Once upon a time, a long time ago, a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed by a terrible curse.
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.
Only true love's kiss could lift her curse.
So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.
But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.
Whoa, there.
I don't know about this, Lillian.
Fairy Godmother said only true love's kiss could break Fiona's curse.
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.
Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.
But to put our daughter's life in the hands of this... person?
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...
Rumpelstiltskin!
Mrs. Highness.
How do you do?
Down, Fifi. Get down!
As you can see, everything's in order.
So you'll put an end to our daughter's curse?
And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me.
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?
Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long.
It's not like she's getting any younger.
But to sign over our entire kingdom?
Well, if your kingdom's worth more to you than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.
Jump, Fifi, jump!
Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!
Who saved her?
No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.
True love's kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!
The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace.
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!
Sir? You're gonna have to pay for that.
Maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?
Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!
I wish that ogre was never born!
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.
Better out than in.
That's my line.
Did my little Fergus make a...
...big, grownup ogre stink?!
Oh, that's diabolical!
And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop...
...and finally, into the castle.
Play date!
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
Happily...
- Ever...
- After.
Look! A shooting star!
So, what did you wish for?
That every day could be like this one.
Come here, you.
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.
Better out than in.
Did my little Fergus make a...
Cute. Real cute.
This lovable lug taught us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
Play date!
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After?
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...
- Play date!
- No!
Outhouse again!
Come on.
Undies!
Outhouse!
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After.
Roar.
Nice landing, baby.
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.
Happy birthday, niños!
Vamos a la fiesta!
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!
Mr. Shrek, would you sign our pitchforks?
And our torches?
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!
A real ogre?
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
Why does being your best friend entail me doing everything I don't want to do?
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?
Could you do that ogre roar of yours for my son?
He's a big, big fan.
Do the roar.
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.
- Do the roar.
- Honey?
Why don't you go check on the cake?
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.
Hold still.
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!
Your cake. Voilà!
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!
I'm in a great mood, actually.
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!
As long as you're not doing anything, how about one of those famous Shrek roars?
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.
An ogre only roars when he's angry.
You don't want to see me angry, do you?
Do it.
Hold it together. Just hold it together.
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.
Oh, good.
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.
- You licked it!
- No.
Just because you're an ogre, doesn't mean you have to eat like one.
Looks like you forgot the candles!
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.
Watch the cake?
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.
- Ya.
- What?
No, don't cry.
Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.
- Do the roar.
- Roar.
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.
No, I ate them.
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.
We need the cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake!
I love you, Daddy.
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.
Is this really how you want to remember the kids' first birthday?
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?
Let's talk about this after the party, at home.
You mean that roadside attraction we live in?
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, OK, maybe you're not the ogre you used to be.
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.
And the other half locked away in a tower.
Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace.
When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it!
Back when the world made sense!
You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?
Exactly!
Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you.
You have everything.
Why is it the only person who can't see that is you?
That's just great.
If she thinks I'm gonna slink back there and apologize, she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize for acting like one.
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!
Please, help!
Please, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
Oh, please, help!
Someone, anyone! Help me!
The pain! I can see a bright light. A tunnel!
Grandma? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Granny.
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre, please don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.
Look, move out or get crushed.
So you're not gonna eat me?
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?
Nowhere.
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.
But, seriously, letme give you a ride. I insist.
Come on. It's the least I can do after all you've done for me.
I got a hot rat cooking.
AII right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?
A liquid libation to ease that frustration?
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.
To live the life of an ogre... no worries, no responsibilities.
You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?
Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.
Why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty!
Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.
Hold on.
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.
You'll be, like, "Roar!"
And the villagers will be, like, "Get away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"
It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle.
- When the world made sense.
- AII right, what's the catch?
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
AII right, I knew it.
So what do you want?
- A day.
- A day.
Rat's done!
To make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something.
In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That's all.
I can't just pick up and leave my family.
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.
No one will even know you're gone.
And by the time this day is up, you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Still, I don't know.
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.
Do you like white meat or dark meat?
So what day would I have to give up?
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?
A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it didn't belong destroying your business and ruining your life?!
Just for an example.
How about the day I met Donkey?
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.
I don't know who that is.
I know. What about a day you wouldn't even remember?
Like a day when you were a baby.
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.
I guess there's nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.
Just 24 tiny little hours.
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!
I never needed to ask for anyone's permission before.
So why start now?
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it!
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!
You signed it.
So, tell me. What happens now?
Have a nice day.
I think I fell on my keys.
There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day.
Oh, great.
As we head over the river and through the woods...
Ogre!
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!
This is the part where you run away!
Sure is great to be wanted again.
Nice one.
Fiona?
Oh, no.
My home.
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you in there?!
AII right, Rumpel!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Rumpel!
Ogre!
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!
Who are you?!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Looks like a troublemaker!
Spread 'em!
Nice job, ladies!
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut your mouth!
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?
Donkey!
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.
I'm driving, so I'm in charge of the music.
Will you witches make up your mind?
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me in trouble and I need this job.
I am not going back to work for OId MacDonald.
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?
Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!
And how do you know my name anyway?
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?
A donkey and an ogre friends?
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!
Can you at least tell me where they're taking me?
To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!
Oh, no.
It's time to crumble!
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!
Yeah!
Gingy?
Gingy snap!
There's one!
Disgusting, filthy ogre!
Hideous monster!
Filthy, filthy creature!
Disgusting creature!
Move it!
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!
Mr. Stiltskin?
You got another customer.
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me my business wig.
Mr. Stiltskin, please!
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!
Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy.
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
Stiltskin!
Shrek!
There he is!
So close!
Have I been waiting for you!
Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?
AII right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.
They would never do that.
They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.
And then they disappeared!
They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter's curse.
I ended Fiona's curse!
How could you when you never existed?
You better start making sense, you dirty little man!
Here, letme spell it out for you!
You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn't even remember.
A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.
You took the day I was born.
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up...
But you haven't heard the best part.
Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.
Where's Fiona?
Where's my family?
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?
You see, you were never born.
You never met Fiona.
Your kids don't exist.
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?
Looks like you got exactly what you wanted!
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!
Get him, witches!
You know what'd help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.
Come on, girls!
Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! Do it!
I'll be right back, Donkey!
I don't know you! I don't know him!
I'm glad I'm not you.
Help me! Help!
Help!
No, not my pretty ball!
Watch out!
Wolfie?
My angry wig.
Help! I've been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!
Donkey! Get off of me!
Watch it with your pointy hooves!
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!
I'm being ass-napped!
Animal cruelty! Help!
You need to calm down!
I'm your friend.
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
Good. I'm gonna letgo...
...right... now.
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!
Donkey! You've got to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...
Because...
OK.
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?
I've never seen an ogre cry.
I'm not crying.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.
Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, or a little baby grandma kitten.
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.
It's none of my business why you're upset.
By the way, why are you upset?
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.
You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?
No. I signed this.
You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!
Yeah, I got that.
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.
Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I've read the fine print.
There's nothing about an exit clause in here.
Well, you didn't expect him to make it easy for you.
Here, letme show you how it's done.
I didn't spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks.
Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn't begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.
What are you doing?
Hey, I can't get my origami on unless you back off.
Thank you. OK, here's what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do. There!
"Try Lou's Bliss."
Who's Lou?
Give me that!
"True Love's Kiss."
You have to take me to dinner first.
"According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love's kiss will render this contract null and void."
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?
Well, that's just it, you see.
I don't know.
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.
So... where did you leave her last?
The last time I saw her,
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!
They keep dragons in there!
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!
I'm gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!
Fiona!
Oh, no.
If I didn't save Fiona...
...then who did?
This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.
Now smell it!
Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling.
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog, not Donkey!
And another thing...
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.
Luscious and tasty.
Hey! That's my wife you're talking about.
Donkey!
Yeah! Waffles!
And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story.
Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!
Donkey! Don't eat that!
There's a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest.
Don't you find that a wee bit suspicious?
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.
You did.
Look out!
Donkey!
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Donkey.
Help! Help me!
Help, Shrek! Help!
Watch your head.
Hey, it's a new guy!
Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.
He's really tiny, isn't he?
Yeah. Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Hey!
- Here you go.
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?
We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!
I didn't know we could do that.
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.
Trust me, you don't want to eat this one.
I go down smooth, but come out fighting!
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.
Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!
- She's back.
- There she is.
Fiona!
I'm so happy I found you!
Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me.
You don't know who I am, do you?
No.
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.
Gather the others and meet me in the war room.
Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
OK, I know you don't remember me, but...
...we're married. Hear me out.
And at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."
Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Right? Who's with me?
I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.
Fiona, I need to...
Witches! AII right, everyone, you know the drill!
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.
Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!
Some people like to look at the goblet as... as half empty.
Me, I like to look at it as half full.
We've gone from the bottom to the top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We're a family.
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?
Good.
Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres.
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Except... funny thing.
Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek!
And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it is the end of the world! Our world!
My empire!
But, as I was saying,
I like to look at the goblet as half full.
Yelling makes me so parched.
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...
...of agua purificada?
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?
Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it's going to take to get this ogre? You.
Faster brooms?
- No!
- Pointier hats?
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?
What a world! What a world!
You know, actually not a bad idea. Baba!
I need a bounty hunter.
And if music doth soothe the savage beast...
...then I think I might know just the person!
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.
Stiltskin is leading tonight's ogre hunt himself.
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?
I bet that's because of us.
If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest...
...he'll be vulnerable.
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route, they'll reach the river by midnight.
We'll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan.
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.
And then we attack!
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?
That's my chimichanga stand.
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, OK?
Go and finish your little speech.
AII right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears,
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten.
Far Far Away will finally be free.
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.
How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?
Actually, I was talking about the revolution.
Revolution?
Why don't you just tell her what you told me?
About how you're her true love and you came from an alternate universe.
Well, while I'm at it, why don't I tell her that you're married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.
I do?!
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
I'm a daddy?
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...
...then I can do it again.
Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?
Donkey...!
Hello?
Fiona?
You should not be here, señor.
Puss?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Feed me, if you dare.
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...
-...fancy.
- Do I know you?
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?
Your wee little boots?
Boots? For a cat? Ha!
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once.
But that is a name I have outgrown.
That's not the only thing you've outgrown.
Hey! I may have letmyself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life.
I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.
I'll get him later.
Puss, what have I done to you?
You've gone soft.
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.
Look, it's not too late to fix it.
AII you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?
Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be...
...rallying the troops, planning attacks, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension.
A gift basket?
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.
Heart-shaped box of slugs.
Skunk-scented candle.
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.
Look, I don't know what this is all about, but I'm trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,
I suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself useful!
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
An apologetic hug?
And a quick kiss goodbye.
Hey!
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?
Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?
I am.
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.
Honk.
AII right, Piggies, be gone!
Don't forget to take her little potty box with you.
This little piggy wants to go home!
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Good.
You call this guy a bounty hunter?
What's he gonna do, flute those ogres a lullaby?
OK, got it!
Make it stop!
AII right, that's enough.
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.
Griselda, seriously, it's time to pay the piper.
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!
Things are getting real sloppy around here!
Here, now make sure they eat up!
You can't end tyranny on an empty stomach! Go on! Go!
Din-din!
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?
AII right, but this is the last time.
Here it comes. Look at him.
I see you!
That's quite a friend you've got there.
I can see why you haven't eaten him.
Donkey! I hate to pull you away from your adoring public, but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.
Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.
That's a good one, Cookie!
Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain't gonna work on her.
Works on me.
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.
- To the cause!
- To the cause!
AII right!
Hello!
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational... op.
This one taken?
We use that to clean the toilets.
And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.
I knew that.
There you go, chief.
Hey... Scott?
My name is Shrek, actually.
You're going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...
Well, let's see about that.
Hey! Hey... Hey!
What the...?
Fiona?
I got it.
Give me your hand.
The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...
Into the castle.
Wow.
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!
AII right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed!
Preparation is half the battle!
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!
Ogre, ogre, un momento!
Just give me a minute.
Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.
I am not believing what I have just witnessed.
Back there, you and Fiona.
There was a spark... a spark inside her heart
I thought was long extinguished.
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!
I am her true love. I ended her curse.
You know of her curse?
By day, one way, by night another.
This shall be the norm.
Until you find true love's first kiss...
...and then take love's true form.
You even know the little rhyme!
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!
- How?
- Convince her!
Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know.
Know about what?!
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?
Excuse me. Coming through!
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.
Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick!
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!
And you are ri-donkey-lous!
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.
Secure your positions!
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!
Get back in position!
You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.
You are going to ruin everything!
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
How do you know about my curse?!
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.
I can explain everything.
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.
Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.
I know everything about you.
I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?
I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.
I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes...
...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.
But, most importantly, Fiona...
...I know that the reason you turn human every day...
...is because you've never been kissed...
...well...
...by me.
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!
No, I can't stop myself!
Please! Make it stop!
I can't control myself!
Yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!
Oh, no! It's the Piper!
I can't believe I letthis happen, and it's all because of you!
- If you'd just letme kiss you!
- What? You're insane!
We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!
Then it's up to me!
Hurry! We must get them away from the music!
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?
Say what?!
No. Hell...
I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.
AII right!
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.
Puss, say something.
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
That's how you knew so much about me.
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?
It's the only way to save your friends.
Get out of my way.
You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss was supposed to fix everything!
Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too.
True love didn't get me out of that tower.
I did. I saved myself.
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!
How would you know?
Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep?
Did you live all alone in a miserable tower?
Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!
But... But I'm your true love.
Then where were you when I needed you?
Maybe you kissed her wrong?
No.
The kiss didn't work...
...because Fiona doesn't love me.
Don't despair, fellow ogres!
They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!
Shrek and Fiona are together?!
Yeah, I've heard enough of your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!
Wolfie! My speech wig.
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.
Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...
...shepherd of your dreams.
Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.
And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!
That is why I come to you, dear citizens.
For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.
Just think of it! Total and
- complete happiness.
- Ya!
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
AII your greatest wishes.
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.
So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Go back where you came from!
It seems that we are safe.
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There's no day after that, and there's no day after that day after that!
My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!
If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?
Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! AII right?
I didn't know what I had.
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!
Gingy?
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?
Collecting my bounty!
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?
Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?
Where all your wishes come true.
Wait a minute.
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
Were you going to eat that?
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
AIso not Shrek.
That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try.
- And that...
- Roar.
...is just sad.
And what is that supposed to be?
I'm just a frightened old man.
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!
That is your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek! Honest!
Take them away!
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!
Stiltskin!
I hear you're looking for me.
AII right! Finally!
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?
- I do.
- What? But...
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.
That means you have to give me anything I want.
No! Only true love's kiss can break your contract!
So if you thought you were just gonna...
-...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.
Then what do you want?
The ogres. They are all free.
But where is Shrek?
This is not good.
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.
The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.
AII that matters is that they're free...
...and Fiona is safe.
I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that.
But, hey...
...I guess you can tell her yourself.
Fiona!
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!
Oh, yeah.
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.
Nobody's smart but me!
That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek.
Thank you.
No, you were right.
I wasn't there for you.
And not just at the Dragon's Keep, but...
...every day since.
Well...
...you're here now.
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!
Don't be a fool, mule!
She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter
- than OId Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.
Hey! We can hear you!
Sorry!
We must get into the palace.
Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!
But how?
The same way we're gonna bust in.
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?
I guess it'll have to do.
Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past behind us once and for all,
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!
Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...
...Dragon!
- Donkey?
- And Puss!
In Boots!
Get them, get them, witches!
Incoming!
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?
Your wife!
Uh-oh.
I'll call you! We're in love!
Fiona, hold on!
Hey, you!
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!
Jump!
Now!
The dragon goes under the bridge!
Through the loop!
And finally...
Into the castle!
Run!
Foo!
So long!
Come on, Fifi, go!
Go! Witches, close up the floor!
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!
Come on, go! FIy away! Up, up! Go!
Fifi, no!
Victory is ours!
Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
You have no idea.
Shrek?
His day is up. His day is...!
Shrek?
It's all right.
There has to be something I can do.
You've already done everything for me, Fiona.
You gave me a home and a family.
You have kids?
We have kids.
Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...
-...Felicia.
- Felicia.
I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.
And someday...
...you will.
You know what the best part of today was?
I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.
Fiona, the sunrise!
You're still... an ogre!
- True love's form.
- Impossible!
The kiss worked.
What?!
Fifi!
Puss!
No, no, no!
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!
I love you, Daddy!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona. I've never been better.
Roar!
Happy Birthday, Farkle.
Fergus, my little man!
And Felicia, sweetheart.
I believe this is yours.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!
Please, señor, letus have it!
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.
You did.
No. It was you that rescued me.
Yummy!
English .srt Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
This is Berk.
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a few degrees south of freezing to death.
It's located solidly on the meridian of misery.
My village. In a word, sturdy.
It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new.
We have fishing, hunting and a charming view of the sunsets.
The only problems are the pests.
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.
We have...
...dragons.
Most people would leave. Not us.
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.
My name is Hiccup.
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls.
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
Morning!
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!
That's Stoick the Vast, chief of the tribe.
When he was a baby, he popped a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.
What have we got?
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.
Good.
Hoist the torches!
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.
They wouldn't know what to do with all this.
They need toothpicks, don't they?
The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber.
I've been his apprentice since I was little. Well, littler.
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.
Hurry! 
See? Old village, lots and lots of new houses.
Fire!
Let's go!
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...
...and...
...Astrid.
Their job is so much cooler.
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.
You've made plenty of marks, all in the wrong places.
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.
You can't even throw one of these!
OK, fine, but this will throw it for me.
See? Now this right here is what I'm talking about!
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!
If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons...
...you need to stop all this.
But you just pointed to all of me.
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.
Oh, yes.
You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.
Keeping this much raw Vikingness contained?
There will be consequences!
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...
...is everything around here.
A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed.
Gronckles are tough.
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.
A Zippleback?
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.
They found the sheep!
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.
- Hurry up!
- Fire!
And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.
Only the best Vikings go after those.
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.
Reload! I'll take care of this.
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!
Get down!
Jump!
This thing never steals food, never shows itself and...
...never misses.
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.
Stay. Put. There.
You know what I mean.
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!
Let's get him!
Mind yourselves!
The devils still have some juice in them!
Come on. Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!
Did anybody see that?
Except for you.
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!
You're all out.
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know.
Sorry, Dad.
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...
Stop!
Just stop.
Every time you step outside, disaster follows.
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding.
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just kill it.
It's who I am, Dad.
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.
I have his mess to clean up.
Quite the performance.
I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped.
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.
When he does, it's with this disappointed scowl, like someone skimped on meat in his sandwich.
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side.
This here, this is a talking fishbone."
You're thinking about this wrong.
It's not so much what you look like, it's what's inside that he can't stand.
Thank you for summing that up.
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.
I just want to be one of you guys.
Either we finish them or they'll finish us!
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!
One more search before the ice sets in.
Those ships never come back.
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me?!
Count me out.
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.
All right. Those who stay will look after Hiccup.
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!
That's more like it.
I'll pack my undies.
No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits.
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades, lots of time to himself.
What could possibly go wrong?
What am I going to do with him, Gobber?
Put him in training.
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.
He'd be killed before the first dragon is out of its cage.
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.
No, you don't.
Listen, you know what he's like.
From the time he could crawl, he's been... different.
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for trolls!
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.
But only the left ones.
What's with that?
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.
...my father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it.
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.
That rock split in two.
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas!
Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become.
Hiccup is not that boy.
You can't stop him, Stoick.
You can only prepare him.
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't always be around to protect him.
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.
Oh, the gods hate me.
Some people lose their knife or their mug. Not me.
I manage to lose an entire dragon.
Oh, wow. I did it.
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!
I have brought down this mighty beast!
I'm going to kill you, dragon.
Then I'll cut out your heart and take it to my father.
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!
I did this.
Hiccup.
Dad...
...I have to talk to you, Dad.
I need to speak with you, too, son.
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.
- What?
- What?
- You go first.
- No, you go first.
All right.
You get your wish. Dragon training... you start in the morning.
Oh, man, I should have gone first.
I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?
You'll need this.
I don't want to fight dragons.
Come on. Yes, you do.
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.
But you will kill dragons.
No, I'm really very extra-sure that I won't.
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?
This is serious, son.
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.
Which means you walk like us, you talk like us...
...you think like us.
No more of... this.
You just gestured to all of me.
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.
Deal?
Deal.
Good.
Train hard.
I'll be back. Probably.
And I'll be here.
Maybe.
Welcome to dragon training!
No turning back.
I hope I get some serious burns.
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or back.
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
Yeah, no kidding, right?
Pain. Love it.
Oh, great. Who let him in?
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?
Don't worry. You're small and weak... that'll make you less of a target.
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.
Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight!
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.
The Hideous Zippleback.
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.
Can you stop that?!
And the Gronckle.
Jaw strength 8.
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?
I believe in learning on the job.
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...
...you're dead!
What's the first thing you'll need?
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield!
If you must choose between a sword or a shield, take the shield!
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!
Take that one. It has a flower... girls like flowers.
Oops, this one has blood on it.
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?
Shields are good for another thing.
Noise! Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim!
All dragons have a limited number of shots.
How many does a Gronckle have?
- Five?
- No, six!
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!
Fishlegs, out!
Hiccup, get in there!
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.
You look like you work out.
Snotlout! You're done!
So it's just you and me, huh?
Nope, just you.
One shot left!
Hiccup!
And that's six.
Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!
You'll get another chance, don't you worry.
Remember, a dragon will always, always go for the kill.
So... why didn't you?
This was stupid.
Why don't you just fly away?
All right, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.
Where did Hiccup go wrong?
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.
He's never where he should be.
Thank you, Astrid.
You need to live and breathe this stuff. The dragon manual.
Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
No attacks tonight. Study up.
Wait, you mean read?
While we're still alive?
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one...
Yeah. That sounds great.
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.
Another one has spines like trees.
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...
...tomorrow.
Dragon classifications.
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous.
Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.
Night Fury.
Speed unknown. Size unknown.
The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
Never engage this dragon.
Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you.
I can almost smell them.
They're close.
Steady.
Take us in.
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.
Hard to port!
Steady!
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies.
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!
Today it's all about attack!
Nadders are quick and light on their feet.
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods!
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.
Find it, hide in it and strike!
Do you ever bathe?
If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.
How about I give you one?
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.
Hey, so, how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
No one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Get in there!
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!
Get down.
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
What do you want me to do, block out the sun?
I could do that but I don't have time!
They probably...
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.
Has anyone ever seen one napping?
Hiccup!
Love on the battlefield.
She could do better.
Let me... Why don't you?
Well done, Astrid.
Is this some kind of a joke to you?
Our parents' war is about to become ours.
Figure out which side you're on.
Toothless.
I could have sworn you had...
...teeth.
No, no, no.
I don't have any more!
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole!
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg.
Isn't it weird to think your hand was inside a dragon?
Like if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from inside by crushing his heart.
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.
It's the wings and the tails you really want.
If it can't fly, it can't get away.
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.
Tomorrow we get to the big boys, slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare.
But who'll win the honor of killing it?
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?
Your mom let you get a tattoo?
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.
OK, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me from the left side.
Hey, Toothless.
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.
OK, that's disgusting.
We've got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod...
...and a whole smoked eel.
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.
Yeah, I don't really like eel much, either.
That's it.
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.
It's OK.
OK.
That's not too bad. It works.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my! It's working!
Yes, yes! I did it!
Yeah!
Today is about teamwork.
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.
One head breathes gas, the other head lights it.
Your job is to know which is which.
Razor-sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion.
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims...
Will you please stop that?!
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...
There!
Hey, it's us, idiots!
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.
Not that there's anything wrong with a dragonesque figure.
Wait.
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Chances of survival are dwindling to single digits now.
Wrong head.
Fishlegs!
Now, Hiccup!
Oh, come on.
Hiccup!
Back, back, back!
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got some things I need to...
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.
Meet the Terrible Terror.
It's like the size of my...
Get it off!
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Wow! He's better than you ever were.
Oh, great.
Hiccup.
Hiccup? Are you in there?
Astrid. Hey.
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.
Well, weirder.
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.
Excellent.
I hope you had more success than me.
Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over, yes.
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!
Out with the old and in with the new, right?
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!
- Come over here.
- Hurry!
He's gone?
Most afternoons, but who can blame him? The life of a celebrity's rough.
He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.
Hiccup?
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.
Here we go. Here we go. Position...
...three... no, four.
All right, it's go time. It's go time.
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!
Yes, it worked!
Sorry!
It was my fault.
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.
Three.
Yeah! Go, baby!
Yes!
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!
Stop!
No!
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!
All right, OK, you've gotta kind of angle yourself.
OK, no, no, no. Come back down towards me! Come back down...
Yeah!
Come on.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?
Here you go.
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...
I know.
- I came looking for you.
- You did?
You've been keeping secrets.
I have?
Just how long did you think you could hide it?
I don't know what you're...
Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
So...
...let's talk...
...about that dragon.
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.
I just didn't know how to...
You're not upset?
What?! I was hoping for this!
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!
Wait till you spill a Nadder's guts the first time!
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.
And all the while you were holding out on me!
Oh, Thor Almighty!
With you doing so well in the ring...
...we finally have something to talk about.
Here, I brought you something, to keep you safe in the ring.
Wow. Thanks.
Your mother would have wanted you to have it. It's half of her breastplate.
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.
Thanks for stopping by...
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.
Well... Yep. Good night.
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.
Please, by all means.
This time, this time for sure!
No! No, son of a half-troll,
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.
- So, later.
- Not so fast.
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!
Late for what, exactly?
Quiet down! The elder has decided.
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!
That's my boy!
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...
...leaving! We're leaving.
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.
Forever.
Oh, man.
What the?!
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on.
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?
Training?
It better not involve this.
I know this looks really bad, but you see...
You're right. You're right.
You're right.
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.
Why would you do that?!
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.
Oh, man.
Get down!
Run, run!
It's OK! It's OK.
She's a friend.
You just scared him.
I scared him?!
Who is "him"?
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.
We're dead.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!
Hiccup, get me down from here!
You have to give me a chance to explain.
I am not listening to anything you have to say!
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.
Please, Astrid.
Now get me down.
Toothless, down. Gently.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.
Toothless!
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!
And now the spinning.
Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile.
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.
Just get me off of this thing.
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.
It's amazing.
He's amazing.
So what now?
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.
You know you'll have to kill...
...kill a dragon.
Don't remind me.
Toothless, what's happening?
What is it?
Get down!
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.
What does that make us?
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.
It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
They're not eating any of it.
What is that?
All right, bud, we got to get out of here... now!
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.
They're the workers and that's their queen.
It controls them. Let's find your dad.
No! No.
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.
We have to think this through carefully.
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest, the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here, and you want to keep it a secret?
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?
Yes.
OK. Then what do we do?
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.
OK.
That's for kidnapping me.
That's for everything else.
What are you looking at?
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I can show my face in public again!
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks
Hiccup would go from, well, being Hiccup to placing first in dragon training, well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad!
And you know it!
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised or more proud than I am.
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.
Today, he becomes one of us!
Be careful with that dragon.
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?
Put an end to this. I have to try.
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.
I will. Just promise me it won't go wrong.
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I would have gone for the hammer.
I'm ready.
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!
What is he doing?
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
I'm not one of them.
What's he thinking?
- Stop the fight.
- No!
I need you all to see this.
They're not what we think they are.
We don't have to kill them.
I said, stop the fight!
Out of my way!
Hiccup!
This way!
Night Fury!
Toothless, go. Get out of here.
Go, go!
Stoick, no!
Dad, he won't hurt you!
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!
Toothless, stop!
No! No!
Get him!
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him.
Put it with the others.
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.
- Dad?
- We had a deal!
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.
So everything in the ring, a trick? A lie?
I screwed up. I should have told you before now. I just...
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?
Not the people you almost killed?
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.
They've killed hundreds of us!
And we've killed thousands of them!
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.
There's something else on their island. It's a dragon like...
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.
Only a dragon can find the island.
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.
Dad, please. I promise you, you can't win this one!
No, Dad. No.
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me?!
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.
You're not my son.
Ready the ships!
This way.
Set sail!
We head for Helheim's Gate.
Lead us home, devil.
It's a mess.
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:
Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
Thank you for summing that up.
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods?
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.
So why didn't you?
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
Because I want to remember what you say right now.
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
You said "wouldn't".
Whatever! I wouldn't!
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.
First one to ride one, though.
So?
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.
I looked at him and I saw myself.
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.
Then something crazy.
That's more like it.
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.
- Here!
- One length to your stern.
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here. Not me, of course.
I know you're always the man with the plan. But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.
Of course. Send them running.
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.
Step aside.
Bear to port.
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.
It's me.
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...
You're crazy. I like that.
So, what is the plan?
That's not really encouraging.
I was wondering where that went.
Stay low and ready your weapons.
We're here.
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.
It's OK. It's OK.
Where are you going?
You'll need something to help you hold on.
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose.
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.
No matter how this ends, it ends today.
Is that it?
We've done it!
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!
Get clear!
Beard of Thor! What is that?!
Odin help us.
Catapults!
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.
Lead the men to the far side of the island!
Gobber, go with the men!
I think I'll stay, in case your thinking of doing something crazy.
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt!
Then I can double that time.
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!
Come on! Fight me!
No, me!
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!
Move, Fishlegs!
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!
Up! Let's move it!
Every bit the boar-headed stubborn Viking you ever were!
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing!
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot, make noise, keep it confused!
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!
That's my specialty!
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!
- Troll!
- Butt elf!
Bride of Grendel!
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!
There!
Go help the others!
OK, hold on. Hold on.
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!
I'm OK!
Less OK!
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?
Yeah! You're the Viking!
Dad?
You got it, bud.
Hiccup!
I'm sorry... for everything.
Yeah. Me, too.
You don't have to go up there.
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Thanks, Dad.
He's up!
Get Snotlout out of there.
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.
No, this way.
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!
I can't believe that worked!
Night Fury!
Get down!
Did you get her?
Go.
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!
You think that did it?
Well, he can fly.
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.
Come on, bud!
Here it comes!
Watch out!
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.
Hold, Toothless.
Now!
No.
No!
Hiccup!
Son!
Hiccup.
Oh, son.
I did this.
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.
Hiccup!
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.
Thank you for saving my son.
Well, you know... most of him.
Hey, Toothless.
I'm happy to see you, too.
I'm in my house.
You're in my house.
Does my dad know you're here?
What? OK, OK.
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.
Toothless! Oh, come on.
OK. Thanks, bud.
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!
Hold on tight! Here we go!
What?
I knew it. I'm dead.
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!
It's Hiccup!
Turns out all we needed was a little more of this.
You just gestured to all of me.
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?
I might make a few tweaks.
That's for scaring me.
What is it always going to be this way? 'Cause...
...I could get used to it.
Welcome home.
- Night Fury!
- Get down!
You ready?
This is Berk.
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.
The people that grow here are even more so.
The only upsides are the pets.
While other places have ponies or parrots...
...we have...
...dragons.
On "The vampire diaries"...
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
- The Sun and the Moon curse?
- Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
- is coming after me?
- Elijah.
- He´s one of the Originals...
- a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall draw
Klaus out together and I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
- And then what?
- Then I kill him.
I come bearing gifts... this is how you kill an Original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and a little white out cash?
If you kill Elijah, then
I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
- then he stays dead.
- Pretty much.
How did you get out?
I knew that I had begged you
not to kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as Originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you?
About your daughter...
You know where Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
No!
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.
Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
- Hey!
- School?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes.
- Only for 5 minutes.
Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here?
I told you to leave.
What is your problem?
You're wearing her clothes?
Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine?
Why would you think that?
Katherine's in a tomb!
Isn't she?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?
What are you doing?!
How could you do this?!
Stefan, you're hurting me!
Stop it, Katherine!
Stop what?
It's getting really easy being you.
- What is she doing here?
- When we killed Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
- How's that possible?
- He's an Original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
- You all do.
- Like hell.
We all want the same thing... Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are, running around like chickens
- with their heads cut off.
- I don't need your help and I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
You know where Klaus is?
When he's coming, what he looks like?
If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill and have some lunch... maybe
Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
Live band?
Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all?
Have you heard from Tyler?
Not a peep. You?
No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you?
- What did he say?
- Not much, really.
I mean... I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know.
And that's all he said?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
Yeah! I...
I mean, no, I... it's just not that easy.
I don't get it!
Since when have I been the one that can express himself and you're one with a loss for words?
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision or leave me alone.
Why is she still here?
She was free.
She wants what we want...
Klaus's death.
Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
- I want her gone.
- So do I.
But you're right, she's staying.
Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus. She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
Hmm, I can't.
I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and
Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Mmm, burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger back, you're wasting your time.
He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about Original vampires?
Spend 500 years running from one.
So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?
Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.
Did you know I would die?
Did Elijah tell you his plan?
Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with?
Why are you still here?
Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't be honest about helping,
I'd be long gone by now, ok?
You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know...
I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
She's out of the tomb?
Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right?
Just be extra careful.
She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena.
With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side.
I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture.
It's impossible.
They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
I'll try.
Thanks. Keep me posted.
Ok. I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see ya.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon.
I promise.
All right.
It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel and now Jenna knows
I'm lying about something.
John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So.
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?
I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?
You think we should tell her the truth?
I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair to her, and it's not the kind of relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus.
You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know?
How does someone hear that?
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
But I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her.
But until then,
Jenna and I are done.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
We can help you.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
I'm sorry about the way
I had to get that information, but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
How?
I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
I'll just help you carry it out.
You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do.
- What you up to?
- None of your business.
We're pouting now?
Are those the Gilbert journals?
How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
No.
- Then you can't help.
- Ugh.
If it's any consolation,
I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy making the place of their death with power.
I think Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
What was he going to do when he found it?
I don't know.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
Wasn't she gone or dead? Yeah?
For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...
They wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
We just need to find it.
But what if they can find the burial ground?
They won't. We tried,
Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
- You're going to kill them?
- No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
Chinese food or pizza?
Like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation?
What about "The Notebook"?
Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
That is so not the point.
Well, yeah, I mean...
Hey.
What's going on?
Girls' night.
Oh.
How are you doing?
You heard about my fight with Ric.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
No. No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or...
Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
You, too?
You have no idea.
Ok, then.
It's this whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
You know what we need?
Dancing. There is a band at the grill.
- I'm in.
- In.
In.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, I would go if I could.
No. I'm not strong enough to send you.
I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
- If you feel weak...
- Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see?
Elena and Damon.
They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you?
I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today.
"They kidnapped her from her home
"and took her to the same location
"her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago."
So Emily died on the site of the massacre, too.
Does it say where?
Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
Mm-hmm.
I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of those.
Find anything?
Nope.
That's too bad.
Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
What's wrong?
She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce.
Luka... kill her.
- What?
- She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon!
Katherine!
What happened?
Damon...
Luka, what's going on?
Luka! Luka!
What are you doing?!
Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack!
Get over there and do something about it.
Now!
No!
Oh, my God! Luka!
Luka! I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka!
I love my boy!
I need a drink.
Hey, Matt.
Things just got real awkward.
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila.
Yeah.
Well, señor tequila's not going to be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me.
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Because whatever it is you're keeping from me;
Whatever you think I can't handle...
You're wrong.
'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent, so I think
I can handle anything, Ric.
Jenna...
He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing?
What is she doing?
Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band!
Weren't they awesome?
This isn't going to end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Like it's so easy.
Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about.
Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
Yeah! Yeah.
You know what, I'm going to sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up.

Matt, I...
- You killed him!
- Aah!
He's dead and I have no one.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell?!
That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time...
It goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who... ahh...
- is trying to help you?
- You wanna help?
Start talking.
I'd love to, but you're not going to like it.
Try me.
Fine. John Gilbert and
Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life.
That's old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb, so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie?
Ahh! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
You know, I really have to get back to work.
Definitely.
I... I wouldn't.
Caroline and Matt are...
In the bathroom?!
If they're happy,
- I'm happy.
- Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
You're into my brother?
I know it's weird, um, but he's been so good and strong. It makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking...
Right now.
I'm thinking that...
My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and...
He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really?
Really.
Oh.
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the grill.
I can't hear you.
Hold... yeah.
Where are you going?
Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.
I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Wait.
I don't need your help.
I don't want it.
I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr. Martin. You ok?
Where is she?
I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena.
No. No, Dr. Martin.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
What the hell?
Mmm!
- The power's out.
- Even better.
I wish, but I should probably... whoa.
Hey!
- We have a problem.
- What's going on?
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
Oh, my God!
We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
Well, what can I do?
- It's time to get out of here.
- I have to find Elena.
She's with Stefan, she's ok.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie.
Come on. Come on.
Dr. Martin!
I'm so sorry about Luka.
I never wanted that to happen, but... at least let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline!
Get away from her!
Matt, no!
Matt!
Matt! No!
Matt! Matt!
Oh! Oh, my God!
Ok. Uh...
Just breath Caroline... just breath.
You have to drink.
Please, please.
Luka...
I can't believe he's dead.
After what we did to him.
No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this, but I don't.
I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.
- What's going on?
- He'll explain.
When did you guys get home?
- A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house?
And why would we check the house?
You're welcome.
You didn't have to kill him!
Yes, we did.
Get off!
How did you guys convince her to do this?
We didn't.
It was actually her idea.
Wow. That's...
Not good.
No. No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry clean.
You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me?
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead, but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kinda need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be ok?
Look,
Isobel is dead.
And there things about her death that I can't tell you;
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
Hey.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and...I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
Not that denial's the worst thing.
Did you...
When he grabbed me...
He gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how?
Yeah.
He did.
You know what I can't figure out?
What's that?
How the town knew
Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mmm, I should have figured as much.
Oh, she was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.
You know what I can't figure out?
Do I care?
Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew that Emily Bennett was the key to getting me out of that tomb.
And something tells me that you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe, yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now?
- You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
I like this Damon.
Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
Hi.
What the hell?
I had your face...
And all the blood.
I... I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me?
How can your blood heal me?
Because that's what vampire blood does for humans, and that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
No.
But it's all going to be ok, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine.
We'll be fine?!
Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my God.
Vickie, oh, my God, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.
What?
Vickie, she knew about the vampires, and I...
What... what did you do?
Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
I need to get out of here.
No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
What did you do to my sister?
Nothing! Nothing! I swear,
I swear, nothing, nothing!
- What did you do?!
- Nothing, Matt!!
You have to calm down! Matt!
Are John and Jeremy asleep?
I think so.
If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that?
Hi. You must be Jenna.
I'm...
Elena's mother.
Isobel.

GWEN:
Dear Santa, are you real?
If you live at the North Pole, how come I can't see your house when I look on Google Earth?
Are you Saint Nicholas?
Because you'd be incredibly old.
How do you have time to read all the letters from all the children in the world?
And how many cookies and mince pies have you eaten in all of history?
How do you get all the presents in the sack?
Does your sack have to get bigger every year because of exponential population growth?
And how do you get down the chimneys?
I put my head in ours and it's really small.
Even if you could squeeze down it in one minute, there's nine houses in my road so that's nearly 10 minutes.
And there are millions of roads in the world.
It must be so hard being Santa these days.
I mean, what if after all of that,
I'm staying at Grandma's?
Santa, how can you get round the whole world in just one night?
My friend said that you'd have to go so fast, it would make you and the sleigh and the reindeer all burn up.
I think you are real.
But how do you do it?
For Christmas I would love a pink Twinkle Bike with stabilizers.
But please don't bring it if it makes you and the reindeer burn.
Love, Gwen Hines. 23 Mimosa Avenue,

ARTHUR:
Dear Gwen, thank you for your letter and, heh, brilliant picture.
Your request for a pink Twinkle Bike will be passed on to Santa.

And he can get around the world to every child without a single reindeer being roasted ali...

I can't eat that. It gets in me teeth.
Oh, dear.
Now I've got to visit the elf hospital, look over a treaty with Greenland and make the gravy.
Then we'll finally have the whole family home for Christmas.
They're nearly done!
COMPUTER:
Battery clear.
Oh, no.
It's the detachable milk maid!
She's got her own power source!
NORAH: Five seconds till she starts singing!
Four!
Three!

Use your HOHO. Exit code 12. Code 12!

Okay, go, go, go!
Revise drop time to 14.13 seconds.
Let's pick this up, people!
COMPUTER:
Drop time revised. Picking this up, people.
ELF 1:
Everybody, mission re-engage.
ALL:
Three, two, one!
COMPUTER:
Mission accomplished.
Hey!
Oh, what a night that was.
That detachable milk maid thing.
This is just the beginning, right, sir?
I got you a present, sir.
Not S for Steve, sir.
S for Santa.
Oh, I don't know about that, Peter.
Okay, let's bring them home.
FERGUS:
CCTV in every room!
Had to go under the floor!
ELF 1:
Sarah.
CARLOS:
Back! Holly injury coming through!
NORAH:
Hey, fancy a trip on the S-1, Arthur?
It only goes 150,000 miles an hour.
No, no. Thanks.
I see a bit of the world in my office, you know.
Some of the stamps I get are amazing.
BRYONY:
Excuse me.
ALL:
Santa!
ARTHUR:
Dad!
Dad! Dad!
I'm sorry. So sorry. Dad!
Dad!
Santa's waving!
ELF 2: He's waving at me!
DEBORAH: He's waving at me!
ELF 3: At me!
Dad! Ha, ha!
Arthur.
Happy Christmas.
You too.
You were fantastic!
Look! Christmas slippers.
Ha! Well done. Yes.
STEVE:
Father?
Ah, there he is. Steve!
Mission accomplished!
Tonight we delivered
2 billion presents.
On this, my 70th mission!
ELF 5:
We'll miss you, Santa!
Stand by.
Psst!
Oh, thank you.
You know, I sometimes think
I couldn't do it without you.
And my splendid
Margaret, who's stood by me all these years very ably doing all that, uh... stuff that women do when their husbands work. Marvelous.
And, uh, Arthur, yes, doing vital work in Maintenance, really vital.
I, um... I work in Letters.
Letters, of course. I'm so sorry.
ARTHUR: You moved me after I tripped over that plug and melted down the elf barracks.
DAVID:
I lost everything in that flood!
SANTA:
Yes. Now, many years ago, my father told me that being Santa is the best job in the world.
He was right.
I've loved it.
I can't wait for year 71!
Merry Christmas, everyone.
ELVES (CHANTING): He's red, he's white!
He's worked all through the night!
Santa!
"What do you get if you eat Christmas decorations?
Tinselitis!"
Isn't this the best bit of Christmas?
It certainly is, Arthur.
The whole family together.
How about a toast, Malcolm?
Oh! Um...
Well, uh, here's to me doing an even better job next year.
MRS. SANTA: Next year.
ARTHUR: But you're already perfect, Dad.
Ha! That turkey did more than him.
Ha, ha! Aah!
SANTA:
You wouldn't understand, Father.
I've rather moved things on since your day. Eh, Steve?
Forget Techno Tommy. He's texting on his calculator after another job.
It's a Handheld
Operational and Homing Organizer.
The HOHO 3000.
I'm enacting mission closure.
Whoopee-doo.
Aren't you the fancy nancy?
Don't matter what you come up with.
You may be next in line, but you'll never get to be Santa unless you knock him off.
ARTHUR:
Um...
I've got you all a present.
After all the hard work, I wanted everyone to have some Christmas fun.
Ta-da!
GRANDSANTA: I'm Santa!
STEVE: No, no, I'm Santa. It's ridiculous.
You just took the piece out of my hand.
Well, I am actually Santa so I think I should have it.
Yes. You're the nonexecutive figurehead.
SANTA: Exactly.
Figurehead.
GRANDSANTA: It means a fatty with a beard who fits the suit.
The other pieces are good too.
Or I can make extra Santas for everyone.
Why don't you be the candle, Steve?
All those bright ideas, eh?
Fine. I'm the candle,
Arthur's the turkey and you, Father, are, of course, Santa.
Grandsanta, you can be this charming relic.
"Relic"? "Relic"?
I did the whole of Christmas in one of these, Arthur.
Oh, yes. I didn't need a trillion elves in bleepy hats.
We don't fly about throwing lead-painted toys down chimneys anymore.
That space sends you back to Lapland.
Malcolm, where did you get those?
Just moving things along.
Do I win?
Cheats, the pair of you!
ARTHUR:
Mum, are you okay?
Polar bear, dear. Attacked me on the ice.
Good I did that online survival course or there'd be one less for turkey.
GRANDSANTA: Christmas has gone right down the rodney hole.
You're a postman with a spaceship.
My S-1 festivized the world at 1860 times the speed of sound.
Christmas 1941, World War II, did the whole thing with six reindeer and a drunken elf!
I was shot at, Arthur.
Took 12 direct hits.
Lost three reindeer.
ARTHUR:
What happened to the elf?
Fell out of the sleigh over Lake Geneva.
Never saw him again.
Goodness. Now...
"Christmas crackers.
Sing 'Silent Night' backwards."
Who'd know that?
I went on alone.
I could still do it now, Arthur.
Just give me a go!
In a heap of sticks.
"Heap of... "?
Let me up and at him!
I'll show you, Robby the Robot!
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
I'll have that back.
GRANDSANTA: Would've won anyway.
What?
Oh, yeah. Run away now you're losing!
ARTHUR:
Steve!
Whoa! Unh!
Steve.
Don't be upset. Look.
You keep this.
Then you can be Santa next time.
That'll be you there, Steve.
Next year,
I bet.
You'll be great.
How many times, Arthur?
It's the North Pole. Shut the doors.
BRYONY:
I secured the gift.
Gift secured!
Just can't be.
The system is foolproof.
It has to be an error, sir.
"Error"?
I spotted the ribbon glinting in the shadows.
I am actually trained in wrapping.
And I said to myself, "Bryony, the wrapping looks okay. Thank goodness.
But that present should not be lying in the..."
Thank you, soldier.
ARTHUR: Has someone got the wrong present?
That's awful.
Whose is it?
No one gets the wrong present. 47785
BXK.
"Gift undelivered"?
They got nothing?
Mm-mm?
ARTHUR: A child's been missed!
Not necessarily.
A child's been missed!
Wanna wake up the North Pole?
Good idea. A child's been missed!
STEVE: Arthur!
Everything all right?
There's been a glitch.
"A glitch"? We've missed a child!
Really? Dear, oh, dear.
That's awful.
How did you let it happen,
Steven?
How did I...?
I thought it was your mission.
No. This is your department.
What'll we do?
We must, um... We must, uh...
What must we do, Steven?
STEVE: There's nothing to do.
The mission was a success.
We can't leave a child out of Christmas.
Sunrise at destination is 7:39 a.m. There's no way to get there in time.
Except, of course, for the S-1.
The S-1 . Right-o.
STEVE: No! The S-1 has just traveled 7 million miles.
We could damage it.
Oh, dear. Um...
And risk the lives of the elves.
SANTA: Oh, my. No.
I'll go, sir!
Bryony Shelfley,
Wrapping Division. Grade 3, sir.
Who asked you?
I wasn't called up for field duty.
I served out my mission in Gift Wrap Support.
I wrapped 264,000 presents in three days, sir.
If you want that bike delivered in a perfect state of enwrapment, then I'm your elf.
STEVE:
No one is going.
It's impossible.
But this child...
PETER: It's a margin of error of 0.00000001514834 percent,
I mean, hello?
Where's the champagne?
My department has delivered the most outstanding Christmas ever.
Oh, uh... Ha, ha.
Well done, us.
But there's a child without a present.
Arthur, Christmas is not a time for emotion.
We will get 47785BXK a present within the window of Christmas.
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in five days.
But that'll ruin the magic.
If there was any way at all to make the drop tonight.
But it can't be done.
SANTA:
Your brother knows about these things.
I won't sleep easy after this,
Arthur, but there it is.
Can't be done.
Merry Christmas.
Arthur! You're compromising the wrapping! That is not a toy! Well, it is, but, I mean, that's not...
Arthur!
ARTHUR:
Um... Oh, come on, come on, come on. Child 47785BXK, where are you?
"Dear Santa, my friend doesn't believe in you.
For Christmas I'd like a pink Twinkle Bike.
Gwen Hines.
23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England."
COMPUTER:
Lights out.
This figurehead thingy:
I'm not just a fatty with a suit, am I?
Of course not, dear.
No. I'm Santa.
Children rely on me.
Oh. Ugh. Ha, ha.
Here.
Thank you. It's just checks for the boys and cash for Father.
Oh, Malcolm.
It's the 2 billion other gifts, dear.
Christmas has become such a mad rush.
Until you retire.
Retire?
Sit next to Father, watching Steve on TV?
MAN (ON HOHO): You are sitting on a level one access HOHO.
Please state your identity.
State your identity.
Who would I be?
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.
And there's Arthur.
Dear Arthur.
What a puzzle.
This one's for me, dear.
Oh!
Happy Christmas, Margaret.
Oh, thank you.
I'm still very much up to the job, you know. Ho, ho...
Good night, dear.
Good night, Malcolm.
It just can't be. It can't.
It just can't be. It can't.
It just can't be! Oh!
GRANDSANTA:
What's all this ka doodle, young man?
Grandsanta.
This little girl.
She's been missed!
Ha! So much for your brother's fancy-pants technology.
Steve and Dad racked their brains but said it's impossible.
Is it, now?
Missed a child. Dear, oh dear, sends shivers down me shins.
In two hours, she's gonna wake up tear downstairs, search under the tree and the look on her face.
But there's nothing there.
She won't understand. She'll think she's the one kid in the world that Santa doesn't care about.
She'll feel so... left out.
On Christmas night, he comes.
Gwen can't not have a present from Santa.
Do you know, Arthur, there is a way.
It's impossible.
They used to say it was impossible to teach women to read.
Follow me.
It's... It's the actual sleigh.
Hello, Evie.
I thought it was scrapped years ago.
So did everyone else.
Can I...?
Icelandic birch. Arctic balsa.
Built in 1845.
Able to reach 50,000 miles per hour at a height of 40,000 feet.
GRANDSANTA:
Over here, you string of tinsel.
Got it.
"Potash of carboniloroxy amilocitrate."
Magic dust.
Mined from the aurora borealis.
But she doesn't still go?
Ha.
Not just a hobby, Arthur.
Great-great-grandchildren of the original eight.
Dasher.
Wow. Heh.
Dancer.
Prancer.
Uh... What are the others called? I could never ruddy remember. Bambi? John.
You there, with the white ear. And you.
And... Not you, you bag of fleas.
Uh... Uh...
Arthur?
I'm not really good with big animals.
Piffle!
Heh-heh-heh.
Don't get bit, mind.
They can smell fear.
Let's hitch them up.
Oh, Grandsanta.
Uh, uh... Excuse me.
Unh!
You can go to Gwen!
On the old sleigh, with the reindeer and the magic dust and everything!
It's a miracle.
You're coming too, lad.
Me?
On that? Up there? Pulled by them?
No. No way.
I'm 136. I can't do it on me own,
I need an elf.
I can't fly a sleigh. I can't even ride a bike without stabilizers.
I know, let's wake Steve. He'll...
No.
He's a worrier, Arthur. What if he stops us? Gwen's forgotten.
You really care.
Well, of course
I do. I was Santa too.
Think of your dad lying awake, chewing his beard off with worry over this girl.
Don't you want to help for once?
Make him proud?
I can't.
I just... I can't.
No, I can't.
Ready?!
ARTHUR: No! You promise
Ha, ha!
Not to go too fast?
Whoo-hoo!
ARTHUR:
Or high. Or bumpy.
I get travel sick.
I'm allergic to snow.
Ye baubles.
And you a son of Santa?
Wait! My slippers!
They're not for outdoor use!
GRANDSANTA:
Dash! Dash!
Dash!
See?
Who's Santa now? Ho, ho, ho!
Whoo-hoo!
ARTHUR:
Aah! Put me down!
What's the matter, boy?
I'm having a heart attack.
They've never flown before.
Just gotta break them in.
Now.
Come away!
Dash away!
Look, Arthur.
All those stars.
We're one of them now.
A shooting star!
Whoa!
Stuck that there for your dad when he was a boy.
Dad? What, he sat here?
So did I.
Every young heir to the Pole gets took out by his father.
Right back to Saint Nick.
We Clauses used to be the only men in the world who could fly,
Arthur, and see all this.
It was a gift, a great big ball wrapped in oceans and mountains.
I remember the look on your father's face when he saw it.
Yah!
Fish!
With horns!
Want to help me make a snowman?
Yah!
No! Not ye...!
Aah! Aah!
Oh, where's the seat belt?
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Could Dad do that? Did he make a snowman for Steve?
Robot Roy?
Ha! I should cocoa.
The next Santa, and he's never even sat in a sleigh.
Oi!
Is that...?
The map of the Clauses.
Used every Christmas night in history.
Whatever your brother says,
Arthur, it's the same old world.
ARTHUR:
What is it?!
No idea. I've never seen it before.
ARTHUR: It's a city!
A new one?
Ruddy cheek.
They're always putting these things up.
I remember the first time
I ran into Chicago.
Ha, ha.
Chicago wasn't on the map?
GRANDSANTA:
Whoa!
Now, where are we?
Ah. Here we are, see?
Oh, no, that's Peking.
Ahead, there's a...!
GRANDSANTA:
Whoa!
ARTHUR:
They can see us.
Well, pull the camouflage lever.
Now, then, we'd better draw in a few sky scratchers. Just, uh...
Not that one.
That's a steam train, you ninny.
ARTHUR:
Do this one.
GRANDSANTA: So, what do they call this place?
"Toronto."
Toronto's in Canada.
The Santas always come through Canada.
Nobody lives here.
It's nice and quiet.
Till your brother came with his "You can't cut through Saigon, there's a war" rubbish.
Don't need him to tell me what's ahead.
I got eyes.
Grandsanta!
Ye baubles, an elf.
Bryony Shelfley. Oh!
There's a small trauma to your giftwrap, but I can fix it.
A stowaway!
I can wrap anything, sir, with three bits of sticky tape.
Three!
Good. Wrap yourself a parachute.
Aah!
Grandsanta!
BRYONY: Aah!
GRANDSANTA: Whoops.
Toronto. Present and correct.
Not quite, sir. You've lost one of the reindeer.
Quantitative...
Hello?
What elf?
PETER: Bryony Shelfley, sir.
The crazy wrapping elf, you know?
Security tracked her to Sector 19.
And we think Arthur was here.
Arthur?
Who else leaves the door open, huh, sir?
The old sleigh barn?
That was sealed up decades ago after that terrible night
Grandsanta sneaked out and...
Thank goodness he's too old these days to get into trouble.
Bash it with a brick, Arthur. Go on.
ARTHUR:
It just won't...
Grab its antlers and tug.
I may just be a wrapping operative, sir, but this contravenes.
MAN (ON HOHO): Seventeen.
Specific mission regulations.
I'm in charge here, not Billy the Bureaucrat.
ARTHUR:
It's stuck.
GRANDSANTA:
Shh!
Eighteen.
Elf, wrap your head.
Sir!
Come on, lad. You're as much use as a cheese chopstick.
Got it!
Oh, no.
(BRYONY MUMBLING
INDISTINCTLY)
Oh, my big Aunt Betty.
It'll have to do. Pass it down.
What?
Permission to breathe, sir. I have about nine seconds left before I black out.
One breath.
BRYONY:
Sir?
I said one. Hurry up, Arthur.
But don't we need a whole one?
You know, to balance the sleigh?
Oh, it won't balance the sleigh. No, no.
If anything, it'll slow us down.
(BRYONY MUMBLING
INDISTINCTLY)
So why are we taking it?
It's for Gwen. Eight beautiful reindeer.
That's what she's dreaming of.
The jingly bells, the sleigh on the roof.
Yeah, but...
That's what the kids want, not some spaceship.
We're giving her the star treatment.
What now?
We have a waker, sir.
With a gun!
GRANDSANTA:
That's it, lad.
You distract him!
ARTHUR: Grandsanta!
MAN: Who's there?
ARTHUR:
Uh... Uh... Uh...
We come in peace.
Our craft has to travel around the world in less than an hour!
We need a sign for our slei...
Craft.
Sorry I can't pay you. Where I come from, we don't have money!
GRANDSANTA:
Christmas 1923, had a heart attack at the reins.
Left ventricle popped out me mouth.
Pushed it back down and carried on!
(GRANDSANTA &
ARTHUR CHUCKLE)
It's big, isn't it, the Atlantic?
Think we should stop and ask someone?
Pishywibble, we're nearly there!
See, I take the North Star there as a fixed point.
Then I plot my bearings from, um...
That's a plane, sir.
Insubordination.
I'll have you harpooned, elf.
ARTHUR: I thought it would be chillier near England.
GRANDSANTA:
Globular warming.
Ha! Land ahoy! There it is.
Told you!
ARTHUR:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
GRANDSANTA: There you are. Down.
ARTHUR: Watch that rock!
GRANDSANTA:
There you go.
Ah.
ARTHUR:
Wow.
England.
Maybe we pulled to the right a bit.
We're a reindeer short.
France.
They have elephants in France?
The odd stray. They breed in the drains. This way.
(GRANDSANTA SPEAKING
IN SPANISH)
Paris Zoo.
BRYONY:
Then this is where they keep the lions!
GRANDSANTA:
They won't eat me.
I'm Santa!
Lie down!
Oh, right.
Call the keeper!
ARTHUR:
How old is this?
"Atlantis"?
"Here be cannibals"?
Watch out for cannibals.
This isn't France, is it?
Technically, it's known as Africa.
Aah!
Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.
How can you possibly be sure?
The GPS on my HOHO.
Take her!
Take the elf!
GPS? Why didn't you say?
I'm a wrapping elf. I don't navigate,
I wrap. I use it to store pictures of bows.
She's right. You brought us to Africa!
I've seen it on a stamp.
I'm too young to die, Arthur.
Do something. Arthur!
STEVE: The old sleigh.
What is happening here?
Was supposed to be chopped up for firewood decades ago.
How did that devious...?
Old people, sir.
Shall I get you your stress ball?
We have finer comms than the Pentagon, and you say we can't contact him except by some ancient...
ERNIE:
Toodle-loo!
Here comes the cavalry!
Ernie Clicker, sir.
Head of Polar Communications for 46 missions!
Oh, crikey blikey, me and your granddad saw some times!
I remember once...
Wow, must catch up soon. Now...
Oh, you're in a hurry. I can tell.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Could we hurry this?
Ooh... You can't rush the Signalator.
Got to play her gentle.
So, what do you wish to say?
I wouldn't worry. It's not like they're facing man-eating lions.

Something's coming through.
What does it say?
GRANDSANTA:
Get off! No!
That's me Evie, you mangy moron!
ARTHUR:
No!
That's Gwen's gift!
Hi-yah!
Only children get to tear the wrapping.
Bryony?
Automatic tape guns!
GRANDSANTA: Down, doggy!
Bad doggy!
Laser-guided scissors!
Oh, no, no!
Standard-issue giftwrap!
No time for a bow!
There's always time for a bow!

Oh!

I can't look.
Not that knob!
Good night!
Oh, no!

Something else!
No, leave it! Don't...
Aah.
My camera!

Wait! Look!
Oi!
BRYONY:
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Wow.
Whoa!
GRANDSANTA:
What's so funny?
Look what they've done to my Evie.
And the map.
But it's okay.
We've got this. Look!
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.
MAN (ON HOHO):
Proceed to the highlighted route.
What's the point? Look at us.
And my camera, totally banjaxed.
How do I get my picture now?
What picture?
The sleigh on the roof, the eight beautiful reindeer and Santa... Me!
...going down the "chimbley."
That's what I wanted them to see.
They missed the kid, but I got there.
My way.
That's why you came. Not for Gwen.
1368 miles, then slight left.
For the love of Lulu, bossed about by Tinpot Tom.
Dash!
Try them again.
Keep trying.
All this for one child.
In 600 million.
We should turn her off a mo.
Don't worry, sir. Children are stupid. Either it won't know it got missed or it'll think it's been bad.
It's a win-win.
You missed one?
A nipper? Cor!
Ha, ha. What's all this here for if you miss one?
Could you please type faster?
All right.
COMPUTER:
Systems critical.

ERNIE:
Oops-a-daisy.
STEVE:
Peter, let go of my hand, please.
PETER:
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
And get me IT.
MAN (ON HOHO):
Descend 1000 feet.
You are at your destination.
ARTHUR: Yes!
We did it, we did it!
We did it! Hooray!
Whoopee-doo.
In 100 yards, turn left.
Straight ahead, left, right.
You are at your client's dwelling.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, steady!
We made it. I survived!
I'll walk home, I'll get a boat, but I am never getting back in that crazy flying death trap ever again!
GRANDSANTA:
Go on.
Get it over.
I want my bed.
What, you're not coming?
You have to deliver the present.
You've got your special coat on.
You're our Santa.
I said me and Evie could get here, and we did.
The rest is just elf work.
Go on, Festive Freddie, sling your hook.
It doesn't matter how we got here.
The sleigh on the roof, the jingle bells, the eight reindeer.
Gwen would never have seen that.
ARTHUR (WHISPERS):
I wish Dad could see this.
It would take such a load off his mind.
So, what are your orders?
Hmm?
You're a Claus.
You give the orders.
Do I? Oh! Um... Heh.
I'm just happy being an elf, really.
You know, just part of it all.
You want to order me to go through the cat flap?
Oh! Um... Yes, that's a great idea.
Do you want to tell me to let you in?
Brilliant. Thank you, Bryony.
BRYONY:
And do you want to...?
Quick!
The alarm? Definitely, yes.
Is this your first time?
But...
Bryony?
Sorry.
He likes these slippers even more than you do!
Happy Christmas.
BRYONY (IN NORMAL VOICE):
When you put the address into the HOHO, what did you see?
(IN NORMAL VOICE) A list of Trelews.
I just clicked on the first one!
Which was not Trelew, England.
We're in the wrong Trelew!
What's going on?!
They've been watching us.
They've seen Evie.
It's just like last time.
REPORTER: Governments tonight are waking to news of a UFO traveling the globe at incredible speed.
BRYONY: That's us!
The clearest sighting was at this tractor dealership in Idaho.
Had eyeballs on its feet and a pointy little head.
It asked me for a sign.
BRYONY: We're on the news.
REPORTER: From the trail in Toronto, these beings do not appear friendly.
COMPUTER: Rebooting.
We are online, sir.
WOMAN 1: This is
Charlotte. Mexican police found a furry thing trying to mate with a dog.
MAN 1: I have calls reporting a steam train flying around.
MAN 2:
Steam train? Been on the eggnog?
MAN 3: It's gone black over Mexico.
This thing's going faster than anything we know of.
STEVE: No.
The herd is now in
Mozambique's airspace, threatening the fragile peace between the two nations.
Two billion items delivered, and we didn't leave a footprint in the snow.
And now...
DOUG: Sir?
We have lost 80 percent of our data.
No, no. We have 18 pulse data reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
Sorry, autosave was off.
Shall I slap him, sir?
Quite hard?
DEBORAH:
Sir, there's a polar bear on Level 6.
Sir? Why is
Arthur out there?
ERNIE:
He missed one.
A nipper.
I mean,
47785BXK.
Sir, we've got something.
Bryony Shelfley, it's her HOHO.
We can still get there.
We just have to go faster, higher!
You've changed your tune.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not here!
ARTHUR:
I've taped myself in! Grandsanta!
Leave me. It's that terrible night all over again.
What night?
Last time I took Evie for a spin.
I didn't know it was the Cuban missile crisis!
I nearly started World War III.
BRYONY:
Hold still. Someone has to drive.
Whoopsie!
ARTHUR:
Oh, no!
Fencer!
Mincer! Come back!
Bryony!
BRYONY:
Hi-yah!
ARTHUR:
Grandsanta, get here!
Oi! That's me new hip.
Please, I'll read you Gwen's letter.
GRANDSANTA:
Stone-deaf. I'm 136.
What's that?
It's Steve.
Steve!
GRANDSANTA: Tell him
I'm not here!
Grandsanta says he's not here.
Hi. I'm looking for a missing relic.
Steve, three words.
Is the first one "help"?
ARTHUR: Yes.
You can help us, Steve!
It was him!
Frosty the Madman.
He forced me to come.
Elf, back me up if you want a career.
I forced you?
You see? Look.
What did you want, Grandsanta?
Let me guess. Hm.
A picture of you in the sleigh delivering the gift to show me how it's really done?
No.
You know the picture they'll have tomorrow?
You, led away in handcuffs!
The Santa who was seen.
By everybody on Earth.
The Santa who ruined Christmas.
Ruined it!
We'll fix this, Steve. We'll be back home in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.
And Evie can go back in mothballs.
You can forget she ever existed.
You can't just go home.
What about Gwen?
Gwen. For that, you'd threaten my whole operation?
Steve, you said if there was any way to get there, you would.
Well, this is it. Look.
The old sleigh is perfect!
Uh, right. Well, anyway, it goes really fast, even with bits missing.
And we've got quite a few reindeer left.
And, if I'm sick again,
I could be sick in a bag.
I'll wrap him one.
We can help them.
No one missed, sir!
All correct presents, present and correct.
ARTHUR:
If you help us, Steve, we can do it!
THOMAS:
Grandsanta and Arthur would be the heroes of the night, sir!
Come home now!
If we all just gave in to Christmas spirit, there'd be chaos.
Unh! We're on our way, Steve.
No!
Santa will want us to get to Gwen.
Ask him. Please.
STEVE:
Arthur, this is Dad we're talking about.
There was a time when he cared about every last gift tag, but now he just wants to be loved and get some rest.
No. He's lying awake, worrying his beard off about Gwen.
SANTA:
Ho-ho-ho. Off to the land of nod.
Please do not disturb until December 26th.
Is that it, dear?
MRS. SANTA: Yes.
Press the red...
No.
Santa's the most caring man in the world.
So why are you here, not him?
Don't leave me, Arthur!
Poor old man and his reindeer, on our own at Christmas?
At least have the decency to finish us off with a rock!
Poor Evie.
Sun'll be up soon.
It's Christmas!
Christmas is for kids.
You grow out of it.
What, in the last six minutes?
I know what you all say about me, you know.
"He belongs in the South Pole."
"Dear Arthur, what a puzzle."
Well, you were right.
All that fuss over one kid.
I was being ridiculous.
This is nice.
It's good to get away from it all, you know.
All the Christmas fuss.
I'm sorry I messed things up, lad.
You see, the night I last took Evie out when there was all that fuss, your father came to me.
I'll never forget it.
Couldn't look me in the eye.
"Dad," he says.
"Steve thinks it best you don't fly again.
We're scrapping the sleigh."
Me own son who used to sit where you sat, looking up at me.
I just wanted them to remember who I used to be.
I was a bit like you, lad.
Keen as cranberry.
So was your dad.
You get old, that's all.
Everything changes.
Does it?
How can I ever write another letter saying that Santa cares?
Good night, Dad.
Sleep well.
Oh!
Sir, we know you shouldn't believe rumors, but we do.
Is it true you missed a child?
Me? No, no, no.
Well, uh, in a way, yes.
It was just one.
In fact, not even that.
Naught point lots more naughts, then a number and some sort of percent at the end.
Not really an error, just a one.
One child doesn't matter?
Which one?
Well, I... It's not that...
SEB:
I did nine ones in Greece.
Did those matter?
FERGUS: What about my ones in Germany? One of them was twins!
They don't matter half each.
Um... Why don't you ask Steve?
He can explain. Fiendishly clever.
But aren't you in charge, sir?
Of course. I'm Santa.
THOMAS:
Sir, if the one that got missed doesn't matter, why have Arthur and Grandsanta gone to take it?
What?
Malcolm, what's this about Arthur?
ELF 1:
He's crazy.
DEBORAH: Is there a list of children who don't matter?
Santa said they don't matter
100 percent.
ELF 2: Is it true children aren't real, they're just antimatter?
Shh, shh! Do not... Look. Look!
I festivized every single country in the world. You see?
This one, this one, this one.
All of them.
I mean, who cares about one single tiny child?
Uh... I do.
Arthur.
My poor boy.
Why on earth would he...?
You're his brother, Steve.
How could you let him?
And about this child you missed,
I'm really not sure you made the right decision.
Is that bird doo on your shoulder?
Right.
Over there is Satellite
Tracking, Navigation, Data Analysis.
Coffee machine's by the door.
Good night, Santa.
♪ Gloria ♪
♪ Hosanna in excelsis ♪ ♪
SANTA:
Um...
I'll be right back.
ARTHUR: Dear Xiao-Ling, thanks for your letter and drawing of Santa tripping over your dog.
It was hilarious.
Dear Alessandro,
I'm sorry your family's had a hard year, but Santa is real.
Dear Lars,
I promise Santa will come.
He's the greatest man ever.
Can I burn this?
Sure.
There's millions like it.
This picture.
This drawing!
It isn't of Dad or you or Steve.
This is Santa!
Ha, ha!
And as long we get the bike to Gwen before she wakes up, then Santa came!
And he cares! Ha, ha!

Aah!

GRANDSANTA:
Oh, dear.
I've seen this before.
Sleigh fever, they call it.
Pressure of Christmas sends a man doolally-tap.
Santa Claus XVI got it, 1802.
Every child that year got a sausage nailed to a piece of bark.
Unh! Whoa!
Arthur, do you really think you can row the Atlantic Ocean in the next
37 minutes?
It's not, unh, too late yet.
I just have to keep, unh, going.
We need a blunt instrument.
Knock him out and regroup.
MAN (ON HOHO): Make a legal U-turn, then slight right in 4228 miles.
You do know we're going round in circles?
You know, we're not the only ones.
Maybe I will see Evie again.
What do you mean?
GRANDSANTA: Reindeer are brave, powerful beasts but they're also dappled cretins with twigs on their heads.
They'll just keep going in a straight line right round the world.
They'll be way up in the sky, flying at unimaginable speed, but they'll pass right over our heads.
Great!
We can get the sleigh back!
Chief De Silva.
Where is this UFO?
It's circling the Earth, ma'am.
Nineteen minutes ago, it went into orbit.
You? Up there?
Catch that with this?
Magic dust.
You crack it over your head.
You'll have to focus. The sleigh'll be coming at you at 45,000 miles an hour.
GRANDSANTA: You'll be torn in half!
Depends on the angle the sleigh hits.
You might just get beheaded.
I've got a phobia of being beheaded, and heights and speed and reindeer and buttons.
Buttons?
Yeah, I'm pretty much scared of everything.
Gwen thinks you're coming. Ah!
You can't do this. Yes, you can!
No, you can't. Yes, you can!
Come on, Arthur!
Don't worry. Only a raving lunatic...
I have to worry!
It's the only thing I'm good at!
Worry me.
The sleigh'll be back any minute.
Come on. Worry me, quickly!
Imagine Gwen, all alone, nothing under the tree.
Here we go. Unh.
No! Don't like this! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Get me down!
The tears as she finds she's been left out.
Screaming, "Santa didn't come!"
Oh, Gwen.
No! It's just too high!
BRYONY: Gwen in the street surrounded by kids on new bikes, pointing:
"That's the girl that Santa hates!"
She runs away, alcoholic by the age of 9.
Dead before she's even...!
She may never build a snowman again!
What if there are buttons on the sleigh
I don't know about?!
Here it is!
Um...
How do you think he's, uh...?
Fine, fine. Probably just, uh...
(SCREAMING
AND WHIMPERING)
(WHISTLING
"GOOD KING WENCESLAS")
So how come they didn't scrap the sleigh, sir?
I threatened the elves.
Said I'd feed them to the polar bears.
Whoa!
Elf, how do you fancy being the one to tell his parents about all this?
(GRUNTS THEN
WHIMPERING AND YELLING)
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Yay! Arthur!
You did it!
I did it with worry!
Oh, I was sure you'd die.
It was great!
MAN (ON HOHO):
Proceed to the highlighted route.
Proceed to the highlighted.
Just keep worrying about Gwen.
I'll find a way there, boy.
Whatever it takes.
To Trelew!
Margaret.
Hand me my Me suit.
All sorted. Steve's, uh... holding the fort while I deliver the present, yes, and find Arthur and Father.
Well done, dear.
Trelew's on a course of 187.7 degrees from the geographic pole but as it's the old sleigh, allow a drift margin of 1000 miles either side of the meridian.
Got a sweater for Arthur, your father's pills, and some nice sweet tea.
Hm.
COMPUTER:
Curtains.
S-1 dented.
PETER: Sir. Sir!
Big scratch down side.
"Popped out to take present.
Turkey sandwich in fridge.
Mum and Dad."
Espresso machine broken.
That idiot, Arthur. He's sent everyone crazy.
He'll destroy Christmas.
And you'll never get to be Santa.
Steven!
I, um...
23 Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.
Malcolm, there's no harm in using a manual.
Men.
Margaret, I order you to disembark.
It's not safe. Unh!
Piffle. I did a microlight flying course on the Internet.
It can't be that different.
Oh! Steve.
You've dented it!
You take it out without asking?
Malcolm, you told me he knew.
You know how Steve feels about his S-1.
It's my S-1 . S for "Santa."
I'm flying to this child.
Of course she's all that matters.
Not me, your son.
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight.
No!
This is about that pool table, isn't it?
I told you, you should've written to me.
I was 8. You're my dad!
For goodness sake!
Arthur and Grandsanta are out there probably not wearing nearly enough layers and you two are bickering over a big red toy?!
I'm not bickering.
If Steven could just stand back... Ooh!
COMPUTER:
Air bag.
You drive, Steven.
Thank you.
So since gift delivery to child 47785BXK is all that seems to matter,
I'll do it myself.
Then we'll pick up Arthur and Grandsanta from whatever ditch they ended up in.
Maximum thrust.
Um, when Santa said he'd be right back, what do you think he...?
He's not coming back!
The Santas are leaving!
Children don't matter?
Christmas doesn't matter!
Nothing matters!
It's like 1816!
Abandon the North Pole!
DEBORAH: Everybody, panic!
COMPUTER: Are you sure you want to delete Christmas?
Meltdown: 10 minutes.
ELF 1: Head south!
ELF 2: It's all south from here, you fool!
I know where we can find a map, lad!
A bit risky, this.
Breaking the rules, even in the old days.
There!
Biggest map in the world!

DE SILVA: Friends, on this night of peace, we stand confronted by an unknown danger.
Aliens. Aliens from space.
MAN 1: Blast them from the skies!
WOMAN 1: Let us do an autopsy.
But maybe the aliens come in peace?
They burst an inflatable
Santa Claus in Toronto.
On Christmas night!
WOMAN 2: What a terrible thing.
DE SILVA: Let us attempt contact, but be ready to save our planet.
GRANDSANTA:
Hold tight, lad. This is where it gets really rough.
Not now, you sack of antlers.
MAN (OVER PA):
Alert level six.
It's coming down through the atmosphere.
We'll see it.
Forty-six, 45,
They'll be waiting for us, sir.
We were on the news.
All their technology against my Evie.
Oh, come on. Let's do it with worry!
Santa mustn't be seen, eh, lad?
Let's give them something to shoot at.
We have visual.
Here it comes.
GRANDSANTA:
Take us to your leader. Ha-ha-ha!
ARTHUR:
England!
GRANDSANTA:
No sign of anyone.
ARTHUR: The sun's coming up!
Come on, lad! You can do it! Move your hooves!
Mankind greets you. Do you copy?
Season's greetings from mankind.
Good morning, do you copy?
The hull is some kind of woody substance, ma'am.
Like wood.
Coated in lead paint.
The engine seems to be alive.
And furry.

BRYONY & GRANDSANTA:
Your slipper!
We have lock.
We got to get you down there, lad.
They'll see us! We'll be stopped!
Give me that.
What are you doing?
It's Evie they're after.
She doesn't fit this world, Arthur.
She's a relic.
Evie?
I always knew she'd be needed one more time.
You go on. We'll let them have her.
You're coming too.
You were right, Arthur. It doesn't matter how Santa's gift gets there.
Doesn't even matter if it's
Mr. Postman in his spaceship.
As long as it gets there.
You made it happen, lad.
No one got left out.
Get off.
Now, do as I say.
MAN:
They're firing on us!
A death ray!
Made of chocolate and oranges.
WOMAN: Unidentified varnished object, turn back or we shoot.
Go!
Turn back.
Happy Christmas!
In Santa we believe!
Go on, elf.
You too.
Hi-yah!
DE SILVA:
Fire missiles.
This is it, old fella.
Maybe the next
Santa never sat in my Evie, but Arthur did.
And he's as good a man as any Santa there's ever been.
Yah!
Goodbye, Evie.
Thank you, everyone.
You just saved Christmas.
STEVE:
Trelew.
Out with the old, in with the new.
Well done, dear.
Poor Arthur.
He tried so hard.
He's flunked again.
Of course he hasn't, dear.
We're here. The little girl will get her present.
I think he's done rather splendidly.
My Margaret.
(DOORBELL RINGS
OVER MONITOR)
Good morning, Gwen.
Ho, ho, et cetera.
Apologies for the minor delay.
I'm sure that even a child can understand that in an operation as complex as Christmas, there's always an insignificant margin of error, which is you. As a gesture,
I've upgraded you to the Glamorfast Ultra X-3 which retails at 9.99 more than your requested gift.
Bigger ergo better.
If you wouldn't mind just signing a legal waiver?
Pedro? A boy?
A Spanish boy?
This is an error.
Now get off the bike.
Will you get...?
No, no, no. Please don't cry.
No cry-o.
No, uh, "sob-idad."
Uh...
It's over a mile.
We've got no sleigh, no reindeer, and you can't even walk.
What are you doing?
I can cycle!
Oi! Come back!
What about the wrapping?!
ARTHUR:
The church. She lives by the church!
Happy Christmas, cows!
COMPUTER: Meltdown. Ten seconds to figgy Flensburg. Snowman.
German, leave out the carrot.
Is Santa on shoe?
What the...?!
Look, everyone! It's Arthur!
He's delivering the present.
It's Arthur.
ELF: Hooray for Arthur!

Meltdown paused.
BRYONY:
Come back!
Oh, my head.
Ye baubles, a beautiful young reindeer.
Ah. So who am I, then?
Okay, so I'm not great with children.
Does that make me a bad Santa?
You're hardly perfect.
Let me guess. You put in the address, you saw a list of Trelews and just clicked on the first one?
You're just like Arthur.
Am I?
COMPUTER: North Pole,
DEBORAH:
But, sir, it's Arthur. He's still going.

Eastern Pack wolves.
Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.
Great. There goes dinner.
And there goes Kate.
-Holy.. .
-Caribou!
Scatter to the sides!
Look at those moves.
Settle the score, leader.
Are you all right?
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-Hey, what's your problem, you stupid Eastern dog?
That was our hunt.
You can't just snake it out from under us.
Can-do, back off.
You better listen to the girl.
Hey, break it up.
Can-do, Hutch, break it up!
All right, Omegas, duty calls.
Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!
-Hey!
-Candy!
-Kate.
-Humphrey? l'm still going to tear this snaggletooth fool apart.
Guys, lower the boom!
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.
Guys, guys, come on.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.
You wolves are making us look bad.
Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.
Now, that's a moon l don't want to howl to.
Western hunt group, get back to the den.
The two of you, go home.
Now!
Omegas, good job.
Great. My first hunt, and l blew it.
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy.
You were amazing. l mean, if anyone's hungry, they can eat.. .
They can always eat.. .
What?
Here.
They can eat berries.
Berries are really nutritious.
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.
Luckily, the Omegas were there to break up the fight.
-Lilly.
-What?
Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.
Kate, you're slouching. Thank you, honey.
Do you see how strong and beautiful you are?
My.
Any food is a blessing, dear.
Winston? Come join us for dinner? Now!
Thank you, honey.
Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.
Not for my pack. l'm sorry, Dad. lt's just those Eastern Wolves. lt's not your fault, Kate.
When they crossed into our territory, they broke pack law.
Winston.
Can-do was jumped by a group of Eastern Wolves. lt ain't nothing.
Quickly, bring him into the den.
Winston, honey, whoever did this, let's rip his tail off and shove it down his throat.
Sir, are we just going to let them keep raiding our hunts and.. .
Put our Alphas on alert.
Already done, sir.
Good job.
Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated. lnstead, now, keep an open mind, l just want you to have an open mind here, we bring you berries.
How about squirrels?
Bad joke.
Flying squirrels.
Winston!
Tony! You're looking good.
My back feels like wood. l got this disk that keeps cracking.
Drives me crazy.
Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Like that little game of tag during our hunt.
Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.
You know there's no caribou left in the east.
You got a problem.
Unite the packs, Winston. lt was you who gave the big speech that your daughter Kate and my son Garth would marry and unite the packs.
Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?
Don't worry. She knows.
Good.
Then she can meet Garth tonight at the moonlight howl. l won't let my pack starve, Winston. lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.
That would be a big mistake.
Kate. lt's.. . lt's okay, Dad. l understand. lt's.. . lt's my responsibility.
Guys, we got to get ready for the moonlight howl.
Guys, girls.
Girls?
You are cool.
So, let me go ahead.. .
Prepare the girls for your arrival and you guys meet me there.
Game on.
Girls.
Kate, you look so beautiful.
Now, if Garth gets out of line, take those beautiful teeth of yours, go for the throat, and don't let go until the body stops shaking. lf my little girl doesn't want to do this, if she's not ready.. .
Don't worry, Dad. l'm ready.
Come on, Lilly.
Okay. Okay.
Your fur.. . lt looks fantastic tonight.
Oh, my gosh. l had.. .
Omega alert. l will handle this. lt totally relaxes the knots.
Hey.
Hey.
That's all l've got.
Wow. This is a new feeling. l saw the whole thing, guys.
And, l cannot believe they didn't just fall all over you.
When you yelled, ''Hey,'' l thought you cinched it right there.
So, you think you can do better?
Please.
The next girl that comes up the hill, she's mine. l've never seen her look that good.
Kate is hot. l'll be right back.
Hey.
Where do you think you're going?
Humphrey, you know the rules.
You're not allowed to howl with her.
She's an Alpha.
We can eat together.
But we can't, you know, howl together.
Guys, l know. l.. . l was just.. .
Kidding.
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.
Friends for life!
Ugly.
So, do you see Garth?
Great. l'm not even sure what he looks like.
But l'm sure.. .
We'll know him when we see him.
Hey, Kate.
What?
Garth.
Lilly, stand up.
Garth, hello. Good to see you.
-Humphrey?
-My butt! My butt. lt really hurts.
You should really do something about that cough.
Be careful, Kate.
There's something going around.
Tails and ears are falling off, literally.
Name's Humphrey.
Garth.
Wow. You are a.. .
You are a big one, aren't you?
Wow. You're practically a moose.
Where you hiding them antlers?
Who's the coyote?
Who's the coyote? l get it.
That's good, 'cause l'm, like.. .
No one important.
Lilly, why don't you take little coyote Humphrey and run along?
Come on, Humphrey.
Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.
So, tell me about yourself.
What does Garth like to do?
Well, l'm really into fitness, you know?
Rabbit sprints, tree squats.
You know us Alphas got to keep fit to lead the pack.
But, what really gets me going is.. .
Was it good for you?
Unbelievable.
You know.. . l just.. . Just.. . Hold on a sec
'cause l'm going to be right back. l.. . l need some water. Some water. Okay?
So, l'll.. . Just.. . Hold on.
No worries. l'll just keep my vocal chords warm.
Yeah.
''Oh, he's no one important.
''Just take little coyote Humphrey and run along.' '
Coyote.
-Where's Barf?
-lt's Garth.
And we're just taking a little break.
A break?
What? ls that so strange?
No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding? l always like to take a break
10 minutes into a howl.
Well, l do.
Your howling partner, he's not a.. .
He's not a stud.
Not a stud but, like, it's like ''stud'' but.. .
A dud. A dud. That's it. lsn't he?
No.
He is not a dud. ln fact, Humphrey, you'd be surprised to find that he is.. .
Strong!
Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's.. . He's.. .
-Proud!
-Yes! Yes.
Proud. And he's.. .
What's the word l'm looking for?
An Alpha's Alpha.
That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.
You make me so mad!
Hey, l was just kidding.
You're kind of cute.
Really? You think.. . So, wow. Okay. Cute.
Yeah. That's.. . Look.. .
Thank you, first of all, but do you mean ''Cute'' in, like, a rugged, kind of handsomely ''Cute''?
Again with the butt.
These mosquitoes are out of control. l'll meet you on Mars, right after l eat the Milky Way.
That sounds good.
Save some for me.
Bag them up, boys. We're going to ldaho.
You got it, chief.
Okay. There we go. Watch out there.
Kate?
Where am l?
Humphrey? ls that you?
Kate! Where are we? l don't know.
Maybe we're dead.
Nope. Definitely not dead.
At least they left us some water.
You got water?
Nope. Definitely not water.
Kate, what are you doing?
Trying to get out.
Calm down.
Listen, maybe they're taking us to where there's more food.
Or maybe we are the food.
Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.
Yeah.
All right. Set them free.
Look at them go.
Wow.
This isn't Jasper.
Yeah, but it sure does.. . Rock!
Quick, get down!
What are they doing?
What a smashingly brilliant story this is.
The golfing goose from the low regions of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.
He's using the wrong club.
Could you do me a favor, Needles, and shut the hole that makes the words?
Looks like they're playing some sort of weird game.
Maybe they can tell us how to get home.
Yeah. And if they can't, we can eat them.
Yeah. Follow my lead.
Yeah, l'm right behind you.
Now you will see, this shot is mine.
Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.
Just a minute! lt's ugly, but a good runner.
Did you see that? Did you see that? l guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.
You mark it ''Birdie'' because it would have gone in.
Technically, sir, it might have gone in.
That silly bird stopped my shot from going in.
So, l will not take an extra stroke.
Mark it Birdie!
Well, it.. . lt was an obstacle.
And everyone has to play with the obstacles.
You know, we wouldn't want to lie.
This is not a lie.
This is not a lie if you are French.
Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash, a hyphen, in between there.
-l say French.
-Canadian.
-French.
-Canadian.
-French!
-Canadian, sir.
May l just say, though, that you are a wonderful golfer.
And you are a very good caddie.
Take off!
Paddy, what is wrong with you?
Hello.
You are two wolves. l have not seen many wolves in these parts.
But l am not afraid of wolves. No. l like wolves.
Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you a few questions.
Yes. Quick! Look behind you!
Grab him!
So, you want to face the French Resistance?
That's French-Canadian!
My butt! My butt! My butt!
Omegas.
This is not a game anymore!
Don't you wash your feet?
Look out for the trees!
Watch that.
Nice one, sir.
Gotcha.
Oh, no.
That's got to hurt.
How do you like it now, wolf?
Hole in one, sir.
You have bit off more than you can chew this time, my friend.
Help!
My goodness. l.. . Look out for the.. .
No. No. No. No. No. No.
He's a goner for sure.
Wait, what are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
Hey, Frank.
Okay. You have a question?
Yeah. Where are we? ldaho? lda-who?
Oui, ldaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes, and a few billion potatoes.
Sawtooth National Wilderness.
What are we doing in ldaho?
You were relocated to repopulate.
They want you big wolves to make a lot of little wolves.
Sounds good to me.
Park shouldn't be without some wolves. l mean, only for the good of the park.
So you two are undomesticated partners?
Paddy, please. Don't be rude.
So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?
You are an item?
-Well.. .
-No.
You wolves, you are funny.
We have to get home now.
There's going to be trouble if l don't get back to Jasper.
Right. All right. You're freaking out. l'm not freaking out. l just have to get home.
-ls this about Barf?
-lt's Garth.
And it's about responsibilities.
So, l don't expect you to understand.
Can you help me? l need to get home fast.
All right, Miss Fast.
Where is home sweet home?
Jasper Park, Canada.
Jasper park? Get out of here.
We love Jasper Park!
Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.
Paddy, please. We've toured it many times. l dated a Pintail from Jasper once.
She never stopped quacking.
Drove me nuts.
Drove her right to me.
Bound to happen. Bound to happen.
So, you can help me, then, get home.
We haven't played Jasper in quite a while. l think it would be a smashing idea.
This is true. So, of course l will help. l like you two. You make me laugh.
And you didn't eat me, so l owe you favor.
Where did she go?
Maybe l should ask you.
You know that's not my style.
My wolf, Can-do, knows your style. l just want to say one thing. lf any of you wolves have hurt my daughter, l will personally rip out your eyes and shove them down your throat so you can see my claws tear your carcass open!
Mom?
Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.
Well, since Kate stood up Garth, l could show him around until she gets back. l wouldn't say ''Stood up.' '
Garth!
Sounds good to me.
Well, come on, Garth. lsn't that sweet? She gets it from me. l'll give her till the full moon.
lt is beautiful out there.
Almost makes you want
to hit the potato patch.
lf you haven't already hit the outdoors,
get on out your door.
The weather today is...
Your ride home.
Quick! Get in!
What? Boxed up twice in one day.
What are the odds?
-Hide!
-Hide!
That right there is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.
Lucky for you, they travel every year to Jasper right after Sawtooth.
The day's looking pretty, and so is my woman.
This is the song we met to.
Come here, you. Let's dance.
-Down here.
-Hurry.
Now, he was in a motorcycle gang, and she was a librarian.
And opposites attract, if you will.
Exactly. ln this case, it was a bookstore that also sold beer.
So, they met.
Come on. We have to get in.
All right. Here we go.
You're just a dream. l'm like a little bunny. Aren't l, dear? l love you, Deb. l love you, too.
Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.
Well, back in a box.
Good luck, you two!
We will be watching out for you from above!
Well, l'll be watching out for you.
He will be breathing heavily.
lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.
Humphrey?
So, why is this called
Rabbit Poo Mountain?
Because this is where rabbits like to poo. l was just kidding. l get it. You're a funny Omega.
Okay. Make me laugh.
What am l?
You got me. lt's a turtle that fell and can't get up.
That's pretty good.
Okay. What's this? lt's turtle road kill.
What else can you do? l just do turtles.
Okay, it's my turn.
You want to see something an Alpha can do?
Would my mother approve?
Of course.
Well, okay then.
Keep searching.
We must find her before tomorrow night.
Winston?
Don't worry, Eve.
She's the finest Alpha l've trained. l'm not, Winston.
She's also the finest Alpha l've ever trained.
We stopped.
-What's wrong with you?
-l have to go.
You can't leave. Can't you hold it?
No! l can't.
Well, did you try crossing your legs?
-Yes!
-Holding your breath?
Yes! l almost passed out.
-Closing your eyes and.. .
-ln or out, l am going.
Would you hurry? l can't go when l feel pressured.
Go!
What is he doing?
The packaging's wolf-proof.
Where is he?
Come on, Humphrey. lt's a rabid wolf!
Max, bring that gun!
This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?
Max, they're getting away!
Not if l can help it.
-No!
-We're trapped. l got you both now.
Shoot them!
Nicely done, Max.
Okay.
Thinking with my belly instead of my head, not a good idea. l get it. l say we build a comfy den.. .
-l'm going home.
-Great.
You're going home, and it's raining. l'm not stopping.
Rain, rain, go away
Get out of here, rain
No one wants you around
What are you doing? lt's.. . lt's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.
'Cause you're wet
And you really are going to ruin our day
Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.
Right! Well, l'll just do it backwards.
That actually worked.
Kate?
That's not a good idea.
Hold on, Kate!
No!
Hold on, Kate! l'm coming!
Let me think. Let me think.
Humphrey!
Don't worry, Kate. lt's all part of my plan. l can see that.
Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.
Grab your what?
Take those Alpha jaws and grab.. .
My tail. My tail.
Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.
That tickles. My tail hurts!
Who knew l was ticklish there? l can't take any more.
No.
My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!
Your tail. l'm so sorry.
My tail's actually fine, last time l checked.
Come on. Let's get out of the rain.
Okay.
Thank you.
Sir, we've searched the entire territory.
Still no sign of Kate.
Sir?
We must defend our territory.
Fore!
Well, well, well. What do we have here? l say, we've caught them at quite the bad time.
No, l'd say we caught them at a good time. lndeed, sir. lndeed.
What are you doing here?
No, the question is what are you doing here? l give you a first class ticket home.. . lt's a straight shot right to the pin.
-And you blow it?
-Yep.
Over a cupcake.
Ridiculous dessert. ''A cupcake.' '
Actually, they're quite delicious.
There has to be another way for us to get to Jasper.
Another way? Another way?
Always another way.
What am l, a travel agent?
Come on. What, are you kidding me?
A great sportsman like yourself always knows a few ways to win the game.
Well, there could be a train.
Actually, there is a train. lt's the Canadian Express and.. .
Paddy, please. lt's called the Canadian Express.. .
Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.
Right by Jasper Park.
-lf you can catch it.. .
-You'll be home in no time.
No time. Very fast.
Great. So where do we board?
Where do you board?
Watch this.
On the other side of that mountain.
Paddy, please.
Come on!
Let it slip, but may l say, that was a stupendous shot.
You may, and it was pretty good, wasn't it? lndeed, sir. lndeed.
Dinner for two. lt's a new move l've been working on for stalking prey.
You're good.
Thanks. Now you try.
No. l.. . l'm not much of a hunter.
Come on. You'll do great.
Just do what l do.
Okay.
Ready?
-One.
-One.
-Two.
-Two.
Three!
Lilly!
Lilly?
A turtle, right? l told you, l don't hunt.
Maybe this will help.
Wow.
''Wow'' what?
Your eyes.
They're beautiful.
Come on. Let's try again.
-lt sure is pretty out there.
-Yeah.
-l'll race you to the top.
-You're on.
Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.
Humphrey?
Omega one, Alpha zero!
Okay! Okay!
Enough, enough! Stop! Stop! l get it. l get it. l get it.
How's that for a girl's throw?
Very funny.
Well, look who's having fun.
You know, l should go check on the train.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.
Hi, there.
What are you?
Well, l'm a wolf. l've never seen a wolf.
You are really strange.
Am l now?
You're totally weird. l'm going to get you!
No. Look out! Look out!
Okay, you asked for it.
No, no, no. lt's okay. lt's okay. l'm really sorry.
Oh, poo.
Mad.. .
Mad bear.
Kate! Get the snowballs ready!
Mad bear on the attack!
The Canadian Express!
Humphrey, the train is coming!
Kate!
Humphrey?
What's wrong with you?
That!
Don't move. We can handle this.
We can?
Okay, we're in trouble.
Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.
So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown, and one of the bears says,
''Does this taste funny to you?''
A simple ''Boo'' would have sufficed.
Man.
Watch this. One more. One more.
Get up. Kate, get up.
Where are those two?
Why must they make this so difficult? l believe the term is
''high maintenance couple,'' sir.
Stuck between the cliffs and the claws.
This isn't good.
Good luck joking your way out of this one.
What's your name, sir?
Growl. All right.
Do you need a hug?
Why don't we talk? Can we just talk?
Good talk!
Hey, need a ride?
Jump! Trust me! l told you, you could trust me.
Hang a left!
Go right!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Unbelievable. They have missed the train.
Or not.
-l know. lt's not very good, is it?
-Well.. .
That was so awesome.
You with the snowballs.
And you with that little bear in that snowball fight. lt was so cute.
But then you with the log!
The look on your face was so good.
And then we.. .
You know, we make a pretty good team.
Kate and Humphrey, world adventurers!
What do you think? l think you're crazy.
You think l'm.. .
No, l'm telling you, we're onto something here.
Stick with me, pup. We'll go places.
Well, l'll keep that in mind.
All right. Take a deep breath.
Howl from right here.
And l'll join in.
Humphrey, what are you doing? l'm sorry. The moon, the moment. l just thought.. .
Come on, Kate. Howl at the moon with me.
See? That's so good.
No. You better go.
But no one has to know.
Please. Go, now.
No.
Dad.
Howling with an Omega, are we?
-l was just.. .
-Get with the others.
What's going on?
We're going to take the valley, and our caribou.
-Dad!
-Lilly, what's wrong?
The Eastern Wolves. They're coming!
Come on!
Just do it.
She howled at the moon with you.
That was just the moment.
Bonjour, my furry friend.
What?
Are you guys crazy?
That's up for debate.
And where is.. . Mademoiselle.
She's sleeping, so be quiet.
Yes. Quiet.
What are you guys doing here?
Making sure that you don't forget the run of the course.
Jasper Park, it is a few miles up.
Do not miss it.
Jasper, few miles, got it.
Good. l've got to say, your girlfriend looks quite pretty when she sleeps.
She's not my girlfriend.
You should work on that. lt's the full moon, Winston. l can see that, Tony. l didn't want it to come to this.
But here we are.
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
Kate.
Kate, wake up. Wake up.
Humphrey? Where are we?
We're.. . We're in Jasper.
We're home.
Yup. We're home.
-There's something.. .
-There's something.. .
Please, you first.
Humphrey, l just wanted to tell you, these past couple of days, they've been, kind of, fun.
You've been, kind of, fun.
Really?
Really.
Well, that's.. . That's great. l told you, we make a pretty good team.
We do.
Okay.
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
You have to go to the bathroom again.
Why, do you see a truck stop? l just wanted to tell you l.. . l.. .
-l.. . l just wanted to tell you.. .
-No. l.. . l love.. .
Oh, geez.
All l asked was for you to follow our customs, unite the packs.
But, no.
Your daughter had to up and run away. l didn't run away.
Kate!
She's back!
-We were so worried.
-Where have you been?
-ln ldaho.
-ldaho?
What were you doing in ldaho?
We were taken by humans to another park.
We were supposed to repopulate.
No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.
Humphrey actually helped me get home.
What a nice boy.
-l came back.. .
-You came back to marry Garth.
Yes.
And unite the packs!
Good for the pack, good for the belly.
Marry? You're getting married?
Yes. lsn't it great?
No more fighting during hunts.
No more scraps and bones at dinnertime.
We're going to unite the packs.
Welcome back, Humphrey.
Good job bringing her home.
Wow. lt's a big crowd.
Yeah. Good times.
So l heard you and Garth spent some time together.
Lilly.
Sorry. l'm sure he's perfect marrying material.
Well, if you like that sort of thing, big, brawny, and perfect.
Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.
Sorry. l know.
But, l liked it.
Right on the pin.
Marcel! Paddy!
When it comes to hugs, we are all French, Paddy?
Well, l'm English, so we don't hug!
But for a first, l'd say that was a good one. l'm so happy to see you two.
We flew in to see that you made it home.
And what do we find?
-You're getting married!
-You're getting married!
Yeah. l'm getting married.
-Who told you?
-l did.
Humphrey.
We should be going.
Yes, yes.
Excuse me. A flea.
And a little something for your big day.
Thank you.
Just wanted to say good-bye.
Good-bye?
Yeah. l'm thinking about doing a little traveling, you know, seeing where the train takes me.
And maybe l'll visit our friends the bears.
Our old buddies, see how they're doing. l'll tell them you said hi.
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?
Yeah. You know, it's a lone wolf thing. l know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega, not Humphrey, the lone wolf.
So l'll be a fun-loving lone wolf. l don't doubt that.
You know, Marcel, l am a stickler for tradition, but this one, l just don't understand.
These wolves are mysterious creatures.
Tony.
So.. .
Are you ready?
Yes.
Good.
Are you okay?
You bet.
No problems on this end.
Ready to go, go, go.
So, you want to start this thing or me?
We'll start together.
Start together. Yeah.
So, what's happening?
They're accepting each other's scent.
And now, the nibble on the ears.
Do you think l can make it?
Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks, you should see an open train car.
Well, avoid truck stops, bears, and that hideous dessert. What is it called?
-Cupcakes, sir.
-Yes. Cupcakes. l will. Thanks, guys.
You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental about cupcakes.
They really are quite delicious. l wouldn't know.
And finally, they will rub noses to symbolize that they are mates!
Kate, what are you doing? l.. . l can't.
You can't! l mean, you can't?
What is this, Winston?
Why can't she marry Garth?
Quiet.
Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?
Because l.. . l fell in love with an Omega.
An Omega?
Humphrey? That sly dog!
An Alpha in love with an Omega.
That's against pack law.
Dad. l also am in love with an Omega.
What?
What have you done to my son, Winston?
An Omega and an Alpha?
An Alpha and an Omega?
Eve, help me out.
This is madness. This isn't our custom.
This isn't our way. Take the valley! l just love weddings!
Stampede! Stampede!
Everyone, run! Run!
To the sides of the valley! lt's that darn disk in my back.
Come on!

Now that's a howl.
Are you ready?
Yeah. Ready.

Charles, you have finally lost your senses.
This venture is impossible.
For some. Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
That kind of thinking could ruin you.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Imagine trading posts in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...
The nightmare again?
I won't be long.
I'm falling down a dark hole, then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
Well, there's a dodo bird, a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.
I didn't know cats could smile.
(SIGHING) Neither did I.
And there's a blue caterpillar.
Blue caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.
But if you get too frightened, you can always wake up. Like this.
(LAUGHING) Ow!
Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
What if it was agreed that "proper" was wearing a codfish on your head?
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.
To me, a corset is like a codfish.
Please, not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
It's always the same, ever since I can remember.
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There. You're beautiful.
Now, can you manage a smile?
At last. We thought you'd never arrive.
Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you. Go.
You do realize it's well past 4:00.
Now everything will have to be rushed through.
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!
Forgive my wife. She's been planning this affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here...
My condolences.
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes.
Of course not. I'm pleased that you purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance.
Charles thought so, too.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC
CONTINUES PLAYING)
Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.
Do I amuse you?
No.
I had a sudden vision of all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses.
I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself.
When in doubt, remain silent.
Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.
Where's your head?
I was wondering what it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking about such an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast.
(SOFTLY) Come along.
Alice, meet me under the gazebo in precisely 10 minutes.
We have a secret to tell you.
If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret.
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.
But now you've brought it up, you have to.
- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.
I wonder if your mother knows that you two swim naked in the Havershims' pond.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.
There's your mother right now.
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.
You've ruined the surprise!
I could strangle them!
Everyone went to so much effort to keep the secret.
Does everyone know?
It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...
But I don't know if I want to marry Hamish.
Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.
You don't want to end up like Aunt Imogene.
And you don't want to be a burden on Mother, do you?
No.
So you'll marry Hamish.
You will be as happy as I am with Lowell, and your life will be perfect.
It's already decided.
Alice, dear.
I'll leave you to it.
Shall we take a leisurely stroll through the garden, just you and me?
Do you know what I've always dreaded?
The decline of the aristocracy?
Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.
You're bound to produce little... Imbeciles!
The gardeners have planted white roses when I specifically asked for red.
You could always paint the roses red.
What an odd thing to say.
You should know that my son has extremely delicate digestion.
- Did you see that?
- See what?
- It was a rabbit, I think.
- Nasty things.
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods, he could get a blockage.
Did you see it that time?
- See what?
- The rabbit.
Don't shout.
Now, pay attention.
Hamish said you were easily distracted.
- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.
I couldn't be more interested, but you'll have to excuse me.
Aunt Imogene.
I think I'm going mad.
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.
I can't be bothered with your fancy rabbit now.
I'm waiting for my fiancé.
- You have a fiancé?
- Hmm.
There! Did you see it?
He's a prince.
But, alas, he cannot marry me unless he renounces his throne.
It's tragic, isn't it?
Very.
Lowell?
Alice. We were just...
Hattie's an old friend.
I can see you're very close.
Look, you won't mention this to your sister, will you?
I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.
Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.
You don't want to ruin her marriage, do you?
Me?
But I'm not the one who's sneaking around behind her back.
There you are.
Alice Kingsleigh...
Hamish.
What is it?
You have a caterpillar on your shoulder.
Ew.
Don't hurt it.
You'll want to wash that finger.
Alice Kingsleigh, will you be my wife?
Well, everyone expects me to, and you're a lord.
My face won't last, and I don't want to end up like...
But this is happening so quickly. I...
I think I...
I think I...
I need a moment.
Hello.
It's only a dream.
DODO: You'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
MALLY: You've brought the wrong Alice.
McTWISP: No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
MALLY: She's the wrong Alice.
McTWISP: Give her a chance.
Curiouser and curiouser.
I told you she's the right Alice.
I am not convinced.
McTWISP: How is that for gratitude?
I've been up there for weeks, trailing one Alice after the next, and I was almost eaten by other animals.
Can you imagine?
They go about entirely unclothed, and they do their shukm in public.
- I had to avert my eyes.
- Doesn't look anything like herself.
That's because she's the wrong Alice.
- lf she was, she might be.
- lf she isn't, she ain't.
- But if she were so, she would be.
- But she isn't, nohow.
How can I be the wrong Alice when this is my dream?
And who are you, if I might ask?
Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee.
We should consult Absolem.
Exactly. Absolem will know who she is.
- I'll escort you.
- Hey, it's not being your turn.
So unfair.
- Hey, leave off!
- Let go!
- Are they always this way?
- Family trait.
You can both escort her.
- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's absolute.
He's Absolem.
Who are you?
Absolem?
You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is, who are you?
(COUGHING) Alice.
We shall see.
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.
Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.
The Oraculum, being a calendrical compendium of Underland.
- It's a calendar.
- ABSOLEM: Compendium.
It tells of each and every day since the Beginning.
Today is Griblig Day in the time of the Red Queen.
Show her the Frabjous Day.
Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the day you slay the Jabberwocky.
Sorry? Slay a what?
Oh, yeah. That being you, there, with the Vorpal sword.
No other swords can kill the Jabberwocky, nohow.
If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.
That's not me!
I know!
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?
Not hardly.
- I told you.
- McTWISP: Oh, dear.
- I said so.
- I said so.
TWEEDLEDUM: Contrariwise, you said she might be.
No, you said she would be if she was.
(SCOFFING) Little impostor. Pretending to be Alice. She should be ashamed.
I was so certain of you.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be the wrong Alice.
Wait, this is my dream.
I'm going to wake up now and you'll all disappear.
That's odd.
Pinching usually does the trick.
I could stick you, if that would help.
- It might, actually. Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Ow!
- Bandersnatch!
- Bandersnatch!
Wait.
It's only a dream. Nothing can hurt me.
What's she doing?
Can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.
Run, you great lug!
This way, east to Queast.
No, south to Snud.
No. No, no. This way.
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.
- Did you?
- No, Your Majesty.
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.
(WHISPERING) Did you steal my tarts?
No, Your Majesty.
(WHISPERING) Squimberry juice.
- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to!
- Off with his head!
My family! Oh, please, please don't!
No! I have little ones to look after!
Go to his house and collect the little ones.
I love tadpoles on toast almost as much as I love caviar.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Drink!
Majesty?
Ilosovic Stayne, you knave, where have you been lurking?
Majesty, I have found the Oraculum.
That? Looks so ordinary for an oracle.
Look here, on the Frabjous Day.
I'd know that tangled mess of hair anywhere.
Is it Alice?
I believe it is.
What's she doing with my darling Jabberwocky?
She appears to be slaying it.
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?
Not yet, but it will happen if we don't stop her.
Find Alice, Stayne. Find her!
Find the scent of human girl and earn your freedom.
For my wife and pups, as well?
Everyone will go home.
Dogs will believe anything.
It looks like you ran afoul of something with wicked claws.
And I'm still dreaming.
What did that to you?
- Banner or Bander...
- The Bandersnatch?
Well, I'd better have a look.
What are you doing?
It needs to be purified by someone with evaporating skills, or it will fester and putrefy.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.
At least let me bind it for you.
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.
The Alice?
- There's been some debate about that.
- I never get involved in politics.
You'd best be on your way.
What way? All I want to do is wake up from this dream.
Fine.
Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.
Coming?
Watch what you're doing!
Hey, watch it!
Okay, okay. All right.
It's you.
No, it's not.
McTwisp brought us the wrong Alice.
It's the wrong Alice!
It's absolutely Alice.
You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.
I'd know him anywhere.
HATTER: Well, as you can see, we're still having tea.
And it's all because I was obliged to kill Time waiting for your return.
You're terribly late, you know. Naughty.
Well, anyway, Time became quite offended and stopped altogether.
Not a tick ever since.
- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.
Yes, yes, of course, but now you're back, you see, and we need to get on to the Frabjous Day.
- Frabjous Day!
- Frabjous Day!
I'm investigating things that begin with the letter "M."
(WHISPERING) Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- What?
- Down with the Bloody Big Head, the Bloody Big Head being the Red Queen.
Come, come. We simply must commence with the slaying and such.
Therefore, it is high time to forgive and forget or forget and forgive, whichever comes first or is, in any case, most convenient.
I'm waiting.
(CHUCKLES) Hey.
It's tick-tick... It's ticking again.
All this talk of blood and slaying has put me off my tea.
Ah.
The entire world is falling to ruin and poor Chessur's off his tea.
What happened that day was not my fault.
Oh, dear.
You ran out on them to save your own skin, you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering shukm juggling sluking urpal.
Bar lom muck egg brimni!
Hatter!
- Thank you.
- (EXCLAIMING) Meow.
I'm fine.
What's wrong with you, Tarrant?
You used to be the life of the party.
You used to do the best Futterwacken in all of Witzend.
- Futter what?
- Futterwacken!
It's a dance.
On the Frabjous Day, when the White Queen once again wears the crown, on that day,
I shall Futterwacken vigorously.
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
(GASPING) The Knave.
Goodbye.
MARCH HARE: Hide her!
Drink this quickly.
Quick! Hide her!
Oh, dear.
Aye.
Mind your head.
Let me out!
Well, if it's not my favorite trio of lunatics.
MALLY: Would you like to join us?
You're all late for tea!
We're looking for the girl called Alice.
Speaking of the Queen, here is a little song we used to sing in her honor.
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat
- How I wonder where you're at
- How I wonder where you're at
- up a...
- up a...
If you're hiding her, you'll lose your heads.
(HOARSELY) Already lost them.
All together now!
- up above the world you fly
- up above the world you fly
- Like a tea tray in the sky
- Like a tea tray in the sky
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Oh!
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
Would you like some cream?
- Would you like a slice of Battenberg?
- Follow the bloodhound.
- MALLY: Sugar?
- Yes, please.
- Oh, that's lovely.
- You're all mad.
Thanks very much.
- (CUP SMASHING)
- (ALL LAUGHING)
MALLY: Pass the scones, please.
- MARCH HARE: That one there.
- Oh! Pardon.
MALLY: Yes.
MARCH HARE: Yep, aye.
One moment.
There. Yes.
Try this on for size.
Oh.
I like it.
Good thing the bloodhound is one of us, or you'd be...
What do they want with me?
(EXCLAIMING) Wait a minute, best take her to the White Queen.
She'll be safe there. Spoon...
Your carriage, milady.
- The hat?
- Of course.
Anyone can go by horse or rail, but the absolute best way to travel is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?
(MALLY AND MARCH HARE
LAUGHING)
Oh, I love traveling by hat.
Mally. Just Alice, please.
Fairfarren, all.
What do you mean? Wait. Gae!
"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
"All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe"
Sorry, what was that?
What was what?
"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Jaws that bite and claws that catch!
"'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
And the frumious Bandersnatch! '
"He took his Vorpal sword in hand
The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
"He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back"
It's all about you, you know.
I'm not slaying anything.
I don't slay, so put it out of your mind.
Mind.
Wait! You can't leave me here!
You don't slay.
Do you have any idea what the Red Queen has done?
You don't slay.
I couldn't if I wanted to.
You're not the same as you were before.
You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.
My "muchness"?
In there. Something's missing.
Tell me what Red Queen has done.
It's not a pretty story.
Tell me anyway.
It was here.
I was hatter to the White Queen at the time.
Hightopp clan have always been employed at court.
Hatter? Hatter!
I'm fine.
Are you?
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.
What?
Oh! Red Knights.
Go south to Trotter's Bottom.
The White Queen's castle is just beyond.
Hold on tightly.
Down with the bloody Red Queen!
You were supposed to lead them away!
The Hatter trusted you!
They have my wife and pups.
- What's your name?
- Bayard.
Sit!
Would your name be Alice, by any chance?
Yes, but I'm not the one that everyone's talking about.
The Hatter would not have given himself up just for any Alice.
Where did they take him?
To the Red Queen's castle at Salazen Grum.
We're going to rescue him.
That is not foretold.
I don't care.
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.
You must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.
From the moment
I fell down that rabbit hole,
I've been told what I must do and who I must be.
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and stuffed into a teapot.
I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is my dream.
I'll decide where it goes from here.
If you diverge from the path...
I make the path.
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard, and don't forget the hat.
There's only one way across.
Lost my muchness, have I?
Bayard! The hat!
Your Majesty.
So sorry.
Splendid shot!
Where's my ball? Page!
Yes, Your Majesty.
(SHUSHING) I want to help you.
Well, if it isn't the wrong Alice.
What brings you here? Mmm?
I've come to rescue the Hatter.
You're not rescuing anyone being the size of a gerbil.
Well, do you have any more of that cake that made me grow before?
Upelkuchen?
Actually, I might have some left.
Not all of it!
Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!
Page!
Oh, dear.
And what is this?
It... It's a "who," Majesty. This is, um...
Um?
From Umbradge.
What happened to your clothes?
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.
So I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like.
My dear girl, anyone with a head that large is welcome in my court.
Someone find her some clothes!
Use the curtains if you must, but clothe this enormous girl.
I need a pig here!
I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet.
- Would you like one, Um?
- No, thank you.
Sit!
Sit!
Go away.
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.
Fat boys!
Oh. There they are.
Aren't they adorable?
They have the oddest way of speaking.
Speak, boys. Amuse us.
Go on.
(MOUTHING) No.
Speak!
- Is that being...
- No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.
Contrariwise, I believe it's so.
No, it ain't so, nohow!
I love my fat boys. Now, get out.
- He did pinch me.
- He did pinch me.
And who is this lovely creature?
Um, my new favorite.
- Well, does she have a name?
- Um.
I believe your name has slipped the Queen's mind.
Her name is Um, idiot!
From Umbradge.
Any luck with the prisoner?
He's stubborn.
You're too soft. Bring him!
We know Alice has returned to Underland.
Do you know where she is?
I've been considering things that begin with the letter "M."
Moron, mutiny, murder, malice.
We're looking for an "A" word now.
Where is Alice?
Who, that wee little boy?
(LAUGHS) I wouldn't know.
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?
Stop that.
What a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
- Hat it?
- Yes.
I used to hat the White Queen, you know.
Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear.
Her head is so small.
It's tiny. It's a pimple of a head.
But this...
What I could do with this monument, this orb...
Nay, this magnificently heroic globe.
What could you do?
Unbind him, Stayne.
How can he work if his hands are bound?
Well, then, shall it be a bonnet or a boater?
Or something for the boudoir?
Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif, snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke, cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau, bongrace, fan-tail, night cap,
Garibaldi, fez...
Hatter.
Fez?
Leave us.
The trees seem sad.
- Have you been speaking with them?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Perhaps a bit more kindly.
Would you all excuse me for a moment? Thank you.
- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.
- Where is she now?
- In Salazen Grum.
Forgive me. I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
No, no, no, no. But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
We have our champion.
Rest now. You've done well.
ALICE: Have you seen a hat around here?
You must find Alice, Stayne.
Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me.
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?
STAYNE: I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN: I know.
But Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
Men, women, even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it. He would have left me.
Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?
Not certain anymore.
Oh, let her have the rabble.
I don't need them.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be working at my trade again.
It's just a pity you have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
Hatter.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
I'm frightened, Alice.
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
Here.
That's better. You look yourself again.
RED QUEEN: Hat man!
Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.
The rabbit will help you.
Find it, Alice.
Take it to the White Queen.
We'll go to the White Queen together.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?
- Tweedles.
- Alice.
- How do you do, again?
- Where's the rabbit?
How is it you're being so great big?
She ain't great big, this is how she normal is.
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.
No, she drank the pishsalver to get through the door, recall it?
Oh, yeah.
- Where's the rabbit?
- BOTH: Over theres.
- MALLY: What are you doing here?
- I'm rescuing the Hatter.
I'm rescuing the Hatter.
He told me that the Vorpal sword is hidden in the castle. Help me find it.
I don't take orders from big, clumsy, galumphing...
Shoo!
- What is it, McTwisp?
- I know where the sword is.
The sword's hidden inside.
Be careful, Alice.
I know that smell.
I'm not going in there.
Look what that thing did to my arm.
Dear, oh, dear.
Why haven't you mentioned this?
It wasn't this bad before.
Hatter? Where are you?
Hatter?
Mallymkun.
Do you still have the Bandersnatch eye?
Right here.
- I need it.
- Come and get it.
Hey! Give it back!
I like you, Um.
I like largeness.
Get away from me.
I have your eye.
No.
Hmm.
MAN: You look stunning in that hat.
Yes. Next.
Your Majesty has never looked better.
Hmm. Another.
Oh!
I don't wish to alarm you, but it smells as though you might have dropped something.
Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.
Stayne!
(BANDERSNATCH
BREATHING HEAVILY)
I suppose this makes us even now.
Um forced herself on me.
I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me.
Off with her head!
Stand back, Mallymkun.
How's this for muchness?
No, no!
It mustn't be used for anything...
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
- Take it to the White Queen.
- I'm not leaving without you.
Go!
Run, Alice!
Alice?
Run!
Seize her.
Alice.
Of course. Why didn't I see it?
Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then.
- Give me the sword.
- Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
- Oh, Alice!
- Bayard! To Marmoreal.
Majesty, Alice has escaped on the Bandersnatch, with the Vorpal sword.
How could you let this happen?
I may have underestimated her, but we have her conspirators, the Hatter and a dormouse.
Off with their heads!
WHITE QUEEN:
Welcome to Marmoreal.
I believe this belongs to you.
Mmm.
The Vorpal sword is home again.
The armor is complete.
Now all we need is a champion.
You're a little taller than I thought you'd be.
Blame it on too much upelkuchen.
Oh.
Come with me.
Is the March Hare here?
(EXCLAIMING) You're late for your soup, you wee besom.
- You're late for your soup.
- Could use some salt.
Come here, you!
Give me that here.
Choppy, chop, chop, chop.
Leek and potato. Yes. That would be...
Pishsalver. Let me think.
A pinch of worm fat, urine of the horsefly, buttered fingers.
My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.
Tell me, how does she seem to you?
Perfectly horrid.
- And her head?
- Bulbous.
I think she may have some kind of growth in there, something pressing on her brain.
Three coins from a dead man's pocket, two teaspoons of wishful thinking.
You can't imagine the things that go on in that place.
Oh, yes, I can.
But when a champion steps forth to slay the Jabberwocky, the people will rise against her.
That should do it.
Blow.
- Feel better?
- Much, thank you.
There's someone here who would like to speak with you.
- Absolem?
- Who are you?
I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.
- How do you know?
- You said so yourself.
I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now.
In fact, you're almost Alice.
Even so,
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.
It will.
So I suggest you keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
You seem so real.
Sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.
Will you stop doing that?
I've always admired that hat.
Hello, Chess.
Since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.
I would like to look my best, you know.
It is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
I was rather good at it, was I not?
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
I love a morning execution, don't you?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself.
As long as I can get at your neck.
I'm right behind you.
Off with his head!
I can't watch.
Good morning, everyone.
Chess, you dog.
- (GASPS)
- Madam, you are being heinously bamboozled by these lickspittle toadies you surround yourselves with.
What is that?
I'm not the only one, Majesty. Look!
A counterfeit nose.
You should be ashamed.
Me? What about that big belly you're so proud of?
Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!
Off with their heads!
The abused and enslaved in the Red Queen's court, all of you stand up and fight!
Rise up against the bloody Red Queen.
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- ALL: Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
Release the Jubjub Bird!
You're right, Stayne, it is far better to be feared than loved.
Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!
Hatter!
Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on. Come on.
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.
It is against my vows to harm any living creature.
We have company.
Have a look, Bayard.
BAYARD: Bielle.
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...
So did I. But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece.
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size.
And it's a good size. It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!
- Hatter.
- Size. Fez. I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?
All healed.
Goodbye, sweet hat.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
Let me think about it.
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?
Frabjous Day. How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
- Still believe this is a dream, do you?
- Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
Yes, yes. But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
I must be, then.
I'll miss you when I wake up.
Who will step forth to be champion for the White Queen?
That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.
I'll do it.
- No, me.
- No, me.
No other slayer, nohow.
If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.
Alice, you cannot live your life to please others.
The choice must be yours, because when you step out to face that creature, you will step out alone.
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears.
Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
- You're going to die?
- Transform.
Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl.
I'm not stupid.
My name is Alice. I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.
He had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him.
I'm his daughter. I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
Alice, at last.
You were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
You called it "Wonderland," as I recall.
Wonderland.
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.
The Alice?
Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.
McTWISP: She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please.
Have some tea.
You're not Absolem,
I'm Absolem, stupid girl.
- What is this?
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee.
DODO: You'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
Cur iouser and cur iouser.
It wasn't a dream at all, it was a memory.
This place is real, and so are you and so is the Hatter.
And the Jabberwocky.
Remember, the Vorpal sword knows what it wants.
All you have to do is hold on to it.
Fairfarren, Alice.
Perhaps I will see you in another life.
- Hello, Iracebeth.
- Hello, Mirana.
On this, the Frabjous Day, the Queens Red and White shall send forth their champions to do battle on their behalf.
Oh, Racie. We don't have to fight.
I know what you're doing.
You think you can blink those pretty little eyes and I'll melt, just like Mummy and Daddy did.
Please.
No! It is my crown! I am the eldest!
Jabberwocky!
This is impossible.
Only if you believe it is.
Sometimes I believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
However, just at the moment, you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky.
Where's your champion, Sister?
Here.
Hello, Um.
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.
One, there's a potion that can make you shrink.
Two, and a cake that can make you grow.
So, my old foe, we meet on the battlefield once again.
We've never met.
Not you, insignificant bearer.
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.
That's enough chatter.
Three, animals can talk.
Four, Alice, cats can disappear.
Five, there's a place called Wonderland.
Six,
I can slay the Jabberwocky.
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!
Off with your head!
Kill her!
We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head.
How dare you? Off with his head!
Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against Underland are worthy of death.
However, that is against my vows, therefore, you are banished to the Outlands.
No one is to show you any kindness, or ever speak a word to you.
You will not have a friend in the world.
Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will.
Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne, you are to join Iracebeth in banishment from this day until the end of Underland.
At least we have each other.
Majesty, please! Kill me! Please!
But I do not owe you a kindness.
- STAYNE: Take off my head!
- He tried to kill me.
- Majesty! Please! Please!
- He tried to kill me.
- I offer you my head!
- He tried to kill me!
Oh, the Frabjous Day! Callou! Callay!
- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
- Will this take me home?
- lf that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.
But I can't.
There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do.
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will. How could I forget?
Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Fairfarren, Alice.
She left me standing there without an answer.
A case of nerves, no doubt.
- Alice.
- LORD ASCOT: Good Lord.
- Are you all right?
- What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.
I'll decide what to do with it.
You're lucky to have my sister for your wife, Lowell, and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.
There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.
You need to talk to someone about these delusions.
I happen to love rabbits, especially white ones.
Don't worry, Mother,
I'll find something useful to do with my life.
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream.
- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.
You and I have business to discuss.
Shall we speak in the study?
Oh. And one more thing.
My father told me he planned to expand his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo, but I don't think he was looking far enough.
Why not go all the way to China?
It's vast, the culture is rich, and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.
To be the first to trade with China, can you imagine it?
You know, if anybody else had said that to me,
I'd say, "You've lost your senses."
But I've seen that look before.
Well, as you're not going to be my daughter-in-law, perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company.
Hello, Absolem.
Tripping out, spinning around
I'm underground
I fell down
Yeah, I fell down
I'm freaking out
Where am I now? upside down and I can't stop it now
Can't stop me now
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I found myself in wonderland
Get back on my feet, the ground
Is this real?
Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
Oh, Alice, dear, where have you been?
So near, so far, so in between
What have you heard?
What have you seen?
Alice, Alice, please, Alice
Oh, tell us, are you big or small?
To try this one or try them all
It's such a long, long way to fall
Alice, Alice, oh, Alice
How can you know this way, not that?
You choose the door
You choose the path
Perhaps you should be coming back
Another day, another day
And nothing is quite what it seems
You're dreaming
Are you dreaming?
Oh, Alice
Oh!
Oh, how will you find your way?
No time for tears today
No time for tears today
So many doors, how did you choose?
So much to gain, so much to lose
So many things got in your way
No time today, no time today
Be careful not to lose your head
Remember what the dor mouse said
Alice!
Did someone pull you by the hand?
How many miles to wonderland?
Please tell us so we'll understand
Alice, Alice, oh, Alice
Oh, how will you find your way?
RODRICK: (WHISPERING) Greg?
GREG: (GROGGILY) Mmm.
(IN SINGSONG) Greg?
What?
Greg !
Huh?
What?
What are you doing?
Get up!
Mom and Dad have been calling you for an hour.
You're about to be late for your first day of middle school.
What?
Oh, geez!
How did that happen?
Go, go, go!
Mom's about to flip out!
She sent me to get you while she waits in the car!
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Getting ready for. . .
. . .school.
Are you insane?
School doesn't start till next week.
And, FYl, school doesn't start at 4:00 in the morning !
You woke up Manny.
And if he doesn't go back down. . .
Good morning !
There is no way he is going back down. l just wanted to sleep till 6:00.
Bubby!
FRANK: Go to bed. l got him.
Greg, what are you doing up making all this noise? lt was Rodrick!
He woke me up!
He changed my clock!
But l swear, he was just. . .
Go to bed.
What is that smell? l can't even identify it.
Bubby!
KlDS: Happy Birthday!
Here, Bubby.
GREG: Wow! Look at the size of that flamethrower!
Okay, first of all, let me get something straight.
This is a journal, not a diary.
Yeah, l know what it says on the cover.
But when my mom went out to buy this thing, l specifically told her not to buy one that said "diary" on it.
This just proves
Mom doesn't understand anything about kids my age.
Huh?
Sissy!
The only reason l agreed to write in this thing is because when l'm rich and famous l'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day long.
Gregory, tell us about your childhood !
Were you always so smart and handsome?
Here's my journal.
Now, shoo, shoo.
SUSAN:
That's our boy up there.
Why did l ever say no to him?
Mom got me this thing so l could write down my feelings about starting middle school.
But l'm gonna be fine. lt's my best friend,
Rowley Jefferson, l'm worried about.
He's definitely not middle school ready.
Geronimo!
He's not quite clear on the concept of growing up. l want a puppy, a kitty, a gumball machine. . .
But anyway, this is about me, not Rowley. l always figured they'd make a movie about my life.
But l didn't think they'd start the story here.
Because, seriously, who wants to see a movie about a kid who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?
Three days, no shower.
Smell the love!
Let me go, Rodrick!
Come on.
We're just having some fun, right?
No, okay. So, look.
Mom asked me to give you some advice about middle school. lt's real simple.
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't look at anyone.
Don't go anywhere.
Don't sit down.
Don't raise your hand.
Don't go to the bathroom.
Don't get noticed.
Don't choose the wrong locker. Don't. . .
Who am l kidding?
You'll be dead or homeschooled by the end of the year, anyway.
And don't be seen with Rowley.
Manny, stop it! Mom !
RODRlCK: Thanks for the eggs, Mom.
Frank?
Greg? l think it's gross and undignified that l have to eat breakfast next to him on the potty.
Okay, well, it's your fault he's still potty training.
Don't look down, Manny.
The potty monster doesn't like it when you look at him. l was just joking with him.
Okay. Kiss him you're sorry and then let's get a move on.
Can't be late for your first day of school.
GREG: Let me just say for the record that I think middle school may be the dumbest idea ever invented.
You got kids like me who haven't hit their growth spurt yet mixed in with gorillas who have to shave twice a day.
There's juvenile delinquents and weirdos.
I'm smaIIer than about
95% of the kids at my school...
CHlRAG:
Give it back! Stop!
...so thank God for Chirag Gupta. lt's mine! Stop!
Can l have the backpack?
You got to jump higher. lt's not yours!
He's an exceIIent buffer between me and these morons.
Hey, Greg.
Hey, fella!
SeriousIy, I don't know what happened to these kids over the summer.
Was there a nucIear accident?
Science experiment gone bad?
Thank God there are a few normal people or this place wouId be a totaI freak show. lf you're as discriminating as I am, it can be tough to figure out where to sit on your first day of middIe schooI.
One bad move and you're stuck next to some idiot for the rest of the year.
ROWLEY: Greg !
Remember how I said
Rowley wasn't middle school ready?
Well, there you go.
What are you wearing?
My family just got back from Guatemala! lt's my serape!
Nice, huh?
All right, class, l'm Mrs. Flint.
Everybody take your seats!
Welcome to your first day of middle school.
Remember your seats.
You'll be sitting here every day.
Rowley, if you had to say where you were ranked in terms of popularity from one to 200, where would you put yourself? ls 200 good or bad? l'd say you're somewhere around the 1 54 mark. l'd put myself around number 1 9 or 20. l might even have a shot at the top spot by the end of the year, if things go the way l think they will.
Well, who's at the bottom?
Hey, guys, wanna see my secret freckle?
GREG: Fregley.
Sent home for hygiene issues at Ieast once a month.
Check it out. lt's got a hair in it!
What color is that?
You wanna help me name it?
All right, ladies!
Gather around !
Come on, put the knitting down !
Let's go!
All right, everybody. l'm Coach Malone and l am your gym teacher.
P. E. is as much a part of my life as waking up in the morning and going to the bathroom. l live and breathe
Physical Education.
Now, who's with me?
Are you ready to have some fun out there?
Yeah !
MALONE:
All right, outstanding !
So we're gonna divide you up into two teams.
So you two, over here.
You, you, you, this way.
Yeah, you three, this side. Good.
You guys are going to be Shirts!
And you will be Skins.
Why are we Skins? l hate this.
He's just trying to make kids like us feel bad.
What do you mean, kids like us? l just don't want to get a sunburn, right, Rowley?
My name is Bell E. Button.
What's yours?
Okay, let's start off with a little game l like to call Gladiator.
BOY 1 : l got this one!
BOY 2: No!
BOY 3: Take that!
Cover me!
Oh, God.
Not good !
We're never going to be able to outrun these guys!
We don't have to outrun them !
We just have to outrun Chirag !
Take a Iook, take a Iook, take a Iook
At the kids on the street
No, they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Think they saw us?
No way.
They were focused on getting that kid with the limp.
We'll hide here for the rest of the class because l'm not playing that game. lt's not fair.
He's got all the Neanderthals on the same team. lt's barbaric!
ANGlE: lt's completely barbaric.
This place is an intellectual wasteland.
But, you know, it's nice to meet someone more interested in his mind than in his body.
You girls get to jump rope.
What are you doing hiding?
Avoiding the pain. lt all starts in middle school, you know?
You're not a kid anymore.
The coddling has stopped.
Kids are now separated by intelligence.
The weak are picked on.
And girls you've known since kindergarten won't even talk to you anymore.
Okay, well, sounds like you got it all figured out, so go back to your book.
This place is a glorified holding pen.
MALONE: All the way!
All the way!
You're like a machine!
ANGlE: lt's where adults put you as you make that awkward transition between child and teenager so they don't even have to look at you.
Hi. l'm Angie.
Great story.
We're gonna go now.
Why? This is a good spot. lt's a perfect spot. l survived all of the sixth grade here.
And l would enjoy some like-minded company to get me through the seventh. ls that the whistle? l think l hear the whistle.
We need to go.
MALONE: No showboating, all right?
Why are we leaving?
We could get killed out here in the open !
Put your shirt on.
They'll think we're on their team.
Besides, getting crushed is better than being seen with that freak job.
Trust me, you can't recover from social suicide. l never talked to a girl that long before.
Whoa!
Check that out. ls that cheese?
Stop!
Good God, man !
You almost got the Cheese Touch.
The what?
The Cheese Touch.
Nobody knows when or how, but one day that cheese mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.
Nobody knew who it belonged to.
Nobody touched it.
Nobody threw it away.
And so there it sat, growing more foul and powerful by the day.
Then one day, a kid named Darren WaIsh made the biggest mistake of his Iife.
Darren touched the cheese!
No, l didn't! l just looked at it!
Really!
CHlRAG: Darren had the Cheese Touch!
It was worse than nucIear cooties.
He became an outcast.
The only way to get rid of the Cheese Touch was by passing it on to someone eIse.
And so began the Cheese Touch Frenzy.
Friend turning on friend.
Brother turning on sister.
It was madness.
Until a German exchange student named
Dieter Muller took it away.
Dieter has the Cheese Touch !
Ze Cheese Touch?
Vat is it?
Vat does it mean, ze Cheese Touch??
Sadly for Dieter, that fact was lost in translation.
Nooooooooo......!
Thankfully, he moved back to DüsseIdorf and took the Cheese Touch with him.
And so the cheese sits, patiently waiting for its next victim.
Wow.
Wow.
This is a terrible place.
No doors?
None. l'm not pooping until l'm in high school.
GREG: The cafeteria, possibly the cruelest place on Earth.
But I was about to make some kid's day by sitting next to him.
That seat's saved.
For who? lt's saved.
That one's saved, too.
So not happening.
Uh-uh-uh.
Taken.
Where are we supposed to eat? l guess this is where all the cool guys hang out.
Fregley must have bumped his head when he was IittIe, like, really hard.
Okay, okay, so my first day could have gone better, but at Ieast
I wasn't humiIiated.
Hey, Greg !
You want to come over and play?
What did he just say to you?
Oh. l think my ride's here.
Hey, guys.
So this guy says to that guy,
"You wanna come over and play?"
Yeah ! Do you guys wanna play with us?
See? This is the probIem.
Right now l have to take abuse from these morons.
But in 20 years,
Quentin here will be working for me.
Greg, please don't fire me. l really need my measly, pathetic job scooping your dog's poop.
Whatever. l'll think about it.
No, no, no.
Vanilla on the bottom and chocolate on the top! l can't eat this!
"Play," Rowley? "Play"? l've told you, like, a billion times that guys our age say
"hang out," not "play."
Oops.
Seriously, if you're not gonna listen to me, just tell me,
'cause if you pull another stunt like that, we'll be stuck on the cafeteria floor for the rest of middle school. l found half a Snickers bar down there. l can't be the guy who eats off his lap in the cafeteria. l should be at the top of the food chain by now.
Something's got to change, fast.
My mom told me to just be myself and people would like me.
That would be good advice if you were somebody else.
Hey, little brother.
Was your first day as crappy as l said it would be?
No. Not at all.
You were wrong. lt was actually better than l. . .
Worse.
You didn't listen to me, did you? l told you not to talk, look or go anywhere, and what happened?
He had to eat his lunch on the floor.
Rowley.
(LAUGHlNG) Perfect.
And if nobody wants you sitting at their table, you think they want
Chummy Buttons over here? l was right. You're not even gonna make it out of there alive.
The only chance you have of making the yearbook is when they dedicate it to your memory.
So you wanna play
Twisted Wizard?
No. l have a better idea. lf he catches you in here, he will kill you.
Literally, kill you.
Don't worry.
As long as we hear the music, we're okay.
Whoa. Yeah. Wow. l didn't know Rodrick was into motorcycles. l found it.
Found what?
Rodrick's middle school yearbook.
This thing holds all the answers.
Rowley, this thing is like a bible.
See this? This is where a person like me needs to be.
The class favorites.
They're the best in their class.
These people aren't nobodies.
They're famous.
They don't have to worry about getting a seat in the cafeteria, either.
Check this out.
There's tons of things l qualify for.
"Most Likely To Succeed,"
"Best Looking,"
"Class Clown."
They should just give that to me right now.
Don't you have to be funny for that?
Hey! We could try for cutest friends!
What did l tell you would happen if you ever went in my room again?
But your band is still playing. lt's the bass solo,
Turd Burglar!
Don't you know anything about music?
Now, l came up here to get a new drumstick, and now, Greg, since Mom and Dad are gone, l'm going to kill you.
Literally, kill you ! l told you.
Beat it.
Okay, but l just want to say one thing !
Run, Greg, run !
What?
Let go, Baby Hippo!
You're gonna have to come out sometime, loser! l'll wait here as long as it takes.
And then, you're dead.
Time out, Rodrick. l have to pee.
(CHUCKLES) No time outs.
Only death !
But l really have to go.
Don't care.
Move over! l'm dying.
Got you !
Greg, did you throw
Manny off his. . .
What is going on?
Greg started it. l just came in here to take a shower.
He's lying !
He was gonna kill me
'cause l was in his room !
And so you peed on him?
Yes. l mean, no. l mean. . .
Yes.
Wow, there's a lot to sign up for.
You could be class favorite in a bunch of things.
Jazz dancing !
We could do that one together! l can't believe all these activities.
They're all so much work.
Staying after school, meeting before school, on weekends.
What kind of extracurricular activities are these?
Out of my way.
Who let you into this school,
Greg Heffley? l was thinking the same thing about you,
Patty Farrell.
You listen to me,
Greg Heffley. l'm running for student council president and l'm warning you, if you get in my way, l will beat you up, just like l did in kindergarten and fourth grade.
Fourth grade?
That one was ugly.
What's her problem?
What did l ever do to her?
Patty, Patty is a fatty, has a face just like a ratty!
Come on, that was pretty funny.
She needs to get a sense of humor.
And l need something to make me a class favorite.
ANGlE: What about class favorites?
Don't you ever say hi or hello before you start talking?
Hi.
Hello.
Oh, Greg's only here because he really wants to be something. . .
Rowley! l was just saying that l would really like to nail these people because it's so obvious that they're only doing these activities to get in the yearbook.
You know, l like your point of view.
You should sign up for the school paper.
We're the voice of the people.
Well, the people are mostly idiots, so l guess, technically speaking, we're the voice of the people making fun of the people.
Thanks, but l can't be on the paper because l'm gonna be in the paper a lot.
So that would be a conflict of interest.
You're the people.
Got it.
Do you believe me now?
That girl is crazy town.
Look! They have wrestling !
That's it! l'm great at wrestling. l've watched it for years, l know all the moves.
Tombstone piledriver.
Chair shot.
Vader Bomb.
AUDlENCE: Heffley! Heffley!
Heffley! Heffley!
Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!
Okay. Something is very wrong here.
These don't look like wrestling costumes to me.
Welcome to wrestling, you future Olympians!
So, just to make sure we all get off on the right foot and nobody gets seriously injured, we're gonna teach you a few basic moves.
Remember, this is about learning the sport and having fun !
All right. lt's not a competition because everyone here is already a superstar to me.
Coach Brewer, can you step over here for a moment, please, give me a hand?
Thanks.
That's known as a speed takedown.
Nice job,
Coach Brewer.
Can you get up and come behind me?
Put one arm over my shoulder?
Let's go, yeah.
You got it, walk it off, come on.
That was known as the arm drag.
Let's give Coach Brewer a hand, everybody!
He's fine.
Yeah, Heffley.
What about piledrivers and Vader bombs?
That is fake wrestling.
This is real wrestling !
Let's go! lf l have to wrestle
Benny Wells, he'll kill me!
MALONE: Let's move! Come on !
Okay, to keep things fair, l've divided you into weight categories by your size, so Rottweilers over here.
Bulldogs, you stay right there.
And we got two
Chihuahuas. Yeah.
Nice head gear.
Thanks. My mom let me borrow it.
All right, let's see what you got.
Don't worry, Fregley, l'll take it easy on you.
Hey, l wasn't ready!
Nobody's keeping score, but that was a sweet speed takedown, Fregley!
This is fun,
Greg Heffley!
Get off me!
ALL: (CHANTlNG)
Fregley! Fregley! Fregley!
Blow the whistle, blow the whistle!
All right! Fregley!
Outstanding !
And let's. . .
Let's hear it for our other winner.
Yay, Greg ! l can't lose to Fregley again. lf l get beat by the weirdest kid in school, nobody's ever gonna let me sit at their table.
How are you going to beat him? lt's like he had superhuman strength ! l'm not gonna beat him. l'm gonna gain
1 0 pounds this week so l can move up to the Bulldog weight class.
And then you and l can wrestle each other.
Ready?
Can l throw at you now?
Later.
You're better at riding than l am, and l'm a better thrower.
Greg, save some for everybody else, honey.
GREG: Can't. l need to bulk up.
Why? l think your body looks beautiful just the way it is. l heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?
Why would you sign up for something you don't have to do?
You signed up for wrestling?
Kind of.
You never sign up for anything at school.
You fly below the radar.
That way you never raise anyone's expectations.
Thank you, Rodrick, for those words of motivational wisdom, but perhaps a better way to look at it is that it's a chance to learn to excel at something.
Well, what could l learn at school that l can't teach myself?
Well, Greg, l think it's great that you took the initiative to learn something new.
This is like the first step to responsibility!
My boss's son Will was smaller than you, but he built himself up with the weights!
Yeah.
We could get you the same equipment.
You could train, get the right nutrition, cardio.
You'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.
And it would only take, like, three months.
Three months?
Yeah. l'll just stick to eating.
Well, l don't know where you put it, Heffley, but you gained 1 0 pounds and joined the Bulldog class.
Yes. l thought you didn't gain any weight this week.
My mom's ankle weights.
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.
What? But this is boys' wrestling.
Ever hear of Title lX?
Her parents threatened to sue, so you show her what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.
Come on ! What you waiting for, huh?
Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.
Make your move!
She's a girl !
Where do l grab her?
Stay down !
Patty, over here!
Get off of me!
Can l wrestle somebody good now?
Well, look who's in the paper.
Greg ! You're famous!
Right on the front page!
And if l would have pinned her, which l could have done easily, you know l would have gotten in trouble for hurting a girl.
Why does she even want to wrestle?
Who knows?
Girls are very confusing.
Like today, l heard someone in the hallway say that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?
A butt can't be cute. lt's a butt. l know, but that's what they were saying. l don't see why girls our age can't talk just like regular people.
So how are you gonna become a class favorite now?
Two words.
Best Dressed.
How are you going to do that?
Fashion is easy.
You wear a shirt and a tie, and kids are impressed. l'm telling you, this is gonna work.
(SlNGlNG) l light 'em up before the motor starts l go so fast that l could never stop
Look under the hood but you don't know what l got l'm a moving violation, baby
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Ta-da! l told you l was wearing this. l know! l wanted to be matchers!
BOY: Check them out!
ALL: (SlNGlNG)
Greg and RowIey sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes Iove...
GREG: You know, maybe Rodrick was right about Rowley.
Maybe l do need a new best friend.
But l can't just ditch him. l mean, if anybody has a better idea,
I'd Iove to hear it.
NARRATOR: ln this school, much like your own, one boy is about to learn an important lesson about seIf-worth and esteem.
Gag me with a spoon.
That guy is so unpopular,
I'd hate to be him.
Why doesn't anybody like me?
BROCK: Maybe because they don't know how awesome you really are.
Brock Branigan P.l.!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to soIve the case of the boy who just needed to be himseIf.
So go for it!
Show them how awesome you really are!
Hey, guys.
Do you like break dancing?
That is totally rad!
Wicked.
You shouId sit with us at Iunch, friend.
Sweet! lt really is awesome to be me!
Thanks, Brock.
Okay. Let's talk about what we've learned.
GREG: l don't know about anyone else, but I know what I Iearned.
It is awesome to be me.
The problem with Rowley is that he's not enough like me.
I can't ditch him
'cause he'd be Iost without me.
But maybe l can fix him.
Because that's the kind of friend I am.
What are you doing?
Making your clothes more middle-school friendly.
Look at this stuff.
Too babyish and weird.
Too "Why don't you just punch me now?"
What are you, a foreign exchange student?
Oh, man.
This one we burn.
That was a present from my mom.
Well, then your mom is trying to get you killed.
Ready?
Steady. Go.
No, no, no.
You look like one of the Seven Dwarfs.
You only need one strap.
One strap is cool.
But there's two straps.
Why would they put on two straps if you're only supposed to use one?
Because the guys who make backpacks aren't cool. lf they were cool, they'd give it one strap, like the cool one-strap guys do.
You know what has one strap?
Machine guns.
You know what else?
Electric guitars.
You know what else?
Purses?
But Joshie is cool.
Rowley,
Joshie is not cool.
He's a lip-synching pop star whose fans are eight-year-old girls.
You're just jealous that l was the one who discovered him.
Who are you gonna listen to, Rowley?
Me or Joshie?
Joshie says to respect your parents and follow your dreams.
Then Joshie must get beaten up a lot.
You actually almost look as good as me.
Am l great at this or what?
There's Bryce Anderson.
Just be cool.
Hey, Bryce.
Yeah, hey, Bryce!
Cute butt!
You're killing me, you know that?
Look, Rowley, tonight's Halloween, our favorite night of the year, so, just promise me you won't wear, do or say anything weird.
You're kidding me, right?
(SlGHS) My mom wanted me to be visible at night.
From space?
So, we'll hit a few houses on the way to the North Side, which is where we'll do most of our trick-or-treating.
Why are we going all the way over there? lt's where the rich people live.
They hand out, like, two, three pieces of big candy to each kid.
Not that candy corn crap. l'm talking about full-size Milky Ways and Nutter Butters.
Plus, if we time it right, rich people get tired of answering their doors and just leave the bowl out.
We can clean up.
ROWLEY: Wow, you're lucky.
My mom doesn't let me play with makeup anymore.
Shut up, tool.
Löded Diper's got a gig tonight.
Mmm.
Going to the North Side, huh?
Takes you right past the Devil Worshiper Woods.
The Devil
Worshiper Woods?
You know about that story, right?
Well, there used to be this house right here where these woods are.
They had to tear it down because what happened there was so terrible.
What happened there?
Well, a long time ago, two kids who were, l don't know, maybe in middle school, they trick-or-treated at that house on Halloween night.
But the house was full of devil worshipers who put the kids in these giant pizza ovens.
And they cooked them and they ate them.
But they forgot to turn off the ovens.
So the house burned down with everyone in it.
How'd the trees get there?
And then they planted trees.
Oh.
And to this day, on Halloween night, you can still hear the demonic laughter of the devil worshiper ghosts as they roam the woods, looking for more kids to sacrifice!
Hey, Rodrick. l need you to help me out. Like. . .
Are you wearing eyeliner?
KlDS: Trick or treat.
Susan ! l'm on door duty!
GlRL: Thank you.
Bubby!
Mom, can you tell him to stop calling me that?
What if somebody hears?
Then they'll know how much he loves you.
Frank, Frank, honey, honey, can you go with them?
No, l can't. l got to guard the house in case someone tries to T. P. us.
They're gonna get drenched from the roof.
Honey, for goodness sakes, don't do that again.
Remember what happened last year? l got you !
Hi. l thought they were teenagers.
And l couldn't see through the bushes.
My legs, they hurt from the squatting.
So, that's why l'm doing it from the roof this year.
So l can see when they're coming.
Can we go now?
Yes, go.
But stay in the neighborhood.
KlDS: Trick or treat.
And no North Side!
We promise!
GREG: We got to stay in this neighborhood the rest of the night.
That guy gave me two full-size Snickers!
Did l tell you or did l tell you?
These people have money to burn !
(LOUD ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG

ROWLEY: l can't believe we got this much candy.
This is, like, the best day ever.
CARTER: Hey, reflector dude, nice costume!
Thanks!
My mom made it. . .
CARTER: Oh, that was awesome! l saw your plates!
We're calling the cops!
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Run !
CARTER:
Hey, they're going through the yard !
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Where are we going?
We're totally exposed !
My grandma's house!
Quickly!
They're coming !
Hello?
That's not helping !
She's not home!
Bingo night.
CARTER: Okay, you guys are dead.
ROWLEY: Open the door!
Get the key!
GREG: Okay. Okay.
ROWLEY: Open the door!
Get it!
Come on, let's get them, boys.
ROWLEY: They're coming !
ROWLEY: Now!
CARTER: Oh, l got you now!
PETE: Hey, hey!
Come on, you babies! l'm gonna kick your butts!
Yeah? You and what army?
Whatever.
You guys are so lucky you can hide in there behind your mommy!
No, we aren't! lt's not our house! lt's his grandma's and she's not even home!
What? Why would you tell them that?
CARTER: (SOFTLY)
Did he just say that?
Oops.
Now they're never gonna leave.
You need to call your mom to come get us.
Mine'll kill me if she knows we're here.
Mine will, too.
She thinks you're a bad influence.
She's right.
Then we're gonna have to bust out of here.
PETE: You have any threes?
Go fish.
Hey, what's that?
Danger, danger
High Voltage
Danger, danger
High Voltage
Just back off! l don't want to hurt anybody, we just want to walk away and forget this ever happened.
Nobody needs to be a hero! Whoa!
Are you kidding me? l'm gonna rip off your arms and punch you in the face with your own fists!
They're gaining !
This way!
The Devil Worshiper Woods!
No way!
PETE: Hey! Stay right there!
We're gonna get you !
(PANTlNG) They're going into the woods.
(PANTlNG) No, no way l go into Devil Worshiper Woods.
Uh-uh.
This isn't over!
ROWLEY: l'm really scared !
Just keep running !
ROWLEY: Did you hear that? lt's the devil worshipers.
Guys?
Are we safe?
Yeah.
And we made it with still a ton of candy.
Sorry. l was. . . l thought you were teenagers.
BOY: Maybe next year, Pops!
Hey!
So anyone eIse exhibiting symptoms of pink eye shouId contact the nurse immediately. ln field trip news, consent forms are going out today for our annuaI
History of Plumbing excursion. ln sports news...
I think Shelly is looking hot today.
BOY: Yeah.
Are they talking about me? l don't know. l don't speak Russian.
And finally, some positions have opened up for the Safety PatroI. lf anyone is interested, see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.
GREG: Now that's what l'm talking about.
Safety PatroI.
The cops of middle school.
You boss people around, report the jerks, and miss cIass three times a week.
MR. WlNSKY: Safety Patrol is a sacred trust.
When you put on this vest and that badge you become a protector of the weak.
You become an enforcer of the laws of this school, because today's litterer and jaywalker is tomorrow's window breaker and graffiti vandal, and it's our job to stop it.
So l ask you, are you up for the job?
Yes!
Yes!
Then welcome to Safety Patrol.
Just remember, with great power. . .
Whoa.
. . .comes great responsibility.
Now, you get your first assignment just after lunch, so you'll be excused from the first 20 minutes of sixth period.
But that means we'll miss Algebra. . .
Ouch !
Do we get free stuff?
Free hot cocoa.
Could this day get any better?
Whoa, is that cocoa?
Sorry, Safety
Patrol only.
Sorry.
You rejected the school paper, but you joined the Safety Patrol?
Look, are you working your way down the evolutionary ladder?
What?
Look, Safety Patrol is the lowest of the low, the geekiest of the geeky, the lsland of Misfit Toys.
You're just jealous they don't trust you to keep our school safe.
Now if you'll excuse me, l need to secure the perimeter.
GlRL: l'm hungry.
GREG: Keep it straight, people.
Single-file line, one by one.
(ROCK MUSlC BLARlNG

Greg ! lt's those guys from Halloween !
What do we do?
Come on, man, just pull my finger. l swear to God, l'm not gonna do anything.
Everybody, shoulder to shoulder.
Shoulder to shoulder.
GREG: Go. Go!
Whoa, whoa.
That was close.
Too close.
GREG: lt's times like these that make me reaIize
Rowley's pretty lucky to have me as a friend.
ROWLEY: And l got
Twisted Wizard Two, and a new bike!
And we're going to take a family trip to New York City for New Year's Eve!
What did you get?
My dad got me a weight-lifting set.
Do you know how many video games l could've gotten instead? l had to get out of there before he expected me to, like, use it.
Anyway, let's play some Twisted Wizard Two at your house.
Probably not a good idea.
My dad's still annoyed at you.
For what?
Remember that secret language we made up last week?
Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa like-pa a woman-pa. l think he cracked our code.
We should probably do something outside.
Why can't you ride and l throw at you first?
My legs kind of hurt from walking over here.
Okay, Rowley.
Come on. Get up.
Shake it off.
Are you sure the doctor was right? lt really didn't look that broken to me.
Yeah, it's broken.
The X-ray never lies.
Oh, my gosh.
What happened? l broke it.
SHELLY: How?
Big Wheel accident.
You're funny.
Can l sign your cast?
Me, too. l wanna sign it, too.
Why, sure.
Hey, l'm the one who broke his hand.
Then you're a jerk.
(WHlSPERS) Sorry.
GlRL: Does it hurt?
SHELLY:
Rowley, you're so funny.
After l stood. . .
GREG: l couldn't believe it!
Rowley was eating at an actuaI tabIe because of something l did!
Where's my credit?
And he's right handed!
He can feed himself just fine.
So, how's that class favorite thing working out for you?
Great.
I reaIized
Rowley's injury thing was a pretty good racket.
MARLEY: lt's gonna be so much fun.
Hey, guys.
Check it out.
Oh, my gosh, what happened? lt's a raging infection caused by a splinter that was left untreated.
Want to be the first to sign my sympathy sheet?
No. l'll sign it, Greg Heffley, if you'd let me look at your infection.
ROWLEY: And on the X-ray, you could see where the bone just snapped right in half. l had the exact same break last year, and it got all purple!
ROWLEY: Cool !
Mine, too!
Hey, Gregory, want to sign the card?
You got
Rowley a card?
What? No, it's for
Bryan Little.
You know, the guy who writes the Wacky Dawg cartoons for the school paper?
He has mono and he's going to be out for three months.
That really stinks.
So, just out of curiosity, who's gonna do the cartoon?
They're having tryouts, but the important thing is Bryan gets better.
Absolutely.
GREG:
Bryan Little getting mono was destiny.
I draw cartoons aII the time. l'm gonna win this. l decided to go ahead and forgive Rowley for milking the broken hand so hard and I toId him he couId work on the cartoon with me.
So, l was thinking we could do something like this!
Oops, I stepped in a puddle!
At Ieast it's not an acid puddle.
Oy, oy, oy! lt is an acid puddle!
Zoo-wee Mama! lt's the same joke every time.
Yeah ! Zoo-wee Mama!
We can't just do the same thing over and over.
We can if it's
Zoo-wee Mama. lt has to be a little more sophisticated.
GREG: (lMlTATES CRElGHTON)
I wonder what is in this cute IittIe box.
GREG: (lMlTATES
CRElGHTON'S FRlEND)
It's not a box, it's a brick, you dumb moron.
GREG: (lMlTATES CRElGHTON)
Oops! I've been trying to open it all day!
Can he say,
"Zoo-wee Mama"?
No, it's not funny.
Well, l think it is. l like Zoo-wee Mama.
You know what? lf you like it so much, then why don't you go do it yourself?
Okay. l will.
See you.
Hey, l forgot my raincoat, so l'm gonna need you to walk the kids home today. l can't. l can't get my cast wet.
You can borrow my coat.
GlRL: Where's Rowley?
He couldn't get his cast wet!
He walks us better!
Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh !
Space monsters!
They're going to eat us, unless we can get into that hole!
Come on, people, move it!
Now, people!
We're gonna get eaten !
Come on ! Don't worry! l'm right behind you !
Whoa!
Go!
Hey!

Yes, Mrs. lrvine!
Sorry, kids!
Are you going to eat us?

And now, what you've all been waiting for.

And the winner is
"Zoo-wee Mama" by Rowley Jefferson!
What?
That is funny!
BOY: Great job.
Zoo-wee Mama.
GREG: l couldn't believe it.
Am l the only one who gets comedy?
Rowley, will you put me in your cartoon?
Sure.
And me, too. l want to be the one who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."
You got it!
Hey, Rowley, congratulations.
Thanks.
No problem.
You know, l read all the submissions and yours was by far the best. l read yours, too.
BRYCE: Hey, Rowley.
Hey, Bryce.
Yeah, hey, Bryce.
Hey, fella.
Wow. Everyone knows me now. lt's like l'm famous! lsn't this great?
Yeah.
Rowley Jefferson? l need to see you in my office, now.
MR. WlNSKY: l just took a call from a Mrs. lrvine about what happened to the kindergarteners last week.
She was very upset.
And so am l.
What?
You violated the sacred trust.
This. . .
This badge is supposed to mean something, and you just spat on it. l can barely even look at you. l really don't. . .
Just save it.
You are officially suspended from Safety Patrol.
And l expect a full apology to the kindergarteners.
Yes, sir.
Hey. What did he have to say? l'm kicked off. l don't even know what he's talking about.
Rowley?
What?
Nothing.
You've been home for an hour and haven't badgered me for any snacks.
Are you feeling okay?
Well, l'm kind of in a tough situation. l know something and if l tell the truth about it, it could hurt somebody.
But if l don't, it could hurt somebody else.
Well, you have to trust your gut and try to do the right thing, because it's our choices that make us who we are.
Okay.
GREG: l was up all night, tossing and turning, thinking about my mom's advice.
And l finally decided to do the right thing. l'm sorry l terrorized you, children.
What? l decided to let Rowley take one for the team.
But l'm not entirely sure that was the right call.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, l was pretty upset about being suspended from Safety Patrol, but then l just started drawing a bunch of Zoo-wee Mamas and l felt better.
Look. l put you in this week's cartoon.
And you even get to say,
"Zoo-wee Mama."
Wow. That's really nice.
So, listen. lt's kind of funny, you know, the whole Safety Patrol thing.
Yeah?
Ready for the funny part?
Well, l'm the one who terrorized those kids!
What?
Yeah, and l think we can both learn some valuable lessons from this.
Like, l should be more careful what l do in front of
Mrs. lrvine's house.
And you, well, you should be more careful who you lend your coat to.
You know what, Greg?
You're not a good friend.
Whoa. How could you even say that? l'm a great friend. lf you were a great friend, you would have told
Mr. Winsky the truth.
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad about just. . .
You only care about yourself.
You hated my cartoon.
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.
You broke my hand and you didn't even seem sorry.
That broken hand was the best thing that ever happened to you !
Don't call me.
Don't come by my house.
We're done. l thought the whole thing wouId bIow over.
But Rowley was still giving me the siIent treatment.
Even when I tried to make the first move.
Yeah.
So, anyway, l was so angry at him, l didn't know what to say.
MR. WlNSKY:
One of the kindergarteners finally told their parents the whole story.
Greg? You're relieved of your Safety Patrol duties, effective immediately.
Rowley, for showing dignity under false suspicion, l am promoting you to team captain.
Now, that's a position that l held for two years. l know you'll honor it.
(YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE MY FRlEND PLAYING)
Okay
You're supposed to be my friend
We're supposed to get along
Hey, you're supposed to be my friend
Hey, Rowley, my mom says it's okay for me to sleep over tonight.
Awesome!
GREG: The whole thing with Rowley is, l was willing to let bygones be bygones.
But then he made friends with CoIIin just to mess with me.
As if I even care if he...
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.
There's no going back, Sergeant. l need to board the helicopter.
Do you have my back? l will always have your back, Captain.
Yeah, maybe l'll meet up with some friends
Yeah, maybe l'll meet up with some dogs
'Cause you're supposed to be
You're supposed to be
Supposed to be my friend
You're supposed to be my friend now
Hey.
Hey, Greg Heffley.
So, l was thinking maybe you might want to have a sleepover?
Yeah. With who?
Me.
Yeah, when?
Now.
Greg Heffley, l love you !
We are going to be best friends forever!
Wanna have a tickle fight?
Okay.
Let's get inside.
FREGLEY: l can't believe it!
Greg Heffley's in my room !
Greg Heffley's in my room, Rebecca.
What do you want to do,
Greg Heffley?
How about Twister?
GREG: l'm not really that much of a Twister guy.
Candy!
Wait!
No, no, no!
Fregley, come on ! Really! l really think we should save those for later!
Maybe we should go outside and. . .
My mom doesn't let me have sugar.
She says high glucose in my diet induces hyperactivity.
But it's so good !
Greg Heffley, you want to jumpety-jump?
Yeah, you know what, Fregley? l just remembered, l have an appointment, a really important appointment. lt's a homework appointment.
Yeah, and l really should be going.
Get away from me! l can fly! Whoa.
How fun,
Greg Heffley!
Greg? Greg, Greg,
Greg, Greg, Greg?
Greg? Greg? l hear you breathing,
Greg Heffley.
FREGLEY: Dear Gregory l'm very sorry l chased you with a booger on my finger.
Here, l put it on this paper so you can get me back.
What?
All right.
GREG: Okay, enough. l'll show Rowley
I don't need him.
When he sees me in the yearbook as Most TaIented, he's gonna come running back.
Okay, since there are so many of you here auditioning, to save time, we're gonna do a group sing of one of my favorite songs.
Please refer to the lyrics on this handout. l will pick out the best voices and place you accordingly.
Greg Heffley, what a lovely soprano voice you have. l'm stunned !
Maybe you should be Dorothy!
No, no, l can't be. . .
No!
Greg Heffley was suspended from the school
Safety Patrol !
How can you trust him with the lead role in the play?
He can't be Dorothy! l'm Dorothy!
All right, Patty, calm down. l'm Dorothy! l am !
My mother is the president of the P.T.A.
She can ruin your life!
Just an idea.
All right, well, Greg, your voice is too high for any of the other male roles.
Perhaps you can be a tree!
A tree?
No way.
(WHlSPERS) The trees get to throw apples at Patty Farrell.
Haven't you seen the movie?
Wait, we don't get arm holes?
How are we gonna throw apples at Dorothy without arm holes?
You don't need arm holes because nobody's throwing any apples.
We're not doing the movie. ln my version, the trees sing.
These, my dear.
Down the winding yellow road
Doth she know to where it goes
With her dog so smaII and true
We hope she fares well
Yes, we do
ARCHlE: My tooth ! l think l knocked out my tooth !
Perhaps we should cut out some arm holes.
GlRL: ls he okay?
You think? lsn't this exciting?
Your son's in a play.
Yeah, sure. lt's not wrestling, but. . .
But at least it's something.
PATTY: Come on, Toto.
Let us explore this magical path !
Bubby!
Bubby! Bubby!
Bubby.
Hey, Bubby, l think you dropped an apple.
Huh?
(SlNGlNG) We three trees from yonder glen
Do spy a fair and sweet maiden
WhiIst we're rooted to our spots ln silver slippers she doth trot
Down the winding yellow road
Oh, yes.
Doth she know to where it goes
You're dead.
With her dog so smaII and true
We hope she fares well
Yes, we do
We three trees from...
From yonder glen !
Wish her joy through journey's end !
Sing !
BOY: This bites!
PATTY: Come on,
Greg Heffley!
Stop ruining the play like you ruin everything else!
Don't make me come over there and beat you up again !
Eat this!
Wow.
FRANK: What'd you think? l thought he was the best one up there.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
You know, l'm. . . l thought
Dorothy deserved it.
Thanks, Dad.
You got some good shots in there.
Look what l found in the trash.
Guess you threw it away by accident.
Give it back, Rodrick!
No way!
You want it?
Come and get it then !
Come on.
Give it!
Come on !
Use your muscular legs!
No, you can't have it.
Okay, okay, boys!
Give it back!
Hold on, don't you want it?
Okay! lt's for you. lt's an invitation for the Mother and Son
Sweetheart Dance. l knew you didn't want to miss that. lt looks like a lot of fun. l think you should go. l think it'd be a lot of fun.
GREG: Fun?
That's the exact opposite of fun!
This entire year has been terribIe and nobody even cares!
My family, my best friend.
WeII, I'm sick of it.
Somebody needs to pay.
Okay, Manny, l'm putting this Tootsie Roll in Rodrick's backpack. lt's for Rodrick, so whatever you do, don't touch the Tootsie Roll.
Mmm-hmm.
Greg? Coaster.
Where's he. . .
Manny?
Where did you get that?
Oh, my.
That's offensive.
Rodrick? Rodrick! l need to talk to you inside! Now!
Go ahead and talk.
We're a band and we have no secrets.
Okay, fine.
What is this? lt's not mine. lt was in your backpack.
No, it was in my room.
Does owning this magazine make you a better person?
No.
Did it make you more popular at school?
(LAUGHlNG) Yes!
No.
How do you feel about having owned this type of magazine?
Ashamed !
BAND MATE: Nice.
Hmm.
Do you have anything you wanna say to women for having owned this offensive magazine? l'm sorry, women.
Yeah, women.
Yeah.
You're grounded for two weeks.
Okay, settle down, Susan ! l think one week is plenty!
Make it four weeks and l'm gonna need the keys to your van !
My van?
Yeah ! Yeah.
Yeah.
ROWLEY: Hello?
HeIIo?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
All right, smile.
Look at this place!
Wanna dance?
Mom, stop dancing.
You're embarrassing me.
Come on. l'm just keeping time to the music. l'm begging you, please stop it.
Okay, okay, okay.
Thanks, honey.
Hi !
Well, if we're not here to dance, maybe you should go talk to Rowley. l think it's time you two made up. l can't.
Sweetheart, he's your best friend.
And sometimes, when somebody's worth it, you just have to put yourself out there. l wouldn't know what to say.
Well, l could go for an ice cream after the dance.
Maybe you could invite him to join us.
Yeah.
Hey, Rowley.
Hey.
So you want to go get some ice cream after? l'm sorry.
We already have plans.
Yeah. We do.
Oh, fine.
My mom wanted me to ask.
So l did. l didn't even want to go.
Well?
Honey, l'm sorry.
Yeah !
(SlNGlNG) Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around l'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because
I'm so versatiIe
StyIe profiIe, I said lt always brings me back when I hear, Ooh, ChiId
From the Hudson River out to the NiIe
I run the marathon till the very last mile lf you battle me
I wiII reviIe
People always say my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile
To step to me, l'm a rapophile lf you want to battle, you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exiIe
GREG: You have got to be kidding me.
BOY: Hey, what's up?
GlRL: Hey.
Hey.
So, l left my racing game at your house and Collin's sleeping over tonight.
So l need it back.
What? No way.
Finders, keepers.
You didn't find it, l left it.
Fine, then leavers, losers.
That's not even a real thing. lt is if l say it is. lt's my game.
Do you know what?
You wouldn't even have that game if l hadn't told you about it.
You wouldn't have half the stuff you have without me.
Yeah, like a broken hand !
That was a million years ago.
ROWLEY: lt clicks now!
Hear that?
Click, click, click, click.
And it's all your fault! lt was an accident!
Kick his butt,
Rowley! lt's easy.
Guys, Greg and Rowley are gonna fight.
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
PATTY: Come on, what's wrong with you guys?
Start punching !
You start.
You start it.
No, you !
Quit copying me!
This has got to be the worst fight ever!
Do something !
Well, well, well.
Look who we have here.
You're so freaking dead.
All you guys better scram or l'm gonna kick your butts, too!
Not you two.
You guys have no idea what l'm gonna do to you.
Oh, um. . .
What are we gonna do? l don't know.
We need to move this along.
My shift at Cinnabon starts in half an hour. l know what we're gonna do.
Give me the wide one.
That's you, let's go.
Pick it up.
But. . .
Pick it up.
Now eat it.
No!
Eat it or l'll shove the entire thing down your throat.
GREG: l don't even want to say exactly what happened because if Rowley ever tries to run for President and someone finds out what these guys made him do, he won't have a chance.
PETE: Now you.
But l'm allergic to dairy! l'll die, and then you'll go to jail ! And. . .
MALONE: Hey!
What are you doing on school property?
WADE: Go, go, go!
CARTER: Shotgun !
Pete Hosey, is that you?
You boys okay?
Yeah? All right.
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Oh, my God.
Rowley Jefferson ate. . . l ate the cheese!
Yeah. l ate it.
And you know what, people? l just did you all a huge favor. l ate the cheese to show you all how stupid this whole school is.
The wrong friends.
The wrong lunch table.
The wrong butt? lt's all meaningless.
Just like this cheese. l know it.
You all know it.
So come on.
Everyone else who's sick of it, step forward and join me!
Cheese Touch !
Greg Heffley has the Cheese Touch !
ALL: Run !
BOY: He's got the Cheese Touch !
Not bad, Heffley.
Not bad at all.
So you want to come over after school and play?
Yeah.
Okay.
PATTY: Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.
Thanks!
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.
Thanks, Patty.
Here's your yearbook.
You're not in it that much.
Maybe try to get out there a little next year.
You know what, Patty?
One day middle school will end and become high school.
And after that, it just becomes life.
And all those things you think are important now won't be anymore.
(SCOFFS) You wish.
(EXCLAlMlNG) As if!
Handing it to you is like touching you and l am way too smart to touch somebody who ate the cheese.
Rowley!
Have a great summer!
Stay cool.
Yep, you're way too smart for me, Patty Farrell.
So the year turned out pretty good.
My goal was to be a class favorite, and l made it.
Even if it wasn't exactly the way l planned it.
Zoo-wee Mama!
(WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME
PLAYlNG)
Hey! Oh!
I don't wanna waste my time again
By getting wasted with so-caIIed friends
'Cause they don't know me
But they pretend to be part of my social scenery
Hey, maybe l'm a critic, a cynic
Or am I jaded or am I afraid of it?
'Cause It's dragging me down lt's bumming me out lt's making my head spin round and round
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right, what do you want from me?
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right, what do you want from me? l get the feeling we're on to something l say jump and you start jumping
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right, what do you want from me?
Just another day in the Iife of me
It's 3:00 am, and l can't sleep
Maybe l'm a critic, a cynic
Or am I crazy?
Do they all hate me?
'Cause they pick me up and throw me down lt's making my head spin round and round
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right, what do you want from me?
Can you say, "Hey?"
Can you say, "Oh?"
That's right, what do you want from me? l get the feeling, we're on to something l say jump and you start jumping

Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city...
...eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing...
...and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time
I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies. No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo,
I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probably--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say
"bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did. Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know. Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay. That should do it. Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops. And....
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts,
Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine...
...you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
Look-- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--? Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see. And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?! How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait! You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir. That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think...
...of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh. It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra-- Smith. You have a vis-- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry. Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay. I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry. My work isn't--
My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea. Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read
The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I like to-- Me too.
-Ha, ha! Yeah.
Ranger Smith. At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time...
...and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really? Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks? Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi? Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right. That Yogi.
Bankrupt? No, no, no. We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes. Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes! Wow. Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay? Thank you.
Ugh. How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm. Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers...
...two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah. That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah. Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre...
...just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson...
...who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans. Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
-Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes. Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh. I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo. This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment. Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What? No. No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it,
Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-Really?
Yes. Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith! Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know
I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding. Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special. Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6. Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money...
...to cover its operating budget...
...can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
-I thought that went well.
-Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget? Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish. Yeah. Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are. But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today. But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right. Have it your way. Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh? Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week! Do I have time for that?
-Impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course! I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer...
...dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds...
...and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry. We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
-Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow. How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir. Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles...
...so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles? Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish,
I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh. Oh, that. Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now. Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying,
"Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned? What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special. People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope. It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi. Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours...
...to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear...
...it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand--
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir. Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'll drive. Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think
I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for llfe.
Try that with people...
...and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh--
If you want.
I mean, it's not that-- You don't-- It's--
You know, it's not a worry. Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did. Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really? Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate,
I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid...
...and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds...
...swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything
I could about the park...
...so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to
Extreme Jellystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi. Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament...
...and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi. That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep. But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in
With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right. We need something flashier than music. Not a problem.
I've got this water-skllng routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski...
...or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park...
...you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay. Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees? That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes. Exactly. Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes...
...the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right. Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant...
... but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary. There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-- No!
Oh, okay. Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah. That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh. It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park...
...which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah. Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says
I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues? Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second. Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No. Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your llfe as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid llfe choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay? Here's my card.
So long.
Hey. Now why is it doing that?
No. Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms. Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms,
$10 off today. Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait. Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea. Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay. Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning. I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried. All Iast night
I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor. Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys. Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored? But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program...
...but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel,
I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so...
...gushy. Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I...
...saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love
And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
Hi. Hello...
...and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you. It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable...
...and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo! Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skllng machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait. There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know. It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh? Fire!
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind. Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different. You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive...
...while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my llfe.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi...
...how smart are you now?
Hey, there! That was quite a show you put on yesterday. Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park. Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor! Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it. You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does...
...and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole llfe, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if
I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm Ieaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this. Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there. Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food. No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park. Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees. They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution...
... have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich...
...and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is. Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing. You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference. No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah. Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger...
...is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and
Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there,
Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements
I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo. I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo. You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing? I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is...
... I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo...
...get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone,
Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called
Evergreen Park.
That's right. In the city.
The city? That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it. Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it. Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles? I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi. We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma. Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want? I don't have a llfe left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends
I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One: light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love...
...whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try. Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do. Park is closed to the public until the press conference. Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone,
I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
-Mm-hm.
Oh, right. Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my. I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True. You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle. See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there. But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke. About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great. Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out. The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We’ll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No. A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is? Wow, I've never heard of that law...
... in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay. You know what? Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages...
...of having lived here since
I was a kid...
...is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh. Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight. My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you’ll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check. Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi. Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
-Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo. Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
-Here we go!
-Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We’ll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We’ll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We’ll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let’s go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha. Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right. You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging? The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they’ll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha. Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that. He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit. Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go. Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
Look, Boo Boo! We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
-Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up. Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you. Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
-Welcome aboard.
-Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it. You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on. Mr. Ranger said--
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that? I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
-Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi. Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know. It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and
I value leadership. I have a merit badge--
Can we talk Iater?
We're pressed for time.
Yes. Get in.
Boo Boo! Boo Boo! Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over. Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry. He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you’ll excuse me,
I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah? Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them
Bigfoot is here. Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what? I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city...
...why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time. Must be something we can do. Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--? Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people. Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this. Keep your eye on the little bear. Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown...
...proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No. No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay. No. Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
-We got it! Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
-Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are...
...and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay. All right, that's--
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general. I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle. And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi. Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of...
...the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming...
...intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides...
...I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
I....
Let's-- Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi! Hey! srt English Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMXI
Here's my day, so far.
Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked.
Pretty good.
Still, things could be a lot worse.
Oh, that's right, I'm falling to my death.
Guess they can't.
How did it all come to this, you ask?
My end starts at the beginning.
The very beginning.
Yes, that's me.
I had a fairly standard childhood.
I came from what you might call, a broken home.
Literally, broken.
I was eight days old and still living
How sad is that?
Clearly it was time to move on.
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.
And here is your binkie.
You are destined for ...
I didn't quite hear that last part.
But it sounded important.
Destined for, what?
I set out to find my destiny.
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.
And our glorious rivalry, was born!
Could this be what I was destined for?
A dream life filled with luxury?
Apparently not.
Even fate makes its favorite soup.
No big deal.
A much different fate awaited me.
A baby.
How thoughtful.
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.
Can we keep him?
A place that taught me the differences between right...
...and wrong.
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand, had life handed to him on a silver platter.
Our baby can fly.
- Yes, yes
- And that was not the best
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.
But I had something far, far greater,
My amazing intellect.
A knack for building objects of mayhem.
After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior.
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning.
At a strange place called shh-ool.
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.
He bought their affections with showmanship,
So I too would make this 'popped-corn' and win over those mindless dregs.
Lights out!
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.
Good receives all the praise, adulation.
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.
While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider.
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects.
And rehydrate them at will.
Someday's it felt like it was just me and Minion,
No matter how hard I tried.
I was always the odd man out.
The last one picked.
The screw-up... black sheep.
Bad boy.
Oh!
Was this my destiny?
Wait! Maybe it was.
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.
Then it hit me.
If I was the bad boy.
Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.
I was destined to be a super villain.
And we were destined to be rivals.
The die had been cast.
And so began an enduring epic, life long career.
And I loved it.
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.
He would win some, I would almost win others.
He took the name, Metro Man.
Defender of Montrosity.
I decided to pick up something a little more humble.
Megamind.
Incredibly handsome criminal genius, and master of all villainy.
MEGAMIND
Read on your own time. Open up.
Hey!
BOO!
Oh, good morning, Warden.
Great news, I'm a changed man.
And I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.
You're a villain, and you're always be a villain.
You'll never change.
And you'll never leave.
- You're fun.
- You got a present in the mail.
Is it a puppy?
From Metro Man. To count every second of your 85 life sentences.
That's funny, never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.
Oh but he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.
Any chance you could give me the time?
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum.
Oh no, looks like you're
By several thousand years.
Oh, am I?
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.
It's a beautiful day downtown where we're here to honor a beautiful man.
Metro Man.
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.
For years he's been watching us
Saving us with his super strength, and caring for us with his super heart.
Now it's our turn to give something back.
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.
Wow, okay, the stuff they make you read on the air.
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.
What I was trying to say was,
I can't believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news.
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we, like lets just get
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.
That's the first thing.
That's sweet of you.
And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby.
- Mmm.
- Okay, that sounded, Okay that
A little bit, yeah.
And you're making your face, and that's making me feel weird.
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying I'm in love with you.
I'm saying... Roxanne?
Roxaroo?
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.
- Freeze!
- Whoa, what are you doing, guys?
It's ME!
Hey, open up.
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.
You were right.
I'll always be a villain.
Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.
B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.
Bad to the bone.
Well hello good looking, need a lift?
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.
Get in the car, you.
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.
You got it, boss.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.
And... Metro Men.
Hey, Metro City!
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?
Give it to me... all right!
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.
Hey, Metro city.
Hello, hey.
You know, you actually want to bring it down a bit.
Boys, a little lower.
Thank you fellows.
Let's get real for a moment.
That's right, that's right ha, ha, that's right.
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.
Super cool, you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?
Do you really want to know?
Really?
Then I'll tell you.
The greatest honor you've given me is...
...letting me serve you.
To help these people of Metro city.
And at the end of every day.
Well.
I often ask myself.
Who would I be, without you?
I love you Metro Man!
And I love you, random citizen.
I tell you Minion, there's no place like evil lair.
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.
How do I look, Minion?
- Do I look bad?
- Disgustingly horrifying, sir.
You always know what to say.
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
Now, back to work.
She's awake,
Quick, to work.
- Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
- Would it kill you to wash the bag?
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.
Wha..why isn't she screaming?
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.
Like this... AHHHHH!
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.
AHHHHH!
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website, where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?
Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in...
Don't answer that.
...Romania.
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey reporter skills, on your weak little mind to find out all our secrets.
Such tricks... won't work... on me.
- Please talk slower
- Temptress.
What secrets? You're so predictable.
Predictable, predictable?
Oh, you call THIS predictable?
Your Alligators, yes.
I was thinking about it on the way over.
What's this? BOOM!
- In your face.
- Cliché.
No, look, watch.
Juvenile.
- Shuck it all!
- Tacky
- Oh, so sorry.
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?
- Garish.
Okay, the spiders new.
Spider?
Ee, Uh, yes!
The *spee..ider*. Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus
Will instantly paralyze... OW!
Get it off!
- Ow!
- Forget it Megamind. Your plans never work.
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?
OOOWWW!
It is a great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.
If you please.
Hey! Uh, my kid can't see.
- Megamind.
- Oh, bravo Metro Man.
Booooo!
Yes, I can play along too.
Booooo.
Should have known you'd try to crash the party.
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.
This is the day you and Montrosity, shall not soon forget.
It's pronounced Metro City!
Oh, potato, tomato, potato, tomato.
We all know how this ends.
With you behind bars.
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boots.
You will leave, Montrosity.
Or this will be the last you ever hear of,
Roxanne Ritchi!
- Huh?
- Roxanne!
- Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
- I'm not panicking.
In order to stop me, You need to find me first, Metro Man.
We're at the Metroman observatory.
Ah ha, no we're not!
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.
Metro Man approaching, sir.
- HAH!
- Hah, hah!
Hah, hah, hah.
Hold on a second.
Oh, good heavens.
You didn't think you were at the real observatory, did you?
Ready the death ray, Minion.
Death ray, readying.
Over here, old friend.
In case you haven't noticed,
You've fallen right into my trap.
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.
Even the most heartfelt belief, can be corroded with time.
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.
But metals can be melted by the heat of 're-vange'.
It's 'revenge' and it's best served cold.
But it can be easily reheated, in the microwave of evil.
Well I think your warranty is about to expire.
Maybe I got an extended warranty?
Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for it's intended purpose.
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand the full concentrated power of the... SUN!
FIRE!
Minion, fire...
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?
- Warming up, sir.
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?
One... sssecond... more.
Aaannnd.... jussst.
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap, tip top more.
And we are ready, in just.
Oh! I told you to have things running.
Told you out of the sounds.
Why do you always blame me?
My spider bite is acting.
Your plan is failing, just admit it.
Yeah, good luck with that one.
Whose side are you on?
The losing side.
- Thank you.
- Uh, could someone stamp my
You of all people, know that we discontinued that promotion.
- Ta, ta all.
- Same time next week?
What did he just say?
Crab nuggets?
Good lord, I'm trapped.
What kind of trickery is this?
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.
It, it has?
This dome is obviously lined with copper.
- Yeah, so?
- Sir!
Copper drains my powers.
Your weakness is copper?
You're kidding, right?
I don't think even he could survive that.
Well, lets not get our hopes up just yet.
- Look!
- Metro Man.
Metro Man...
Metro Man! AHHH!
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!
Ewwww.
You did it, sir.
I did it?
He did it.
I did it.
He did it.
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!
- You did it.
- I did it!
Montrocity is mine!
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.
All right people, hit it.
Hit it!

- Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.
- Drop 'em.
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,
I'm on the Highway to...
- Highway..
- La, la, la, la, la...
- Highway..
- Ahh, ahh, ahh....
First off, what a turnout.
How wild is this, huh?
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.
Are there any questions?
Come on..yes?
You in the back.
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us.
And the city.
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of.
And multiply it by... SIX!
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
Normal people do.
Let's just have fun with this, come on.
And I will get back to you.
Now slam the door, really hard.
They can... they can still see you.
- Now?
- Yeah, you're still there.
- Oh,
- Let's get going.
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.
Ahh, Minion.
Did you think this day would ever come?
No way, not at all, sir. Never, never in a million, not even...
Yes, I did.
Look at the intricate moon links.
I'm looking, I'm looking.
And what's this?
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.
But it seems to only carry one station.
Oh, that sir is called a window.
- Window...
- All the kids are looking through them.
Oooo, I've never had a view before.
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.
If my parents could see me now.
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out of the way.
I can have, everything I want!
And there's no one to stop me.
All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...
Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
We may as well go home, as I did on my own.
Alone again, naturally.
To think that only yesterday.
I was cheerful bright and gay.
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do, the role I was about...
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.
I understand you, little well dressed bird.
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't it. What's your vacuum like?
Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.
I'm in a heated existential discussion with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.
I... is something wrong, sir?
Just think about it.
We have it all.
But we have nothing.
It's just to easy now.
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.
- I mean, we did it, right?
- Well, you did it, sir.
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.
- Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
- Huh?
Unhappy.
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow, we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.
That always seems to lift your spirits.
Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?
- Him, sir?
- Nothing.
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh, something to consider and um, well, I think I'll just power down for a while then.
He was always there for us.
Dependable.
Perhaps we took him for granted.
Maybe we never really know how good we have it, until it's gone.
We miss you, Metro Man.
I, miss you.
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.
Are you happy now?
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero.
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.
Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas.
- 'Cause we're done.
- Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party at my house.
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really fell like being around a bunch of people.
No, no, no. That's why it'll just be, like you and me.
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.
- But,
- I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case, we were like something crazy happened.
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe we should have this for like ever, like a memory, you know.
Um, I'm gonna pass.
I have some work here I need to do. Okay, bye.
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?
- Goodnight, Hal.
- It's a soft yes, on Thursday.
What's, wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house? She's don't like bouncy houses, they like clown's.
OW! Ohhh!
Stupid van!
Broken finger!
I've made a horrible mistake.
I didn't mean to destroy you.
I mean, I meant to destroy you.
But I didn't think it would really work.
What are we suppose to do, without you?
I am so tired of running rampant through the streets.
What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?
Someone has to stop, Megamind.
Hey, we're closing soon.
Oh, you scared me.
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.
Bernard, I was just well I was talking to myself.
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.
Thank you, I just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I have so many evil plans in the works.
The illiteracy beam.
Typhoon cheese.
Robo sheep.
Battles we will now, never have.
You know we never had the chance to say goodbye.
So, it's good that we have this time now.
You know, before I destroy the place.
Nothing personal, it just brings back to many painful memories.
Hello, hello?
Roxanne!
That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?
- Megamind's head is not that grossly big.
Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...
Hello, is someone there?
Hello, who's there?
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.
It's just you, Bernard.
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.
Well thank you for letting me stay.
And thirty seven seconds if I were you.
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down with you then.
I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes.
Yeah, he was really good at those.
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.
I've looked into the reset button.
The size is impossible.
Bernard, I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you okay?
Metro Man is gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.
Oh, come on, Bernard.
As long as there's evil good will rise up against it.
Ohhh, I wish.
I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind.
- You really think so?
- Yeah.
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.
Hero’s can be made. That's it!
- All you need are the right ingredients.
- Yeah.
- Bravery.
- Yes.
- Strength.
- Of course.
- Determination.
- Imperative.
And a smidgen of DNA.
- With that, anyone can be a hero.
- Yeah!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
I think we should run.
Bye.
Time to put the past behind us.
Only the future... AHH!
Oh, that's to much.
I'm definitely scared right now.
Oh, hope no ones seeing this.
Create a hero? A what?
Why would you do that?
So I have someone to fight.
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.
A ying, with no yang.
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.
In other words, I have no purpose.
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on, ask.
How are you doing to do it?
I'm going to give someone, I don't know who yet.
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that someone to become Montrocity's new hero.
Over here, follow.
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.
We could put everything back the way it was.
When the world was perfect.
And rosy. Behold, Minion.
Metro Man's cape.
Look closely.
Tell me what you see?
Dandruff?
Yes, it's his DNA.
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.
Boss, I think this is a bad idea.
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad, bad.
Okay, you might think it's good in your bad perception.
But from a good perception, it is just plain bad.
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.
Now we have just one shot at this.
I must find a suitable subject.
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.
What on earth is that?
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.
- O-llo,
- Uh, it's hello.
Hello, like that?
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.
- It's Roxanne.
I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day.
- Oh, You've inspired me too.
- Great!
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.
- I'm already hot on his trail.
- Uh, huh.
And what gives you that idea?
- Uh, sir.
- I just found his secret hideout.
How did she find my hideout?
Uh, how did you find his hideout?
This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof.
Okay, there's no way she'll find the secret entrance.
Oh! There's a doormat here that say's 'Secret Entrance'.
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.
She'll discover all our secrets.
- Ohh, oh no!
- You dim-witted creation of science.
What? Oh, not you Roxanne.
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.
Roxanne?
Oh no, not again.
Roxanne.
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm glad you're here.
How did you get here so fast?
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.
- In a suit?
- Uh huh.
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.
But that's not important.
I better take the lead.
This way looks exciting.
No, it says, exit.
Uh, which is the abbreviation for 'Exciting', right?
It's the mother load.
- Ahh.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Just look at this thing.
You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.
- Really?
- You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?
- Yes, right.
- Together we could figure out his plan
Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!
- That's what I want to hear.
Minion,
Code-Send out the brain pods.
You know the whole point of a code is...
Oh code-just do it, Minion.
Ahh, it's me you fools!
Bernard!
It's daddy.
Megamind!
What have you done with, Bernard?
Bernard? Oh yes, I mean poor defenseless,
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!
You know the drill.
Oh no, not the drill.
- Let him go.
- Or what?
Or I'm going to find out what this weird looking gun does.
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.
I'll just go get him.
Unhand me you fiend!
It, it's strength's to much.
Oh, I work out.
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.
Are you okay?
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.
I got this covered.
Let go, it's mine!
Bernard, help!
Give it to me.
Oh no!
Roxanne.
Ow!
Who on earth is that?
Roxanne!
Bernard, you were right about that door being exciting.
This way.
- Huh!
- What are you doing?
This will stop them, here!
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.
Just throw it.
Daddy's, suffering.
- Wow, that was real exciting.
- Yeah.
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.
What's going on?
Hal, what happened?
I think a bee flew up my nose.
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you, when like fifty ninjas tried to attack me.
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...
- and they were all like crying, so.
- Wow.
Brave one, isn't he.
Who are you?
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.
- He's my partner.
- Partner?
Yes, yes partner.
Well look partner, I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's been through a traumatic experience.
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.
Yeah, okay.
I'd like that.
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you accidentally, okay lets end the meeting.
Sir!
Code-Did you find out who it was?
Huh?
Oh, oh.
Code-get the car.
Code-right away, sir.
- Buh bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hal.
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.
Who is this man, infused with godlike power?
Ow, ow, whoa ho.
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.
No criminal record.
Actually, no records at all.
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.
Not yet, Minion.
Not...
...Yet.
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?
So I will just go ahead and defuse him, since this is clearly a mistake.
No, Minion. Something much more powerful is at work.
This is no mistake.
It's destiny.
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.
Hal? Hal Stewart?
Am I saying it right?
Stewart.
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.
- Oops, all out.
- Well use the forget-me-stick.
Oh, right!
Just look at him.
Well, he doesn't look quite the hero type to me.
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.
I smell hero.
I smell something burning.
I think it's working!
Places, places...
You have your disguise?
What?
Ah, you look fantastic.
Rise, my glorious creation.
Rise, and come to Papa.
What's going on?
- Easy my child.
- Who are you?
I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice.
Honor, and nobility.
I am your father.
So you're like, my space Dad?
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.
And you are, what?
I'm your space, Step-Mom.
I, I had some work done recently.
Is this some kind of dream?
This is a dream come true.
You've been blethed with unfathomamble power.
What kind of power?
Unfathamomble.
It's un, without Fathom.
- Whoa
- Yeah, we've come to guide you.
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.
I know this is a lot to take in.
It may take months for you to come to grips..
No frickin' way.
Wahoo! Look at the big hero.
I'm a big hero.
Thee Minion, he's perfect.
Aaannd, action!
- Someone help me.
- I'm okay.
Sun is shinning in the sky
Ohhh, oh!
There ain't a cloud in sight
Zap, zap, zap.
Ha, haaa!
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay something cool back at me.
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.
No, no, no. Shut it down, and stop.
I said slow down.
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!
- Maybe we should change tactics?
- You think so?
Oh, you know how boys are.
They want video games.
I can throw a few parts together.
Can't... wait.
LoL, smiley face.
Can't wait for what, sir?
Oh, that was such a funny story.
And brilliantly told, by the way.
Okay, now you tell one.
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.
And, I never heard you laugh before.
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.
Mr. Blue, you did it right.
And, exit.
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind
I'll remember you this,
I'll remember you this way.
You don't get out much, do you?
Fun!
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.
It was one of my favorite things to do.
Now look at it.
It's a dump.
Hey Mr. Blue, we're so please to be with you.
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?
Um, well we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump, now... do we?
They're all back.
But how, why?
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.
Wa haoooo
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I, were never a couple.
But I thought you two were...
I know, everybody did. It's just, well he was never really my type.
Really?
Okay, now you tell me something.
Something you've never told anyone.
Well, in shh-school.
None of the other kids really liked me.
I was always last one picked for everything.
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't go to the same school.
Hal, I think you're ready for this.
Do I have a son?
No, Hal, you make me laugh.
It stretches, it's for you.
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?
Titan.
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?
It was the only name I could trademark.
Oh.
Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?
No not yet, but.
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.
That's very good. Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.
- All you have to do, is save her.
And she'll be yours.
- Who want's Churro's?
- I do!
Thanks spaced out, momma.
On the count of three, unsheathe your Churro.
One, two, three!
To Titan.
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind.
And the city will know your name.
The City's parks' restored to their original glory.
The street's, the safest they've been.
The banks reopened.
Has something happened to Megamind?
Has someone tamed this monster?
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic, but pleasantly confused.
Well you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.
Huh, how long is this going to take me?
Just a few alterations, sir. And I'll be done with your most terrifying cape yet.
I'm calling it, Black
Mambaaaaaaa... aaaa... aaa.
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am running late. I have to go.
What, where, where are you going, sir?
We have our date to battle Titan in the morning.
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to, run a quick errand.
You don't run errands.
What's going on here?
- What?
- Oh, wait a minute.
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
Fleur Du?
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?
Ahhh.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.
Your going on a date with her.
No my main man, get out of town.
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?
She will never find out.
That's the point of lying.
Ahhh!
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think this is your first day at being evil.
NO!
This has gone far enough.
Oh, that was really grown up.
Sir please, it's for your own good.
Well what do you know.
I may not know much, but I do know this.
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.
You heard me.
Who are you?
- Now give me the keys.
- NO!
My soul purpose in life is to look after you.
Well I don't need you to look after me.
What are you... what are you saying?
- You don't need me?
- Let me make it clear.
Code-I don't need you.
You know what, you know what.
Code-I'll just pack my things and go.
Code-Fine!
Code-Fine back.
Well good luck on your date.
- I will.
- That doesn't even make any sense.
I know.
I know I am so close, I can feel it.
Okay, okay I just have to take a step back.
Wait a minute.
Titan.
What's a Titan?
My super ears are burning.
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.
The names Titan.
- Titan?
- Your very own heroic guardian
What's your name? Just kidding, I know everything about you.
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,
Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed you know, all of them.
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.
- What do you want?
- Thought maybe we could go for a little
- Get to know each other first.
- WHOA!
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.
Just what do you think you're doing?
Oh are we moving to fast?
You're probably right. I should just rescue you a few times before we get
Whoops!
Saved that, You are lucky to have such a great hero here.
Somebody do something?
No wait, Duh! I gotcha.
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.
- Ahhh, building!
- AHHHH!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Gotcha!
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.
Put me down, right now!
Okay, all right, all right, hold on.
Are you crazy?
I suppose I'm, a little crazy... about you.
Who are you? Really.
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare to have your mind blown, little lady.
- Tada!
- Hal?
Yeah, isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.
No, it's not great.
Aww, our first fight. This is so us, we're like an old married couple.
There is no us, okay. There will never be an us.
But, I have powers.
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.
You are a good guy, Hal.
But you don't understand we need to find out why...
Right now, this isn't right.
- Listen to me, Hal.
- You're suppose to be with me.
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.
Hmm, not the only exciting development of the night.
Megamind's created a new hero.
And I know why.
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created a new hero to kick it for him.
But why, Hal?
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.
Wow, that's a lot to take in.
It, it boggles my mind.
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking who's butt.
But in the mean time.
Let's enjoy each other's company.
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right, you know, I could use a breather.
To, Bernard. For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world.
To... being normal.
- Roxanne.
- Yes?
Say I wasn't so normal.
Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color.
As a random, not a specific example.
Would you still enjoy my company?
Of course, you don't judge a book by its cover.
Or a person from the outside.
Oh, that's a relief to hear.
You judge them based on their actions.
Well that seems kinda petty, don't you think.
- You.
- What, what?
Oh, don't look at me!
Just, just a technical glitch.
Don't look yet.
My bad.
Where were we?
Now, now, hold on.
YOU!
I can explain.
What about everything you just said?
About judging a book by it's cover.
Well let's take a look at the contents then, shall we?
You destroyed Metro Man.
You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you.
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?
What could you possibly hope to gain?
Wait a minute.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?
No...
Okay Minion, you were right.
I was.... less right.
We should stick to what we're good at.
Being bad.
Minion...
You there.
Yeah, you.
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!
Okay, Titan it's time to go down, in style.
I hear there's a new hero.
Who dares to challenge my evil.
Where is the one they call, Titan?
Challenge me, if you dare.
Oh no, we're gonna crash.
This is embarrassing.
Ballsy and incipient.
Boneheaded, irresponsible.
RUDE!
Unprofessional, that's what this is.
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?
Of course not, he was a pro.
Hey, Megamind. You're actually the guy I want to see.
Also, there's a door here.
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying to beat this score.
Were you even planning on showing up?
What's this?
Where did you get all this stuff?
It doesn't belong to me.
You stole it!
- Pretty cool, right.
- Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.
Being a hero is for losers.
It's work, work, work twenty four seven, and for what?
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.
Roxanne Ritchi?
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb.
- Ohhhh
- Who needs all that noise.
That's why I think, WE should team up.
You? Wait! What?
With my power, and your big headedness, we could rule the city.
- You want to team up?
- I even drew up some new costume designs.
- See
- Costume design?
You have a brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume, or something.
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like two tanks sword fighting.
I can't believe you.
All your gifts all your powers, and you squander them for your own personal gain.
- Yes!
- NO!
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.
That's why I created you.
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
- Space Dad told me.
- Look, I'm your Space Dad.
You should be more like Metro Man.
You tricked me?
Oh, don't like that, huh?
Well there's more.
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.
- No.
- And we were smooching.
Mwah... Mwah... Mwah.
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna, gonna...
YES! Yes I know.
Break me in two. Oh god, how I missed this.
And the hero strikes the first blow.
But evil returns with a backhand.
YES!
Ahh... shhhh.
Come out you little freak!
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement.
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.
You little blue, twerp.
En Garde!
Oh, now that's the spirit.
Take, that, and again!
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter.
You go first.
Look I'm not sure where you're going at.
This one's for pursuing my girlfriend.
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.
And Megamind! This is for
Space, Step-Mom.
You lied to her!
Oh, well now, I thought that pummeling went really, really well.
I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?
- But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue.
- You're dead!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This isn't how you play the game.
Game over.
Great button.
I'm calling time out.
Time out, time out!
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from Copper. You're powerless against it.
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...
Metro Man?
You, should stop comparing me to Metro Man.
You run Megamind, but you can't hide.
We're saved, we're saved!
What's your name, new hero?
- It's Tighten.
- Thank you, thank you.
Tighten has freed us.
Oh I wouldn't say free.
More like, under new management.
What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.
- Congratulations, another one of your genius
And why did my doorman let you up?
- Carlos?
- What are you, no, no!
I need your help.
Why do you need MY help?
Because you're the smartest person I know.
Well you can't hide here.
Copper should have worked, why didn't the copper work?
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.
Copper? You're not making any sense.
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.
Okay, how can I help?
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.
Well, there is one place I know.
You gave him these powers, can't you just take them away?
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.
The night you dumped me.
Alone.
In the rain.
- Did you ever look back?
- NO!
- Oh, my giant blue head.
- I guess we're here.
So, this is where he hid it.
After all these years. My old shhool house.
You know, I think there's an apology in order, for the other night.
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.
Wow, can't believe he kept all this stuff.
Aww, I remember when he wore that.
Can you just stay focused here?
Yes of course, you're right, focused.
HEY! Come over and look at this.
What is it?
Um..... look!
This glass has ice cubes in it.
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.
No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet?
One of life’s great mysteries.
Hey.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
We now run a confirmed report.
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.
The city has never seen this level of destruction.
If only Metro Man were still alive.
- You're alive?
- You're alive.
I'm alive.
But..we..we saw your skeleton.
- You were dead.
- Are you a ghost?
There had better be, an amazing explanation for this.
Speak, apparition.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You both deserve the truth.
It all started back at the observatory.
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna stop you.
My head wasn't in the game that day.
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...
Using my super speed.
I decided to go clear my head.
Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.
But I just felt stuck.
I began to realize, despite all my powers, each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't.
A choice.
Ever since I can remember I've always had to be what the City wanted me to be.
But what about what I wanted to do?
Then it suddenly hit me.
I do have a choice.
I can be whatever I want to be.
No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig.
You can't just quit either.
That's when I got the brilliant idea...
...to fake my death.
Copper drains my powers!
You're weakness is copper?
Once your death ray hit.
I never felt so alive.
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.
Metro Man was finally dead.
And Music Man was born.
Music man?
That way I can keep my logo.
- WHAT?
- 'Cause of what?
Finally I'm free, to get in touch with my true power.
Weaving lyrical magic.
Check this out.
I have eyes that can see
right through leaaadd.
- Ewww
- Granted you have talent,
But there's a mad man out there destroying our... your city.
Why did you do this?
The people of the city relied on you, and you deserted them.
No offense.
No, I'm with you.
Look, we need your help.
I'm sorry, I really am.
Um, I'm, I'm done.
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying for every Yang.
If there's bad, good will rise up against it.
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.
Now it's about time, you find yours.
Hey, who needs him.
We can beat Tighten ourselves.
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns, hold them sideways, and just go all gangsta on 'em.
We can't
So that's it? You're just giving up?
I'm the bad guy.
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset, and I don't get the girl.
I'm going home.
Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost.
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay indoors until further notice.
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.
Hal!
Hal!
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses.
Well, I'm over you.
I've come to stop you, Hal.
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you going to do, report me to death?
I was going to try reasoning with you.
You and I, we worked together for a long time.
I know you.
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.
I want to talk to the real Hal.
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man, and eating dip,
And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten-Hal.
To late!
Megamind.
You and I have some unfinished business.
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower, oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.
Roxanne!
Come on Roxi, call for your hero to come rescue you.
Megamind.
I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are...
You can't give up.
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight.
Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.
It was your best quality.
You need to be that guy, right now.
The city needs you.
I need you.
Roxanne.
You have one hour.
Don't... keep me waiting.
Warden, Warden!
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life sentences to go.
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.
Here it is. Black is part of my heart.
I.... AM.... Sorry!
Not buying it.
I don't blame you.
I've terrorized the city countless times.
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.
I lied to Roxanne, and...
My best friend, Minion.
I treated like dirt.
Please, don't make this city,
Don't make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings.
Apology accepted.
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.
You got me!
Good luck, fellows.
We're gonna die!
Wait, what?
Hey, Metro losers.
This is Metro Tower.
They say it's suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength.
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.
And I hate reminders.
HAL!
Please don't do this.
I know there's still good in you, Hal.
You're so naive, Roxie.
You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there.
You're weaving a fantasy.
There is no Easter bunny.
There is no tooth fairy.
And there is no Queen of England.
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.
You dare to challenge Megamind?
This town isn't big enough for two super villains.
Oh, you're a villain all right.
Just not the super one.
Yeah, what’s the difference?
PRESENTATION!
I knew you'd come back.
Well, that makes one of us.
- What's the plan?
- Well, mostly involves, not dying.
I, like that plan.
I can't control it.
No!
Well, that was easy.
Looks like there's only one loose end now.
Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation.
You came back.
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have left.
Whoa, I... I thought you were dead.
My death was, greatly exaggerated.
So, you're the punk I've heard about.
Whoa!
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.
I'm so proud of you.
Minion?
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.
He's the real hero.
Megamind.
Going somewhere?
Besides jail.
No, not in the face there, please.
If you know what's good for you Tighten.
You'll stay out of Montrosity.
- You got it!
- Good!
Pretty sneaky, sis.
But there is only one person I know who calls this town, Montrosity.
Ooops.
You!
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.
You're not going to be laughing no more.
The invisible car. Hey, remember that night that I dumped you?
You are bringing this up now?
I did look back.
You did?
YOU DID!
Yes, and you should look back, right now.
Oh, I get it.
This is the last time you'll make a fool out of me.
I made you a hero.
You did the fool thing, all by yourself.
Oh, uh...
You're so pathetic.
No matter what side you're on.
You're always the looser.
There's a benefit to loosing.
You get to learn from your mistakes.
What?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.
Enjoy your flight.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Megamind.
So, this is how it ends.
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.
But not today!
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.
Say bye, bye Roxie.
Ollo.
Thing about bad guys, they always LOOSE!
Ohhhh.
You did it, you won.
Well, I finally had a reason to win.
You.
MINION!
Can't see it's cold and... warm, and dark and light.
It's me, Minion.
I'm right here.
We've had a lot of adventures together.
You and I.
We have, Minion.
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure, but,
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?
Yes Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.
Code-We're the good guys now.
Code-I guess we are.
Oh, oh. I'm going... I mean this is...
This is it, I mean I'm going far awa...
Oh, what a drama queen.
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim
- He had you, didn't he.
- Whew!
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.
There he is with that little face. Look at that face.
We did it!
We did it!
- Fist pump!
- You did it!
We won, we won, we won.
What! Get back you savages!
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
But the path we choose for ourselves.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Now hand over your wallets.
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding.
I have to admit.
Being good, has its perks.
You know, you look pretty good in white.
Megamind, if you please.
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.
Sorry my friend.
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!
Defender of Metro City.
You know, I like the sound of that.
Hit it!
I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
Come On
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
You Know It
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
You Know It
You know, and The Whole World Has To
Answer Right Now, whose bad.
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad- come on.
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad- you know it.
You know it, You Know, You Know,
And The Whole World Has To
Answer Right Now
Who's bad!
Zeus.
Poseidon. lt's been many years.
What do you see?
Thunderclouds.
But no lightning.
Stolen.
What? You think l took it?
Omnipotence has blinded you, brother.
We are forbidden from stealing each other's powers.
-But our children aren't.
-You're accusing my son? l haven't seen him since he was a baby.
He doesn't know me
-or even know who he is because of you.
-lf your son is the thief, l will send him to the depths of Tartarus. lf you touch him, you will have the fight of your life.
He must return the bolt to me in 14 days, by midnight on the summer solstice, or there will be war.
And he's alive!
Percy Jackson is a beast!
You're a beast, man! Give me some.
-How long was that?
-Seven minutes.
Seven minutes?
That's crazy, man. That's ridiculous.
How do you do it? l just like being in water. lt's the one place l can think. l wish l could spend all day underwater instead of this place.
Right. lt's like high school without the musical.
Every day it's the same thing. Look at this.
Good morning. l'm Mrs. Dodds, your substitute English teacher.
Would someone please explain what Shakespeare was trying to convey in this line from Othello?
Percy Jackson?
Well? l'm sorry, l don't know.
Anybody else?
-Hey, Mom, l'm home!
-l'm up here, honey!
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.
-How was school today?
-The usual. l think this dyslexia thing is getting worse.
Why do you think that? l don't know. Maybe it's the ADHD.
You know, l thought this school was supposed to make things better.
Percy, l know how hard this is for you.
-But someday it'll all make sense.
-Really?
When?
Tonight? Tomorrow? When?
Woman!
Hi, Gabe.
Where's my beer?
-lt's in the fridge.
-So, what, it's supposed to magically float from the icebox and into my hand?
Hustle.
Come on, man.
You have to do that right here? lt's disgusting. We're in a kitchen.
Yeah, real charmer you got there. Really.
Show some respect, all right?
That's my mom right there.
This is my house.
You show some respect.
Come on.
Why do you stay with that pig?
He smells like a sewer.
He sleeps till noon every day and he can't even hold a job.
Why do you stay with him?
He's been good to us, Percy, in ways you don't understand.
You're right. l don't understand. l don't get it.
Be prepared.
Everything is about to change, Percy.
Everything is about to change.
There are 12 Olympian gods.
The big three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.
They attained power by overthrowing their father, Kronos, chopping him into little pieces.
The three gods have been rivals ever since, always arguing, always threatening war.
On several occasions, they would come down to Earth and.. .
-How shall l put this?
-Hook up?
They would hook up with mortals.
The children of these unions were half god, half human.
Can anyone tell me what they were called?
Percy.
Percy. l'm sorry. What? What, Mr. Brunner?
What is the proper name of the offspring of a human and a god?
-Demigod.
-Exactly.
And many became great heroes, like Hercules and Achilles.
Can you name another? l'll give you a hint.
You have something in common.
Percy.. .
Perseus?
Correct.
Now, over here, we have a depiction of Hercules defeating the Nemean lion.
Hercules killed the beast with his bare hands and took the skin as a trophy.
Percy?
Yes, Mrs. Dodds?
We need to talk.
Okay.
The next 1 1 labors would become increasingly difficult. lt would take Hercules three months.. .
So, did l do something wrong?
Mrs. Dodds?
Hello?
Where is it?
Hey! Hey. How did you get up there?
-You stole the lightning bolt!
-l don't know what you're talking about!
Give it to me!
Give it to me! Now!
Or l will bite your heart out!
Percy!
-Release him !
-You!
Release him or l swear l'll tear you to pieces! l'm going crazy! l should be on medication.
Percy, calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay!
Oh, God, wait! Did that really just happen?
She just turned into that thing?
A Fury concealed in our school. l should have known.
Wait, a Fury? What's a Fury?
And why did you say you could tear her to pieces?
-What did she want from you?
-She said something about me stealing a lightning bolt.
They found him.
-He's in danger.
-Who found me?
-He's no longer secure here.
-Where should we move him?
We have no choice. The Camp.
What camp? Look, l'm standing right here. lf they think he's the thief, there's nowhere safe on heaven and Earth for him now.
Percy, take this to defend yourself. lt's a powerful weapon. Guard it well.
Only use it in times of severe distress.
This is a pen. This is a pen!
Take him to his mother, and don't let him out of your sight.
Okay. Percy, come on. Come on, man.
Come on!
-Are you guys crazy?
-Let's go!
This is a pen, man.
-What do you want me to do with this?
-Come on!
-Look, man, what's going on?
-Look, don't trust anyone, okay?
Don't look at anybody, just keep walking!
Why did Mr. Brunner ask you to watch me?
-Because l'm your protector.
-Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
My protector? Are you kidding?
What, you think because l'm like this, l'm not capable of keeping you safe?
Maybe you're not seeing what l'm seeing.
You have crutches!
Look, l would give my life to secure your well-being.
What are you talking about?
What's going on?
We got to warn your mom.
Come on, Perce.
Come on!
-Sally! More beer!
-Mom !
Hey, Mom. Mom ! Mom !
Look, we gotta talk, okay?
Hey!
Can't you see she's servicing me and my friends?
Hey. Hey! Don't talk about my mom like that, you bald-headed freak.
No, Gabe! Gabe!
Calm down!
-Hey, nice one.
-Like l said, l'm your protector.
Yeah.
Sally, Percy has to leave now.
Like, right now.
Okay.
Look, what is happening?
Okay, l swear, l didn't steal anything!
Honey, l believe you. l believe you.
Where are you taking me?
What is this camp? lt's a camp for really special people,
-like you.
-''Special people''?
-What, am l crazy or something?
-No, honey, no.
Percy, this is about your father. l was just out of school and working at the Jersey shore when we first met.
Your father was unlike any guy l'd ever seen. He was just dazzling.
They're always dazzling.
We were really in love, Percy.
And then you came along, and then it was just perfect.
But he had to leave.
So he did abandon us.
No, honey, he was forced to. He loved you.
Leaving you, it was probably the most difficult thing he ever did.
Why did he have to go?
-Because he's.. .
-Sally, watch out!
Mom ! Go straight!
-Percy?
-Mom, you all right?
-Yeah, yeah.
-Grover, you all right? ls it me or is it raining cows?
What is that?
Get out! Come on! Come on!
Why are you taking your pants off?
What are you doing?
My job!
-You're half donkey?
-l'm half goat.
Go, Grover!
Guys, watch out, there's glass!
Come on, get out of the car!
That thing's getting closer!
-You don't even need these.
-Look, man, those are just for show.
Follow me!
This way, guys! This way!
Come on! Come on! Come on, run! Run!
Come on! Come on!
We're here!
-Mom ! What are you doing?
-This is as far as l can go.
-Come on!
-l can't go through! l'm not like you!
-Look, l'm not leaving without you.
-You have to!
You're meant to!
Put my mother down!
Percy, go! You're safe inside the gate!
-What can l do?
-Listen, use the pen!
-What?
-Use Brunner's pen and click it!
Perce, are you okay?
Percy, behind you!
-Perce, you okay?
-l'm not feeling.. .
Percy!
Perce, l'm sure glad you're alive.
-Where am l? What is this place?
-The infirmary.
-You've been unconscious for three days.
-Three days?
So, Perce, what do you remember?
Some crazy dream. l don't know.
There was a monster. My mom was there.
You were there, too, but you were some weird hybrid man-goat thing!
Yeah. The politically correct term is Satyr.
No.
No, no, no, no!
All of it was real? My mom's gone? l'm sorry, Percy. l try, man, l really do.
But, frankly, l'm just a junior protector. l don't have my horns yet. lt was my fault. lt was my job to protect you.
Both of you.
So this is Camp Half Blood.
-''Half'' meaning what?
-l think you know.
''Half'' meaning ''half mortal, half god."
-Fire!
-Guys! Watch the arrows!
Newcomer! Hello!
Look, man, remember all the myths about Greek gods and goddesses?
Well, they're not myths.
Look, remember what Mr. Brunner said?
Sometimes they come down to Earth and they fall in love with mortals?
And then they have kids?
-No way.
-Yes way.
Yep, you're a demigod!
Two points for Percy Jackson!
Look, don't worry. But you're not alone.
There's hundreds in the world.
Some lead normal lives, and some, l'm not allowed to divulge their names, are very famous. l'm talking about, like, White House famous.
See, man, this place right here, this is the place where you'll learn to harness your powers.
You'll train to become leaders, warriors and heroes. l think you have the wrong guy, all right? l'm not a hero. l'm a loser. l have dyslexia, ADHD.
And those are your greatest gifts.
When you try to read, the words float off the page, right?
That's because your brain is hardwired for Ancient Greek, not English.
Like at the museum, l could read.
Yeah. And your ADHD?
You're impulsive, Percy. You can't be still!
Those are your natural battle reflexes, man.
They kept you alive in your fight.
Look, no pitiful loser can defeat a Minotaur.
Your blood is special. lt's the blood of a god.
This is a lot to process.
Yeah, a lot. A lot.
This is where you'll do most of your battle training.
What's her name?
-She will squash you like a bug.
-Her name.
Annabeth. Daughter of Athena, the goddess of wisdom.
Hey, no staring. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.
There's someone l want you to see.
Check this out.
What are those things?
They're Centaurs.
-Wait a minute. ls that Mr. Brunner?
-Come on.
Mr. Brunner? ln my world, l'm known as Chiron.
-Are you recovered?
-Am l recovered?
You, you're not in a wheelchair. You have.. .
A real horse's ass. l apologize for hiding my true form, but l needed to keep an eye on you. l hope you'll forgive me.
Come.
Hey, Grover!
The daughters of Aphrodite.
Okay. All right, guys.
You guys got a lot of catching up to do.
Their mother is the goddess of love, so you know where that leads.
Hey, baby!
Satyrs.
What is this place?
Welcome home.
Your father built this for you.
This whole place is mine?
This thing's got some weight to it.
My father is Poseidon!
God of the seas.
Why didn't anybody tell me? lt was for your own safety. lt's exceedingly rare for a child to be born to one of the big three.
You're very powerful.
A threat.
A threat? Who am l threatening?
Poseidon's brothers, Zeus and Hades.
That's why your mother married your stepfather.
His pungent odor masked the smell of your blood
My mother put up with that creep to protect me? l wish l'd known.
She sacrificed so much for me.
Now she's gone.
Why am l even here?
You're here because you're in jeopardy.
Everyone thinks you're the lightning thief.
Look, l didn't steal it.
Zeus' bolt is the most powerful weapon ever created.
And if it's not returned by the summer solstice, in 10 days,
-there will be a war.
-This is your problem, all right? Not mine.
-This is about your world, not mine.
-This is about all worlds!
Olympians would be forced to choose sides.
Earth would become a battleground.
Mountains erupted, earthquakes, raging fires!
The end of life as you know it.
What can we do? l want to take you to Olympus, convince Zeus of your innocence.
Someone's using you to start a war.
What are we doing here? Let's go now.
Your boldness is commendable, but outside those gates you would be in danger at all times.
The Fury and the Minotaur were only the beginning.
First, we must train.
This is always a fun game to watch.
God, how do you guys wear this stuff? lt weighs more than me.
Look, trust me. Wear it or you'll get killed.
Wait. What? What? Wait.. .
Heroes! Warriors!
Fall in!
Hustle, hustle!
Dylan, Paris, stop lollygagging!
Percy. Step forward.
This is Percy Jackson!
And he's going to need a team.
We'll take him. l'm Luke. Son of Hermes and camp leader.
Not necessarily in that order.
Where's your helmet?
No one gave me one.
Chiron, you still got your wheelchair?
Kid's gonna need it.
You're a goner, man. l'm messing with you.
Smile a little bit. lt's good for you, kid.
Anybody got an extra helmet?
Please pass it up.
Try it on.
That'll protect you. So will all of us.
Welcome to the Blue Soldiers, my friend.
All right! Everyone in position for Capture the Flag!
First team to capture the enemy's banner wins.
Dismissed!
Steady, steady!
Now!
Percy, l know where the flag's at.
Come on!
Keep your eyes open. Don't get killed. l'm coming, buddy, l'm coming!
Sons of Ares. Watch out!
Whoa, that's a sword! That's a sword!
You guys take camp way too seriously.
Go!
Percy, get out of here! Go look for the flag!
How did l just do that?
No. l won.
Did you really think it would be that easy?
My mother is goddess of wisdom and battle strategy.
Do you know what that means? l always win. l always lose. Maybe we're both wrong.
Okay, Chiron, shouldn't we get in there and stop them?
-She's killing him, man.
-You've got to be kidding.
This is the best part!
Stand up and fight, hero.
Come on, Perce. Come on, Perce.
Go to the water.
The water will give you power.
Yeah, Perce!
-Get up there.
-All right! Yeah!
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Ladies and gentlemen, the son of Poseidon is coming through.
A hero is coming through! Move it!
Hey, no dirty looks. Stop that.
-Sorry, l'm trying.. .
-Hey, Percy?
We're having a party at our place later.
And we would really love it if you came. l'd love to come. That'd be great.
-That would be amazing!
-Awesome. l would love to come, too, to the party.
You know? Thanks for inviting me, ladies.
Beat it, nymphs.
Wait, don't leave. Ladies.. . l'm available.
Wait, come on, don't leave. l'm available! What time's the party?
-Feeling like a hero?
-More like a mutant. l'm not gonna grow a fish tail or gills or anything like that, am l?
Not likely.
Although a huge ego isn't out of the question.
You know you could have killed me out there? l could have died, if l was normal.
But you aren't. l get the sense that you don't like me very much. lt's possible. l mean, our parents hate each other.
Wait. They do? l definitely have strong feelings for you. l just haven't decided if they're positive or negative yet.
Well, you let me know when you figure it out.
You'll be the first.
Percy Jackson, show yourself!
Hades! Stay back!
Percy Jackson, bring me the bolt!
Be a good boy.
Hand it to me and l will exchange it for your mother.
Percy! Don't listen, Percy!
My mother's gone!
No, your mother is still alive. l sent the Minotaur to abduct her.
She is here with me in the Underworld.
Mom?
Percy?
What have you done with my mother? lf you ever want to see your mother again, you will bring me the bolt!
-Chiron, l have to go get her.
-Percy, you don't have the bolt.
Look, l'll tell him the truth!
When he realizes l'm not the thief, he'll release her.
No. You cannot negotiate with Hades.
When he finds out you don't have the bolt, he'll kill you and your mother.
-This is her only chance.
-No.
Stick to our plan.
Travel to Olympus, bargain with Zeus.
Once you convince him of your innocence, we will do everything in our power to bring back your mother.
Okay.
Going somewhere?
Yeah. Yeah, l'm going for a walk.
-For a walk? l'm coming with you.
-No, no, l'm going alone.
-No, l'm coming with you.
-No!
You're being followed.
-You're stressing me out.
-Leave me alone.
We got a 1 :00 demigod curfew, okay?
Leave me alone. Go to sleep or something.
No.
-Come on.
-One small victory and you're ready to fight Hades?
-Double team.
-Really? You, too?
Look, l just found out my mother is still alive. l'm gonna get her back.
-From the Underworld?
-Whatever it takes.
Yeah, well, maybe you'll outsmart Hades.
-Maybe l will.
-Look, man, l can't let you do this, okay?
Look, l'm not asking for your permission.
Okay. Well, according to regulations, if l can't stop you, l must accompany you,
'cause l'm your best friend and your protector.
Junior protector. ls that really necessary? l don't need your help. Okay?
This is something l have to do on my own.
Yeah, well, we weren't asking for your permission.
Come on, all right?
Today you tried to kill me.
-Now you want to defend me?
-That wasn't real.
-That was just training.
-Yeah.
Percy, that's all l've ever done, is train and train and train. l've grown up here. l've only been in the outside world a couple of times.
And l've never had the chance to go on an actual quest.
Besides, you've won one battle and l've won hundreds.
-You're gonna need my experience.
-Good point.
You two really want to come?
-Yes!
-Yeah!
Okay. l guess we're all going.
So who knows how to get to the Underworld? l did not think of that one. l think l know someone who might.
Friendly Harriers inbound!
Luke?
Hey, guys.
Percy. l figured you'd stop by sooner or later.
Everybody does, just to get away from all that
Renaissance fair stuff out there, you know?
But welcome to the modern world.
Cool. New stuff.
-What are you guys up to?
-We're going to get my mom back.
Your dad is the messenger of the gods, one of the only ones who's gotten in and out of the Underworld.
Do you have any idea how?
My dad's a jerk. l've never met him.
-You, too?
-Guess we all got Daddy issues, huh?
That's because all gods are the same.
Selfish.
They only care about themselves.
But l once broke into my dad's house.
Got some cool stuff.
For you.
Flying shoes?
They're my dad's.
He has hundreds of these little guys.
He won't even miss them.
Look underneath the other one.
You see, people have gone to the Underworld before without having to be dead.
Hercules did it. Orpheus did it.
My dad does it all the time.
Getting in's the easy part.
Getting out, now that's tricky.
This is a map to Persephone's pearls.
Persephone? You mean Hades' wife?
Yeah, he forced her to marry him.
Keeps her prisoner.
Needless to say, she hates it there. lt's hot, he's a weirdo.
So she has secret visitors.
She keeps pearls hidden for them all over the world, and these pearls, they provide a quick escape from the Underworld.
You could use them to get out.
-So, how do the pearls work?
-Easy.
You take a pearl, you step on it, you crush it, visualize where you want to be taken.
Right now, there's three pearls in the United States.
This map will guide you there.
Right here is your first location.
''Auntie Em's Garden Emporium."
Once you find the first pearl, the map will show you the next one, and the next one, and then you're off to Hades.
Which reminds me. You guys might need some extra protection, so.. .
My favorite shield.
You might want to take a step back.
-Hey. Thanks, Luke.
-Don't mention it.
But you're gonna have to promise me one thing. lf you see my dad on the highway to hell.. .
Yeah?
Kick his ass for me.
This place definitely needs an extreme makeover.
Hello!
Hello? Anybody home in Auntieville?
Check this out. They got free sodas.
Okay. That's nasty.
The Health Department needs to give this place an F.
Hey, guys, check this out.
Look at this.
Nice.
-Gold drachmas.
-That means we're on the right track.
Here.
How are we gonna find the pearl in this place?
That's a good question.
Okay, let's split up. Check everything.
-Good idea.
-Yeah. l'm gonna go this way.
Hello?
-Get out! She's coming!
-What? Who?
We stopped.. . Directions.. .
My poor husband! Help me!
Please, help me!
Check this out.
He looks just like my Uncle Ferdinand.
That's crazy.
He got the mole in the same place.
No. lt's not my Uncle Ferdinand, because Uncle Ferdinand was killed by
Medusa.
Percy! Annabeth!
-We're in trouble!
-Grover?
Please! We have to leave before she finds us!
-Who?
-She's turned my husband to stone!
Grover! Where are you?
Percy! Annabeth!
-Annabeth, where are you?
-Grover!
-Come on, man, watch where you're going!
-Perce! Listen.
-Where are we?
-We're in Medusa's lair.
-Annabeth!
-Annie!
We're lost! We'll never leave!
Don't move.
Well, this is a fabulous surprise. lt's so heartening to have such young visitors.
We get so lonely here.
Don't we?
That's why l create my statues.
They're my only company, daughter of Athena.
-How do you know me?
-You have such beautiful hair. l once had hair like that. l was courted, desired by many suitors.
But that all changed because of your mother, the woman who cursed me.
Who turned me.. .
-Don't look!
-.. .into this!
They say the eyes are windows to the soul. l hope you find my eyes attractive.
So rude, not looking people in the eyes.
Come on.
Sneak a peek.
How are we supposed to fight something we can't look at?
We can look at a reflection.
Okay, wait. Check this out.
All right. Good idea. l'm gonna go get Annabeth.
-Okay, l'm gonna take care of Medusa.
-Okay.
You'll make a wonderful addition to my collection.
We'll be friends forever.
Do you mind?
No, no.
Sooner or later you will open those eyes.
The temptation to look at me is too hard to resist.
Don't look, Annabeth!
Don't open your eyes!
Who's that?
Another demigod? l can sense you.
Son of Poseidon. l used to date your daddy.
-Need a hand?
-Grover. Help.
-Thanks. Okay.
-Come on. Let's go. l hear you have the lightning bolt.
May l see it? l don't have it!
Let me see your eyes. l hear they're bluer than the Circassian Sea.
Open them, or my hungry babies will have to open them for you.
But it would be such a pity to destroy such a young and handsome face.
Stay with me, Percy.
All you have to do is look.
Are you okay?
Yeah, l'm okay.
Son of Poseidon!
Heads up.
Hey, guys! lt's cool to open up your eyes!
Annabeth, that was great, great demigod driving.
Thanks.
-We should take it with us.
-The head? Oh, no. That's sick. lf you open the eyes, they still work, dead or alive.
You never know when something like that might come in handy.
Yeah, you're right. But l'm not touching it.
Come on, man, just take off your jacket.
We'll wrap it up until we get some ice.
Why do l got to take off my jacket?
Because you're the protector.
Yeah, you're right. l am the protector.
So l'm gonna give you my hoodie, not my jacket. Okay?
Come on, you baby.
Disgusting.
Yeah, just toss it up. Come on, don't.. .
Hey. Hey. Guys, wait.
The pearl.
One down, two to go.
Would have been nice if Luke had warned us about Medusa.
Maybe he just didn't know.
GPS from the gods. Where to next?
Let's see.
The Parthenon in Nashville.
Nashville? Oh, great.
Home of my least favorite music.
-Let's stop for the night!
-Yeah.
-Let's stop for the night!
-Yeah.
-Good idea.
-Oh, my God.
Percy.
Hey.
-Hey.
-Nice work today. Thanks.
What happened to you?
That poor lady who turned to stone, she.. .
She had a tight grip.
Check this out.
Cool. Very cool.
So, why do our parents hate each other?
They both wanted to be patron god of Athens.
And the people chose Athena.
And our parents have hated each other ever since.
-What's your mom like?
-l don't know.
-l never met her.
-What? ls it like this for everybody?
-Don't any gods see their kids?
-lt's forbidden.
Right after we were born, Zeus decreed that the gods couldn't have physical contact with their mortal offspring.
-That's a stupid law.
-l agree.
Although, between us, l think my mother speaks to me sometimes. ln times of trouble, l hear her voice
-giving me advice.
-That's happened to me!
Yeah. That's your father talking to you.
Yo, Percy! Get in here, man! This is ugly!
Right.
Hey, hurry up!
Perce, check this out, man.
You're on TV.
...surrounding the missing boy,
Percy Jackson,
and his mother, Sally Ugliano.
But their relatives have
some interesting theories.
So, Mr. Ugliano, talk to me
about your son, Percy Jackson.
No, he's not my son. He's a stepson.
He did not come from these loins.
Ever since he started with the drugs
and the alcohol,
-he's never been the same.
-Oh, no.
Five nights ago, he tried to kill me
and he threw his mother on the ground.
And his cripple friend then attacked me
from behind and knocked me out.
When l woke up, Sally was gone.
She was kidnapped by Percy.
-She would never leave with that...
-Shut up, Gabe.
Great. Now l'm a fugitive.
See? That's what l'm talking about, man.
Gabe's always running his mouth.
He's just mad because l busted him up with my crutches.
Guys, l can't pee with her watching me.
Sorry, guys. l messed up. l should have closed the curtains.
Come on, guys. Let's hit the road before Homeland Security shows up.
That's amazing.
A complete replica of the Parthenon in Nashville.
All right, guys. Let's go get the pearl.
Hey. That's your mom. l wonder if she really looks like that.
We'll find out.
Guys, check this out. Oh, man. lt's the pearl.
-That was easy.
-Easy? lt's 30 feet in the air and this place is filled with tourists. l got an idea.
We'll come back after the place closes.
Come on, follow me.
Or l can just throw my crutch up there.
-l'm saying, the pearl would fall out.. .
-Grover!
Perce, l'm saying.. . lt's not a bad idea !
The park's been closed for an hour.
Let's move.
Yes, sir!
-All right, this will be easy.
-Okay. l'm gonna fly up. l'm gonna use Luke's flying shoes.
-l'm gonna grab the pearl, and.. .
-Cool.
Okay, so what are we going to do?
All right, guys. l got this.
You got what? Hey, yo, hey, listen!
-You're going to kill the janitors?
-Chill.
Those are working-class Americans!
Oh, man.
-Why did you do that?
-They're not dead, they're unconscious.
-Now, we have 30 minutes. Come on!
-Cool.
-Y'all, what's cracking?
-Hey.
-Luke!
-Annabeth!
How do you turn on the shoes?
Tell Percy he's got to
break into a run, okay?
He's got to build up speed,
kind of like a jet on a runway.
lt's gonna take some practice.
Okay. l got this. lt's gonna take some practice!
-l got it!
-Yes!
-Yeah, Percy!
-There we go!
-There it is.
-Yeah!
-That's what l'm talking about.
-Way to go.
All right, let's grab everything.. .
Oh, man.
Look, l got this, okay?
Hey, guys, l'm with Park Recreational Services.
You guys have been caught sleeping on the job. You better be happy l'm not writing you guys up, okay?
This is the last time.
We've been expecting you, Mr. Jackson.
Not again.
Just give us the lightning bolt and we'll let you go.
Look, l don't have the lightning bolt.
Okay. This is bad.
Hydra !
Guys, watch out!
The middle one spews fire!
You got a sweet tooth? All right! Try that!
Percy, stop! No!
How flipping awesome was that? l just killed that thing!
Killed it? You only made it worse.
-What are you talking about?
-Percy, when you cut off one Hydra head, two more grow back.
Get back!
Distract that thing! l'll get the pearl!
Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!
Go! Open the door!
The door won't open!
Grover!
That's nasty.
We interrupt
our regularly scheduled programming
for this special report.
Scientists are baffled
by what now appears to be
a single storm cloud that is expanding
over much of Europe and Asia,
moving towards the United States.
Savage winds, rain and mammoth waves
are being reported along the coastlines
of several continents.
So far, no casualties, but countries
everywhere are preparing for the worst.
The gods are angry.
We need to get the last pearl.
Where's the next location?
Yeah.
Well, let's see.
Well, guys, we got ourselves a good one.
We're going to Vegas!
Yo!
There it is.
Lotus Casino. l've been looking forward to this!
Look, guys, remember, always split the eights, never the tens, okay?
We're not here to gamble, remember?
-We got poker, we got blackjack.. .
-Grover, we're not here to have fun.
We just need to grab the pearl and go, okay?
All right.
This is nice!
Okay, this place is officially dope.
Here's your complimentary
Lotus Fun Book.
Thanks, but we're not staying.
Please, l insist. lt's good for everything in the hotel and casino.
Don't comp us. We're not checking in.
-Okay, that guy was persistent.
-Yeah!
Yeah, we're here for one thing and one thing only.
That is really awesome.
Where would we find a green pearl in this place?
Maybe on a cocktail waitress or a showgirl.
We should start there.
Can l get you something?
Try a lotus flower. They're so good.
-lt's our signature dish.
-Really? Signature? ls it good?
-Thank you.
-Yo, do we have to pay for this?
-l guess we don't.
-lt's free.
That's really good.
This is the most delicious thing l've ever consumed!
Guys, why don't we stay here for a while?
-Yeah!
-That sounds like an amazing idea.
But we're on a time-sensitive mission right now.
-Aren't we.. .
-l can't remember. l totally forgot what l was gonna say. l think l figured it out. l think l know why we're here.
-Why are we here?
-To have fun.
Okay. Let's never leave!
-Yeah!
-Let's stay here!
Yeah!
You're awesome!
-Thanks.
-Thank you! Thanks.
No, Percy. Don't eat the flower.
lt dulls the senses,
keeps you prisoner here.
Hey, l think l'm gonna go get some air. l'll be right back.
Okay.
-Another lotus flower?
-No, l'm good. Thank you.
Look around you. Focus. Focus!
-Another lotus flower?
-No, thank you.
-Would you like another one?
-l'm fine.
-The French Connection?
-Yeah. You seen it yet?
Yeah, yeah, l think so, on DVD.
What's DVD?
Seriously?
Whatever. l think it's the best movie of the year.
What? Wait. This year?
Yeah, this year. 1971 .
Percy, wake up.
You need to escape.
-Wake up!
-You could really use a lotus flower. l really don't want one.
-Thank you.
-Just one.
No!
Another lotus flower?
-No.
-We insist. l really don't want another lotus flower, so please, leave me alone. ls there a problem, Mr. Jackson?
No. Thank you.
Percy Jackson's awake.
Excuse me. Annabeth. Annabeth!
What're you doing with that?
Don't eat that.
-What?
-We have to go. Now.
What do you mean?
We're having so much fun!
No, no, no, we're not having fun.
Grover! Grover! Wake up!
Grover! Come on, we got to go!
What? Look, Perce, your timing is terrible, okay?
Dude, we're heading to the chapel.
We're getting married!
-How romantic!
-No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, which of y'all did l propose to?
-Wake up!
-Yo, man, you're such a buzz kill.
Percy, what's wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?
Both of you need to wake up, now!
Look at me. Look at me.
You're in a trance, okay? We're trapped!
Listen to me. lf you eat the flowers, you're never gonna want to leave. Okay?
We're gonna be stuck here forever!
Oh, no. We got to go.
-Okay, l see your point! Okay.
-Let's get the green pearl!
Hold it right there!
Stop right where you are.
Move, James Dean! Out of the way!
Let's go, guys! Car! Car!
Come on, guys! Car!
Get in!
Come on, come on! ln the car, in the car! Let's go!
-Keys! Got the keys.
-Come on! Go!
-Drive! Drive!
-They're coming! They're coming!
-Come on, start driving!
-l got this.
Go!
Now, that's how you get out of a casino!
That's how you drive!
Of course. Now that all makes sense.
-What?
-That was the lair of the lotus eaters.
They've been luring people into their trap since ancient times.
Guys, look. Tomorrow is June 21st.
No. No, no. lt can't be. Today's the 15th.
No, tomorrow is the 21st.
We were in there for five days.
-lt felt like hours.
-Then tomorrow's the solstice.
Our deadline is tomorrow at midnight.
Okay, look, we've got to move it.
Where's Hades? lt's in Hollywood.
All right. l can get us there in four hours.
Maybe three.
And now,
the latest breaking news from KZL Y.
An unprecedented storm cloud has grown
to cover most of North America.
Authorities in several states
are ordering evacuations,
reporting severe weather conditions.
Don't slip. Watch your step.
Wait, wait. Hold it.
''Woe to all depraved souls."
Well, l guess there ain't no turning back now.
-Yep. Looks like we're stuck in here.
-Yeah.
Hey, Perce, who's that creepy guy with the hoodie? l don't know. Let's find out.
Who are you?
-We need to see Hades.
-The living are not permitted here.
Die and come back.
Okay, we won't die and come back, but.. .
You know what? l think l know what he wants.
-What?
-You got to pay the ferryman.
Watch this.
Yo, my friend! What up?
Okay, guess not.
Look, you like dead people, right? l got a few dead people you might recognize.
Check this out. Jackson, Grant.
And look who's joining the party.
Benjamin Franklin.
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
Look, you give us a boat ride, you take the money and you get an interior decorator,
'cause it is too depressing in here.
All right? Here you go.
That was $170!
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The drachma. The drachma !
Climb aboard.
Thanks for telling me, man, you're burning money. We're in a recession.
-That's treason.
-Just shut up. Shut up, man. Go on.
Welcome to the Underworld.
What is all this?
The scrapheap of human misery.
Lost hopes and dreams.
Wishes that never came true.
All lives end in suffering and tragedy.
This is as far as l go.
Guys, do you hear that?
-Yeah, what is that?
-l don't know.
-Annie, stab that thing!
-What are we gonna do?
Back!
-What were those things?
-Hellhounds.
Yeah, well, maybe you should feed them.
They sensed the presence of another animal.
-Great, they smell goat.
-A Satyr. l haven't had a Satyr
-visit before.
-Persephone!
What could possibly be taking so long?
Don't ignore me!
Or what? What will you do? l'm already in Hell.
We have visitors.
Nephew.
Welcome.
You have your father's looks.
Always the lucky side of the family.
Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
-You're Hades?
-Yes.
Sorry. l just didn't expect you to look like this, man.
Kind of stylish. l like it.
Would you prefer that l looked like this?
No! No! Look, stick to the Mick Jagger thing! lt works for you!
You're very brave coming here.
Come closer.
Hey. Perce. l can see the look of disgust in your eyes, but this existence was not of my choosing. l was banished here by Zeus and your father. l am damned.
My only chance of getting out of this place is to defeat my brothers and take control of Olympus. But, of course, l'll need the bolt.
-And l need my mother.
-Then we have an understanding.
You give me the bolt and l'll give you your mother. l need to tell you the truth. l'm not the lightning thief. l don't have the bolt. l never did.
Why did you come here, then?
Well, l was hoping that when you saw that l wasn't the thief, you'd let my mother go.
Yes. Yes, but do you think l'm an idiot? l'm Hades!
Now, give me the bolt, or say goodbye to your mother!
Percy! l thought l'd lost you forever.
No.
Zeus' master bolt.
Liar. l swear, l don't know how that got there.
-That's not even my shield!
-No!
Luke rigged it!
He put the bolt in his shield and used us.
Luke stole the lightning bolt. l think we're done here.
Feed them to the souls.
We had a deal, all right?
You have the bolt! Just let us go!
Summon the hounds.
-Ella tho!
-No. No ella tho.
Lassie, sit! Sit!
No! No! l am going to be king of the gods.
Stay back! Stay!
Stay!
All right, come on.
Go on, give it back.
Bad dog!
He won't remember a thing!
Why did you do that?
Because he's cruel and abusive!
The only thing l look forward to is my allotted time away from this hellhole.
A war of the gods would put an end to that.
And l'd be alone, with only him, forever.
Go. Take the bolt, and your mother.
Only three?
Oh, no.
There are four of you.
Each pearl transports only a single person.
One of you will have to stay.
-All right, l'll stay. You three go.
-What? No.
No, no, no. l've achieved
-my quest. l'm staying here.
-No. No! l've trained for situations like this.
Guys! Guys. Knock it off.
-l'm staying, because l'm the protector.
-Grover, come on.
Look, man, l don't want to hear it. Just go. lt's my duty. lt's what l'm meant for.
We'll come back for you. l'll take very good care of him.
All right. Now move it, guys!
Each of you, step on a pearl and concentrate on where you want to go.
Take this.
To Olympus.
Hey. Look.
Zeus and Poseidon preparing for battle.
No, no. This isn't the right place.
This isn't Olympus. This is.. .
This is the Empire State Building!
Percy! The entrance to Olympus is there!
Well, there's 10 minutes till midnight.
Let's move.
Percy Jackson!
Well, you weren't supposed to make it out alive. l can't let you take that bolt to Olympus. l'm the lightning thief.
You hid the bolt in my shield. Why?
Well, when you said you were going to the Underworld, it hit me.
''That is the perfect opportunity to get the bolt to Hades."
Why would you do that?
To bring Olympus crumbling down.
Percy, let's go.
Let's go!
Well, it's too late, 'cause l'm returning the bolt to Zeus right now.
Not before midnight.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Luke! Why do you want a war of the gods?
Control.
They've been in power for too long. l say it's time for our generation to take over.
Remold the world in our image.
-A world of new heroes.
-You're no hero.
-Mom, are you all right?
-Yeah.
Stay here.
Luke!
Maybe they were wrong.
Maybe you're no son of Poseidon.
Yeah. l think l am the son of Poseidon.
He's got the bolt! Come on!
Let's move! We've got two minutes!
Olympus.
Percy, l can't get through.
You've got to go!
Silence!
-lt is almost midnight.
-This was predestined!
-You wanted this battle!
-You have only yourself to blame!
Please! Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!
Time has run out.
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
My name is Percy Jackson, and l think you might be looking for this.
Give me the bolt, lightning thief.
You're wise to betray your father. l didn't steal it.
And l have no connection to Poseidon.
But tell me, if you didn't steal it, then who did?
Luke, son of Hermes.
You see, he was angry at you.
All of you.
He wanted you to destroy yourselves.
You have done well.
Let there be peace.
Hi, Mom.
Annabeth, l am so proud of you.
Zeus, l have a good friend.
He's a Satyr named Grover.
He's my protector, and the only reason why we escaped the Underworld is because he stayed behind.
And now you expect me to bring him back.
Very well. l believe this assembly's business here is finished.
Brother, please. l need to speak with him.
Just this once. l'll meet you outside. l'm not expecting you to forgive me.
But l want you to know that l'm grateful. l didn't do it for you. l did it to save Mom.
Please. We don't have much time.
How old was l when you left?
Seven months.
Look, l didn't need you there all the time, but.. . l would have liked to have seen you just once.
Why didn't you ever come back? l wanted to.
When l was with you and your mother, l became less concerned with my responsibilities. l was becoming human.
-And that's a bad thing?
-For a god? Zeus thought so.
That's why he passed the law preventing gods from ever having contact with their children.
That was because of you?
But l was always watching over you.
Just because you didn't see me doesn't mean that l wasn't there.
When you were troubled, l tried to help. l heard you. l know l'm not the father you always wanted, but if you ever need me, l'll be there for you, in your thoughts and in your dreams. l'll stand by you, Percy.
Always.
You can come visit me anytime.
Just promise me that l don't have to see that loser Gabe ever again. l kicked him out.
Yeah, he's gone.
He's out of our lives forever.
Finally.
-l'm going to miss you.
-Me, too.
Percy?
This is where you belong.
-Good job, man.
-Thanks, Perce.
Ready! Aim !
-Hey, whoa, Perce.. . Watch it!
-Hey!
You guys gonna kill the man who saved the world?
Great job. All you guys, take a lunch break.
Thank you!
So, the conquering hero returns, triumphant.
-Grover.
-Hey!
-You notice anything different about me?
-No.
You sure?
Anything that's improved about me?
No. What, you've been working out?
What, you get a new cologne?
You smell good.
-Look, man. l got my horns!
-l was seeing them the whole time. l mean, look at that thing.
You got little horns in your head.
-Right?
-Crazy.
Zeus came through, and now l'm Senior Protector, First Class, baby.
Congratulations. Definitely earned them.
Thank you, man.
Keep moving, keep moving!
Don't lose interest!
One foot in front of the other, and the next thing you know, you're running!
Percy.
You left the camp.
You disobeyed my orders.
Yeah, about that.
Which is why you're my favorite student.
You can receive all the training in the world, but ultimately, you have to follow your instincts.
Grace under pressure.
All right. Time to train. Go suit up.
You might be a big shot on Olympus, but down here, you're still just one of my students.
Move it.
Nice horns, Grover. l'm serious, man.
We talked, we wooed, we dined,
-we had a great time!
-Well, l'm happy for you, you know?
Persephone might really like me. l'm serious. l think you can handle this one on your own.
All right, Perce.
-Hey, Perce, awesome job, man.
-Hey, thanks.
-Good job.
-Thanks.
Good job.
Who's next? l think l'd like to give it a shot.
Welcome home.
Wait!
First rule of battle strategy.
Don't ever let your opponent distract you.
Sally, open the door!
Open up!
-You changed the locks?
-Yes.
So, here's your junk.
-You can let yourself out.
-Well.. .
How am l supposed to move all this stuff by myself?
Deal with it. l need a beer.
What? ''Do not open.. ."
That little brat.
Well, l may not live here anymore, but l'm still the king of this castle.
English - US
It's funny how you wake up each day
and never really know if it will be one that will change your life forever.
But that's what this day was.
The day I left the city to spend a week in the house where my mother grew up.
A day I'll never forget.
So many years have passed
Almost there. Feeling all right?
I'm okay.
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And look at the trees
I used to play there when I was a child
Oh, Hara.
How many times have I told her?
Wait here. All right? I won't be a minute.
Okay.
Hara! Your car's blocking the driveway again.
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Shawn? Where are you?
Shawn?
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.
Come meet Hara!
Supper is done and night has come
Let's have tea together near the fireplace
Nice try.
My house, my home ls so small, so pretty
My mom, my dad We are family
Joy everywhere
Hey, back off!
Hey! Go get your own!
Arrietty!
What?
You went outside again, didn't you?
How many times have I...
What happened to your room?
It's my own little garden.
If you ask me it looks more like your own little jungle.
Is that a bay leaf?
Where did you get that?
I wanted to wait and give it to you on your birthday, but...
Happy birthday!
This will last me all year.
But the bay tree is so far away.
If a bean saw you it would...
Beans don't scare me.
The beans should scare you.
That's what worries me.
The world is a dangerous place for a Borrower.
Your Aunt Eggletina wasn't scared either and she...
Was eaten by a toad. I know, I know.
If you don't like your gift
I can put it in my room.
No, no, I should keep it.
I have just the recipe for these.
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.
Oh, you don't have to.
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.
What?
Don't tell me you forgot!
Tonight's my first borrowing!
Look, Papa's home.
Papa. Papa, I made it all the way to the bay tree today.
And I used the leaves over my head just like you said.
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.
So, what I'm trying to say,
- if there was any doubt...
- There's a new bean in the house.
What?
- I know. I saw him.
- Arrietty, I told you to be...
Yes, Mama, I was careful and he didn't see me.
And he's much smaller than other beans.
Papa, you just have to let me come borrowing tonight.
We know nothing about this new bean.
But you promised this would be my night.
And I've seen him.
Papa, please, I am telling you, he's just a child.
And the children are more vicious than the grownups.
I'll be fine.
Well, the young beans do go to bed early.
Oh, thank you, Papa!
Pod!
The boy is very sickly and weak.
She'll be fine.
But...
Oh, and don't worry, Mother.
I'll get Papa back safely.
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.
She'll need to know how to take care of herself out there.
Without our help.
Sometimes I worry that we are the only Borrowers left.
What'll become of us?
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.
Your heart needs rest. No excitement.
- Is that clear, Hara?
- Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.
Whatever you need, Shawn, you ask Hara,
- and she'll get it for you, all right?
- Yes, Aunt Jessica.
Make him feel at home, Hara.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.
Don't you think you should wear something a little darker and longer?
No, I think this one's perfect.
So, I need you to get me some tissue paper and some sugar.
Oh, and promise, dear husband, you won't let our daughter get eaten or squashed like a bug.
Oh, please God. Please help them.
Don't worry about me. Everything's fine.
Okay, bye, Mom. I love you.
Oh, goodbye. Love you, too.
Stay close to your father.
I will
Do I get one of those?
Nope? Okay.
Arrietty!
Did you see that?
That's my girl.
Don't look down.
One step at a time.
All right. You need to hold this for me.
Okay.
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.
Arrietty!
- Let's go.
- Right.
It's so big.
Papa, what is this place?
This is where beans store all their food.
The sugar is over there.
When you get down there, wait for me.
Yeah!
Papa, you are great!
Yay!
There. That wasn't so hard.
- Where to now?
- Tissue paper. Then home.
Papa, look what I found.
Looks like someone got their first borrowing.
Careful with it, it's sharp.
Okay.
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!
Look down there.
Filthy rats.
You want to stay away from those things.
I'm not afraid.
I will cut them down to size with my sword.
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.
What is this place?
I've heard human beans call it a dollhouse.
Dolls are toys for beans.
And we are not toys.
These things are not for borrowing.
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.
Don't you think Mother would absolutely love that dresser over there?
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.
Borrowers take only what they need.
Don't be afraid, okay?
Hey.
I know it was you in the garden.
I knew I saw you.
My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.
Was it you?
Was it?
Please don't go.
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
He might have seen me out in the garden today.
We all make mistakes.
So we'll just have to be extra careful now.
Best not to tell your mother about this.
You know how she worries.
Right.
I'm very proud of you.
A lesser Borrower would've panicked and run away.
Well, we're home.
Safe and sound.
Is everything okay?
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.
This old light gave out halfway to the kitchen.
No.
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up on the sugar.
That's okay.
I'm just happy you made it home.
It wasn't a total loss.
Arrietty, why don't you show your mother your first borrowing?
What a beautiful pin.
Okay. Off to bed.
Night, Mama, Papa.
She looks so worn-out.
Should I make us some tea?
Shawn, come inside.
You'll catch your death of cold.
What did you say?
Why would he do that?
I think he was just being nice.
It's the same cube of sugar
I dropped in his room last night.
Pod, what does she mean, she dropped it?
Do not touch it. Do you understand me?
It's a trap.
I just know it. They're going to trap us like cockroaches.
Homily, let's try not to get hysterical, okay?
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!
We'll probably have to move now.
Goodbye, old table.
We had so many fun times together.
Let's not say goodbye to anything just yet.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I told you that young bean would be trouble!
But no one ever listens to me.
Thank you, Arrietty.
Smart girl, doing this when the sun came out.
Or maybe I have a smart mama who taught me.
You're a good girl.
If you've got this,
I think I'll go lie down a bit.
Okay.
Is that you from last night?
No, wait. Don't go.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Please leave us alone.
We don't need your help.
But can I please just talk to you?
No! Human beans are dangerous.
Whenever we're seen, we have to move.
My parents said so.
So you have a family. That must be nice.
You don't have a family?
Yeah, I have one.
But they sent me here to get the care and attention I need.
Because they're both very busy with their work.
Sorry to hear that.
Anyway, my name is Shawn.
What's your name?
What do they call you?
Not that it's any of your business, but it's Arrietty.
Arrietty. Arrietty.
That's a beautiful name.
Maybe we could be friends?
Could you at least come out so I can see you?
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.
I won't hurt you, I promise.
Help me! Help me!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What in the world? A crow!
Oh! Attack! OW!
You get out right now!
What got into that bird?
Don't think I've ever seen one behave like that.
Maybe it's nesting season or something.
I don't know.
Looks me to like it was after something.
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.
Which I'll have to replace, of course.
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?
Your aunt said for you not to get too excited!
Should I get your medicine?
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.
Nesting season?
Well, Shawn, you have a nice, long rest now.
Papa!
I hear you visited the young bean.
I'm sorry.
I went to ask him to leave us alone.
But I really don't think he intends to hurt us.
Many Borrowers have lost their lives thinking the same.
It must never happen again.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
We'd better start looking for a new home.
The boy knows that we're here.
Are we safe?
Delivery. Package for you, ma'am.
Thanks for the drink, Hara.
It's pretty hot today.
Do you happen to know of any good pest control companies?
Pest problem?
Here's one.
"Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination."
1-800... Oh, hang on.
So you got yourself a mouse problem?
Maybe it's mice, maybe it's little tiny people.
Strange things have been happening here and I know why.
That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I mean, when Hara told me,
I just couldn't believe it.
Why on earth would a crow try to fly into your room?
Were you frightened?
No, I wasn't scared.
Hara came and chased it away
And it's a good thing I came in when I did.
That bird had huge wings and claws...
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara, considering Shawn came here for a little peace and quiet and tranquility before his operation.
Yes, ma'am. Forgive me.
I'm sorry, Hara.
I don't mean to be short with you.
But why his mother chose this time to go away on business is just beyond...
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother here to look after you.
You know, not so much lately.
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped, but honestly, why couldn't she be here when her son needs her so?
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing that miniature house in my room.
And the detail's amazing.
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.
That beautiful little house belonged to your mother.
She had to leave it here when she moved away to go to college.
It was Mother's?
Your grandfather had it specially made because he was hoping it would be a lovely home for the little people.
What?
That's right.
Little people who lived in the walls.
He was quite obsessed with them.
People laughed, of course, and called him mad.
But your mother, she believed him.
They worked on that house together for hours.
And he told her they would come, but of course, they never did.
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any tiny little people in your room?
Can't say that I have.
I think it's why your mother doesn't like to come here any more.
Too many memories of wishes that never came true.
Can we look inside it?
Yes!
You know, I haven't looked inside it in quite a long time.
Hara, could you be a dear and turn off the lights?
Ma'am.
So many years have passed
This is the living room.
Your grandfather had all of this handmade by a real furniture maker in England.
Isn't that just insane?
Look at the attention to detail.
They really were preparing it for someone to live in.
And just in case you don't believe what I'm saying is absolutely true, have a look at that room right there.
Come in the garden
What a kitchen!
And look at the trees
Everything in it a miniature of the real thing.
That oven actually works.
You could bake real cookies.
Some really little cookies.
What a pity their dream never came true.
It really would've made a lovely home.
Settled down there long ago
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And sit on the grass
I used to sit there when I was a child
Ivy and moss
Little daisies
Covered the lane long ago
You know, Mother, we've had these same pictures for years.
Wouldn't you like some new ones?
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.
And I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.
Besides, there's no point in changing them now.
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.
Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?
What's wrong with me?
There he is!
Does he look eaten?
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?
I slipped and twisted my leg.
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.
Well, what is going on down...
Pod, you're hurt!
It was the cat, wasn't it?
See, I'm not crazy.
Get up here!
Does it hurt, Papa?
It's just a sprain. Go calm your mother.
I'll get some cold water. I'll be right back.
Everyone relax!
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.
Who's that?
I wonder if he has news about any of the other Borrowers.
Okay, I leave now.
Can't you at least stay and have some tea?
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.
Why don't you see if Spiller would like a cup of tea?
Won't you please stay, Spiller?
I've never met another Borrower before.
We can't thank you enough for your help.
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?
We're all alone here and we're starting to believe we're the only ones left. Are we?
This many.
Oh! Then cousin Lupy could still be alive.
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it? Can I see it?
You use this for your borrowing?
Give that back, Arrietty, before you shoot someone's eye out.
Okay. Go now.
Oh, but couldn't you stay a little bit longer?
I'll cook dinner.
Already got this.
A cricket leg!
Want some?
- Very fresh.
- No, thanks.
Bye.
Thank you, my friend.
I'll go with him. To see him out.
What were you doing out there in that storm?
I was looking for a safe route for our journey.
And now I know which route not to take.
Oh, Pod.
Spiller knows of more Borrowers a few days journey away.
There's a small river past the forest.
He's offered to take us on it.
That's great.
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.
And I'm sure it will almost be as nice as this.
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.
Or that I met anyone.
Hey, maybe next time you could bring your whole family with you.
No family. Only Spiller.
Well, we... We could be a family.
And when you come back you could stay for a family dinner.
Hara?
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.
You'll have to start over.
Why do we need such a big bag anyway?
Are we putting the whole house in here?
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.
Papa, can I come in?
- How's your leg?
- Well, better than that cricket's.
I'm serious.
Papa, why do we have to move?
Once a Borrower has been seen, the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.
Well, isn't it possible that not every human bean is dangerous?
Arrietty, before you were born there were two other families who were living in this house.
One family went missing, they just disappeared.
The other one moved away.
They were seen by humans.
And so, we have to do whatever it takes to survive.
But, Papa...
Oh! Oh, no!
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?
Mother!
It won't open!
Frame is buckled!
The wall!
Homily!
Homily, are you all right?
Pod, remember how I always said
I wanted a new kitchen?
More bills.
Remember, take only the things we need.
We can't possibly carry all of this.
And, Homily, don't take anything from the dollhouse.
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.
- You stay with your mother.
- Okay.
So you finally came.
Did you like your new kitchen?
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.
But it doesn't matter.
Because I came to tell you goodbye.
Can I turn around?
You're beautiful.
My papa said we have to move now.
We've been seen, and Borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.
What are Borrowers?
My mother, father, and I are all Borrowers.
We borrow things that beans won't miss if they are gone.
Just little things, soap, cookies, and sugar.
All things that we need to survive.
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.
I think my grandfather saw one of you once.
It's possible.
And it's my fault that you're leaving.
Niya! Niya!
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.
So, in my aunt's house, how many other Borrowers are there who are living with you?
It's just my father and my mother and me.
What about in other houses?
I'm sure there are some.
But I've only met one other so far.
You must be afraid you'll be the only ones of your kind who are left.
What?
Every year there's fewer and fewer of you, right?
Aren't you scared that soon you'll all be gone?
What a horrible thing to say!
I know that there's more of us because Spiller said so!
Who's Spiller?
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest, and he said that there are hundreds more of us.
That might be true.
But, you know, none of us can live forever, can we?
We all have to die sometime.
Why would you say something like that?
Because it's true.
I guess so.
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes things happen to us that are just beyond our control.
And when these things happen, there's really nothing you can do about it.
You just accept it and prepare for the worst.
I wish it wasn't that way.
But you can't live a life that's built on nothing but wishes.
It isn't practical.
Sometimes you just have to accept the hand of fate.
Oh, no, you don't.
Sometimes you have to stand up and fight for the things that are worth fighting for.
You have to survive.
That's what my papa says.
And so we're leaving even though it's dangerous.
And we are going to survive.
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.
We always have.
As long as we have each other to live for, we'll keep on living.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm actually the one who's going to die.
What?
There's something wrong with my heart.
They're gonna operate next week but it probably won't help.
That's terrible.
I've always been sick and I've had someone looking after me.
And that's why when I saw you,
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.
But I guess I messed up.
I made it worse. I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.
Now what on earth is this doing here?
Now how did you get in there?
There you are!
Mom!
What? What's wrong?
My mother, I think she's in danger.
No!
Give me that, you little thief!
Now we'll see who they call crazy.
And I bet there's more of you, aren't there?
Wait, no! Wait, wait! Wait!
I have to go help her.
But...
Oh, no! Help! No, no, please! Help!
Pod! Arrietty!
Let me out of here!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!
Arrietty! Help!
Watch it!
Let's see.
Now to find the others.
Let me out! No! No!
Something terrible has happened.
- Squeaky Klean.
- Yes, hello.
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.
Could you get out here right away?
I have a very unique pest problem.
- Is it mice?
- Oh, much worse than mice.
Do you want them exterminated?
No, I need you to trap them.
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!
Shawn! Shawn!
Arrietty!
My mother is missing.
Someone took the roof off!
I think a human bean got her.
Oh, Mama.
We will find her.
What?
Someone's locked us in.
There's a room next door. Hold on tight.
One step at a time.
Right.
It's stuck!
Wait.
I can get us in.
Oh, no, no!
Keep going.
What do you mean you're lost?
How can you possibly be lost?
It's the only road!
- Is it before the bridge?
- What bridge? There's no bridge!
Hara must have found it and opened it.
This is what I was afraid of.
Mother's been taken.
Are you okay?
Be careful. Shawn, please.
Where are those idiots?
Mother! Where are you?
Be wise.
They're supposed to catch pests.
But... HOW did you...
Hara.
Could I have some warm milk?
Okay! Wait just a minute.
Thank you, Hara.
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?
Cookies? Now he wants cookies.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Arrietty!
Over here!
Arrietty! Here I am! Here I am!
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Arrietty.
Oh, good. There they are.
They finally found the road.
The only road.
Another bean!
It's okay, Mother. He's a friend.
Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.
See what we see.
Yes, of course.
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?
Hara? Hara!
Oh!
What's going on here?
It's finally happened.
I found the little people.
Little people?
Yes! And what little robbers they are.
I wouldn't have believed it either unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.
It's remarkable!
It's the eighth wonder of the world.
And they're so teeny!
And they have a whole house full of things they've stolen.
Are you sure you didn't find the sherry again?
All these years you thought I was losing things.
But it wasn't me. It was them!
You didn't mention little people to the exterminators, did you?
No. I didn't want to scare them off.
Because I'm sure the house is just full of them.
You'll see when I show you.
This is their nest.
Nest?
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.
What?
It was here! It was here!
Where's that little teapot?
Okay, Hara,
I'm sending the exterminators away.
No! No, no! Wait just a minute.
Oh. Oh! I'll clean that up later.
Oh, please!
Hello, Shawn.
Can we come in for a minute?
It's open.
You'll see.
Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.
I don't know how they did it, but the whole thing is gone.
Not gone.
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait! I can prove it!
I've got one of them in a jar!
Poor Hara.
I think she's finally gone bonkers.
Do I smell fresh herbs?
Someone's been making tea.
It's just as my father told us.
There really are little people living here.
Yes, there are.
Your mother really should be here to see this.
She waited so long for some proof of them.
But they're not thieves like Hara said.
They're just Borrowers.
What?
I mean, they must be very frightened.
I just hope they're still here.
I hope so, too.
Excuse me. Ma'am!
Where would you like us to start looking?
Oh, are you all right?
Where did she go?
Who took my lady?
There are little people! There are!
Easy, 68$)'
And, no, I'm not losing my mind!
If I collapse, leave me behind.
With my tea kettle.
You're doing great. It's just a little further until we break for food.
Can't we just head back?
We can live with the rats in the compost heap.
Oh, no!
Let's hurry.
I can't do it.
Arrietty, you really should eat something.
We're gonna be walking at least until morning.
What?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like maybe it's all my fault that we had to leave such a wonderful house.
That's in the past.
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us, together.
I'm going outside for a bit.
Arrietty, don't go too far.
Niya.
Niya.
Just a little further.
Spiller!
That's the last of it.
Come on, we should keep moving.
Okay.
Mother, are you all right?
Arrietty!
Arrietty!
Shawn.
Arrietty.
We have to leave.
But Spiller says there's more of us not too far from here.
A two-day's journey, at most.
He thinks it might be my mother's family.
You won't be the last of your kind.
But how did you find me?
Niya here showed me the way.
Thank you, Niya. Take care of him.
I brought you something.
Now think of it as a gift from one friend to another.
Thank you, Shawn.
I have to go.
When is your operation?
Tomorrow. But I'm not scared.
Because someone taught me how to be brave.
So you'll remember me.
How can I forget you?
You protected me after all.
Arrietty.
I hope you have a happy life.
Goodbye, Shawn.
Arrietty, my heart is strong now because you're in it.
And you always will be.
Forever.
I never saw her again.
But the following summer I returned
and was happy to hear the people in the house down the road
talking about how many things in their home had gone
missing.
I'm 14 years old, I am pretty
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady
I live under the kitchen floor
Right here, not so far from you
Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams, oh, I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky and the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Now I know there's another world
Butterﬂies floating in the air
There is someone out there for me
Walking down, picket fence
Run my hands along the edge
And music plays in my head
Hear the song before I go to bed
When stars are bright outside my window
Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow
And I remember Oh, I remember
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I'd fly to you
All the way across the states
I'd fly to you
Hear me, the winter day
Oh, I'd follow the sun and come right to your door
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I will miss you in summer again when
I will miss you in summer again when
This is the Ardèche River in southern France.
Less than a quarter of a mile from here, three explorers set out a few days before Christmas in 1994.
They came along this way.
They were seeking drafts of air emanating from the ground, which would point to the presence of caves.
Eventually, they sensed a subtle airflow and began clearing away rocks, revealing a narrow shaft into the cliff.
It was so narrow that a person could barely squeeze through it.
They descended into the unknown.
They were about to make one of the greatest discoveries in the history of human culture.
At first, the cave did not appear to contain anything special, aside from being particularly beautiful.
But then deep inside, they found this.
It would turn out that this cave was pristine.
It had been perfectly sealed for tens of thousands of years.
It contained by far the oldest cave paintings, dating back some 32,000 years.
In fact, they are the oldest paintings ever discovered, more than twice as old as any other.
In honor of its leading discoverer, Jean-Marie Chauvet, the cave now bears the name
Chauvet Cave.
This is the road in the Ardèche Gorge leading to the cave.
It is early spring.
We have been given an unprecedented endorsement by the French
Ministry of Culture to film inside the cave.
From the first day of its discovery, the importance of the cave was immediately recognized, and access was shut off categorically.
Only a small group of scientists is allowed to enter.
They are archaeologists, art historians, paleontologists, and geologists, among others.
They are here to perform their studies together during a few short weeks at the end of March and the beginning of April.
This is one of the rare times anyone, with the exception of two guards, is allowed inside the cave.
The cave is like a frozen flash of a moment in time.
The reason for its pristine condition is this rock face.
Some 20,000 years ago, it came tumbling down in a massive rock slide, sealing off the original entrance to the cave and creating a perfect time capsule.
A wooden walkway leads to the entrance of Chauvet Cave.
The narrow tunnel through which the discoverers crawled has been widened and locked with a massive steel door like a bank vault.
Once we pass through this door, it will be locked behind us so as not to compromise the delicate climate inside.
For this, our first exploration into the cave, we are using a tiny, nonprofessional camera rig.
In this first narrow holding room, we are fitted with sterile boots and given safety instructions.
We have this, okay.
Once you've set this on the rope, you don't touch it.
Jean Clottes was the first scientist to inspect the cave a few days after its discovery.
For five years, until his retirement, he served as head of the scientific team.
Our guide leads us down a first sloping tunnel, which ends in a vertical drop to the cave floor.
Since our film crew has been limited to a maximum of four, we must all perform technical tasks.
In addition, our time in the cave has been severely restricted.
And I will take one light as well.
So it's five past 3:00.
We have one hour.
Apart from time constrictions, we are not allowed to touch anything in the cave or ever step off the two-foot-wide walkway.
We can use only three flat cold light panels powered by battery belts.
- You see how, when they made the passageways, they protected the stalagmites.
It's a nice touch.
Inevitably, moving along in single file, the film crew will have no hiding places to get out of the shot.
The first large chamber we come to is the original entrance to the cave.
In prehistoric times, before the rock slide, daylight must have illuminated this.
- So on the left when we arrived inside the cave, you can see the entrance, and that was the archaeological entrance.
People came into the cave level, not like us, down a ladder.
And then the cliff collapsed.
And then we've got the rubble from the cliff.
From outside, you cannot see it.
From inside, you can.
Over there, you've got the dots, the red dots.
Those are the red dots which I saw first when I came into the cave, big dots made with the palm of the hand.
Well, here we have... - we have a big cave bear skull, right?
Male, probably.
And you'll see many others.
You see, in this big chamber, which is a really huge... - it's the biggest in the cave... - there are no paintings except right at the end.
So this is probably relevant, because when the entrance was still open, there must have been some light here.
So they put the paintings, really, in the complete dark.
See here.
This is a cave bear painted in black.
The paintings looked so fresh that there were initial doubts about their authenticity, but this picture has a layer of calcite and concretions over it that take thousands of years to grow.
This was the first proof that it was not a forgery.
- A beautiful horse here, one of the most beautiful in the cave.
And what is touching is that it looks as if it had been done yesterday.
Look how fresh it looks with that technique.
And here we have, behind the horse, there are two mammoths, big mammoths.
And here you can see cave bear scratches, and the cave bear scratches are not the same color.
They look like they might have been made
5,000, 10,000 years earlier.
We are coming here to one of the great spots of the cave, which is the famous panel of the horses.
It is of the... - one of the size of a small recess.
And this small hole there is where water comes out, gurgling, after there's been something like a week of rain.
And that probably explains why all those animals were painted around that hole.
It's one of the great works of art in the world.
For these Paleolithic painters, the play of light and shadows from their torches could possibly have looked something like this.
For them, the animals perhaps appeared moving, living.
We should note that the artists painted this bison with eight legs, suggesting movement, almost a form of proto-cinema.
The walls themselves are not flat but have their own three-dimensional dynamic, their own movement, which was utilized by the artists.
In the upper left corner, another multilegged animal.
And the rhino to the right seems also to have the illusion of movement, like frames in an animated film.
The painters of the cave seem to speak to us from a familiar yet distant universe.
But what we are seeing here is part of millions of spatial points.
Today scientists have mapped every single millimeter of the cave using laser scanners.
The position of every feature in the cave is known.
This is the shape of the cave in its entirety.
From end to end, it is about 1,300 feet long.
This map is the basis for all scientific projects being done here.
- We are working to create new understanding of the cave through that precision, through scientific methods, but that's not, I think, the main goal.
The main goal is to create stories about what could have happened in that cave during the past.
It is like you are creating the phone directory of Manhattan.
Four million precise entries, but do they dream?
Do they cry at night?
What are their hopes?
What are their families?
You'll... - we'll never know from the phone directory.
- Definitely.
We will never know, because past is definitely lost.
We will never reconstruct the past.
We can only create a representation of what alre... - what exists now, today.
You are a human being.
I am a human being.
And here when you come to that cave, of course there are some things.
I have my own background.
What is your background, if I may ask?
- Well, I used to be a circus man before, but I switched to archaeology.
Circus?
Doing what?
Lion tamer?
- Well, mostly... - not lion tamer, but mostly unicycle and juggling, yeah.
The first time I entered to Chauvet Cave,
I had a chance to get in during five days, and it was so powerful.
Then every night,
I was dreaming of lions.
And every day was the same shock for me.
It was an emotional shock.
I mean, I'm a scientist but a human too.
And after five days, I decided not to go back in the cave, because I needed time just to relax and take time to... -
To absorb it?
- To absorb it, yeah.
Yeah.
And you dreamt not of paintings of lions but of real lions.
- Of both, of both, definitely.
Yeah.
And you were afraid in your dreams?
- I was not afraid, no.
No, no, I was not afraid.
It was more a feeling of powerful things and deep things, a way to understand things which is not a direct way.
- Uh, sorry.
Silence, please.
Please don't move.
We're going to listen to the silence in the cave, and perhaps we can even hear our own heartbeats.
These images are memories of long-forgotten dreams.
Is this their heartbeat or ours?
Will we ever be able to understand the vision of the artists across such an abyss of time?
There is an aura of melodrame in this landscape.
It could be straight out of a Wagner opera or a painting of German Romanticists.
Could this be our connection to them?
This staging of a landscape as an operatic event does not belong to the Romanticists alone.
Stone Age men might have had a similar sense of inner landscapes, and it seems natural that there's a whole cluster of Paleolithic caves right around here.
- The Chauvet Cave is just here at the top of this cliff, but the Chauvet Cave is also associated to this natural feature, this beautiful arch called Pont d'Arc.
Maybe this Pont d'Arc, in the mythology of the people, was not only a landmark but a mark also in the imagination, in the stories, in the mythology that was important for them to understand the world.
But what kind of world was it for Paleolithic people back then?
- 35,000 years ago, the Europe... -
Europe was covered by glaciers, and in this glacial Europe, you have to imagine a climate dry, cold, but with sun also.
That was important.
In this place, for example, you have to imagine woolly rhinos, mammoths along the rivers.
In the forest, you had Megaloceros deers, horses, reindeers, bisons, and also ibex or the antelopes moving.
So it was very rich.
The biomass in this part of Europe was very important for the development of human but also carnivores.
So you have to imagine lions, bears, leopards, wolves, foxes in very large numbers.
And among all these carnivores and predators, human.
Could it be how they set up fires in Chauvet Cave?
There's evidence that they cast their own shadows against the panels of horses, for example.
- The fire were necessary to look at the paintings and maybe towards staging people around.
When you look with the flame, with moving light, you can imagine people dancing with the shadows.
Like Fred Astaire.
- Fred Astaire, yes.
I think that this image dancing with this shadow is a very strong and old images of human representation, because the first representation was the walls, the white wall and the black shadow.
The presence of humans in the cave was fleeting like shadows.
Bear skulls everywhere, but these skulls belong to the cave bear, a species, like the mammoth and the woolly rhino, that vanished from the face of the Earth long ago.
Tens of thousands of years of patient water dripping has left a thick coating of calcite on this skull.
It now has the appearance of a porcelain sculpture.
In all this menagerie of bones, there's not a single human specimen.
Scientists have determined that humans never lived in the cave.
They used it only for painting and possibly ceremonies.
Michel Philipe has studied the bones of Chauvet Cave.
Caves constitute a favorable place for the preservation of bones.
As the result, there are a lot of bear bones.
Overall, this represents
99% of the finds, but there are also some wolves.
We have two skulls and have several bones.
We have a few ibexes.
We have a magnificent skull on the wet sand with calcite, quite lovely.
When you shine light on it, they are calcite crystals that glisten.
It's truly quite lovely.
There are some horses as well.
There is a cave hyena.
What else is there?
There's also an eagle skeleton, a golden eagle, practically whole, but it may be a little more recent, carried in by the run of water and wedged against the big rocks at the edge of the waterway.
So you can see its bones spread out over ten feet in length.
Our goal is not only to say what bones there are, but we also try to understand if they lived there, if they were moved, how they were transported.
Did the bears bring the bones?
There are several bones that have been chewed on a little.
So it could have been the bears or the hyenas.
All the scientists are lodged in a nearby sports complex.
Although they each have their special field, they compare and combine their findings.
We were interested in the work of these two.
Carole, Gilles, can you explain about what you're doing here?
- Yeah, oui.
In the cave, we are trying to reveal the contours of underlying designs that are hard to follow with the naked eye.
Because we are not supposed to touch the wall, we take a series of photos that we put together in a mosaic.
We are trying to achieve a maximum of detail.
Then we take a transparency, and we put it on top of the photo.
And then we trace the underlayers of engravings.
Later, we return to the cave and check against the contours all the designs that we can see and all the markings of the bears as well so that we can understand each figure and event.
We have bear scratches and then a magnificent drawing of a mammoth done by finger and other scratches done over the mammoth.
So their succession is very important to understand what took place.
On the computer, one can see three phases.
The first dates 40,000 years back in time, the one when the bear scratched the walls.
Then a second phase with drawings stretching over eight feet in height, therefore made with a stick, followed by the main phase sometime around 33,000 years or less.
It starts with the scraping of the wall to get to the white of the rock.
After that, the first figures were put in place.
These were the two rhinos attacking one another at the bottom.
After that came the three bulls.
- And finally, they ended with a series of horses going from top to bottom and, in the final phase, adding this very beautiful horse that confronts the viewers when they arrive in the cave.
- When you do a synthesis of the composition, there is a kind of dynamic circular movement going from the bottom to the right, towards the center, like a circle.
It obviously creates a very strong dynamic that is reinforced here by the oblique movement of the horses.
- It's the force of the contrast, the fact that they've played with the contrast and with the shape of the wall.
It's like an easel.
They've used the surface, made use of the material, and mixed material to create this very strong impression.
By comparing all the paintings in the cave, it seems certain that the horses of this panel were created by one single individual.
But in the immediate vicinity of the horses, there are figures of animals overlapping with each other.
The striking point here is that in cases like this, after carbon dating, there are strong indications that some overlapping figures were drawn almost 5,000 years apart.
The sequence and duration of time is unimaginable for us today.
We are locked in history, and they were not.
Despite this blurring of time and the anonymity of the artists, there's one individual who can be singled out.
Dominique Baffier is a scholar of Paleolithic culture.
Here on the right, she examines the cluster of palm prints with her colleague
Valérie Feruglio.
We are currently working on this large panel that was covered with positive handprints.
We've been able to put forward, as evidence, the number of positions the individual assumed and his movements.
He started by crouching, and then he stretched out to reach all the way to his highest palm prints.
This panel is comprised of the prints of a single man who must have measured roughly six feet tall.
A single human.
- 1 meter 80 tall, that's big.
Was it only one person?
- Une personne, une personne.
One person, a person measuring six feet.
And you'll notice on these prints that there is a very significant detail.
He has a slightly crooked little finger.
And that's extraordinary, because it gives a physical reality to a prehistoric individual who, 32,000 years or more ago, came to the cave before us.
And what is even more surprising is that you'll find traces of him deeper in the cavern.
We'll be able to recognize him by his crooked little finger, because he printed his hand farther in the cave.
So we can follow this man's path.
Madame Baffier took us on a tour.
She serves as the custodian of the cave, and her rules of engagement are strict but entirely reasonable given the precious and fragile nature of this unique place.
- You have cave bear tracks, the forepaws and hind paws.
These are the longest cave bear tracks currently known in any cave.
It's very sparkly.
There are crystals that glitter.
Here at this junction, we have the panel of the panther.
You can see the drawing of a panther, which is the only one known in Paleolithic wall painting to date.
Here we've arrived at a place where concretion growth has been very important.
On the ground and walls, you can see that rimstone calcite ridges have covered everything in sparkling formation, a kind of cascade...
With waves.
Here you have... - take a look... - a bear vertebra which is entirely coated in calcite and held by calcite crystals.
In front of us, on the wall, you also have an overflowing drapery-like concretion and here a kind of niche where you can see the traces of ancient red paintings, which have been washed away by water seepage.
And this is where you find extremely original images, like this insect-shaped one or this one shaped like a butterfly or a bird in flight, that you also find on this rock pendant hanging from the ceiling large and very small coupled with two vertical ocher stripes that follow the pendant's contours.
So here we are in front of the large panel of red paintings, also an extremely intriguing item: this mound of stones.
You can see that it didn't fall from the ceiling.
It was prehistoric man who grouped the stones here, but we do not know why.
On this panel, you have, first of all, a little rhinoceros with a large horn and a stripe on the abdomen.
Also, you have a whole series underneath of positive handprints.
And over there, you can see the hand of the man who printed his palms in the first room of the cave, because you can recognize his crooked little finger.
In other words, we've followed him here.
Here there are some animals and here the front part of a big rhinoceros with a very large horn.
Here you have torch swipe marks.
The men would light their way with a torch, and when the wood was too burnt down, they would scrape the torch against the wall to rekindle the flame.
The traces are fresh, because you can see these small fragments of coal that have fallen.
One of these tiny fragments was tested by radiocarbon dating.
This torch was swiped
28,000 years ago.
- And here we have a painting that is quite interesting, because it represents a couple of now-extinct cave lions.
You have here the male.
He's behind, the larger one.
He's outlined in a single stroke more than six feet in length.
And in front, you have the female.
She is smaller and seems to rub her flank against the male.
And this representation of the cave lion has allowed us to shed light on a mystery, because archaeozoologists didn't know whether the cave lion had a mane, like the lion today living in Africa.
And this representation of a cave lion, more than 30,000 years old, shows us that they didn't have a mane.
Look at the outline of his head, which is clearly delineated.
And this is, without a doubt, a male, because we've got the scrotum right here under the tail.
This is one of the most beautiful panels in the cave, along with the lion panel at the far end.
And here we can see the technique of prehistoric man, but you can also see their keen knowledge of the animal world.
They tell us stories.
Here you have an ensemble of horses, but their open mouths suggest that the animals are whinnying.
That is to say that these images become audible to us.
You see that the two rhinos there are fighting.
You can see all the signs of fury towards each other, the movement of their legs, which are thrown forward, and you can almost hear the sound of their horns colliding against each other in the movement of the fight.
Here you have another story, a story of lions, a male courting a female who is not ready for mating.
She sits and growls.
Look, you can hear the female growling.
She's raising her lips.
She's baring her teeth.
She is not happy.
And here, to finish off, you have the flight of this bison.
We hear the hooves.
We can make out multiple legs indicating its movement.
It is escaping from this alcove, following this auroch.
Madame Baffier takes us down to the farthest chamber of the cave, the mysterious chamber of the lions.
There is a serious level of toxic CO2 gas emanating from the roots of trees, which seeps down into the cave through the porous limestone.
Our time is even more constricted in this location, and there is no possibility to get close to the paintings.
- Unfortunately, there are things you won't be able to show in your film and you won't be able to see.
You can't get closer.
That is the case with these absolutely marvelous paintings in the farthest chamber, this grouping of lions.
It is especially the case with this rock pendant, where the lower portion of a woman's body has been painted.
That is, you have her pubic triangle and her legs that separate, starting at the knee, which diverge and are reminiscent of the well-known small early Stone Age statuettes from archaeological digs in the Swabian Jura in Germany.
We can only see part of this lower half of a female body, because we cannot access the other side of the pendant.
You can not walk on these grounds, because they are too fragile.
You would destroy the charcoal remains.
You would destroy the tracks left by the bears and the humans.
So you'll have to make do with this partial image.
If you completed the other half of this female body with its other legs symmetrically, you could see that it is connected to a bison head that would have a somewhat human arm.
And here we are, some 30,000 years later, with a myth that has endured until our days.
We can also find this association of female and bull in Picasso's drawings of the Minotaur and the woman.
This is the only partial representation of a human in the entire cave.
For the time being, the other side of the rock pendant must remain unreachable for us.
The people who created this are equally enigmatic.
Of the few things they left behind, practical items like flint tools can be more easily read.
- All the boxes...
The local museum is filled with artifacts from the region.
- Because we have made some excavation in the site.
But Jean-Michel Geneste
- can only lead us to a handful of findings from Chauvet Cave.
- Things are preserved.
You have only two, three boxes in this area, but I have prepared for you some...
To shed light on the enigmatic female image, he has prepared some similar figurines from other regions.
- Very precious for archaeology.
You can see, like in this Willendorf Venus, it's a copy made in limestone, found in Austria, from the same period.
In the Chauvet Cave, you have only the lower part of the belly preserved.
It's embedded in a bison.
There seems to have existed a visual convention extending all the way beyond Baywatch.
- No male representation very clearly found but this lion man.
It comes from a site,
Hohlenstein-Stadel in Swabian Alps.
What is amazing, it's a mixture between an anthropomorphic shape, a human body, and the head of a lion.
Is it the spirit of the... - of a lion in a man?
Is it a marriage?
Is it a new being?
That's a question we can ask to this reproduction.
What the people who lived in this valley left behind is their great art.
It was not a primitive beginning or a slow evolution,; it rather burst onto the scene like a sudden explosive event.
It is as if the modern human soul had awakened here.
Even more astonishing to consider is that at the time,
Neanderthal man still roamed this valley.
But there must have been other forms of artistic expression, like music, for example.
For this, we had to look around in nearby regions.
Southwestern Germany
30,000, 40,000 years ago was connected to this valley through an ice-free corridor.
It should also be noted that the Alp Mountains were covered by 9,000 feet of ice, binding so much water that the sea level was 300 feet lower than today.
A hunter could have walked from Paris to London crossing the dry seabed of the English Channel.
Walking 400 miles in this direction would lead you to the Swabian Alb of Germany.
There, in the museum of Blaubeuren, we find replicas of the best-known Paleolithic Venuses.
But this one, the Venus of Hohle Fels, stands out.
Found in 2008, it is sensational for its age.
- The Venus from Hohle Fels is probably the oldest depiction of any kind of figurative object we know at all.
It's the earliest representation of a human being, and it's the absolute root of figurative depiction as we know it.
Later on, we see a range of animals being depicted.
We can think of the animal depictions in ivory here or the fabulous depictions from Grotte Chauvet of mammoths, of lions, and we can see a very clear connection between the Swabian finds and the depictions in Chauvet.
What's also fascinating is that at this time,
40,000 years ago, we see evidence for musical instruments, a range of personal ornaments, mythical depictions that clearly show that these people had a religious concept evolving the transformation between humans and animals.
This here is the original statuette carved from a mammoth tusk.
- If we look at the Venus of
Hohle Fels a bit more closely, we can see very clearly, for instance, that the figurine has no head, right?
Instead of a head, the figurine has a ring.
It was perhaps worn at times, suspended on a string of some sort.
Also, the sexual attributes are key, which clearly link this depiction to ideas of reproduction, fecundity, sexuality, ideas that are absolutely essential to all of humanity also today.
It's also important to realize that at this time, much of Europe was occupied by Neanderthals.
So we're dealing with the critical phase in human evolution where two forms of human beings are testing their boundaries.
And what we find over and over again is that Neanderthals, although they're very sophisticated, they never had this kind of symbolic artifact ever.
This small ivory mammoth was also found near Hohle Fels cave.
And this beautiful horse comes from the same region.
They also found fragments of flutes.
We asked Dr. Conard to show us an original.
- The ivory flute is really a remarkable artifact that Maria Malina discovered a few years back, and I think what's extremely important is that we realize that archeology today is not a heroic adventure with spades and picks but high-tech scientific work that's done with incredible detail.
Really millimeter by millimeter, the sediments are removed in these deposits the age of Grotte Chauvet and our sites, between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago.
And this detailed work allowed Maria to identify a whole range of finds that she was able to piece together.
Maybe you can explain how that worked out.
- Yes, we were doing an inventory of all the artifact pieces.
Some of the pieces came from the 1970s, from the first years of excavation, and these were really small pieces.
You can see here in this picture.
The tiny ivory pieces remained unexplained for a full three decades.
- And 31 pieces had a very significant look.
We found pieces with a part of the finger holes and with notches on the side, and with these pieces,
I thought already that it could be a part of an ivory flute.
Of course, the question was very important how this flute was made.
And you can see here on the long axis there is a split going all over the flute, and inside the two halves, they hollowed the flute out.
And these little notches along this axis, along the split helped to refit these two halves together very precise.
This flute is only one of eight in all so far recovered from this area of southwestern Germany.
The caves here have no paintings but yield many other objects of art.
- In this cave, the Geissenkloesterle cave, many very important findings from the Ice Age were made.
We found some little ivory statues of bear and mammoth... - a very tiny mammoth, very lovely.
And in 1992, I was part of the excavation team.
People lived here about 30,000,
40,000 years back in time, and in that time, it was very cold here, because the Alp Mountains were covered by a glacier about 2,500 meters thick.
And in the valley down there, reindeer and mammoth were passing, and it was very cold.
And that's the reason why
I'm dressed up like an Inuit.
We presume that in this way, the people of the Ice Age were clothed by reindeer fur and boots made of reindeer fur and reindeer leather, because otherwise you couldn't stand the cold.
One of the most important finds we made in this cave was a very tiny flute made out of the radius of a vulture.
Astonishing on this flute is that is... - that it is pentatonic, and this is the same tonality we are used to hear today.
And if you like, I'll try to play some small tunes for you.
And when I first reconstructed the instrument and tried to play some tunes,
I came across these ones.
Sounds a little bit like Star-Spangled Banner.
Back in France, near Chauvet Cave, explorers using more primal techniques in search of still-hidden underground chambers roam the landscape.
Professional cave explorers have techniques for finding underground chambers, because there are air currents.
So they use the back of their hands or their cheeks to feel for a faint draft of air that may be coming out of the cave.
I'm trying to do things differently, as I have the habit of using my sense of smell in my profession.
So I try to sniff the smells coming from the interior of a cave.
Here, I didn't smell anything except the exterior landscape.
Outside you can smell the earth, the wild thyme, the ivy.
You can smell a range of things but nothing specific related to a cavern that's been closed for thousands of years.
This is my personal technique, because I design perfumes.
It's a matter of trying to experience it in a different manner.
So I've been... - I've always created perfumes, and most notably,
I was president of the French Society of Perfumers for some years and...
There are plans to build a theme park for tourists with a precise replica of the cave a few miles from here.
This replica may even contain a re-creation of the odor of the prehistoric interior.
- Evidently, the odor you can smell right now is quite attenuated.
It is very subtle.
There are not many emanations, but our imagination permits us to try and reconstruct the scene, the scene with its odors from 25,000 years ago, with all the animals that would have been found there... - bears, wolves, perhaps even rhinoceroses, and man... - the presence of their lives, meaning burnt wood, resins, the odors of everything from the natural world that surrounds this cave.
We can go back with our imagination.
Herzog:
With his sense of wonder, the cave transforms into an enchanted world of the imaginary where time and space lose their meaning.
These crystal formations take thousands of years to grow.
The artists of the cave never even saw them, as many of them only started to form after the landslide sealed the entrance.
In a forbidden recess of the cave, there's a footprint of an eight-year-old boy next to the footprint of a wolf.
Did a hungry wolf stalk the boy?
Or did they walk together as friends?
Or were their tracks made thousands of years apart?
We'll never know.
Dwarfed by these large chambers illuminated by our wandering lights, sometimes we were overcome by a strange, irrational sensation as if we were disturbing the Paleolithic people in their work.
It felt like eyes upon us.
This sensation occurred to some of the scientists and also the discoverers of the cave.
It was a relief to surface again aboveground.
Back outside, we ask Jean-Michel Geneste about hunting techniques of Paleolithic people millennia before the invention of bow and arrow.
- The Ohauvet Oave
Aurignacian people hunted a lot of really big games.
They hunted everywhere in France and Europe.
In the settlement, we found a lot of bones of reindeer, bison, horses, and sometime mammoths.
So they developed very specific hunting technology.
For example, the system of the Aurignacian bone point is very ingenious.
It's a bone point on a wooden shaft.
The piece of the bone point is very strongly associated to the shaft.
It's a system using a fork and a piece inside.
So it's very strong.
It has been made and developed to kill bison or horses like that.
It's very aggressive, and it's also very strong and powerful.
This kind of weapon and spear were thrown not only by hand, like that, because it's not very efficient, but l... - we suspect that very... - in the beginning of the Paleolithic, they developed the technology of the spear thrower.
A spear thrower, it's at the beginning only a hook, sometime a tooth, a piece of antler, like this one, on a long handle.
It's elongated arm gave a lot of power, like that, and also at the same time, some precision to keep... -
I just... - to give the spear a good direction.
So I will show you.
Yes.
You see, the spear with a flint point, but to use this, it's necessary to have a small depression at the back of the spear.
We suspect that sometimes they used feathers to a very... - to keep the direction at the moment of the throw.
I will try to show you how to kill a horse.
Okay.
His efforts may not look very convincing, but this is a powerful weapon.
Spearheads have been found deeply embedded in the shoulder blades of horses and mammoths.
- You see the fly?
It's very straight, and it's 30 meters.
But stay here.
The Paleolithic man was better than you, I guess.
- Oh, I suspect.
It could be really difficult for me with such a shot to kill a horse, really.
By mid-April, scientific research has ended for the year.
Now we are allowed full access to the cave, but even that is restricted to a single week, four hours a day.
The famous cave of Lascaux had to be shut down because the breath of scores of tourists has caused mold to grow on the walls.
We enter Chauvet Cave aware that this may be the only and last opportunity to film inside.
The mystery of the Minotaur and the female began to unfold when our guides allowed us to mount a small camera on a stick with which we reached out.
The bison seems to embrace the sex of a naked woman.
- Traditional people and, I think, people of the Paleolithic had very probably some... - two concepts which change our vision of the world.
They're the concept of fluidity and the concept of permeability.
Fluidity means that the categories that we have... - man, woman, horse, I don't know, tree, et cetera... - can shift.
A tree may speak.
A man can get transformed into an animal and the other way around, given certain circumstances.
The concept of permeability is that there are no barriers, so to speak, between the world where we are and the world of the spirits.
A wall can talk to us, or a wall can accept us or refuse us.
A shaman, for example, can send his or her spirit to the world of the supernatural or can receive the visit, inside him or her, of supernatural spirits.
If you put those two concepts together, you realize how different life must have been for those people from the way we live now.
Humans have been described in many ways, right?
And for a while, it was Homo sapiens and is still called
Homo sapiens,
"the man who knows."
I don't think it's a good definition at all.
We don't know.
We don't know much.
I would think Homo spiritualis.
The strongest hint of something spiritual, some religious ceremony in the cave, is this bear skull.
It has been placed dead center on a rock resembling an altar.
The staging seems deliberate.
The skull faces the entrance of the cave, and around it, fragments of charcoal were found potentially used as incense.
What exactly took place here, only the paintings could tell us.
- If you want to have an understanding of it, you must go outside of the cave.
I mean, you must start from the cave and then go outside.
How far outside?
Where would you go?
- Well, I would say everywhere but with... - to have a look at different culture would be a very good way to better understand how different culture could have coped with rock art, for example, in Australia, in North America, or in South Africa.
Aborigines in Australia who lived until recently almost like Stone Age people.
- Sure, for example, because they used to paint and to create rock art until the 1970s, and in some places,
I think there still are some traditions of creating rock art.
Well, of course it has changed since the beginning of the century, when they were discovered, but it can tell us different ways of looking at rock art which are not our way of looking at rock art.
Do you have an example?
- Yeah, sure, of course.
In north Australia, for example, in the 1970s, an ethnographer was on the field with an aborigine who was his informer, and once they arrived in a rock shelter.
And in that rock shelter, there were some beautiful paintings, but they were decaying.
And the aborigine started to become sad because he saw the paintings decaying.
And in that region, there is a tradition of touching up the paintings time after time, so he sat, and he started to touch up the paintings.
So the ethnographer asked the question that every Western person would have asked.
"Why are you painting?"
And the man answered, and his answer is very troubling, because he answered,
"I am not.
"I am not painting.
"That's the hand, only hand, spirit who is actually painting now."
The hand of a spirit.
- Yeah, because the man is a part of the spirit.
Do you think that the paintings in Chauvet Cave were somehow the beginning of the modern human soul?
What constitutes humanness?
- Humanness is a very good adaptation with the... - in the world.
So the soc... - the human society needs to adaptate to the landscape, to the other beings, the animals, to other human groups and to communicate something, to communicate it and to inscribe the memory on very specific and hard things, like walls, like pieces of wood, like bones, this is invention of Cro-Magnon.
And how about music?
- And... - yes, and also things, mythology, music.
But with the invention of the figuration... - figuration of animals, of men, of things... - it's a way of communication between humans and with the future to evocate the past, to transmit information that is very better than language, than oral communication.
And this invention is still the same in our world today... - with this camera, for example.
On the Rhone River is one of the largest nuclear power plants in France.
The Chauvet Cave is located only 20 miles as the crow flies beyond these hills in the background.
A surplus of warm water, which has been used to cool these reactors, is diverted half a mile away to create a tropical biosphere.
Warm steam fills enormous greenhouses, and the site is expanding.
Crocodiles have been introduced into this brooding jungle, and warmed by water to cool the reactor, man, do they thrive.
There are already hundreds of them.
Not surprisingly, mutant albinos swim and breed in these waters.
A thought is born of this surreal environment.
Not long ago, just a few ten thousands of years back, there were glaciers here
9,000 feet thick.
And now a new climate is steaming and spreading.
Fairly soon, these albinos might reach Chauvet Cave.
Looking at the paintings, what will they make of them?
Nothing is real.
Nothing is certain.
It is hard to decide whether or not these creatures here are dividing into their own doppelgaengers.
And do they really meet, or is it just their own imaginary mirror reflection?
Are we today possibly the crocodiles who look back into an abyss of time when we see the paintings of Chauvet Cave?

Open Season 3
Woo hoo!
One day to guys trip.
Hey Boog!
When are you gonna bring your fine self down here to fix up our habitat, huh?
Just as soon as I finish helping Riley with the dam.
There we go.
You all set for tomorrow?
It's gonna be awesome!
Sorry Boog!
I gotta build this dam.
No guys trip for me.
What? No guys trip?
No guys trip?
Have you lost your mind?
I gotta finish this or
O'Grady will tear my eye.
Yeah. That's okay, it's cool.
We'll think about you while we're making this and talking trash.
I'm not sure that you can fit in there, jerky!
Hey, I don't know, maybe the whole batch?
Alright you troops!
- Let them fly!
- Oi!
Hey, you need anything else, just let me know.
We gotta get on the road bright and early tomorrow, baby.
Uh, about that, Boog.
I've got a wee problem.
With all the new kids,
I'm not done collecting my nuts.
Believe me, lad.
I'd rather be skittling with you.
Than getting my minds with these boffin goons.
Yeah, right.
- Ant! Guys' trip?
- No can't do, bugger!
I got too many. Responsibilities.
No problem.
- Birdie?
- Sorry Boog.
Great.
Surfs, Danny? Let me guess.
Uh. We cannot go suddenly.
That's what I thought.
That's okay.
At least I've got Elliot.
He won't let me down.
It'll be like old times.
Me and he.
The original partners.
Sshh. Quiet.
Koo! Koo-koo!
Giselllal Gesalital I was just looking for your dad.
Rabbit fight, huh?
Yeah, count me in.
Where's your little bro?
You'll never find me here.
Alright, let's see.
Where to hide?
Ahhh "X" marks the spot!
- Got you!
- Gotcha!
You're out!
You gotta work on the landing.
Great game, dad.
Yeah, great game, you guys.
That was awesome.
Alright, when your mother asks.
You'll say I lost for protecting you from a wild boar.
And a sidekick ferret.
Mom's gonna kill you.
I was attacked by a ferret.
- No, you weren't.
- Dad.
Stop telling Elvis to lie.
Mom says you're not supposed to do that.
That wasn't a lie?
It was uh.
It was a reverse!
A stretch of a non-actual. Boog.
Buddy, back me up here.
Just tell the truth. It's the only way to roll.
Exactly what I was saying.
And stay in school.
And don't talk to strangers.
And never run with scissors.
So Boogster, you wanna take the kids fishing?
Actually, Elliot.
- I'm kinda getting ready for guys'.
- I see where you're going with this.
It's time to teach survival skills.
- I was hoping to.
- Grab a baseball.
- Well I..
- Acupuncture? Origami?
- Elliot. Elliot.
- Yoga? Sumo wrestling?
- Elliot!
- Pods. What happened to pods, right?
I tell you what. Just take them.
Do whatever you want.
I'm trying to get ready for guys' trip!
So are you definitely going?
- How could I miss it?
- Yeah, I knew I could count on you.
Remember to tell Boog that you can't go on guys' trip.
I meant to say I have to babysit the kids.
'Cos Giselle's going to see her mother.
That's okay, E.
Don't sweat it.
You've got family obligations.
And sometimes, you've got to cancel.
Sometimes?
Don't you mean always?
How long have you known about this?
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?
Oh, just forget it.
- I don't know why I even bother.
- Boog!
Oh, he'll get over it.
Just like he did when I canceled the fishing trip.
I guess rabbit fight's over.
Pretty much.
Mother! I was attacked by a ferret!
I guess me and Elliot. We weren't as tight as I thought we were.
Oh hey.
You're not gonna cancel on me too, are you?
'Cos bears gotta stick together.
You know what I like about you, dinkleman?
You're always there when I need you.
And don't worry.
We're gonna have a blast tomorrow.
This will be the best guys' trip, ever.
You'll see!
Elliot.
Three meals a day.
And everyone in bed by sunset.
I know.
And make sure to apologise to Boog when he gets back.
- Okay.
- For what?
For some things you said yesterday.
And for some things you forgot to say two weeks ago?
Kids.
Keep an eye on your dad.
- Bye mom!
- We love you!
- Safe journey!
- Have fun!
Have fun with the old dadillacs.
What was that, Elliot?
I love you.
- Say hi to your mother for me.
- I will.
What are we gonna do first, hm? Father?
Don't worry, kids.
I've got a tons of things planned.
Right.
When does uncle Boog get back, again? it's gonna be fun!
Then he realised, that his best one horn friend in the world had abandoned him.
And worse than that?
All that was left on his hand was.
A hook!
This is very fun.
Well, I guess it could be worse.
Who am I kidding?
This whole thing was a bad idea.
It's not a guys' trip with only one guy?
I mean. It's not like I changed?
He's the one who changed.
He's the one who flakes all the time.
But he has a family.
You have to be more understanding.
Yeah.
Understanding my butt!
You're better off without that under privileged broken horn plank, cancel it.
But you guys are partners.
Partners?
Who cares, baby?
That deer ain't got nothing on us.
Yeah! You know, you're right!
You know, what would be great to eat just about now?
Another woo-hoo bar.
And I know just the place to get it.
Beautiful.
Now all we need are the balloons and you'll be ready to go!
Don't worry, baby.
I'll never let anything happen to you, ever again.
Hello. Ladies!
Don't you all love my finest evening?
Hooty-O's?
Hoo- Hoo.
Coco Ding bats.
My favourite!
Honey? Now that's more like it.
There you go, buddy.
Don't worry.
Nobody's driving.
Hey, rabbit!
You ain't leaving 'til you eat those
Coco Dingbats.
This is the best guys' trip ever!
Me and Dinkleman agree with you one hundred percent!
Rabbit loves Dinkleman.
Dinkleman loves rabbit.
Was what that, Dink?
Can't go on guys' trip because
I'm married?
No deer on guys' trip.
Bla bla bla guys' trip.
Dink?
We gotta go somewhere where folks don't let us down.
Place where we fit in.
A real home.
A place like that.
With other bears who totally get us.
If only we knew what that was.
Wait a minute.
A place where no one lets you down.
You stay here, rabbit.
Keep your eye on the stash.
Doug.
Why do you always let me down?
Circus in two days.
You could at least pretend to care.
Oh, was I supposed to catch you?
How classy.
Rehearsals over!
I'm telling you, Alistair.
One of these days, I'm gonna give that diva a piece of my mind.
I'm sure you will.
I mean. Back where I came from.
I know. The zoo.
No.. No.. No...
For the last time.
It's the Wild Animal Park.
There's a difference, you know?
Anyway.
When I was in the Wild Animal Park.
No one treated me like that.
All the animals worshiped me.
There was one grizzly.
One king of the jungle.
Me.
Oh... See....
Just as soon as we get out of here.
We're gonna find a place just like that.
And I won't forget your help.
I'll be king.
And you'll be.
Well, we'll find something for you to be.
- Oh?
- OK, here's the plan.
You lift the cart.
And we'd both squeezed through.
Go on.
Give it a try.
You want me to pull something?
Have I ever done you wrong before?
You promise to take me with you?
Of course I will.
- You're the Yin to my.
- Yang.
What? No!
What kind of word is Yang?
I was thinking more like.
You're the 'Yin' to help me get 'Yout'!
Now let's hurry up before someone sees us.
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
A little help?
Please?
Now you're supervising, that's good.
You want something done?
You gotta do it yourself.
Too heavy!
Doug!
Ssshh. Someone will hear you.
Yeah, I know.
We need another set of arms.
Hey, I'm upset too.
You can't take this on personal?
We all have our limitations?
Oh, hey!
That wheel's on your hoof.
Doesn't that hurt?
Now where were we?
Oh yeah.
We need another set of arms.
Question is.
Where to find it?
Protect me!
What in the world?
Ho! Another grizzly in the flesh!
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.
Yo, you got some kind of thing coming out of your neck.
I know. It's called Alistair.
Hola! Comme es ta?
What do you want, bear?
The name's, Boog.
Man! Another grizzly?
This will be so great!
We'll go fishing, have rabbit fights.
Be best friends!
She's here too?
Hold up. Are you talking about Ursa?
She's difficult to catch.
Bear-vana? Listen Boog.
We're busy here. Go back to where you came from, okay?
Back where I came from?
Back there.
I'm the only bear.
- The only bear?
- Yeah.
- All the other animals? They...
- Worship you?
What?
Oh yeah, that sounds fantastic.
Didn't you hear me?
I said I'm the only bear.
You must be so lonely.
The only lonely bear.
That's very sad.
I promise I wouldn't do this but.
Right. Right. Sounds terrible.
- I'm fighting this one.
- Give me just a second.
What are you doing?
Don't you see this is our chance?
We get the bear to help us move the carts and we're out of here!
But the circus will miss us!
They'll send a search party!
You're right.
I'll go.
- But you. But you.
- Trust me.
I got it all figured out.
Listen, Boog.
You and me? We're gonna do all those things you talked about.
Fishing, camping.
- Oh, and rabbit fights?
- Sure!
Girls, rabbits, whatever you want.
So here's what I'm gonna do for you!
I'm gonna find a place where we can all be best friends together.
Really?
You'd do that for me?
In a bear-minute.
We're grizzlies.
Gotta look out for each other.
So, here's the thing.
We gotta swap places so the circus doesn't know I'm gone.
But I come back tomorrow night.
And you, me and Ursa.
- We go on a kind of..
- Bears' trip?
Yeah, sure.
Bears' trip.
Together.
Alright! I'm in.
Great.
Now hold still for just a second.
Keep it down and stop moving
Oh yeah.
This is gonna work!
Now what about me?
Hey, like you said.
If they figure out you're missing, they'll send a search party.
Don't worry. I'll bring someone back tomorrow night to swap with you.
When I say three, lift as hard as you can.
Got it?
Got it.
One, two, three.
You'd better hide that doll so nobody gets suspicious.
- What doll?
- That one.
In your hand.
You mean Dinkleman?
He ain't no doll!
He's my bro!
My boy!
My Blouse
Right.
Hey, so where's that all for only bear place you were talking about?
You know, just so I make sure
I stay away from it.
Over the mountain, pass forest and down by the stream.
Cool! Thanks!
See you tomorrow night!
When can I meet Ursa?
Perhaps it's better to do that in the morning.
When you're a little more.
Awake. No?
I don't know why I'm so tired.
Oh.. Si...
Could it be the chocolates?
So, what are you?
- Some kind of Iama?
- I'm an Argentinian Carnelian.
What's an Argentinian Carnelian?
It's a kind of lama.
Nice digs.
I just want you to know.
That it is very sympathetic.
That you came all this way.
Just to meet another grizzly.
Oh, Mr. Weenie, mommy's going to miss you so much.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
Now remember.
Play nice with everybody.
Ready for your third dinner?
Yumm.
Mommy and Bob are going to look for Big Foot.
Okay, sugar plum?
Remember.
Mommy loves you!
Is she always like this?
Yeah, but it's not so bad.
And my friends!
It's so good to see you all!
- Hey, you too!
- You look great.
Weenie, it's been ages.
Thank you for it.
Why?
Who is our new friend?
I'd like you to meet Nate.
Nate, meet Mr. Weenie.
He's a strong silent type.
You!
Are trying my patience!
Come on! Work you!
Work! Work! Work!
- Fussy. -Yeah?
- Nine?
- Yeah?
- Nine? -Yeah.
- You know, some animals are much kinder once they've been. - Fixed!
Oh... Hi...
Mr. Weenie.
Come and sit with me.
We can watch the television together.
He's not still mad at me, is he?
I think his angry days are behind him.
If you know what I mean.
One night only!
The great Maslova Family Circus!
Hey! That's Boog!
I don't remember Boog's fur being so light and spiky like that.
Listen, I know Boog as 'Zat' guy Boog!
If that is Boog, he sure looks terrible.
Of course he looks terrible!
They're trying to kill him!
This is horrible!
Look out, Boog!
Poor Boog.
We have to do something!
Let's go save him!
Oh, I wanna go save him.
Oh please, please, please, please.
We must hurry!
How? Have you noticed?
We're in the air stream.
There's no way out of here.
How are we gonna save him?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No.
But if we climb out of that vent.
I could track us to the circus.
To save Boog.
Yeah, the coast is clear!
Keep it moving, keep it moving!
Keep it moving.
Relax, Fifi.
Remember what the vet said about staying calm?
You stay calm!
With 500 pounds of animal on your back!
Nice stitches!
Marshmallows?
Slightly burned.
Mixed with enoki.
Robust poop!
What's with you always with the poop?
The circus! This way!
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Come on.
Who's up for a rabbit fight?
Can't we wait for uncle Boog to get back?
He was supposed to be home last night.
Yeah! Do you think he's still mad at you for ditching him on guys' trip?
He can stay on guys' trip forever as far as I'm concerned.
What does he think?
That I can just, you know.
Leave the kids alone, while Giselle visits the mother in law of doom?
- Dad.
- Children needs constant attention.
- You ignore them for one second.
- Dad!
Come here, Little E.
You're not going rogue, son.
Dad, let's just play, okay?
Good idea.
We don't need uncle Boog.
Rabbit fights are way more fun without him anyway.
You're out.
Gotcha.
New game?
Well, that's enough fun for one day.
Now can we wait for uncle Boog to come back?
Boog, Boog, Boog.
From now on, we will no longer mention his name.
Okay ....
So...
What do you wanna play next?
Well, how about a game of.
Shrub.. Jump?
Diving?
Where we jump into the nearest shrub.
And uh.. Come on Elvis,
I'll show you.
Dad! No!
It's poison ivy!
It's part of the game.
Whoever scratches first.
Loses!
Lwin!
Ooh, that has gotta hurt.
Well played, Little E.
Okay, who's hungry?
Dad.
We need uncle B.
I mean.
We need someone.
Taller.
- To reach a branch that high.
- Not so.
Who knows more about getting honey than adeer, huh?
Come here, Little E.
Spine so frail.
Dad?
Quiet, Gisella.
The slightest sound could wake the bees.
Bees!
At least getting stung will take his mind off the itching.
Yeah.
Hey! Keep it down!
Too much chocolate.
Hey, why did you do that?
Just hold still.
Give a little poof over here.
A tease over there.
A pull, a tug.
A comb.
Make it snappy.
I am a genius.
Get a camera, because you are.
Perfecto!
The spitting image.
They will never know the difference.
Now, let us go dance.
Doug is here everybody!
Remember what they say about not talking.
If you don't have something nice to say?
She's beautiful.
I see what's going on here.
What are you talking about?
Nothing's going on here.
Okay.
I'm serious.
Hm-hm?
Hey, I'm just happy to meet another grizzly. That's all.
Whatever you say.
Tiger. Show me your strength.
So uh...
Hey, Ursa.
- I thought I'd introduce myself, because you know. - Doug?
Why is voice low?
Are you again. To be sick?
Oh! Um.
- I'm not actually.
- You'd better not be.
No!
I mean, um.. Hey!
Watch it with that stick, little dude!
Come on, Doug. Arms up!
Why must we go through this everyday?
A little bribe, perhaps?
It's chocolate! You love chocolate.
- Come on, arms up!
- Please.
Now, we are ready.
Let's begin.
Right foot up!
Left foot up!
- Slower.
- Faster.
Jump!
Squat leg!
- Stop!
- Wildly bear!
Hit it!
You can really move.
You ready?
Hey, I was born ready, baby.
Wait, I'm not. I'm not ready for.
Why can't you just once be there when I need you?
Oh wait!
Ursa, let me explain.
- I'm not.
- Doug!
I don't want excuses.
Maybe if you just.
Cut the lift.
- That's all.
- No, wait!
I could've caught you.
It's just that I'm not.
- Doug. Thanks a lot!
- Yeah, thanks Doug, okay?
He only thinks all about himself.
- Listen, I'm not.
- Doug.
That was worse than yesterday.
Oh, wait!
Ursa.
Uh.. Give her some time to cool down maybe, okay?
But I have to tell her who I really am.
There will be plenty of time for that.
When we are all living in Bear-vana.
Trust me.
If there is one thing I know.
It is women.
And.
Musical theater.
But that is not important right now.
What is important.
Is that women.
Do not like to be rushed.
Look, Alistair buddy.
I wait in here until
Doug is back at sunset
And everything is gonna be fine.
Alright, Alistair.
If you say so.
Alright ladies, buckle up.
- One two three four.
- Look, I'm flying!
This must be the place.
Bear-vana.
Finally.
I'm the only bear.
And all the animals are gonna worship me.
Just like they did Boog.
Boog's back, everybody!
- Boog!
- Thank goodness, he's back!
- Yes.
- About time.
Yeah, I know.
It's good to finally be here.
You look terrible!
And your voice seems worse!
Yeah. Complete Gaga girl.
What are you talking about?
My voice is as smooth as silk.
Must have been rough out there.
Rough? Yeah, it was rough alright.
That's why I look terrible.
My voice sounds like Ka-Ka.
Now why don't you all run along and fetch me some goodies?
Goodies smoothies.
Boog!
Here.
Hold these for a second.
How dare you show your face around here?
After what you've done?
Gotta go polish my...
Uh. Me too.
Me three.
Yeah.
Dad.
I thought you were going to apologise?
Apologise?
If anyone should apologise, it's him.
To me.
For.
For.
This!
And this!
Then this!
Well?
The silent treatment.
Well, I too can play at that game.
Only I'm not playing.
I was fine before I met you.
Oh, sure, I was tied to the hood of the car.
Sorry uncle Boog. Dad hasn't been the same since you've been gone.
Now look at me. A pathetic shell.
And all because of you!
It's too late now, Boog.
This deer.
Has sailed.
Sorry uncle Boog.
I hope you guys can work things out.
Dad!
We're all glad you're back, uncle Boog!
That is one seriously messed up deer.
That's better.
Good to be myself again.
Time to hit the road.
Doug?
He's not coming back.
Give him a chance.
It's still early.
Besides, he's a grizzly.
We're family.
It's all a lie.
There is no Bear-vana.
Come on, Alistair. He'll be back.
Grizzlies hate each other.
It's in their genes.
What are you talking about?
Grizzlies don't hate each other.
The mens do!
They are to macho.
Doug lied so you would help him escape.
And I...
I was his partner in crime!
In crime!
Who have I become?
If Doug's not coming back.
Then Ursa won't talk to me.
What am I doing here?
This one goes to my girlfriend.
Out on the Pampas.
I'm all alone.
My heart.
Has crushed to nada.
I'm all alone.
It won't work.
Don't bother trying.
If you try that.
You'll go flying.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
That was. Well, you were.
That was beautiful.
You are making fun.
No! No! Really!
Listen, Ursa.
I know you've got no reason to believe me.
But I gotta tell you the truth!
I'm not Doug.
I'm Boog!
You are right.
I have no reason to believe you.
Look. I never should've come here.
I know that now.
This was all a big mistake.
Why is fur dark?
Like I told you.
I'm not Doug.
I'm Boog.
I was just you know.
Looking for a place where I belong.
So, if you just give me a hand moving one of the carts.
I'll be out of your hair.
Oh, now I see truth.
You want me to help you escape.
And ruin circus!
- No!
- You are pathetic, Doug.
No, Ursa, seriously.
I just.
You twanged?
No.
Okay, 'cos I thought I heard my name.
It doesn't matter.
I. Just want you to know that.
I am sorry.
I really thought Doug was my best friend.
That's okay.
I suck at picking best friends too.
Are we good? You and me?
Yeah!
We're good.
Excellente.
I promise I will never tell you
I'm coming back when I'm not.
And I promise I'll make time for you..
Even when I got a bunch of important things going on.
- Amigos?
- Yeah!
Amigos.
This is nice.
Talking like this.
We will do this every night.
A kind of. Guys chat.
Si?
Guys chat?
I like that.
Good, okay, so...
Since you're stuck here.
A little advice, okay?
The way to a woman's heart.
Is through.
Her.
Art.
The circus is coming!
How can a circus be coming?
A circus is a tent.
With posts, stuck in the ground!
This is a highway!
Oh no! No!
Thank you.
We made it.
That wasn't easy.
- This still doesn't look like a circus.
- Strange.
It sure smells like it.
No!
I need those! I need those!
I need them!
There you go, baby.
Just like new.
- Hi, how's it going, Stew?
- So far so good.
I got your balloon order.
How could you have been so wrong?
I don't know?
Maybe it's allergy.
Wait a minute.
Look in the window!
The circus poster will tell us where to find Boog.
Quickly!
Before we are seen!
There you go, baby.
Wait 'til you see the super balloon bouquet I whipped up for ya.
Nice exploration of negative space.
Hurry up! I should be on top!
- I should be on the top!
- A little closer!
- Don't wave!
- Nine, a little closer.
Meat snack.
Look, they're colored.
It's perfect replacement.
I need those.
Hey! Stop that!
We have been discovered!
You just. Hey!
Come back here!
No!
I'm gonna get you!
Get back here!
Gotcha!
Meat Snack!
Meat Snack.
Come back here!
You knew you were going to this guys' trip.
For two whole weeks before you told him.
Maybe I should go talk to him.
Hold it right there, big fella.
So you forgot.
If he was a real friend.
- He'd understand.
- You're absolutely right!
Boog is a real friend.
Your life is a mess without him.
By mess you mean awesome!
No, I mean mess!
- Awesome!
- Stop that!
- Enough!
- Dad?
Girls.
I was just.
Not important.
So, is it breakfast time again?
Lunch? Dinner? Play time?
Is it a dope problem?
What's a dope problem?
Nothing, what's up?
Mom always says that.
You should try and work things out.
You're upset with me?
You're right!
I've been a complete failure.
How can you ever forgive me?
We were talking about you and uncle Boog?
You should go talk to him.
Or maybe we should go and get uncle Boog.
Bring him. Here.
And you're not a complete failure.
You're a dad.
We love you no matter what.
Father?
It's okay.
All for the taking.
Hey Boog! Can you help me with my digging?
Can you help me get my wife unstacked from the pine?
- What.
- Can you help me with my nuts?
- I mean...
- Thought we were gonna mark the perimeter?
- Hold on!
- What about our habitat?
- Yeah!
- Hey Boog, can you help me with thing?
Do you think dad and uncle Boog will ever forgive each other?
What's going to happen if they don't?
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
I'm not your servant!
I'm king of the jungle!
Well, technically the lion is the king of the jungle.
And this is the forest.
A jungle tends to be denser and hotter.
- Deer!
- What?
I travel.
Fine! Then I'm king of the forest!
Either way.
Things are gonna change around here.
You! Go get me some nice ripped berries.
And you two. Find me a good waterfall where I can have a nice soak.
And you Doily!
Riley!
Whatever!
You and your guys go build me a nice comfortable bed.
Up on that hill.
Don't you mean in your cave?
Oh, yeah.
My cave.
Move!
Better do what he says.
He's gone bluhnicaccasl
He has really lost it.
- Yeah.
- Could be stress.
Big mad bear disease.
It could be stupid deer disease.
Seriously? Is that going around?
Maybe we've all been taking him for granted a little too much.
Oh! Hello girls.
How long have you two been standing there?
We just uh.
Got here?
What is that?
Some kind of nervous tick?
Nervous?
Who's nervous?
What do you girls want?
We just wanted to say.
How glad we are that you're back.
Bye!
Hey. Perhaps Boog is uh. Changing
- That's not it.
- We change all the time, huh?
Just yesterday.
Deni, he's in love with foei gras.
Then I tell him what it is, and.
He can't talk, he can't sleep.
He saved me.
Can you just go and find our mom?
Please?
I'll be your best friend.
Alright, alright, you twist my wing.
But only because the two of you are so good.
Thank you Serge!
- You guys rock!
- Deni, follow my tail!
What do you think?
Your tie is a smart bow tie.
Perfecto!
I see you're sweating.
Nervous anticipation.
What are you talking about?
- I'm not sweating?
- Yes, you are.
I see a little drop of moisture on your upper brow.
Right there.
- Hello little sweat.
- Yeah, sweat.
Right.
Nothing to worry! You're gonna knock her out with the real you!
She'd be like. Doug!
Who is Doug?
I'm all about Boog, baby!
There is something different about Doug.
Looks like someone got a hair brush for birthday.
- Still think I'm Doug?
- Yes.
How about now?
What are you trying to prove, Doug?
That I'm Boog!
Let's try the ladder.
Oh, forget it.
- Well, can you ride.
- Unicycle?
Check this out.
See?
I'm Boog!
Look, I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.
But once you get to know me.
The real me.
- You might like me.
- Leave me alone!
Doug was afraid of heights.
If you're really Boog.
Why don't you come up here and prove it?
Don't give up.
Follow her.
She wants you to.
That's. Pretty high.
You're probably right.
That impressed a pretty girl.
- Hm.
- Just go!
One can't help but be moved, no?
Now you believe me?
I believed you when you ride the unicycle.
Doug couldn't do that either.
You mean you made me climb all the way up here for nothing?
Not for nothing.
You need to be punished for juggling the dog.
Boog.
What a nice name.
If you want to practice the dance.
Meet me outside.
You put a girl in grizzly!
Cats, tonight, you're gonna play your little whiskers off.
And a one and a two.
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...
You dance very well, Boog.
I practiced.
I figured you might trip me or something if I messed up.
Me?
I would never do that.
Yeah, but I might.
So you'd better watch yourself.
Oh, definitely looking good.
You are not like other bears.
Why is this?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because
I grew up with humans.
Really?
Me too!
I grew up in circus!
Me too!
Well. Kinda.
I mean, I used to do this show back in Timber Line.
It wasn't a whole circus.
But I juggled and stuff.
You and me.
We are not like other grizzlies.
We are not like.
Anybody else in the world!
That was so inspiring.
So moving.
So. So prof undo.
Let us retire to the caravan.
For our end of the day talk.
We should practice the lift.
I'd like that.
Come.
We will hook.
Over to the trailer.
Time to share.
Like the amigos we are!
I pulled something.
If just once I could perform the dance.
The way it was meant to be.
I would never need to perform it again.
Boogie!
What about the guys chat?
Huh? Yeah.
Ursa and I need to practice.
Doily!
Make sure you get that spot right by my third...
Ooh! Yeah!
That's it!
Sorry Boogster.
Just a little cramp at my neck.
Seriously?
Six pack, take some pride in your work!
Any chance we can take a little break?
A break? You all just had a break.
Like. Six hours ago.
What is going on here?
Giselle!
Thank goodness! You're back!
Now you can vent him.
Excellent!
Reenforcements.
You two!
Go get me some more berries.
And you! How about you start massaging my paws?
All this clapping is making me sore.
Now!
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about?
Boog would never yell like that.
Especially at fawns.
So who are you?
Who am I?
- If you haven't noticed, I'm.
- Boog!
I'm so sorry I let you down.
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Does that answer your question?
Giselle!
Oh, thank goodness you're back.
See?
Even the crazy broken deer knows I'm Boog.
Do you even know his name?
Of course I do.
It's. Uh.
Starts with an E.
E .... Emily?
Edward?
What about 2 L's?
Eleanor? Oh, whatever.
It doesn't matter what his name is.
All that matters.
It's that I'm a grizzly.
And I'm king of the jungle.
First of all, this is a forest.
I tried to tell him.
And second of all.
What have you done with Boog?
- Yeah!
- Where is Boog?
What have you done?
What difference does it make?
You would all do what I say.
I'm your Boog now!
Boog!
Boog, now that we're best friends again.
What do you say we go on guys trip?
Just the two of us?
He's not Boog!
Oops.
You're not Boog!
That's not Boog!
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought you were mad at me.
But now I know that you weren't.
Because you're not even you!
What a relief.
- Elliot?
- Yes, dear?
- Elliot!
- Oh, right.
What have you done with Boog?
He's locked away somewhere.
You'll never find him!
Especially after tonight, when they take him back to Russia.
Russia?
- Who's Russia?
- It's not a 'who'!
It's a 'where'.
And believe me.
You could walk for the rest of your life and never get there.
You won't get away with this!
No? Who's gonna stop me?
Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'm ready to talk.
I'm listening.
He's at the circus.
Just follow the search lights and you'll find it.
That's a good one.
What search lights?
Now let's go save Boog!
'Cos I owe him a big apology.
And because we miss him
And we want him to come home before they ship him off to Russia!
Yeah!
Imposter!
Sorry.
That Boog sure is one lucky guy.
I Wish I had a friend like that.
Wait.
I do have a friend like that.
Thank goodness, that nice man at the Punimart called us.
You poor dear's.
Must have been hungry to go all that way to find food.
But don't worry.
Mommy won't make that mistake again.
That's enough, isn't it, Bob?
Maybe we should stay.
No, no, you're right.
My snugly, woddly and I need this time apart.
Kick me out, Bob, before I change my mind.
Well, we might as well dig in, since all hope is lost.
Wait for it, wait for it!
Oh, Meat Snack!
Excuse me for a moment.
I hate cats.
So do I.
Fi! Look! The circus!
I've seen of these lights before.
Wait!
You mean the circus is just behind those trees?
Yes! My new old friend!
Boog is closer than we ever imagined.
Alistair?
What's wrong?
And once again.
I have been tossed away.
Hey, hey, Alistair.
Come on, buddy.
Don't bother me!
I sat in my trailer all night.
Waiting for the sweet sound of paws.
Knocking on my door.
But no.
All I hear.
Is the sounds.
Of loneliness.
What are you talking about?
Have you forgotten?
Already?
Do I mean so little to you?
It's time for guys chat
Just us on guys chat.
You blew off guys chat!
You blew it!
Oh man!
I totally forgot!
See, I was with Ursa and.
Well, you know how it is when you're all caught up and.
Look, Alistair.
Sometimes it's hard to find time for everything.
And everyone that's important to you.
Alistair.
Alistair.
You're right.
I've been a bad friend.
You might not believe this, but.
I know exactly how you feel right now.
And I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
Seriously?
That's what friends do!
Amigos!
Don't worry!
We're gonna have plenty of time for guys chat.
Once we get back to Russia.
Huh? Russia?
Oh, sure!
Oh, you're gonna love it there.
All the snow and the ice.
You're gonna love the way it pierces your skin.
And makes your...
Oh, I get excited just to think about it.
Plus, it's only 5,000 miles away.
So you can visit home every year or two.
Or three.
Maybe four.
You're gonna be a polar bear.
That's what you're gonna be.
Let's go, troops!
Look alive!
Uncle Boog never took us on a rescue mission.
Yeah, I know.
This is way cool!
You should go out of town more often, mother.
Elvis, I don't think so.
Release the emergency break.
We are moving!
Hang on to your little horses.
Steady. Steady.
Alright everyone, steady.
I can't see a thing!
- Why?
- Out of the way! Out of the way!
Steady. Steady.
Oh no! Oh no!
- They're gone! They're gone!
- What's gone?
- Turn left, right?
- Right!
No! Nine! I said left!
No! No!
No!
Oh.
I'm calling it a day.
It's worse than I thought.
They strap him to wheels and light him on fire.
Then point and laugh!
It's torture at its worst!
We have to rescue Boog before.
They make him wind into tiny, whiny rope of death!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Wait!
Their fortress is inpenetrable. it's hard to break into.
So here's what we're gonna do.
McSquizzy and Buddy, you work on the left flank.
Kids, you run the charging manoeuver on the right.
Ian, Giselle, you find a chisel, a toothbrush.
And as many maracas as you can carry.
- Then.
- Or. What about this instead?
Serge and Danny, you find the exits.
Mom and Ian, you stay and look out here and here.
While the rest of us sneak in here.
And rescue Boog.
Yeah!
That's ridiculous!
The tent's too big.
We need at least 6 more of us.
To pull that off.
Oh, my friends!
Mr. Weenie?
What are you guys doing here?
We are here to safe Boog!
- Kick some pals!
- So are we!
It's destiny.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I'd like to welcome you
To the great Moslova Family Circus!
Everyone clear about what to do?
- Yes!
- No problem.
Uh, what was the middle part again?
Dad ....
Everyone spread out and try to find Boog.
When you see him.
- Go get him.
- Alright, let's move it out.
- Be careful, girls.
- Okay, mom.
So. Come here often?
Don't even think about it.
Stop acting like such a troop.
I really missed you guys.
Yeah, me too.
A full house! This is fantastic!
- Are Ursa and Boog ready to go?
- They're ready.
Boog.
Where did the rest go?
You! You must be the new recruits!
Yeah, yeah.
That's what we are.
Come on, let's go.
- Any sign of Boog?
- No, I can't see him from here.
We need to get to higher ground.
Like that.
Man, I can't wait to get back and see Alistair.
Back to my own cart.
Home cooking. Three meals a day.
I don't know, Bob.
This expo is a bust.
When we head back to the air stream.
Did you hear that?
He's close by.
I can smell him.
Let me try the bathing call.
Big Foot!
Ladies and gentlemen.
The miraculous balancing...
Stanley! Do you see him?
I'm not seeing him.
Please. Welcome.
The juggling pugs.
Fifi! Do you see him?
Great!
Boog!
Come on.
Let's find a different spot.
You'd think we can't miss a 1,200 pound fat bear!
Ursa!
- Wait!
- Come on, Boog! Show them what you got.
I can't see a thing from back here.
Any sign of Boog?
Ursa!
You're doing great, Boog.
Oh, you see him? Good!
Let's get him!
Mika! You have returned!
Time to go back into space.
It's dark in here!
Let me out!
I'm coming, Buddy!
Mr. Weenie!
Look, Bob, proof aliens do exist!
- Keep up, handsome.
- Ursa!
Where are you, uncle Boog?
Hi Fifi!
Ursa!
- Pretty!
- Oh no!
I hate dogs.
Uncle Boog!
Tell dad he's right there!
Ursa!
- Ursa!
- Boog!
What are you doing?
You need to get to your place.
I need to talk to you about Russia.
It's so far away and.
- I'm not sure if I...
- Boog, we need to focus here.
It's almost time for the big lift!
- I know, but...
- Come on, Doug!
Please don't make this difficult.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Gesalital
Uncle Boog is right there!
What are you saying? Right? Left?
Left? Rig ht? Left?
Boog!
Elliot!
Wait, what are you doing here?
Thank goodness, I found you!
We're here to rescue you.
Elliot, I can't go!
Doug! Pay attention!
Ready?
Go, Doug, go!
Boog!
It's worse than I thought.
He's been brain washed.
And now, Ursa.
The great bear in disguise.
Featuring the flying nano plates.
Boog.
Are you sure you can do this?
I don't know.
Russia's a big step and.
No, I mean the lift.
I've never been able to do it before and... if you are not 100 percent sure you can do it.
I'll be ready.
Plan B.
Smash and grab.
Smash everything and grab Boog.
Don't bother with me.
Just another circus dancer.
You ready?
Come on, Ursa!
Go for it!
I got you!
Boog!
Okay guys, smash and grab!
Please hold me.
He did it!
Oh, she finally did it.
You got me.
Boog!
- Uncle Boog!
- You're safe! We're here to save you!
Rescue accomplished!
Yes!
What are you all doing here?
Come on, let's get moving before your captors return.
Hold up, Elliot!
I appreciate you all trying to rescue me, but...
I need to talk to Ursa.
Ursa?
Who's Ursa?
I am.
So. What?
She like your new best friend or something?
No, I am.
What?
You have 2 new best friends?
I canceled one guys trip and the next thing I know.
I've been replaced.
Twice.
Elliot, buddy.
I'm sorry.
You haven't been replaced.
You'll always be my BFF.
Are you apologizing?
Yeah.
I forgive you.
But only because you forgave me first.
Now, let's ditch the goat and the babe and hit the road!
I am not a goat!
I am a Lama.
Really? 'Cos you look more like an
Argentinian Carnelian.
And now.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The musical scaling of Alistair!
Come on, Boog.
- Without me?
- No.
We gotta get out of here.
- Elliot, Alistair.
- Do it!
- Guys..
- Come on.
Hold on, come on you guys.
- I'm not letting go:
- Alisa
Stop!
Everybody just hold up!
Ursa.
My beautiful Russian bear.
I came here looking for a place where I belong.
But what I found was so much more.
What I found.
Was you.
Oh, Boog.
Come with me.
Come to the forest, make me the happiest bear on earth.
Oh, Boog.
I really want to.
But I can't.
A Russian circus without a bear is like... no circus at all.
I could never do that to them.
You should go.
I can see that they are more than just your friends.
They are your family.
And family should always stick together.
Come.
I will help you move the carts.
Boog.
You should stay.
I learn something too!
That friends want each other to be happy.
So if she makes you happy.
Then you should be with her.
Elliot.
That was really nice.
You're awesome, dad.
Yeah!
I know.
These are tears of joy!
So beautiful!
Alistair!
You came back for me?
Oh, buddy! I'm glad to see you!
Oh, it's good to see you too!
I'd like to breathe.
Sorry, I tricked you, Boog.
Sometimes you don't know what you have until you've lost it.
I know exactly what you mean.
- Ursa.
- Doug.
Come on! We're late for our show!
And now!
Ladies and gentlemen.
The duet you've been waiting for.
Looks like the circus has a bear.
Looks like you do too.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!
Let them go.
But the circus!
The circus.
Will be fine.
Or try to work to Rome.
A place that we call home.
You sure you're cool with this?
Absolutely!
It's important to make time for your friends.
Even when you have a babe around.
Oh yeah!
Punch it in, baby bear.
Dinkleman, I didn't know you were a girl!
Have fun, Elliot!
And don't forget to keep an eye on Elvis.
Let's get move on!
Guys trip waits for no deer!
Or bug.
That's right, son.
You're old enough to take part in the sacred tradition that is... guys trip.
# On the road again #
#Just can't wait to get on the road again #
# I've always loved making music with my friends #
#And I can't wait to get on the road again #
He's not coming?
He's gonna join us later.
Maybe we'll get some answers, Bob.
Like if Mr. Weenie was probed or not.
# On the road again #
# Going places that I've never been #
# Seeing things that I may never see again #
#I can't wait to get on the road again #
Hey Alistair.
Aren't you glad to be going back to Russia?
Oh, truth said it, amigo.
I hope I get to see my girlfriend.
Carmen I'm coming for you!
# On the road again #
# Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway #
#With the best friends #
# it's now the world keeps turning our way #
#In Norway#
What is it?
It's just a little something we set up for you.
This is so sweet.
Thank you for making me feel welcome.
Alright, ladies. Look alive!
Oh, brother.
Oh, arrest me, officer.
- Got it.
- Shake it, shake it.
To the right. Two three four.
Who's up for the rabbit fight!
Yeah.
Look out, baby.
Guys trip!
It doesn't getting any better than this.
Just me and my best friend in the world,
- having a good time.
- You got it, Boog.
BFF till the end.

Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?
Justin!
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.
Justin, you get back here right now!
No, stop!
-No, no! Stop him!
-Go back! Don't climb!
Wait, wait.
Hold on. Easy, little boy.
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!
No, no, no! There he goes.
Justin!
I've got him! I've got him!
Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza had been stolen and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.
There is panic throughout the globe as countries and citizens try to protect their beloved landmarks.
Law enforcement still has no leads, leaving everyone to wonder, which of the world's villains is responsible for this heinous crime?
And where will he strike next?
I'm having a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Despicable me
Morning, Gru!
How you doing?
Hello, Fred.
FYl, your dog has been leaving little bombs all over my yard, and I don't appreciate it.
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.
Unless they're dead.
I'm joking!
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.
Okay. Yeah.
Steamrolling whatever I see
Despicable me
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Despicable me
You've got to be pulling on my leg!
Hello!
Cookies for sale.
Go away. I'm not home.
Yes, you are. I heard you.
No, you didn't. This is a recording.
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.
Goodbye, recorded message.
Agnes, come on.
Kyle!
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.
Gru!
Dr Nefario.
I know how you must be feeling.
I, too, have encountered great disappointment, but in my eyes, you will always be one of the greats.
What? What happened?
It's all over the news!
Some fella just stole a pyramid.
They're saying he makes all other villains look lame.
Assemble the minions!
Minions, assemble!
Okay. Okay.
Hey!
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?
All right.
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?
Hello, everybody!
Yeah, all right!
Simmer down. Simmer down!
Thank you, okay.
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard about this other villain who stole the pyramids.
Apparently, it's a big deal.
People are calling it the crime of the century and stuff like that.
But am I upset? No, I am not!
A little, but we have had a pretty good year ourselves, and you guys are all right in my book.
No, no raises!
You're not going to get any raises.
What did we do?
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!
Nice!
That's how I roll.
Yeah, you all like watching football on that, huh?
But that's not all.
We stole the Statue of Liberty, the small one from Las Vegas.
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you about this yet, but I have been working on something very big!
Something that will blow this pyramid thing out of the water!
And thanks to the efforts of my good friend Dr Nefario...
Thank you!
There he is.
He's styling.
Now, we have located a shrink ray in a secret lab, and once we take this shrink ray, we will have the capability to pull off the true crime of the century.
We are going to steal...
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
Hey.
Dave, listen up, please.
Next, we are going to steal, pause for effect, the moon!
And once the moon is mine, the world will give me whatever I want to get it back!
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes?
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers, and I really don't see how we can afford this.
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.
Hey, chillax.
I'll just get another loan from the bank.
They love me!
Edith, stop it!
What? I'm just walking.
-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
Hello, girls!
Anybody come to adopt us while we were out?
Let me think.
No!
Edith! What did you put on my desk?
A mud pie.
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?
-Yeah, I know.
-Good.
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?
Sort of.
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties.
Okay.
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.
Look at my face!
Do you still think it's a great sale day?
Eighteen coco-nutties.
I think we can do a little better than that, don't you?
Yeah.
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the Box of Shame, would we? No.
-No, Miss Hattie.
-No, Miss Hattie.
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.
-Hi, Penny.
-Hi, Penny.
Hi, guys.
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...
I just wanted to congratulate you on stealing the pyramid.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something that's very, very big, very important.
When you hear about it, you're going to be very proud.
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.
Gru to see Mr Perkins.
Yes, please have a seat.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.
Hey.
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.
It's a mathematical term, a quantity represented by an arrow, with both direction and magnitude.
Vector! That's me,
'cause I'm committing crimes with both direction and magnitude.
Oh, yeah!
Check out my new weapon.
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.
Do you want a demonstration?
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes, to get the piranha back inside of my...
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.
So, all I need is money from the bank to build a rocket.
-And then, the moon is ours.
-Wow!
Well, very nice presentation.
I'd like to see this shrink ray.
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.
You don't have it?
And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money?
Apparently.
Do you have any idea of the capital that this bank has invested in you, Gru?
With far too few of your sinister plots actually turning a profit.
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.
If we don't start getting our money back...
Get the picture?
Look, Gru, the point is, there are a lot of new villains out there, younger than you, hungrier than you, younger than you.
Like that young fellow out there named Vector.
He just stole a pyramid!
I've got it. I've got it.
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.
Suckers!
Suckers!
We got it!
What?
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!
No, no, no!
You!
Now, maybe you'll think twice before you freeze someone's head!
So long, Gru!
Quick! We can't let him get away!
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Fire! Fire, now!
You missed me!
Come to papa!
Take that.
How adorable.
Got you in our sights!
Like taking candy from a...
What?
Hey, Gru!
Try this on for size!
That's weird. What is going...
This is claustrophobic!
No, no, no!
Too small! This is too small for me!
I hate that guy!
...and please watch over us, and bless that we'll have a good night's sleep.
And bless that while we're sleeping, no bugs will crawl into our ears and lay eggs in our brains.
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.
And please bless that someone will adopt us soon, and that the mommy and daddy will be nice and have a pet unicorn.
Amen.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one
If they were really real
And they are
So, I bought one so I could pet it
Now it loves me
Now I love it
Don't you... What the...
Good luck, little girls!
Whoa! Cool.
Hi! We're orphans from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.
-I don't care. Beat it!
-Come on!
We're selling cookies so, you know, we can have a better future.
-Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
-Yeah.
Light bulb.
Dr Nefario!
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots disguised as cookies!
-What?
-Cookie robots!
-Who is this?
-Oh, forget it.
Well, it appears you have cleared our background check,
Dr Gru.
And I see you have made a list of some of your personal achievements.
Thank you for that. I love reading.
And I see you have been given the Medal of Honor and a knighthood.
-Me, me, me.
-Me, me, me.
Kevin?
You had your own cooking show and you can hold your breath for 30 seconds?
It's not that impressive.
Idiot!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
What in the name of... What?
Well, here's the dealio.
Things have been so lonely since my wife,
Debbie, passed on.
It's like my heart is a tooth, and it's got a cavity that can only be filled with children.
I'm sorry.
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?
Do I look like I speak Spanish?
You have a face como un burro.
Well, thank you!
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?
So, so excited!
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby.
I bet the mom is beautiful!
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.
I'm just saying it'd be nice.
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.
That's a Cheeto.
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.
Who's Debbie?
Your wife.
Hi, girls!
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.
He's going to adopt you.
And he's a dentist!
Yeah!
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.
And that's Agnes.
I got your leg, I got your leg!
Okay, that is enough, little girl.
-Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
-Higher!
-Higher!
-Just release your grip. Wow!
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?
Some nonstick spray?
Crowbar?
Okay, girls, let's go.
Oh, yeah!
Pretty impressive!
What are you looking at?
Boo-ya!
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!
Take that!
You done been shrunk!
Yello?
I got the shrink ray, all right.
No, I'm not playing with it.
Gru?
Don't make me laugh! No.
P.S., he is not getting the moon, and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him, he's gonna be begging for mercy.
Okay, bye.
Look at you, a little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby...
Curse you, tiny toilet!
Okay, here we are.
Home sweet home.
So, this is, like, your house?
Wait a sec...
You're the guy who pretended he was a recorded message!
No, that was someone else.
Can I hold your hand?
No.
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.
No, hey!
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.
Girls, this is Kyle, my dog.
Fluffy doggy!
What kind of dog is that?
He is a... I don't know.
Do you really think that this is an appropriate place for little kids?
'Cause it's not.
No! No! Stay away from there!
It's fragile.
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.
Hey! It's dark in here.
It poked a hole in my juice box.
As you can see,
I have provided everything a child might need.
All right.
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!
Somebody broke that.
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.
Rule number one.
You will not touch anything.
What about the floor?
Yes, you may touch the floor.
What about the air?
Yes, you may touch the air!
What about this?
-Where did you get that?
-Found it.
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.
Rule number three.
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart!
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?
Does this count as annoying?
Very!
I will see you in six hours.
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?
Question. What are these?
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!
Look at this. Watch me!
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.
Why are you so old?
Okay. I'm on it.
Hello?
TV!
What is that?
-Look at that!
-That is cool!
Come on!
I don't think he's a dentist.
We've been working on this for a while.
It's a anti-gravity serum.
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.
-Do the effects wear off?
-So far, no. No, they don't.
And here, of course, is the new weapon you ordered.
No, no.
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering under what circumstances would we use this?
But, anyway.
What I really wanted to show you was this.
Now those are cookie robots!
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!
We got bored. What is this place?
Can I drink this?
Do you want to explode?
Gru!
Get back in the kitchen!
-Will you play with us?
-No.
-Why?
-Because I'm busy.
Doing what?
Okay, okay, you got me.
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.
In real life, I am a spy.
And it is top secret, and you may not tell anybody,
-because if you do...
-What does this do?
Hey!
My unicorn!
You have to fix it.
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?
She's gonna hold her breath until she gets a new one.
It is just a toy. Now stop it!
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!
Tim! Mark! Phil!
This is very important.
You have to get the little girl a new unicorn toy.
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!
Go, and hurry!
What are those?
They are my cousins.
Jerry! Stuart!
Watch them, and keep them away from me, please.
-Wow!
-Wow!
It was your cousin's idea.
What?
Okay, bedtime.
Not you two!
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.
Just so you know, you're never gonna be my dad.
I think I can live with that.
Are these beds made out of bombs?
Yes, but they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up.
But try not to toss and turn.
Cool.
-Will you read us a bedtime story?
-No.
But we can't go to sleep without a bedtime story.
Well, then it's going to be a long night for you, isn't it?
So, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite.
Because there are literally thousands of them.
And there's probably something in your closet.
He's just kidding, Agnes.
It's beautiful.
Girls, let's go.
Time to deliver the cookies!
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.
Actually, we're going to have to skip the dance class today.
Actually, we can't skip the dance class today.
We have a big recital coming up.
-We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
-Yeah, Swan Lake!
That's fantastic. Wonderful.
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!
No.
No?
We're not going to deliver cookies until we do dance class.
Really?
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.
So if you want to go, you are going to have to walk yourselves.
What are you doing?
Walking to dance class.
Ya? Okay, fine.
You just keep walking, because I'm really not driving you!
Okay.
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!
And you had better be in this car!
Here we go! One! Two!
...three, four and five.
And lift, and stretch.
And one, and two...
-Here you go.
-What is it?
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?
Of course, of course.
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.
Pinkie promise?
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.
But he's a V.
You know, we're supposed to start with the A's.
Then we go to the B's. Then we...
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!
I was just thinking that it might be nice to deliver Mr Vector's first.
That is all.
Almost over. It's almost over.
Girls, welcome back to the fortress of Vector-tude!
Do you have my cookies for me?
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes, two caramel clumpies and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else order that many cookies.
Not likely.
Name one person who ordered more cookies than me.
That'll be $52.
Right.
Seven, eight, nine...
Tic Tacs! Where was l?
Seven, eight, nine...
Why are you wearing pyjamas?
These aren't pyjamas!
This is a warm-up suit.
-What are you warming up for?
-Stuff.
What sort of stuff?
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.
Like sleeping?
They are not pyjamas!
Here you go, 52 big ones.
Bye!
Come on!
What the...
Quiet down, fish!
Down, boy!
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!
But what about the other people who ordered cookies?
Life is full of disappointments for some people.
Don't do that!
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?
No.
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!
Don't care.
-Please?
-Please?
We'll never ask for anything else, ever again!
-Pretty please?
-Please?
-Come on!
-Come on!
Light bulb.
Come on!
Goodbye, have fun.
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.
What?
Oh, my gosh!
Look at that fluffy unicorn!
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!
You've gotta let us play for it!
No, no, no.
Come on!
How much for the fluffy unicorn?
Well, it is not for sale.
But all you gotta do to win it is knock down that little spaceship there.
It's easy!
Yay!
Again!
-Wait!
-Come on. One more time!
Just one more.
I accidentally closed my eyes.
-I hit it! I hit it!
-That was cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.
Hey, buddy, let me explain something to you.
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?
Do you know what that means, professor?
It means you don't get the unicorn!
Somebody's got a frowny face.
Boo! Better luck next time!
Okay, my turn.
Knocked over!
-It's so fluffy!
-Yeah!
That was awesome!
You blew up the whole thing!
Let's go. Let's try another game!
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?
Okay, girls, go play.
I got the shrink ray!
Cotton candy!
We have 12 days until the moon is in optimum position.
We can't afford any distractions!
Get me Perkins.
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins, but I figured that you would want to see this!
What?
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.
What?
Sorry. Sorry!
Could you excuse me for just one second?
I told you not to touch my things.
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.
Hey, can we order pizza?
Pizza? You just had lunch.
Not now, for dinner.
Dinner?
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!
Can we get stuffed crust?
-Stuffed crust!
-Stuffed crust!
I'll stuff you all in the crust!
You're funny!
Just don't come out of that room again!
All right.
Sorry about that. Where were we?
You were sitting on the toilet.
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.
I know how much you like to laugh inside. Now, I was saying...
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.
Believe me, I am completely focused.
-Hello!
-What?
That guy is huge!
-Are we on TV?
-What are those? Children?
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!
No, no, no!
Freeze ray!
Mr Gru?
Okay.
As I was saying...
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.
-But my plan...
-Is a great plan.
I love everything about your plan, except for one thing.
You.
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me landing on the moon!
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket out of macaroni!
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket based on the macaroni prototype!
I don't understand.
Let's face reality, Gru.
You've been at this for far too long with far too little success.
We're gonna put our faith, our money, into a...
Well, a younger villain.
But l...
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.
Now, I know there have been some rumours going around that the bank is no longer funding us.
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.
They are true.
In terms of money, we have no money.
So how will we get to the moon?
The answer is clear.
We won't.
We are doomed.
Now would probably be a good time to look for other employment options.
I know.
I have fired up my resume as I suggest that all of you do, as well.
What is it?
Can't you see that I am in the middle of a pep talk?
Yes!
Yes, we will build our own rocket using this and whatever else we can find!
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
Who needs the bank?
Let's go. Let's go!
Mom! What are you doing here?
And here he is in the bathtub.
Look at his little buns.
Mom.
Not cool.
And here, he's all dressed up in his Sunday best.
He looks like a girl!
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!
You're funny!
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!
Mr Perkins, your son is here.
Send him in.
Hey, Dad.
You wanted to see me?
-Yes, I did, Victor.
-I am not Victor any more.
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!
Sit down!
Do you know where the shrink ray is?
Duh! Back at my place.
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.
I guess Gru must just have one that looks exactly like it!
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!
Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be?
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime, and you just blow it!
-No, I didn't.
-Oh, really?
You just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon.
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!
There's a squid on my face!
Don't worry.
The moon is as good as ours.
Come on now, it's bedtime.
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.
You did not!
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!
-But we're not tired!
-Well, I am tired.
Will you read us a bedtime story?
No.
Pretty please!
The physical appearance of the "please" makes no difference.
It is still no, so go to sleep.
But we can't. We're all hyper!
And without a bedtime story, we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.
All night long.
Fine.
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.
Sleepy Kittens?
-What are these?
-Puppets.
You use them when you tell the story.
Okay, let's get this over with.
"Three little kittens loved to play, they had fun in the sun all day.
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?
Keep reading!
-Come on!
-All right, all right, all right.
"Three little kittens started to bawl,
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,
"'Fine, but at least you should brush your fur."'
Now you brush the fur.
This is literature?
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed!'
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,
"'Fine, but at least you should drink your milk."'
Now make them drink the milk.
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone, rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'
The end. Okay, good night.
-Wait!
-What?
What about good night kisses?
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging or kissing.
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.
I like him. He's nice.
But scary.
Like Santa!
Only 48 hours till the launch, and all systems are go.
About that,
I was thinking that maybe we could move the date of the heist.
Please tell me this is not as a result of the girls' dance recital, is it?
No, no, no!
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!
I just think it's kind of weird to do it on a Saturday.
I was thinking, maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?
Gru, you and I have been working on this for years.
It's everything we've dreamed of.
Your chance to make history, become the man who stole the moon!
But these girls are becoming a major distraction!
They need to go.
If you don't do something about it, then I will.
I understand.
Good.
Butt.
Butt.
Butt.
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together, we will make the "clink" sound with our mouths.
Ready? Edith?
-Clink.
-Clink.
There we go. And now we drink.
And Agnes?
-Clink.
-Clink.
Very good!
Excuse me, girls.
Come on!
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.
-Clink, clink.
-Clink, clink.
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?
I'm here for the girls. I received a call that you wanted to return them.
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.
I didn't like what you said.
But...
I will get the girls ready.
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!
Tell her you wanna keep us.
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.
I did it for your own good.
Come on, let's go get that moon.
Right.
What is this for?
The recital?
I am the greatest criminal mind of the century.
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.
And we are good to go in T minus 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
Oh, yeah!
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.
Boo-ya!
My flight suit.
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...
I've got it!
I've got the moon!
I've got the moon!
I can make it!
-Wait a minute!
-Kevin!
Come on, come on!
He's still not here.
Why would he come? He gave us up.
But he pinkie promised!
Girls, girls, places!
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.
Can we just wait a few more minutes?
All right. But just a few more minutes.
He's not coming, guys.
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!
Okay, okay. There's the library.
That's Third Street. The dance studio...
There! There! There it is!
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.
Over?
Vector, open up!
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.
-Mr Gru!
-Zip it, Happy Meal.
Now, the girls.
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them a little while longer.
No!
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!
Listen close, you little punk.
When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!
I'm really scared!
He is gonna kick your butt.
What? He punched my shark!
There he is!
Hang on, Gru.
Oh, no!
Vector has the girls. Go!
What happened to the ship? It's big again!
-Not as big as the moon is going to be!
-What?
The larger the mass of an object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off!
I call it the Nefario Principle.
I just came up with it now, actually.
Oh, no!
Did you see that?
-Vector! Help!
-Vector!
-Over here!
-Hey!
What are you girls doing back there?
The moon!
Watch out!
Get as close in as you can.
You got it.
-Mr Gru, up here!
-Mr Gru!
Okay, girls! Girls!
-You're going to have to jump.
-Jump?
Are you insane?
Don't worry, I will catch you.
You gave us back!
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.
But you have to jump now.
It'll be okay.
Okay, girls.
Jump now!
Margo, I will catch you.
And I will never let you go again.
-Not so fast!
-No!
Let me go!
Margo!
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!
I got you.
No!
Oh, poop.
This time, good triumphs, and the moon has been returned to its rightful place in the sky.
But once again, law enforcement is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder, who is this mysterious hero?
And what will he do next?
Okay, girls. Time for bed.
-Come on! We want a story.
-Three sleepy kittens!
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously.
Tonight we are going to read a new book.
This one is called
One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!
Here, watch this.
That's the horn!
This is gonna be the best book ever!
Not to pat myself on the back, but, yes, it probably will be.
Here we go.
"One big unicorn, strong and free
"thought he was happy as he could be.
"Then three little kittens came around
"and turned his whole life upside down."
Hey, that one looks like me!
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!
Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental.
"They made him laugh.
"They made him cry.
"He never should have said goodbye.
"And now he knows he could never part
"from those three little kittens
"that changed his heart.
"The end."
Okay, all right. Good night.
I love you.
I love you, too.
No, no!
All right.
Didn't I get you already?
They're very good!
I'm so proud of you, Son.
You've turned out to be a great parent!
Just like me.
Maybe even better.
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.
No, no, no!
Hey, Carl! Hey.
No, no, no.
Me, me, me.
John?
No, no. Me, me, me.
Oh, poop.
Oh, no!
Stop! Stop!
Hello, I am Gru.
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
English srt
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
- It's beautiful, right?
- It's great.
Hey.
- What's that?
- What?
- Check it out.
- Hey.
Okay.
- Hey, there's a note in it.
- Get out of here.
Yes, there is. It says:
- "Will you mar... "
- Stephanie?
It's no secret we've been on a journey together.
An adventure.
And I've done a lot of soul searching and I know...
This is just right.
So will you marry me?
That's so sweet. No.
Sorry?
I can't.
Really?
I really didn't wanna do this right now but you're kind of forcing my hand.
I'm thinking we've reached the end of the line.
Really?
Look, Griffin, I know it shouldn't bother me that you're a zookeeper...
But it kind of does.
And when we first started dating,
I just assumed...
That you would turn into the guy that I'd always dreamed of being with.
- But... 
- Not your dream guy, I got it.
You had to see this coming.
I bought a ring and rented a horse.
Well, that's not my fault!
Don't yell at me on the beach!
- I love... 
- Stop it!
Do not make this harder than it has to be. God!
You totally set me up.
Little heads up.
I may have hired a mariachi band.
Oh, there they are.
Just ignore them.
Ignore it.
Thank you, sir. There you go.
Good morning, Barry.
Come on, Donald, let's move you out of the sun. Come on.
There you go, buddy.
Nice and shady.
- Cherry.
- Thanks, Franky.
See you at the party tonight.
Come on, Shane.
What are you doing?
We talked about this.
His food should always be fresh and placed inside the door out of the sun.
You go down there.
I am not getting jacked up by him again.
It's been 10 years. Bernie's cool.
Why do you bring this stuff around here?
You trying to make the rest of us look bad?
What? No, no.
I feel for him. He's all alone.
Oh, he's all alone.
Look, it all starts with trust.
Sure.
You won't be so cocky when he's beating you to death with your own arm.
Hey, bern.
Got a little something for you.
Looks like things just got fun around here, huh?
What is this, anyway?
Is this an old tire or a gateway to adventure?
It's... it's adventure.
It's an adventure.
Hey, Tony.
Go.
Hey.
How did it go with the tire swing?
Oh, that good, huh?
- Don't know if he's gonna come around.
- Don't get discouraged.
Bernie feels what you're trying to do.
All the animals do.
- You're like the hippo whisperer.
- I don't know.
Hey, is that the new release cage?
Yep.
- The eagle enclosure's almost done.
- I gotta tell you, it is amazing.
- Great job.
- Thank you.
It's getting a lot of attention.
In fact, I may be sitting on an offer to work my magic...
At the Nairobi zoo in Africa.
Oh, man.
Wow, that's awesome.
Congratulations.
I'm thinking about it, but ....
It's great to be wanted.
You know how that feels.
Oh, I've been in play.
There was a zoo in New Hampshire that was coming after me pretty hard.
It wasn't so much a zoo.
It was more an animal farm.
But the animals were nice. Cool.
Not big like here.
We didn't have the... they had a couple badgers.
A badger and a... they had a sick raccoon. Sick.
His name was Peter and he was big.
- Hang in there, girl.
- What happened?
- She's having trouble breathing.
- What's happening?
She's stable and she's sedated.
- I'm gonna get a trach tube.
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- What do we do, Kate?
- Don't panic, Griffin.
- Not breathing.
- Support her neck.
On my count. One, two, and ....
She's a big girl. She's a big girl.
- Griffin, you okay?
- Yeah.
There's something blocking her airway.
I need a laryngoscope.
- I don't know what a laryngo... 
- It's in the drawer.
Okay, I got post-its, cinnamon tic tacs... 
- it's silver, curved and has a light on it.
- Got it.
Come on. There's definitely something in her throat.
Hold her jaw open.
I'm putting my hand in.
- It's stuck.
- No, come on.
Oh, God. Okay.
- I guess I'm up.
- I can't... 
- Come on.
- Okay, I'll hold.
- Hold the jaw.
- Come on, you can do it.
That's a feeling
I never wanna get used to.
Hurry, hurry.
You can do it, you can do it.
I got it.
She's breathing.
Good luck getting the deposit back on that one.
You did it.
No, we did it.
We did it.
She's okay.
Oh, God. You're okay.
This place looks amazing, Griffin.
No.
Grif, mom and dad would have loved this. Thank you.
- Kate.
- Hi, Dave.
That's... Kate heads up our eagle program. That's Robin.
- This is Venom, he is our reptile guy.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Oh, you gotta bring it in with him.
Now onto the fiancée.
Okay, Venom, reel it in.
- Okay, that feels good.
- Yeah.
Hey, come on.
No, you're not married yet.
Congrats on your big day.
I don't know where you kids are going for your honeymoon, but Omaha...
Stupid with underground fight clubs.
Okay.
- We're gonna circulate.
- Yeah.
All right. Congrats on being hot.
I gots to gets my flows on.
All right, folks.
I'd like to bring up the guy who is responsible...
For putting together this little party-slash-field trip.
Dave's brother, Griffin.
Griffin.
- Are you going with Floyd?
- Oh, yeah.
- Go get them.
- I'm getting them.
Let's hear it for him.
Love.
We're all here tonight to celebrate one thing...
And that's love.
You know, finding the perfect mate...
Is the most important thing in the world.
No matter what package they come in.
I mean, you take Floyd here.
Now, porcupines, they... they get a bad rap, you know?
And I'm sure you see the sharp quills and the tough exterior.
But you know what I see?
Just a great guy looking for love.
And that's what Robin sees in my brother Dave.
- To the couple.
- Yeah.
To you guys.
Congratulations.
All right.
Hi.
God, what was I... ?
Sorry, I just lost my train of... 
I got a train of... train.
What I'm basically saying is... 
I mean, I'm not... may not be an expert on love, you know...
Per se.
But I do know a lot about animals.
He's an indigenous... he's a woodland creature.
Did I cover burrowing?
Did I go over burrow because I don't know if I got... 
I had a whole thing on burrow.
Did it get hotter, 10 degrees hotter?
Where did that breeze go?
It is hot.
My elbows are sweating.
That's weird.
I don't know why I'm telling you this now. Oh, boy.
I had so many beautiful things... 
I'm just gonna sum up.
I think sum it up, what I wanted to say.
Dave, Robert, good luck.
That's really what it comes down to.
And anybody who wants to learn more about porcupines...
I'll be off to the side over here.
Yeah. Food for thought, ladies and gentlemen.
- You invited Stephanie?
- Sorry to jump you like that.
I didn't even know Robin was gonna invite her. I'm an idiot.
You still got a thing for her, don't you?
So, Stephanie, I saw the way that you were looking at Griffin.
Is something going on?
I don't know.
I guess I feel bad about the way things ended between us.
- I might've been a little rough on him.
- A little?
Okay, Robin, a lot. I'll own it.
Seeing him tonight and up there in his little uniform and ....
So cute.
I don't know, it just reminds me that he has so much potential.
You deserve a great girl in your life.
But you gotta understand how the world works.
- What's wrong with being a zookeeper?
- Nothing, you're the best, okay?
It's just ....
Look.
Offer's still on the table to work at the dealership.
Okay? Because here's you, the grass, mine's greener.
- Dave.
- No, I'm serious.
You could make your annual salary in a month.
That is how you get a girl like Stephanie.
Come on, this could be a whole new life for you.
Think about it.
Yeah.
Floyd, right?
I hope my being here doesn't make you uncomfortable.
I'm not uncomfortable.
So comfortable.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
No, it's fine, it's fine. I got it.
Oh, God, it's barbed.
Okay, so, hey, how you doing?
Still in design school?
- No, no, I've been out for a while.
- Okay.
- I'm a buyer for saks now.
- Oh, that's good.
I see you've been busy.
Lead zookeeper.
Yes, yeah.
You know, I got the bump last year.
They don't usually until you've been here 10 years.
I'm only been here eight.
It's basically like getting a black belt after only a month of karate.
Or mastering a ....
Let's see ....
That's all I can think of right now.
- Just karate, go with that.
- Yeah.
So it's good.
Yeah.
That's good.
Oh, Griffin, you're bleeding.
- No, no.
- Yes, yes, you are.
Come here.
Let me get it, come... 
I'm not gonna bite.
There.
There you go. Now you're all better.
Anyway, Robin was talking about...
Wanting to see the animals tomorrow...
And were wondering what are the odds of getting a private tour?
Not good. Not good at all.
There's a sign-up sheet, a pretty elaborate waiver.
And you'd have to go through the main office, which is closed. They close at 4.
- Yeah, doesn't sound good.
- It's not.
Okay, so we're on our own.
- Well, it was really nice to see you.
- Okay.
You know?
Bye, Floyd.
Bye, Griffin.
Dave's right.
I gotta get out of this zoo.
- Closing up shop again, Grif?
- Yeah, just had to clean up.
Meeting.
Let's do this. Come on.
What? Oh, nothing.
I wasn't cleaning my basement.
Okay. Here we go.
If this is another eating intervention,
I'm not hearing it.
This is my ideal weight. Ask the vet.
Come on. Pop the latch.
Yeah, let's go. We want a good seat.
- What do you think this is?
- Am I psychic?
- We got the call the same time.
- Take it down a peg, just asking.
Bernie.
Hey, we having a meeting.
You wanna come?
You don't.
Don't know why I asked.
Come on.
We're gonna have a meeting.
I'm excited about this.
- I wonder.
- What's going on?
All right. I got a very busy schedule.
This better be good.
You sleep 20 hours a day, Joe.
I think you'll live.
Okay, things I didn't want the group to know.
Look, we got a problem.
Remember that chick that broke
Griffin's heart? Well, she is back.
- What?
- What, Stephanie's back?
This is not good.
Griffin's thinking of quitting.
We can't let that happen.
He can't leave.
He's the best zookeeper we ever had.
He keeps my hay fresh and he rubs lotion on me when I get dry skin.
He makes papier-maché antelopes for me to attack. And inside? Muffins.
Oh, I like muffins.
Can I get a "hey now"?
Plus, he's the only human who recognizes me as an equal.
In your dreams.
Thumbs, baby.
It's all about the thumbs.
- What do you call this?
- That's a paw.
You can't grab a coffee mug with that.
You can't wear mittens. It's useless.
I'm so blessed.
Sorry. One more look.
Griffin saved my life.
Right, I made my decision.
We're not helping Griffin.
Really? Because I remember a time when you needed help with females.
Namely me.
Remember, you were shy.
You sent your buddy over to test the waters to make sure.
And then you would, like, follow me around.
I'd look at you, you'd look away embarrassed.
Okay. We're helping Griffin.
- Now, how do you propose we do it?
- Animals are experts on mating.
- We tell him how to get her back.
- No.
Nobody's talking to Griffin.
You know the code.
We don't ever talk to humans.
You don't break the code, idiot.
Besides,
Griffin's got no shot at this girl.
That is why you're single, Bruce.
You have no sense of romance.
Herbivore.
Maybe it's possible to help Griffin without talking to him.
The girl's gonna be here tomorrow and she's interested.
And how do you know that?
She said, and I quote,
"Griffin has potential." Potential.
All we have to do is make him look like a hero in front of her.
Then zip-zang,
Griffin gets the girl, stays at the zoo...
Everybody wins.
Awesome. We got a plan.
Hey, what's this now?
Wait. You're not a zoo animal.
Excuse me. Am I standing in the zoo?
Then I'm a zoo animal.
Don't get mad at us because no kid says, "mommy, I wanna see a crow."
Okay, that's the captivity talking.
Enough. You've all made your point, we'll help Griffin.
But no one breaks the code.
- Understood?
- No breaking the code.
Okay, we're helping a human.
This is big.
You started your diet today.
- He's not even chewing.
- Take a breath.
What, I'm stress-eating.
Stop looking at me!
Much better than the tire we had.
Sorry about that, by the way.
You're gonna enjoy this a lot more.
I don't know. I made it,
I drilled it and put a ball in there.
Get that baby spinning, have it land in a circle.
What?
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
I think you'll like it.
There. There you go.
I'm not sure, kind of like a disco ball.
Look at that.
Party at Bernie's. It's fun.
It's gonna be good.
It sucks being alone here, buddy.
I know.
All right.
Okay.
See you tomorrow, bern.
I don't know.
She just intimidates me, you know?
But you know me.
I don't like to talk about it.
Hey, Griffin.
- Hey, Grif.
- Hey.
We were gonna go see the rhinos...
And we were wondering if you could show us the way.
You know what? I can't right now.
I'm feeding the giraffe.
She's eating carrots.
Okay.
Here they come.
- See the thumb?
- Yeah, yeah, I see it.
Time to make Griffin look like a hero.
Here we go. Get it together.
All right, here you go.
Anybody looking? No.
- Oh, my God.
- Joe.
Joe, over here.
Please. This way.
- Get them out of there, I'll distract him.
- Got it.
Joe.
Oh, crap.
Get in.
Oh, God.
Joe.
Joe? Joe.
Joe.
Joe.
Joe.
Joe.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, I mean:
Wait a sec.
Griffin, I know this is weird.
- Griffin.
- Lion secure, going home.
Haven 't you learned anything from being under my tutelage?
No. No.
Mommy, look, it's going to eat.
Come on.
- Yeah, it's on, but, like, on reverse.
- Yeah, you should definitely go.
He... ?
He didn't... ?
Wasn't saying anything, did he?
What's going on?
- He's a good one, yeah.
- How much do they weigh?
What's up?
- Good night, Griffin.
- Good night, Manny. Heading home?
If by "home" you mean Uncle bosoms...
I'll be there in the back, purple couch.
Okay.
All right.
I know you had your dinner...
But this is just a little reward for what I like to call a winning attitude.
You care to comment on that?
Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay.
Have a good one.
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
You remember nothing.
I totally think this is working.
Relax. Calm down, calm down.
Breathe. Breathe.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
He's freaking out.
Look at him, look at him.
What do you think I'm looking at?
- You can talk.
- Yeah, we can talk.
I can sing pretty good.
I can teach you how to give yourself a bath.
- How'd you get out of your enclosures?
- You don't wanna know.
- Actually, I do.
- Okay, but I don't wanna tell you.
- How long have you been able to talk?
- Let's see. Today's Tuesday, so always.
Always.
- Then why haven't you?
- Humans can't handle it.
Any time we talk to humans, it always ends badly.
Except for parrots.
Somehow they get away with it.
"I be parrot.
Happy Birthday."
Why did you talk to me?
You saved my mate. We tried to help you connect with yours.
But you blew it.
I appreciate it, but you know what?
I had a really bad experience and I don't like to talk about it.
"Don't like to talk about it."
That's crazy.
We've been hearing about that breakup on the beach every day...
For the last five years.
Okay, I might have mentioned it before
I knew you could understand me.
Come on, man, we heard her talking.
She wants you.
So what if you don't have my great complexion or my thick, wavy hair?
I would tell you this.
You have nice calves.
Great calves.
Of course I don't have calves.
I basically have columns with toenails.
So you think I should maybe ask her out?
Okay.
All right, now, slow it down, hot shot.
You ask Stephanie out, it's gonna end the same way.
You haven't changed, you don't trust your instincts.
You listen to us and we turn you into an Alpha male.
I don't know.
I don't think he's got the size.
Size has nothing to do with it.
We both know who the Alpha is.
You're giving me attitude.
That's why I do stuff to your water bowl.
That was you?
You said it was vitamin drops.
- Surprise.
- Oh, that's it.
- Bring it, come on.
- It's been brought.
Oh, boy, here we go again.
It's like watching a fight between two beanbag chairs.
- I am tired. I'm back in.
- Me too.
You're a good man, Griffin.
You just need a little help.
Yeah.
Who better than us to help you?
- Come on, you honeypot.
- Bring it, big boy.
What have I got to lose?
- That's not instilling confidence.
- Sorry.
Two more licks.
Is it on, is it on, is it on? Yeah.
Hey.
Thought we'd mix things up a little today.
Got some organic jambalaya.
You know... if you ever ....
You want anything, I... you could always ask me.
Hey, how's the...?
How's that ball working out for you?
Lot of fun with the... any disco...
Parties'?
All right.
Just leave it by the door.
Come on.
Move. Come on, stupid bears.
Do something.
What is he doing?
Hey. Don't do that.
No, no, no. Hey.
Can we get that?
Okay. Now, no sudden movements.
I want you to get to your feet.
Slowly walk to the door.
Come on.
They're not gonna hurt you. Good.
Okay, we're fine, here.
Here we go.
- He backed you down.
- I didn't see you do anything.
Hey, thanks, guys.
I appreciate you showing some restraint.
Any other day, that would've been lunch.
But you showed confidence, what you're not doing with the girl.
See, when I take down a female, I... 
- take down a female, you?
- Don't know me my whole life.
I did three years in Vancouver.
- You got a chick in Canada?
- Yeah, I was dating a kodiak model.
- Kodiak model?
- She's technically a model.
She was on a tobacco can, born with an extra claw.
She knew how to use it.
Canadian bears are wild.
Very wild.
She's wild in your dreams.
You don't know squat, Jerome.
Were you there, huh?
I didn't think so.
And what's with the "Jerome"?
Anyway, you need to unlock your inner bear.
The only way that's gonna happen is to do as we say.
- And that's how you get your girl.
- We get it.
Let's start with your walk.
- My... come on, my walk is fine.
- Fine? It's a hot, stinking pile.
This time he's got a point. Come on.
- Show us your stuff.
- Yup.
My... this is stupid.
- My walk?
- Wipe that goofy look off your face.
You're a predator. Act like it.
Get those paws up.
That's what we do.
What was that?
No, no, no.
This guy's untrainable.
We're wasting our time.
Give me one more shot.
Come on, get your paw up.
Yeah, up. Come on, reach.
- This is ridiculous.
- We know what we're doing.
- Trust it.
- Get your paws up.
There you go.
That's what we're talking about.
Let's see movement.
Swing your paws like you're swatting salmon.
- Good.
- I don't know, man.
Give us a snort.
Good old bear snort.
Not with your nose, with your mouth.
Get your lips into it.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
- Now lead with your pudding cup.
- My pudding cup?
Yeah, your pudding cup, man.
Get it out front. Remove the mystery.
That's good like that.
Who... '? How would this ever help me?
- Show them the goods.
- This just feels weird.
That's it, looks good. Come on.
Add a roar.
The roar.
Put some oomph into it.
Roar.
- Fine.
- Bend those knees.
- Get low.
- Yeah.
- Shake that money-maker.
- Swing those arms.
- Here's a predator.
- Dig a hole.
- Dig a big old bear hole.
- Dig it.
- Get dirty.
- Stop digging.
- No, keep digging.
- Keep digging.
- What, are you too good to dig?
- That's it.
- Through the wickets.
- That's good.
Kick up those woodchips.
Look at him, a natural.
Scratch your back.
Scratch it on the tree.
- Yeah, he's a bear.
- Yeah, he's a bear, baby.
- You're the bear.
- You're a big bear.
Stop it.
Hi, kids.
Carry them all?
We'll look at the giraffe now.
I appreciate the grub.
No problem.
I popped it myself so enjoy.
I would have left it in longer.
I like mine burnt a bit.
But I wasn't sure how you weighed in on that.
This is fine.
Hey, Shane.
I was supposed to tell you there's a meeting tomorrow at 10.
Okay, cool. Thanks.
Who are you talking to?
No, you know what it is?
I'm in a one-act play...
And I was rehearsing.
I know both parts because
I'm understudying the other guy.
And something.
What's the play about?
Steam ships.
I wouldn't do it around him.
That's when they get you, you see?
When you're not focused.
I didn't do it, you know.
- I'm sorry?
- I didn't attack him.
Oh, yeah, he says you did though.
He's a liar, okay?
He never treats us with any respect.
To get us to move, he prods us with a long stick...
With a nail in the end of it.
One day, I guess I wasn't walking fast as he wanted me to...
So he swung the stick at me, but I caught it, and he slipped and fell.
He told everyone I attacked him.
Wow, I never knew any of that.
And my only mistake was assuming he would tell the truth.
I guess that's what humans do.
They lie.
Not all humans, Bernie.
Look, now, maybe you got a raw deal...
But sometimes we need to put the past behind us...
And look towards the future, you know?
I guess sometimes we all get stuck living in the past.
Yeah.
Look, is there anything else
I can do for you?
Can you get me my view back?
You know, it's not my call.
I miss it, you know?
Seeing the world.
I used to be able to climb high enough...
That I could just catch a glimpse of a few buildings.
Now all I see is cement.
I wish I could help you, Bernie, but... 
I mean, that enclosure's gone.
It's a... it's where the snack bar is now.
All right.
Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Anything.
Is t.G.L. Friday's as incredible as it looks?
It's pretty good.
Your girl's gonna be at the party.
Here's how we get her.
First, answer me this, what do you think attracts a female to a male?
Looks, success... 
I'm gonna stop you right there.
- It's pee-pee.
- Sorry?
Pee-pee. Smell, scent, chemistry, pheromones.
Which is why you have to learn to protect your territory.
- Turn everything into a home game.
- There's gotta be another way.
There's not.
Now, don't be stingy with the magic.
Watch and learn.
Notice the full extension of my lift leg.
- The proud, soaring arc of my stream.
- Yeah.
See how I raised the bar from the last pee mark.
And voilé.
You're up, sunshine.
You know,
I really don't feel like doing this.
The zoo is closed. You're fine.
All right.
Not there. That's my spot.
Hey, don't give me attitude.
This will help you at the dinner tonight.
Right here. Fine.
All right, unzip and make it rain.
Okay, you gotta look away.
Such a delicate flower.
Shut it down. Shut it down.
- Kate's coming.
- What?
- I can't_
- Snap it.
Be a man. Snap it.
- Hey, Griffin, Rebecca and I are going... 
- Hey.
Hey.
It's gonna be hard to unsee that.
I'm sorry about that, I... you know what happened... the wolf got stung by one of Venom's scorpions.
And I was taking him to the infirmary...
And then he started limping bad.
Oh, and the urine will neutralize the poison.
Exactly, exactly, yes, yes.
And that's why I did it.
I was just peeing on him, for his health.
Okay, when you finish, I'll give him an antihistamine just to be safe.
- Sounds good.
- All right, go ahead.
Go ahead. Soak it.
Make sure you get the whole area.
Sorry.
I have to.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
Excuse me, sir.
You do know that we have a functioning restroom not 20 feet from here.
Oh, you do, good, that sounds good.
Yeah, that's nice.
- Have a good evening.
- You too.
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.
I've set up my territory, I'm about to show Stephanie my pudding cup.
What?
- Yeah, thank you.
- Pretty great party, huh?
Yeah, Dave goes all out.
He really does.
Listen, Stephanie, I was thinking...
Weddings can be weird if you're alone and you... oh, God.
No, no, don't. No, it's not you.
Lt's, it's... oh, it's my ex, I broke up with him, but he showed up here anyway.
Sweetness. Funny story.
So I go to the fridge to replenish the old electrolytes...
After some cross-training, and there...
Taped to the door, next to the picture of that kayak I'm getting...
Was the invitation to this wedding that you wanted me to go to.
So here I be.
No, no, no.
Gale, this is an old friend of mine.
Griffin.
Actually, my ex-boyfriend, Griffin.
Griffin, this is my ex-boyfriend, Gale.
What's up?
Everything.
So listen.
I know we had some stuff, but I'm making changes.
I sat down with my life coach and I cleared out everything...
Except for you.
So suddenly I'm more important than learning the banjo?
Griffin, you wanted to ask me something. Remember?
- It's very nice meeting you.
- That's what people tell me.
What was I supposed to do?
Her ex-boyfriend showed up.
Nothing, fleeing was the right call.
Fleeing is the new fighting.
I know we flee...
But humans are at the top of the food chain...
So we should ask Joe.
Why are you concerned with what the stupid lion would do?
Do you realize that if monkeys' canine teeth were a little bigger...
We'd hold the title, king of the jungle?
Let me ask you something, can the king of the jungle do this?
He's behind me. I saw him mid-flip.
Cut her from the herd.
Cut her from the herd.
That's a good call, Joe.
As long as this other guy's in the picture, you ain't got a chance.
Next time you see her, get her alone.
That's how you'll get your girl.
That's how you gonna get your girl that's how you gonna get your girl yeah, yeah that's how you get a girl that's how you get a, get a girl just focus on the lyrics.
You know what?
It's worth a shot, I'll try it tomorrow.
I basically had the same advice Joe did...
But he kind of stole my thunder.
- Coming, Barry?
- Okay, you're not listening.
I gotta be honest, my legs fell asleep when we sat down.
I think I'm here overnight.
Hey. Hey, look, my bus was late.
I need a bike.
Sorry, but that wedding party just cleaned me out.
Yeah, that's my group.
Please, you got to have something.
That's right.
Cut her from the herd.
How weak.
Hey, Stephanie.
- That's how you're playing it?
- Stay away from her.
- Share the road.
- I'm not good at sharing.
This is not right.
Stop it, this is... very dangerous out here.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Get off the road!
Move it. Coming through.
- Taste the heel.
- Hey, easy.
- Taste it.
- Stop it.
I will not get the deposit if you do that.
Oh, sweet nanny, that is painful.
Oh, Jesus. That is fiberglas. Stop it.
Oh, Jesus.
- Hey.
- Oh, Grif.
You're like a daredevil.
So listen, I've been thinking... 
I was thinking about... hold on a second.
Everything just turned light blue.
My body's starting to shut down.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, I'm good.
- Okay.
I was thinking about the wedding.
I was wondering if maybe you needed someone to go with you, that I... oh, look, Griffin,
I need to tell you something.
Yeah?
I'm gonna go to the wedding with Gale.
He was supposed to come with me before we broke up...
And we had this long talk and I'm really confused right now.
I hope you understand.
And I hope you understand that that is fantastic. It's better this way.
- Really?
- Yes, yeah. Yes, yeah.
- Okay.
- All right.
All right. Bye.
Get ready to experience the hail of Gale.
Cherokee style.
You said to cut her from the herd,
I did.
You see this is what happens.
I should've never listened to you.
We didn't tell you to back down.
Stick to your cozy life...
Because take it from me, you would never make it in the wild.
What did you just say?
In the wild, I would never let a rival dictate the outcome of a situation.
"In the wild"?
You were born in captivity, Joe.
In this very zoo. I bottle-fed you.
"In the wild." You've never been in the wild a day in your life.
I could walk 25 yards and buy a balloon on a stick.
- "Wild."
- You're missing the point.
Whether you're taking out a rival or taking down prey...
It's not just the attack, it's about everything leading up to it.
The females in the pride, they do the hunting.
- We do.
- Thank you.
And the fighting.
Okay, you know what?
Are you giving the advice?
If you are, I don't need to be here.
Yeah, you heard me, I will walk.
Relax, Joe.
The best way for a male to attract a female...
Is to be seen with another female.
If he's going to the wedding, he needs a date.
That's it. Good night.
Find a date, sweetie.
I'll do that.
So basically you're using me.
Not basically, I am.
This is very junior high, you do realize that.
It is, I admit it, I am not proud.
I don't think you should go through this.
- No, I do, I definitely do.
- I don't know.
You can't remember the last date.
This isn't a real date.
If I'm gonna go on a fake date,
I was hoping I'd fake date a doctor.
Or somebody French.
Please.
If you do this for me, I will give you half my lunch for the next three years.
You know what?
And this, to sweeten it.
That's a signing bonus, if you do.
Take it, look at that.
All right, I'll go.
But I'm calling you Francois Dubois, cardiologist.
You can call me Betty, as long as you're going.
Hey, buddy.
Got a little something for you.
Happy Birthday... 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's out. It's out. I'm sorry.
I was just messing with you.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I mean, don't do that to me.
It's a gelatine cake.
Kate made it for you.
- She's a good lady.
- Oh, my heart's racing, man.
Was that on a plate?
- No, you're good.
- Thank Kate for me.
That's it?
You're all birthday-ed out?
I'm sure you got things to do.
Actually, we do.
How are we gonna pull this off?
- I don't exactly blend in.
- It's simple.
We just tell people we're going to a costume party.
- No one's gonna believe that.
- Maybe not at first.
But when you put on this shirt and talk, they will.
Griffin, I'd hug you, but it's fifty-fifty I'd crush your spine.
You know what? Fist bump works.
- My wrist.
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Payback, baby. Come on.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- Can I drive?
- No, you cannot.
Please?
Sorry, bern, not happening.
Look at that up there.
I'm so alive.
Take it easy, man. No problem.
Here it comes, you ready?
Shut up.
Hi, y'all, welcome to Friday's.
Can I interest you in... ?
Yeah, we were just at a costume party.
- Zookeeper.
- Gorilla.
Preppy gorilla.
We noticed there was already a gorilla so we were like:
"You know what? Let's put wings on this loser train, get our Friday's on."
- You look so freaking real.
- He does, yeah.
Can I try on your head?
Yeah, no, l... you know... it's all hooked on with wires and whatnot.
And stink.
This thing hasn't been washed in years.
I think the last guy who wore it might have thrown up.
Yeah.
Can I get your order?
I'm just gonna go with the baby backs and some fries.
And for you?
Thirty oranges.
No, Bernie, that's ice. That's cold.
Should've warned you.
It's called a brain freeze.
Gonna get worse before it gets better.
Ride it. Ride it.
Gonna subside in 10 seconds.
Yeah, that's ice, but it's deadly. Deadly.
We'd like to send that table of secretaries a basket of zucchini fries.
You got it.
Yeah.
My eyes.
Yeah.
I'm so glad I met you.
Penny for your thoughts?
Just hanging out, enjoying your company.
So there's talk you might leave the zoo.
I was just upset. Thought that's what
I needed to do to get Stephanie back.
No, Bernie,
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I wanna thank you.
Tonight you gave me more than I could ever ask for.
You're very welcome, Bernie.
You're a good friend.
Hell, you're my best friend.
I just made this weird, didn't I?
No, no, not at all.
Okay, good.
Can I try on your watch?
Now it's getting weird.
What are you doing out?
Someone can see you.
- No, no one's around.
- We were worried about you.
Tell me you're not wearing that to the wedding.
- No, no, I got an outfit.
- All set with the other female?
Got it covered,
Kate's coming with me.
- Oh, good choice.
- Thanks.
- Joe, anything else for Griffin?
- What would I know?
- You're the expert on everything.
- God, your mother ruined you.
She did not. Your mother ruined you.
Has anyone got a game plan for the ex-boyfriend?
We forgot about him.
Look. I couldn't help overhearing.
You wanna intimidate a rival?
You gotta do this.
And if that doesn't work, assume attack position.
Okay, if I was in a pond that would be my go-to move.
- I respect that.
- You better take me with you.
- Bernardo.
- Oh, my God, it's Bernie.
Hey, that's great.
- Bernie, you made it.
- All right, all right.
Let's not make a big deal out of this.
Here's what I'm thinking.
Take me along, you know, just in case you need some backup.
- Bern, I gotta do this on my own.
- I'll sit at another table.
You won't even know I'm there.
I've got unbelievable mingling skills.
Bernie, you're a gorilla.
I can't believe you just went there.
All right, fine.
But if you get in a jam, call us.
- Will do, all right?
- We're gonna need your cell phone.
- What?
- Hand it over.
Fine. Here you go.
Thanks. Thanks, guys.
All right, everybody back to your enclosures before the zoo opens.
- Where did you get the watch?
- Don't you worry about it.
Venom?
I got you. I've got you covered.
Sure this is gonna help with the ladies?
Hey, Venom,
I need to ask you a favor...
Franky.
- Venom, I need to borrow your car.
- Absolutely.
- Gonna need your keys.
- Oh, yeah, they're in my pocket.
Oh, I had a little dust-up with the copperhead.
Yeah, I won't be able to move the arm for another six hours.
Go get yourself some keys, brother.
Other pocket.
Thanks.
- Are you kidding me?
- What?
You look amazing.
- Thank you.
- No.
No, you overdid it. Don't you see?
You look too good for me.
People are gonna know it's a setup.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What did you want me to do?
Come in my work clothes?
No, no, we don't have time now.
Thank you.
Yeah, you would know.
Here, come here.
She didn't notice us at the church, now she's gone. She's just gone.
We tussle a little bit ....
There she is.
Then the sea lion lets me go.
Thirty seconds later, I resurface.
- And he's killing over there.
- What's the game plan here?
This whole depressed energy is not getting the job done.
- I can't compete with him, all right?
- I don't care.
And to this day, you can't say my name around Jose Canseco.
I know.
Give me your hand.
What?
Come on.
She's looking.
- You positive she saw us?
- Yes.
- She just looked over here.
- Laugh.
- What?
- Laugh like we're really having fun.
Okay, take it down.
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, no, no, it's okay.
Just keep... don't look... turn away... 
- oh, God, I just sucked in a fuzz.
- Are you okay?
Okay, everybody,
I know tonight isn't about me...
But my beautiful girlfriend,
Stephanie, and I...
Recently won a ballroom dancing competition.
I hardly had any lessons, but I'm wicked athletic...
And like I said, we won.
In honor of the bride and groom, we'd like to perform our dance.
Get up.
This is our song.
This is my song with Stephanie.
No, it couldn't be.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
No. No.
Okay, this is definitely the song, then.
Maybe it's a coincidence.
It's a very popular song.
Maybe she is thinking about you.
I'll wait.
I don't believe this.
This is a clear statement.
It's premeditated, very definitive.
She knew exactly what she was doing.
This is definitely on purpose.
We are... okay, okay.
Can you do any of that?
No.
Okay, you're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.
Oh, man, they're good.
He's lifting her.
How did they... ? Wait.
They practiced, I have a dress on.
Wait. I can do this one.
Hold me, grab me.
- Have you got me?
- You know what? I have you.
No one's looking. Get off.
Thank you, thank you.
All right, freestyle.
Us too, over here.
He did a push-up. He did a push-up.
- Well, that was really great.
- They're, like, the perfect couple.
Hold on a sec.
This is our song.
Come on. Come on.
Did you know...
That the female eagle...
Is attracted to the male...
That can fly the highest?
Soar with me.
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah.
You know what?
I'm gonna go get some air. Okay.
Thanks.
- Madame, please, don't touch that.
- Sorry.
Okay. All right.
Come back here. Get down.
This is prohibited.
What's he doing?
Griffin.
I'm so sorry and I'm gonna reimburse you for everything.
Don't sweat it. The ice sculpture was her mother's idea.
- How is Robin's leg?
- Oh, she's fine.
- It was more of a pull than a tear.
- I hit her so flush.
- She just went with the fall.
- The legs were:
- Agile.
- Yeah, she's bendy.
Don't worry about it. Relax.
All right. Thanks, bro.
Listen.
I don't know what you're trying to prove with all your ribbons...
And your fancy moves...
But what do you say you just back the hell off?
And what do you say we drop the moves and we settle this like men?
Okay. Come on, let's go.
I haven't beaten anybody since my birthday.
What's up? We gonna do this?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- It's attack position.
Man, it's gotta suck to be you.
Attack.
Griffin's phone. Go for Bernie.
- I split my pants.
- I'm putting you on speaker.
So how's it going?
What part of "split my pants” don't you get? My butt's hanging out.
I took out an ice sculpture,
Gale got in my face, it's a mess.
Griffin, if you wanna give up, I get you.
- He's not giving up.
- Okay.
Don't back down from that guy.
You get in his face, make him back down.
As far as the girl goes, you keep her off balance.
You insult her. That's right.
You make her feel bad.
Then you compliment her.
You knock her down, you bring her up.
When she seems interested, walk away.
Throw poop at her.
That's how I met Karen.
You can do this.
- Go.
- Close the deal, Griffin.
Throw the poop.
I'm doing this.
- What's up, puppy-breath?
- What?
Just saying looking good, freckle-chest, yeah.
Man, I am hungry.
Target sighted.
Griffin, what's going on?
Four words:
I need dessert, go.
God, you're beautiful.
- I am?
- Yeah, but you're still here.
Oh, dessert, go... okay, I'm going.
Thanks, boss.
Whoa, guy, back for more?
Does she talk about me?
Sorry?
Does she mention me?
Does the thought of what Steph and I had haunt you?
You know, keep you up at night?
You mean the way you flamed down?
Do we laugh every time we see a couple riding a horse on a beach?
- Oh, yeah.
- Not that specifically.
Every time we see an engagement ring...
A whisky bottle with a note in it, a mariachi band, horse stables or sand.
We laugh until we can't breathe.
And then we make out...
Hard.
- Your name's Gale.
- What?
- You have a woman's name.
- No.
No, Gale like Gale sayers, the football player.
You wish. Perfume and Teddy bears.
Daddy must have wanted a girl so he named you Gale.
- Watch it.
- Oh, sorry, Gale, you're a female.
- Hey, man, you better back off.
- Want me to back off, crystal Gayle?
- You got problems, man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Not in the mood, hammer thumbs.
Griffin, gone.
- We're leaving.
- Okay.
So tell me everything.
- What was with the robot moves?
- I don't know, I panicked.
I also ripped my pants and cried a little. It's a blur.
That was so fun.
Can we please do this every weekend?
Just show up at weddings and trash the place? Because we are good.
You know, forget good, we're great.
And we're bigger than weddings.
- We should rob banks.
- I'm in.
If you say, "let us knock off a gas station," I'd do it right now.
Give me your hand, feel this.
Feel my heartbeat, it's like a rabbit.
- All right.
- Oh, my God.
Actually, that's not good.
- Yeah, no, I gotta get that checked.
- Yeah.
And Kate, you were incredible.
Thank you.
I'm really glad that you asked me to come out tonight.
Francois.
I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.
Gale can be such an idiot.
Hey, I know you.
- You're that little zoo girl, right?
- Kate, yeah.
Okay, thank you so much for saving us from that lion.
Oh, my God, I almost passed out.
I was so scared.
Grif, do you think maybe we could go somewhere and talk?
- Can we just have a sec?
- Sure.
It worked. Can you believe it?
Yeah.
That's... that's amazing.
- That's what we came here for, right?
- It is, I... 
- you need to do this.
- Yeah?
- Yes, yes.
- You helped so much, thank you.
No, I'm just gonna take a taxi, or a shuttle or something.
- Go, go.
- Are you sure?
I can't believe it, thank you.
Hey, Stephanie.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Okay, let's review your order.
That'll be 64 meat lover's pizzas,
32 Caesar salads.
And can I interest you in our new fudge roll?
Yes.
All right, let's see, that's a total of $1636 74.
Will that be cash or credit?
Hang it up, hang it up.
So close.
I am so happy right now.
You know that, ever feel that?
All the time, like... you happy now?
Because right now I'm happy.
And it's, like, all of a sudden it just hits you, like, bam, I'm happy now.
Gosh, you know, I have a fashion show tomorrow, I want you to come.
Tomorrow, I'm supposed to work.
Sad face.
- How about instead... 
- What?
You come to the zoo.
I give you a private tour.
That's a terrible idea.
I really thought you were different.
But the same old zoo stuff.
You know what?
Let someone else zoo-keep tomorrow.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't remember this Griffin.
Yeah, well, you get used to it because now it's all about you.
- Okay.
- You know what else?
You got a bat in the cave.
Yeah, she got a booger.
- No, don't say that.
- Gross.
No, other side, nostril.
Take care of that.
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- You better.
- Don't go anywhere.
- Not going anywhere.
- Throw out the napkin.
- Okay, I'm so sorry.
- Dead empty when you get back.
- Okay.
Jurgen. Jurgen.
- Stephanie.
- Hi.
Kiss, kiss.
This is Jurgen Milraux.
Who is this chaotic pile of man?
He's ruining the vibes here.
He is a waste of space.
I'm sorry, what?
You scream, "help me,
I'm worthless and funny-looking."
Can l...?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.
- Hey, siegfried, where's Roy?
- What?
How's the chocolate factory,
Willy Wonka?
I'm sorry, but you walked right into that one, grandma hair.
Grandma hair?
He got the grandma hair, he got the grandma hair.
I don't understand one word.
Here's what you have to understand, your face is a poem.
I feel...
...pleasure.
Whoa, let's put the donkey back in the barn.
Gonna mingle.
You were awesome in there.
Oh, my God, my friends love you.
You were so great. I gotta say, you are really getting there.
Look, I hope you don't mind but I talked to your brother...
And you have a job at the dealership if you want it.
Is that pushy?
Hey, you know what? Fine, I'm pushy.
It's just... 
I think that that zoo is really holding you back.
You deserve better.
We deserve better.
We?
Good call, Glenn.
An animal like you on this bad boy?
It's top of the food chain. Follow.
Shana, wanna grab us an espresso and a Montblanc?
- We're having a signing party.
- Yes, sir.
Enjoy the hunt.
Dancing.
- Back off, Nimer.
- You back off.
- Oh, not cool.
- Yeah.
What's up?
- Welcome to the dream.
- Help!
I don't like this thing!
Make it stop, make it stop!
- That looks difficult.
- You know what's not difficult?
Giving a supermodel the bad news...
That I can't date you because
I'm already dating a supermodel.
Yeah.
- I gotta say, this is incredible.
- Where have you been?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about, I... it's time.
Oh, God, he's calling, letting her know he's here.
Watch this, look, look, look.
- Aren't they amazing?
- Yeah, no...
They're great.
They're fast and sincere.
- Did you know they mate for life?
- I do now.
Listen, Kate, I wanted you to be the first to know...
That I took a job working for my brother at his dealership.
- Shut up.
- I'm serious, I figured I'd... 
I'd done everything I set out to do in the zoo game and it was ....
The zoo game? What the hell are you talking about, Griffin?
You love working here, you're great at it. The animals love you.
Yeah, but maybe that's not enough.
It's time I start thinking about myself.
Okay, is this coming from you or Stephanie?
No, it's my decision" I mean, she thinks it's a good idea, but I do too.
Not buying it.
You can't see what's happening?
Yeah, I am changing me.
No, she's changing you into something that you're not.
Well, maybe what I was before wasn't what I was.
And it is now, maybe, that it is if it is the way it is.
- You're not making any sense.
- Makes enough sense that you get it.
Okay, look...
If you wanna quit,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.
But I want you to look me in the eye, and tell me this is what you really want.
It is.
There you have it.
Hey, bern...
Got your favorite.
- Hey, listen, I just wanted to... 
- Save it.
I already heard.
You know, you almost had me convinced things could be different.
That I could actually trust someone again.
You can.
Oh, I gotta take this. One sec.
Yo, go for Grif.
No, mohegan blue.
Chrome wheel package, buddy.
Papers are all ready for you, make it happen, slam it.
All right, gotta go.
Oh, sorry, bern.
All people lie and I was an idiot to believe you.
Hey, Shane.
I'm gonna let you in on a little something.
Ten years ago, you and Bernie had an incident.
I know what you did.
I also know you lied about it.
So?
So if you ever do anything like that again...
I will go to your house and I will beat you in front of your mother.
I'm telling you, vern, this baby does zero to 60 in under four seconds.
Yeah, I don't know, I... 
- I got grandkids.
- That's even better.
You stick them back here.
You tell them it's a secret cave.
I can't take it. I miss Griffin.
I know you can't see it but my lip won't stop quivering.
- He wouldn't be gone if you'd listened.
- You talked to him first.
- Yeah, he's right, you know?
- I can't take it.
- You're killing us with the crying.
- You were sobbing all night.
- I wasn't, I have sleep apnea.
- Sounded like baby-crying.
- Baby-crying.
- What did you say, thumbs?
- Come down and say it to my face.
- I leave this tree, I'm slapping you silly.
You come down and I'll use you as a loofah.
- How? You have no thumbs.
- Oh, yeah?
Let's do this. I'll start from my back.
Bring it.
- That's it, I'm quitting my diet.
- Can't quit something you never started.
- You know what I think we should do?
- Not a zoo animal!
Hey, Kate.
Hey, Venom.
Oh, what are they doing out?
Grieving. They miss Griffin.
- Oh, I know how they feel.
- Yeah.
Look, Venom, I'm sorry, but I'm leaving the zoo tomorrow.
- You too?
- Yeah.
The eagle enclosure is up and running so I'm taking a job in Nairobi.
Why?
I was gonna pass because I started having feelings for someone here...
But he's with somebody else, so....
You know?
I do.
What are you doing?
Oh, what are you doing?
Don't you play possum.
- What?
- You know?
You started having feelings.
Come on, "someone here."
I was talking about Griffin.
Tragic misread of situation.
Feel as though you're breathing through your eyes.
Hey, babe, how was your day?
Did you sell a lot of cars?
Three, but you know what? One guy, he didn't feel like he needed it.
- Do you love it?
- Trying to complete the pose ....
- Is that a chair?
- Yes, it's a Chintoko.
- Really?
- There's only five in the entire world.
Sit, sit, sit.
- Yeah, okay.
- I love it.
- Isn't it comfy, cozy?
- Yeah.
Totally amazing. I just think this whole place looks so great.
It's really just... it's coming together.
I'm so happy.
Really gives this whole room a nice zhuzh. You know what I mean?
Hey, you know what? I ordered in dinner tonight from Le Chereaux.
Oh, you know what else?
That just reminds me, we have an absinthe tasting on Mathieu's sailboat.
- Yeah, Mathieu.
- Do you remember him?
He's disgustingly rich.
Okay, I gotta get my yoga.
Hey, you think it's bad feng shui that we have a tv in the living room?
I feel if I do yoga in here...
It will counterbalance the whole bad juju, you know?
Bad juju of the tv.
Wait till I show you this new dress I bought.
What's wrong?
Hoping for someone else?
Hungry?
Guys, see that lady there?
I just sold her an extended warranty we don't even have.
Nice, guy, nice.
We've got a high roller checking out the Mercedes McLaren.
Knock yourself out, Nimer.
Oh, you got a good eye.
Griffin Constantine Keyes.
The changes I've seen in you...
These past few weeks have been nothing short of remarkable.
And I've been doing a little soul-searching.
And I made a mistake five years ago on that beach.
- And I wanna correct it. So will you... ?
- Yeah, not gonna happen.
What?
Come on, you had to see this coming.
Look, when we first started dating you assumed I was gonna turn into...
The type of guy you always dreamed about.
But you know what?
I don't like that guy.
I don't like this job.
I don't, bro, I'm sorry.
It's not... yeah, this I love.
But we'll always have this, you know?
I love you, right? Okay, good.
I don't like this suit.
I don't like our chintaki chairs.
- Chintoko.
- Either, I don't like them.
I don't like that I can't understand
90 percent of the stuff you talk about.
But most of all,
I hate who I've become.
I'll ignore them.
Shut up.
Shut up, he didn't say yes.
I'm not gonna pay you.
Come back for your watch?
No, I came back to see if you were interested in happy hour at Friday's.
Look, if you're here just to yank my chain... 
I'm not.
I wanna tell you I'm sorry.
And I know I let you down.
And that you... you're my best friend.
And, oh, yeah, I... 
I dumped Stephanie.
- Nicely done.
- Yeah.
- Hey, what happened to your eye?
- It's good to have you back, Grif.
Hey, Griffin, you're back.
Oh, everyone's gonna be so happy.
- Right now I gotta go talk to Kate, okay?
- Griffin, Kate's gone.
- She's leaving for Africa tonight.
- What?
She's on a 9:15 flight.
Oh, man, it's my fault.
- I blew it.
- It's my fault.
- I told you to be someone you're not.
- No, you know what? It's my fault.
I was worried you were gonna leave,
I wasn't thinking about you.
It's not my fault.
I said throw poop at her, always works.
Who cares whose fault it is?
There's still time. Let's get Kate.
Follow me, everyone.
Nothing can stand in our way.
Wow, he is really hauling.
Oh, he stopped.
- He's eating a pretzel.
- Barry is right, I'm going to get her.
Wait, it's bumper to bumper to the airport. Whoa, almost took off.
My gosh, you're right.
It's rush hour, I'll never make it.
I can get you there.
I'm the fastest animal in the zoo.
Plus, I fit in the bike Lane. Hop on.
Hop off, hop off.
New plan. Follow me.
Griffin, I got your back, baby.
Wait, where you going?
Hey, Griffin, you nut.
What are you doing back there?
- Nothing, everything is fine.
- Can't be in that area, it's unauthorized.
A guy inside said it's okay.
They will allow it.
Listen, having a party Saturday, a blowout.
Sounds good, I'm there.
I love blowouts.
- It's gonna be wild.
- I'll see you.
- Where you going, Griffin?
- Hey, get out.
- I can do this.
- Wait, don't leave.
- Okay.
- Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Hey, Griffin! I'm saying... hey.
Hang on a second.
Where are you going?
Can't leave me here.
I'm out of the zoo without my izod.
Griffin, what a surprise.
Hi, Mrs. d.
Hey.
Ma!
- Take a cookie, sweetie.
- Oh, thanks, Mrs. d.
Ma!
- Come on, the road's blocked.
- Yeah, oh... how about this?
I'll go around the back.
Come on. What do we do?
Oh, you... you know what?
A heads up would be nice.
Go, I'll meet you there.
Kate!
Wait, stop!
Kate!
Oh, God, she's gone.
- It's over.
- It's not over.
Get in.
- Stay in sync.
- I'm trying.
Your arms are twice as long as mine.
Hurry, we gotta out her off at the bridge or she's gone.
Row, gorilla, row.
Come on, use those big arms, baby.
Now we're doing it.
Row, row, row.
Bernie.
I was kind of hoping we'd see some steps.
- Get on.
- What?
- Get on my back.
- Okay.
You know what?
I don't think I can do this.
I'm afraid of heights.
- Oh, no.
- Don't look down.
- That's not helping.
- Don't look up.
Bernie, I'm looking down.
This is not good, give me your hand.
There she is.
Hurry, she's on the move.
What are you stopping for?
Just be yourself, Griffin.
That's all you need to do.
- Now go get your girl.
- How?
- Griffin?
- Kate, hey.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was cartwheeling.
What? _i__ oh, you said... 
- you said eagles, they mate for life.
- Yes.
Well, when an eagle finds it's perfect mate, they cartwheel, right?
That's what they do. They lock their talons together and spin out of control.
And just before they hit the ground, they break apart.
The only difference between me and an eagle is...
I will hit the ground as you've just seen.
You said you were done with the zoo game.
I thought I had to change who I was to be happy...
But I was wrong.
Kate, it took me five years to get over someone I wasn't even in love with.
I can't imagine how long it would take to get over you.
And on a side note, I may have crushed an ostrich getting here.
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.
- He's fine, he's... 
- No, no.
Yeah, we should get him back, we should.
Wait a sec.
What the heck is benihana?
You still got your izod?
Get it.
I can't get it off.
I don't know what that was.
Share the road. You all right?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What is he doing?
That's a crazy stance right there.
You don't stay- you... 
I mean, you just stay, don't go anywhere.
Yeah, baby.
Okay, that... whoa, man, I feel like I went through a car wash right then.
All right, all right, be careful.
There is a place.
A place that knows no sadness.
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.
A place inhabited by little blue beings three apples high.
It lies deep in an enchanted forest, hidden away beyond a medieval village.
Most people believe this place is made up, only to be found in books or in children 's imaginations.
Well, we beg to diff en
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!
I'm going in!
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!
Yes!
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!
Oh, yeah! So excited!
Now you see us, now you don't!
Three, two, one. Yeah!
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf plays their own special pad.
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro for the Blue Moon Festival!
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!
Clumsy! Help!
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!
Smurf on the loose!
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.
Who's clumsy now, huh?
Hey, what do you get when you cross a Smurf with a cow?
Blue cheese! I got you a present.
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!
But, wait! I...
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal for the Blue Moon Festival?
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.
Grouchy, it's right there.
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."
Clearly you two lack the verbal skills required
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy, the other Smurfs don't want to dance with you for fear of what are politely called
"fractures."
How could anybody think that?
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.
Watch it, there!
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.
As happy and as perfect as life in Smurf village is, even sunshine and butterflies must have their dark clouds.
And for all Smurfs, that dark cloud has one name.
Gargamel, the evil wizard.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
This is so wrong
"I'm Papa Smurf.
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people
"and live in the forest with 99 sons and one daughter.
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.
"And I betrayed Gargamel, and I don't even care.
"And everything is just sunshine and rainbows."
But all of that is about to change.
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!
That's your cue to pounce on the miserable beasts in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.
I simply can't stop thinking about the miserable beasts every single minute of every single day.
'Cause I need them!
It is only by capturing the little wretches and extracting their happy blue essence that my magic will finally become...
Not infallible.
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.
I shall become the most powerful wizard in all of the world.
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.
"O great one?"
Yes, lying, deceptive, horrible little Smurfette?
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching, how ever do you expect to find us?"
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.
For, you see, I have a magical map that shows me exactly where the smurf root grows!
I shall now use my formidable powers to magically transport us here!
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!
Alakazoop!
Great.
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?
We really need that Smurf essence.
Alakazamp!
Now tie it off right there!
That blue moon time of year again.
Time to smurf some magic.
Summon a vision and see what our future holds.
I must get the visioning potion just right.
The magic is always strongest during the blue moon.
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.
A dragon wand.
I got it! I got it!
Clumsy.
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!
Papa!
Clumsy, what have you done?
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?
Are you okay?
Yes. Fine.
Why aren't you rehearsing for the Blue Moon celebration?
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face, so I thought I'd make some smurf root mud packs to take down everyone's swelling.
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.
No! Those fields are too close to Gargamel's castle.
I'll get the smurf root.
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?
Okay. If you say so.
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.
Let's see, just a few more...
- Boo.
- Gargamel!
Help!
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!
A ball of yarn!
A nice, juicy bird!
So, that's it!
It's invisible.
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if it's safe.
Azrael?
Are you dead?
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?
Nothing apocalyptic, really.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Perfect. Another year we don't have to worry about that mean, old...
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.
No, no! Gargamel!
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta accidentally led him to the village.
Gargamel!
Smurf for your lives!
Everybody skedaddle!
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!
Sound the alarm, Crazy.
This is really bad!
Smurfs, that way!
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!
There you go, you nasty cat.
- This way!
- This is no joke!
- Look out!
- Papa!
Let go! Cursed nature!
Here comes papa, Papa!
Papa, your primitive little defenses, they're useless against me, sir!
I laugh at them.
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?
Maybe this will all blow over.
I can fix this. I just gotta think.
Yes!
Follow me, everyone!
Save yourselves!
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!
The one time we want him to trip and he's running perfectly!
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!
This is not good at all.
Clumsy!
Help!
Well, we tried. Let's go.
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.
Not the Smurf bridge!
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.
This is not a Smurf bridge, it's clearly a chain...
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?
Oh, no!
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!
- Don't let go!
- Help!
Help!
Look out for the hole!
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.
Smurf up! It's a hole.
Hold on!
Oh, no!
Looks like you got the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?
Now you belong to me!
Not this time, Gargamel!
What's wrong with you?
That was great! Let's have another go.
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!
We're not even wet.
What part of the enchanted forest is this?
My calculations indicate...
That's slimy.
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.
Oh, my.
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.
And can't we just go around the rock?
Oh, my smurf.
Where the smurf are we?
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle, that's where.
Well, at least they're not coming after us.
Oh, yeah. Really?
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!
- Run!
- Not again!
Azrael? Are you dead?
Must have Smurfs!
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!
- Guys, come on!
- Go!
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.
Hey, can we get the photographer over there?
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.
If you could not stand directly in front of the display, but over to the sides, it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.
Also, don't forget to smile.
Remember, you're working for a cosmetics company. That's it.
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!
Hello, Henri.
On top of everything with the campaign, Patrick?
Well, as much as I can be.
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.
Patrick!
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.
It's gonna be quite the gala.
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.
Can you give me what I want?
Is that what you're asking for?
How would I know what I'm asking for when I don't even know what I want?
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.
Exacto! I need you to create a new campaign for Jouvenel.
All digital, of course, so it can be ready on time for the launch.
Odile, that's two days.
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign, it's kind of tight.
But... No, two days is perfect.
God only needed six days for the whole world, right?
Fail me, and maybe you can go and work for him.
Where are we, Azrael?
What manner of freakish realm is this?
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?
Yes, yes, of course.
This day just keeps getting better and better.
So we're just gonna jump in the portal, get back to our village and everybody's happy, right?
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.
We're all gonna die.
Papa Smurf, how do we get home with the portal closed?
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight, the portal will open again.
Now, let's take shelter till dark.
All right, let's get smurfing.
Okay, but I'm not happy.
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!
Way to go, Smurfette!
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!
Smurf!
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!
Hey.
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.
Why don't we just go around the tree?
There you are. By all means, relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.
What? Where?
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!
Be careful, Brainy.
Hey. Hey!
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!
A jump from this height will Knock the blue out of us!
- My hip.
- Papa!
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!
Stop that carriage!
Never mind. Here it is.
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!
You've had that coming for about 30 years!
Smurfs!
Oh, wow.
Castles and palaces everywhere!
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.
And look at the giant princess!
This village is amazing, Papa.
Yes, and likely very dangerous.
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,
I need you all to stay close and do exactly as I say.
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.
You can count on us, Papa.
They can see us! Camouflage.
Blend in.
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.
We get to climb another tree.
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!
- Brainy.
- That's it.
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.
How are we supposed to find Clumsy in there?
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.
- Grace?
- Hello?
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...
Baby kicked.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Please say hello.
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.
This is the sound of my voice.
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.
Hello.
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.
Or the new VP of marketing.
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!
- It's...
- It's provisional.
If I wow Cruella de Odile, then I'll keep the job.
If not, then my head'll be on a pike next to the last guy.
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.
But I have two days.
- Yikes.
- I know.
What if I don't get them done in time?
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.
Unless...
Wait, the backup ads we have did fine in focus groups.
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.
Azrael, we've come so far, yet ever am I haunted by the same familiar riddle.
How to find the Smurfs?
If only I...
I'm sorry, is my thinking interrupting your vile hacking?
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.
Very nice. Are you done now?
I don't want to look at it.
What? What?
Is that... No. No, it can't be.
It is.
The tawny locks of Smurfette.
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!
With my skills, even this small trifle of smurfiness will yield me just enough power to catch them all!
I must find a laboratory with which to tease the magic from these precious little strands.
Yes. it's a bit small, but this should do nicely!
It's even got its own cauldron.
What died in here?
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!
Somebody's been working a dark and terrible magic in there.
What is that?
On, baby.
Daddy is home.
Come on.
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.
How are we gonna open a magical portal when we can't even find Clumsy?
Hey, I think I see something up there.
Oh, no.
Clumsy? Is that you?
Hello.
Help! Help!
Oh, smurf.
Hey.
"Berry Boom."
Patrick!
Elway. Elway.
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!
What is it?
No, no!
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.
Elway.
Elway. Did you do that?
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.
- I got this side.
- All together now.
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.
GO! Pull the lid!
Gross.
This is so...
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...
Did you just talk?
I'm not saying till you put down the giant spiky thing.
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?
- Get out of here!
- Look out!
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!
Kiss my smurf!
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!
- Over here!
- Get him!
Have you had enough? Tap out?
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!
Other way! Other way!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!
Run!
Elway!
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!
Grace! Run!
Stop bleating like a sheep and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.
Grace, we're being attacked!
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!
It's okay, it's okay.
They're friendly.
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.
I was about to make haggis with your innards.
This is it. This is it, Azrael!
Smurfette's hair goes in here, flows through the Smurf essence extractor, and finally, I have my Smurfilator!
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...
Would you care for a mint when you're done?
Yes, yes, yes!
With this precious elixir, my sorcerous spell shall be powerful beyond all measurable measurement.
This one tiny drop will give me the power to capture them all.
This is great!
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin
It's so obvious that what you're doing is wrong.
Oh, really? After you.
How crazy is this?
There are little blue people singing in our kitchen!
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?
Sorry.
Okay. It says here Smurfs are mythical creatures from Belgium,
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.
Documented by Peyo.
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.
It says they're mythical, Grace.
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.
Well, they look pretty real to me.
Come on.
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.
You guys come from a magic forest where you live in oversized mushrooms.
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.
And you like to use the extremely imprecise term "smurf"
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.
And you're all named after your personalities?
Do you get your names when you're born, or after you've exhibited certain traits?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
Yeah, whatever.
Master Winslow, there must be something about the blue moon on your magic window machine.
Just what is this magic searching device?
Right now, I'm using Google.
- Google.
- Google.
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.
"A figurative construct..."
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!
"But the moon itself doesn't appear to be blue."
- What?
- Not blue?
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,
I'll just have to smurf us a potion to invoke the blue moon.
You hear that, honey?
They're only staying till an actual blue moon rises.
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion, which, at this point, seems completely plausible.
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.
Of course, the stars will need to be perfectly aligned.
And when that might be is hard to determine without the proper instrument.
Master Winslow, might I borrow your stargazer?
My what-whatzer?
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!
Besides, Papa had a vision, and everything turns out smurf y.
Right, Papa?
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.
What does the temperature of this Lilly have to do with the finding of Smurfs?
- Take your meds, man.
- What?
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.
Pardon me, wise sir?
By any chance, have you seen any little blue men?
They're everywhere!
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.
I know.
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.
Great. We're gonna be here how long?
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.
Next, find a book of spells and then smurf a portal and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.
Bye, Elway.
Someone looks smurfalish!
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft, like a blacksmith's apron.
I wear it because it's what everyone wears at work.
What are you, you pasty giant?
I try to get people to buy things by analyzing market trend predictions.
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.
Look, I would love to explain but I am super late. I gotta go.
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?
You had one outfit on, and now you're wearing something completely different.
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette, she probably got the other one dirty.
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know, somebody wants a bigger mushroom.
But, then you'd be further apart.
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.
I've got a baby on the way, so...
Wait, wait. We can't just leave them here alone, without an adult.
I'm 546 years old.
Of course you are.
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.
- Love you.
- Okay.
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere if I were you.
Why not?
Our world doesn't do well with visitors from other places.
I mean, look what happened to E.T.
It's a movie. A moving picture.
Book. Just stay, okay?
Great. He's gone and we still don't have a Stargazer.
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller, he reads stars all the time.
Ergo, it's at his place of business.
Excellent work, Brainy.
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.
Clumsy, I think it might be best if you stay here. You know?
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Smurf away!
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?
Look, he's getting into the mechanical wagon.
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!
Goodbye, blue world.
Use your hat, you ninny!
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.
We're stopping. Hold on tight.
Not to me, Grouchy.
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.
Master Winslow, we really need your help.
- Hey.
- Right here.
What are you doing here?
What part of "we need a Stargazer" don't you understand, you numptie?
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?
If we could just have a quick look around in your predicting parlor...
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.
All of you. Trust me.
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.
I'm not going... Hey!
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.
All right, who smurf ed?
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.
I hope you guys like desk drawers, because that's where...
- You're late.
- Odile!
You were in my office.
It's my building, and we have much work to do.
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?
Close. I had a crazy morning.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.
Nervous energy.
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.
- I like it.
- Yep.
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.
Hey! Stop it.
- Henri.
- Make it work.
You have no idea.
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.
Are you crazy?
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?
I'm sorry, Master Winslow, but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?
It's not something people of this century just have, especially here.
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.
Well, perhaps we could sing to help things along.
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long
Stop.
La la la la la la
Stop!
Sing a happy song
Come on. None of you find that song just the tiniest bit annoying?
I find it annoying.
Well, what do you sing at work?
- I don't sing at work.
- What?
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.
I know. How about if we hum?
Please stop humming.
I need to hone my message here.
I've got a message.
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.
That's good. You should use that.
Or, "Dance and be happy."
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?
It's an embarrassment of riches.
They're giving you gold here.
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow, you'll know it's the right message if it comes from the heart.
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.
- You said it.
- Absolutely.
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.
I love emerging dramatically through the smoke.
It makes... It makes me feel so deliciously mysterious.
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.
What?
Where? Where?
What?
Curses! So close.
What?
Theirs is upside-down.
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.
- Hi.
- Hello.
What are you doing?
Just greening things up a bit.
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but, you know, I'm not so sure this stuffs gonna grow out here.
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.
So where is everybody else?
They went to get a Stargazer so Papa can smurf a blue moon to get us home.
And they went without you?
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?
- Hey!
- Sorry!
Why don't we come inside?
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that this new anti-aging cream can make any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.
Astonishing, really.
I see no transformation.
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish, if you ask me.
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.
How sad for you in 30 years.
Henri, escort this lunatic out.
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?
Alakazootiful!
How did you do that?
Yes, and seriously, me next.
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards never reveal their secrets.
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.
Please, señor Can you do that again?
You may attempt to persuade me.
What is it that you desire?
Riches?
Fame?
Fortune?
With my help, the whole world will know the name that is Garbagesmell.
Gargamel.
Yes. With my help, the whole world will know the genius that is Gargamel.
L.m
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone, on the bright side, I did land us all here in your little mushroom, and we got to meet you and Patrick.
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.
Well, I used to be.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So how long did it take you to...
Gosh.
Un-fumble your feet?
Well, about as long as it takes to realize that nobody's just one thing.
You can be anything you wanna be.
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.
Probably not.
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.
First, you put your...
Works every time.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
This is a fascinating wind machine you have here.
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!
They are everywhere and they won't stop singing.
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill to get what you have in that ring.
Not if we Kill them first.
Let's see, we're going to need some knights, preferably in shining armor, some bowmen, poison arrows.
I like the way you think.
And some spikes to mount their heads on.
Well, it is all about the presentation.
And, of course, all of our testing would be animal cruelty-free?
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?
Get out of here.
You have a wicked sense of humor.
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!
Henri?
I said, get out of here.
Señor Gargamel, now you must assure me, darling, that you can recreate whatever it was that you did to my mother, but on a massive scale.
Do that, and the world will worship you.
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...
Heretic. Yes, thank you.
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon has gone straight to my nether regions.
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.
Now, to the matter at hand.
So do we have a deal, señor?
Not quite, my sweet maiden.
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!
Hit the deck!
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.
Can't everyone just slow down
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!
Wait for it.
I gotta get me one of those.
Oh, my gosh!
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!
When we get inside, spread out and find that Stargazer.
Come on, Smurfs!
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.
Grace, are you running?
No, no, I'm totally fine, but they need your help!
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna get themselves killed!
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.
Patrick, they need you.
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!
All right. Where are you?
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
You call that groveling, you fool?
Every village has an idiot. What?
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!
Smurf thief!
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...
So that's where all the unicorns went.
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.
Fine. Then hang on.
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.
Perfect.
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!
That'll put some air up your skirt!
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.
Predator!
Smurf droppings.
These are disgustingly tasty.
Hello.
Oh, creepy.
I hope they weren't looking for a stargazer, too.
Stargazers, stargazers...
Dresses!
You mean I can have more than one kind of dress?
What?
Papa, I'm telling you, we're never gonna find those...
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.
Hold still, stairs!
Look at the stair-climbing toy!
- Hey.
- What is that?
- Let me see it.
- Careful.
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.
Just say who you are and be who you say, right?
I can't seem to get it to scan.
My son wants one of those blue animatronic things.
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.
What aisle did you find this on?
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?
What? Ice Bat?
It comes in pink.
Smurf thief! Stop!
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?
You bet.
Smurf!
But I've got feelings.
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence on that old hag?
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!
I'm not a toy!
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?
- There she is!
- There she is!
Hey, this dress is mine!
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!
A giant's after me! She's huge!
Hey, that's mine!
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...
- Mommy!
- Really?
Don't ever forget that one magical moment our two worlds met.
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.
Hey!
That's one!
Technically, when loading cargo onto the head of a bear,
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.
Hold onto your knickers, boys, it's about to get grisly.
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!
Let's go, go, go!
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.
Two more!
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!
Grace, that's Gargamel!
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.
Bad kitty!
Oh, I hate that Cat!
Gargamel.
Smurfette.
More lovely than ever.
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.
Or not!
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...
Yahoo!
- Patrick.
- Hey.
- Impressive.
- Thanks.
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!
Or suffer the wrath of the great and powerful...
Let me... Let me see here...
How can you be the only girl in the village?
Well, see, I wasn't brought by a stork like the others.
I was created by Gargamel to trap the other Smurfs.
Wow. And then what happened?
Papa saved me.
He cast a special spell and then helped me become the Smurf I was meant to be.
No. Play it safe.
"Odile, pending your approval, it's ready to go to the billboard agency."
Well, here goes nothing.
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent, it's a whole new wager.
Without that blue moon, our giblets are gravy.
Well, it's off.
Time to either celebrate or file for unemployment.
Hey, what's wrong?
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. it's okay.
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.
I know the feeling.
Better yet...
I know the cure.
You just match the colors with the buttons.
You try.
Hey! Go, Grouchy!
- You're good!
- Nice one!
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!
Walk this way...
You sing.
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss
It's a rock face.
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?
Never mind.
- Like this
- Like this
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy
Little skirts climbing way up her knee
Not another single girl in the whole smurf in' world
And I can't believe she's lookin' at me
- it's a complete
- Surrender
- To the power of her
- Gender
So I close my eyes and make a wish
- I just want to
- Savor
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!
- Gutsy!
- Nice!
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
That was rare.
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Sorry, boys.
Yeah, that cools the giblets.
Nothin' like a cool breeze through my Enchanted Forest.
- It's approved.
- What?
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?
Well, she said "approved," so coming from her, that's love.
Oh, my goodness!
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!
Yeah.
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.
Do it, do it.
Go, go, go!
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard in New York City.
It's a go, laddie boy!
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.
But we are going home, right?
Of course. Just not tonight.
Now, off to bed.
I was hoping I'd be sleeping in my mushroom tonight.
I miss the other Smurfs.
Me, too.
I've never spent the night away from home before.
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Papa?
Do you really believe we're ever gonna get home to the other Smurfs?
Don't worry.
We'll be reunited with the others soon enough.
If only the stars would align.
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.
- Aye.
- Yeah.
He's always so nice, but when he leaves you feel bad.
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.
Oh, hello, little moth.
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.
Both of us meant to soar.
Go now, and bring back an army of mighty eagles to free me.
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.
Fly! Fly!
Fly!
Okay. Let's see here.
Hey.
I'm guessing you have a long night ahead of you.
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?
So tell me, that weird guy in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?
Not the smartest of sorcerers, but dangerous just the same.
Thank you.
Back home, I could hold him at bay with a spell or two.
But here, without my books and potions...
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?
Well, what are you gonna do?
I'll do anything and everything I can do to get my Smurfs home.
I won't ever give up. They're my family.
And you never give up on family.
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes having all those little guys depending on you?
I mean, what if you screw up?
How'd you know when you were ready?
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.
Yeah, right. Scratch that.
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you come for us today when your Grace called?
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.
Well, that's what being a papa is.
When it comes time, you just do.
And knowing what to do doesn't come from up here.
It comes from here, where it matters most.
My spleen?
No, your heart.
I'm trying to have a moment here, you whippersnapper.
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.
Come on, baby, stop playing.
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?
You know what happens to people who sit on my bench?
Be gone with you, behemoth, for I have instructed a moth to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles to free me from this confine.
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.
You see? You see?
The dungeon isn't built that can hold the likes of Gargamel.
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!
So long, scallywags!
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.
Wait, take me with you!
Wait! Wait!
To my castle for more essence!
Here they come, here they come.
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.
- There we are.
- Clumsy.
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.
I think there's too much pink.
Just because your name is Grouchy doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.
Yeah, it does.
- Smurfette.
- Hi.
- High five. High four.
- High four.
Great news! The stars have revealed a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!
- All right!
- Smurftastic!
I never doubted it for a second.
It has to be done tonight, between first star and high moon.
That's our only chance.
But we'll need a magic spell that works in this realm to open the portal home.
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.
Is there a place that sells spells?
No.
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.
How about old books?
Wait, there's an antique book shop right near where I work.
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.
Hey! Smurf hug!
Oh, I love you guys!
Bring it in, big fella.
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.
Hey, get up here.
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.
We've already got one.
- Really?
- What?
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.
That's the wrong ad.
What happened to my office?
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Someone sent this to the ad agency last night.
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta, just got me fired.
You sent the wrong file.
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.
I never wanted a house full of little people running around!
Blue. Little blue...
Okay...
Patrick.
What are you doing?
Going to try to save my job.
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!
There's no call for that kind of language, laddie.
See?
Okay, Patrick, wait.
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.
Just stop and listen to me for a second, please.
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?
And I hope that you can straighten that out.
But you are so not seeing the big picture here.
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.
Of all the people on the planet, those magical little creatures came to us.
They chose us.
Don't you see how absolutely amazing that is?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.
This is our blue moon.
And if you don't stop for just a second to see that, you're gonna miss it.
Hey, hey. Taxi!
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!
There's got to be some essence in here somewhere!
NOT DOW.
What? What?
Very, very well done, my little friend.
And to think, I almost ate you that time.
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick, the rouge merchant.
He will lead us to our elusive little blue quarry.
Don't you just have a switch or something to shut them off?
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.
Smurf me.
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?
According to the searching device, we take the F machine two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?
- What?
- Jump!
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.
That was great.
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...
For smurf's sake.
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.
Oh, it smells like butter in here.
Where do you suppose this magic bookstore could be?
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.
- It's closed.
- Figures.
We have to find a way in. Come on.
I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.
All right, everybody.
- Hey.
- Wow.
This place looks creepy to me.
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.
Let's just get the book and get outta here.
You're right. This book of spells is our ticket home.
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire, limitless power and world adulation.
Now why does it have to be so hard?
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.
Wherever did you hear that ear-damning squall?
It's your little blue men.
I saw them going into the bookstore around the corner.
You know, that song is really annoying.
Cautiously excited.
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.
Oh. Nearly there.
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.
Ah, yes.
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. ”
Peyo.
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.
- Look at that.
- Wow.
Well, I'll be smurf ed.
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.
You see all that in there?
Look here, at the patterns on this page.
Openous-lockicuss.
What?
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.
Oh, that's just plain naughty.
All that remains now is to return to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle, where your essence shall finally be mine.
- The dragon wand.
- No!
It's...
Oh, please, please, allow me.
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!
Wait for me!
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.
After all, what is the hunt without the thrill!
No!
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.
Let's get outta here.
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion and smurf the moon tonight.
It has to be tonight.
Me? Smurf the moon?
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?
- Papa, no!
- No!
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?
Come to papa, Papa!
- Just go!
- Papa!
- Papa!
- No!
Keep movin', lass.
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?
What's gonna happen to Papa?
Papa told us to smurf the moon, and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
Come on. We don't have much time.
"Come on"? Come on, where?
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?
We ride. Come on!
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.
And Smurfs. Let's ride.
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!
But I'm not sure I can do this.
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!
According to my calculations, this is dangerous!
It's getting dark.
Yeah. Yeah, I think we'd better go look for them.
Yeah.
Hi.
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.
Listen, Grace, I'm...
Hey, Odile.
Patrick...
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,
I know that the ads that ran weren't the ads I sent.
But they're the ads I should have sent.
The ads I almost did send.
But I didn't 'cause...
I second-guessed myself.
I gave you what I thought you wanted, instead of what I thought was right.
But this is right.
It means something to me and...
I don't know,
I think it's gonna mean something to others, too.
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.
"Once in a blue moon."
That means that there are only a few moments in your life when something truly memorable, truly magical, happens to you.
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid, you might just miss it.
That's what that image means.
Don't let those blue moon moments pass you by.
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.
I so smurf in' love you.
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.
We're outta control!
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.
Look! We got the incantation.
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.
- What?
- Oh, no.
He took him to some place called BellVeedaRay Castle.
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?
Belve... He's taken him to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.
To extract his essence.
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.
Papa said no matter what happens we're not to go back for him.
He's trying to protect us.
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.
No, no, no. We can't.
We promised Papa we'd do exactly what he said.
- That's right.
- I didn't.
I never promised him anything.
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.
I'm in.
Aye. Me, too.
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few
And steal their essence blue
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!
Oh, look at this.
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard yields me all of this essence.
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest from your entire family of Smurfs.
Alakazookas!
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!
No. No! The cages! No! No!
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!
I'll snip it from their hair.
You're a fool, Gargamel.
My Smurfs are well on their way home by now.
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.
Good luck, Gutsy!
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.
Brainy, what's happening?
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.
I don't think I can do it.
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.
I'll be smurf ed!
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.
That which doesn't kill you only makes me stronger.
- Yo!
- Huh?
Gargamel! Come out and play!
Oh, I think our tiny little guests have finally arrived.
- No!
- Ah, well.
Enjoy the ride, Papa!
And remember, keep your hands and feet
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!
Smurfs, run!
Smurfs.
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurf ed!
Yeah, what he said.
Adorable.
Two little smurfs come to save their beloved Papa.
Hey, Gargamel.
Make that three little smurfs.
And I went home and got a few friends.
MY, my, my!
I think the whole village must be here.
Whatever will I do with all this essence?
On me, boys.
Fire!
Let's get this hoedown started!
There comes a time when every Smurf must stand up...
Watch it, you little hoodlums!
For what is good and cute and blue in the world.
And on this brisk New York night, that time is now.
Hey! Seriously?
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.
Eat yolk, Gargamel!
Patrick, can you do it?
Go, go, go!
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.
You know, one bad apple can ruin your whole day.
Full smurf ahead!
Come on!
Hey, Gargamel, here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...
- Fire.
- Fire.
I'm too beautiful to die!
Oh, Papa.
No. No, Smurfette.
What did he do to you?
You shouldn't have come back for me.
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.
Smurfette!
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.
Charge!
Get him!
Grab the wand!
- Goin' in!
- Go!
Bombs away!
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!
Hang on, Papa.
Onions!
Get back, cat.
Here, kitty, kitty...
Smurfette!
Looking for me?
Play time is over!
Behold the awesome power of me!
Smurfette?
Had enough, huh?
You're mine, kitty.
I'm done smurfing around.
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!
What's happening, Papa?
No!
Gargamel!
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.
Oh, Papa!
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa is about to meet his little blue end.
No!
Upsy-daisy!
Oh, no. Papa!
Papa!
No! No!
You again!
Goodbye!
I'm really...
This ends here, this ends now!
Really going to enjoy this.
Gotcha!
Freedom!
Son of a smurf!
Come back here!
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!
Come back here right now with my wand!
Oh, no. Crikey.
I... I got it.
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.
I got it! I got it!
The vision's never been wrong.
I got it!
My wand! Give me back my wand!
How dare you!
How dare you defy the great and powerful...
Oh, my God.
Smurfs!
Are you dead?
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!
- Patrick.
- Hey.
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!
Clumsy, you're a hero.
I'm a hero?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.
Thanks, Papa.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
And now to get rid of this!
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.
I'm not one for long goodbyes, but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.
- Bye.
- Take care.
I hated this. So much less than I expected.
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.
I've never had a girlfriend before.
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.
High four.
High four, Grace.
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.
Hero? Stop.
Well, actually, you mind saying it one more time?
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.
- You saved me.
- So long!
You saved my whole family.
Actually I think it was the other way around.
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.
Your village has given me some ideas.
Come here.
Goodbye, Papa.
Goodbye, Papa.
Let's go home.
And so, the Smurfs left the strange city of New York, and I think they left it a little sweeter, a little wiser, a little smurfier.
And as that portal began to close for the last time...
Hey! Seriously, stop!
Bye, New York!
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.
Finally someone has given me what I want.
I think I'm not fired.
Wow!
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby, some unique new friends...
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.
Grace,
I smurf you.
Smurfs. Smurfs!
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.
What are you looking at?
MALE OVER RADIO: Scorch, Scorch, are you there?
Come on, Scorch, get back to me.
You haven't run off and done something reckless, have you?
Gary, we've got a problem!
GARY: That's my brother, Scorch.
As usual, he's in trouble.
How did he get into this mess?
For that, I have to go back a long, long time.
Forty-seven minutes ago.
Baby rescue mission. Planet Gnarlach.
GARY OVER RADIO: Quiet, Scorch.
Whatever you do, don't wake the Gnarlachs.
Hey, that's me, Gary Supernova.
I work in Mission Control, which means I control the mission.
Scorch doesn't see it that way.
Oh, relax, Gary, they're fast asleep.
GARY: And that is a Gnarlach.
- Scary, slimy...
- ...and surprisingly stinky.
GARY OVER RADIO: Uploading that to Blue Tube.
Gary, this place smells worse than the latrines at the BASA Academy.
Mmm. Thank you for that.
(MALE VOICE) Um, I was programmed at the BASA Academy.
The only thing I smelled there was progress.
Zip it, James.
The name's Bing, by the way. James Bing.
GARY OVER RADIO: All right, Scorch, let's find those babies
and get you out of there.
(WHISPERING) Bingo.
Spacecraft identified.
Good. Now proceed with extreme caution.
Negative.
Proceeding with style. (GRUNTS)
Not style again! Scorch! Shh!
Hah! Triple Star System into a Reverse Galaxy, followed by a Double Black Hole with a twist!
And he sticks the landing!
GARY OVER RADIO: Now proceed with caution.
OK, Scorch, the babies should be straight ahead.
SCORCH: Copy that.
No!
Bad news, little brother.
We're too late.
They've eaten the babies!
It's so unfair!
Scorch, they're right behind you.
- What?
(CHUCKLING) Oh.
Hi, little guys.
- Uncle Scorch is here to rescue you.
- Coochie, coochie, coo.
Yeah, Gary, maybe tell Scorch to keep his voice down in this situation?
- Just a thought.
- Scorch, quiet!
Gary, you should see them.
They're so cute. It's magical.
GARY: You're gonna wake up the whole neighborhood.
And this is not a good neighborhood.
- Peekaboo!
GARY: - Scorch?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, good, here we go again.
- Scorch!
Gary, we've got a problem!
Of course we have a problem.
You never listen to me.
You said there were 12 Gnarlachs, Gary.
No, I said 1200.
Uh, nope, I don't think you did.
- There are 1200 Gnarlachs down there.
- Got it.
- Twelve-hundred baby-eating Gnarlachs.
- Got it.
Twelve-hundred of our archenemies, the Gnarlachs.
- Twelve-hundred of 'em.
- Got it.
Nope. I think I'd remember if you said 1200.
(GRUNTS) - Now do your thing.
- OK.
Chasm of death in 20 yards and closing.
Deploy grappling hook in three...
...two...
...one.
Whoo! Oh, yeah!
- You see that?
Boom! That's what I'm talking about!
- Scorch me, baby!
Helpless babies, your chariot awaits.
In your face, Gnarlachs!
I got the babies! Ha-ha!
- Oh, no, no.
Guys, no, no.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
- No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
- Huh?
- Shh! Gary?
GARY: - I'm on it.
Ha! Take that!
(BOY) Supernova-9, you are clear for landing on planet Dad!
Hey! This is a no-fly zone, mister.
Very funny, Dad.
I'm serious.
This console's expensive, Kipper.
Console? I mean...
I mean, I'm right here. Unbelievable.
Can I have my spaceship back?
- Mmm... No.
- Dad, you never let me do anything.
OK, but be careful.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Ahh!
- It burns! It burns!
- Ohh!
- Sorry. Dad. Hey!
OK, let's play the game where you sit on your hands.
- That game stinks.
SCORCH: - Hey, Gary!
Be a pal, park this puppy, will ya?
Activating remote assistance.
Time to watch your old man bring in the Supernova-9 for a landing.
- Scorch is back!
I love you, planet Baab!
Whoo!
Boom!
Cool!
And that is how you do that.
- Gary!
- What? OK, that's terrifying.
Why do you always call me in jumbo-head mode?
We've received an SOS from an uncharted sector of the galaxy.
Prepare for Scorch's next mission.
Copy that, boss.
Where are we headed?
He's going to the Dark Planet.
Lena, are you crazy?
Let me... rephrase that.
They call it the Dark Planet because nobody ever comes back.
It's like going into a black hole.
He leaves in an hour.
Whoa! He's going to the Dark Planet?
Wicked!
Stay here. Don't touch anything.
And nobody's going to the Dark Planet.
We are going to the Dark Planet!
- Scorch!
- Scorch, one question!
No questions, just pictures.
Yeah, baby!
Excuse me, Scorch!
Scorch Supernova!
Yes, the beautiful young lady in the front row.
- Oh!
- Hi, sweetie. Welcome home.
- Gabby, we're live.
(GIGGLING) - Oh, right.
Hi. Tell us about the mission.
- The Dark Planet.
It's heroic, even for me.
- No one has ever come back alive.
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.
- Have you had time to prepare?
- Uh, no, no, we haven't.
- Gary Supernova, my baby brother.
- Uh, fact check: I'm older than him.
Gary works all the gizmos and bleep-bloops here in the nerd factory.
- I work in Mission Control.
We use a trans-inducified field matrix to...
Mmm-hmm. And that's today's edition of The Boring Report.
- Back to you, Gabby.
For BNN, this is Gabby Babblebrock, reporting live from BASA headquarters.
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- And I feel sorry for her.
Now, listen, we know almost nothing about the Dark Planet.
No one does.
We need to postpone the mission.
I would, but I've already contacted all my sponsors.
Dark Planet Cola!
Destroy your taste buds!
This is 800 percent sugar.
That's what makes it good for kids.
Oh. Hey!
Plus, I've already taken the photos for the new cereal box.
When?
♪ Scorchios ♪
- Just now.
- Scorchios?
- There's a surprise in every box.
- Ah!
- Whoa, I'm pretty good at this.
- OK...
- Come... Come on!
- I could do this all day.
- Whee!
- Knock it off!
- We need to think this through.
- I have.
Someone out there needs my help, and I am going to help them.
OK, but if you go now,
I can't help you help them.
You know, Gary, you're absolutely right.
There's no sense in rushing things.
Why don't you pull up the star charts in the briefing room, and we'll talk about this with the whole team.
You got it, partner.
That should keep him busy.
Let's fire up the ship!
Computer, load all information on the Dark Planet.
JAMES: All right, just a sec.
Scanning files, scanning files...
Here we are. The Dark Planet:
A remote M-class planet located 400 light-years
past the Taurus Molecular Cloud.
A strange and terrifying environment,
the only known world in which evolution is taking place in reverse.
It began with intelligent, attractive beings,
but was soon overrun by ugly, aggressive
and quite terrifying dim-witted creatures.
Yuck. Gross.
JAMES: As you can see, from gentle intelligence to savage stupidity.
They have a strange custom of dividing themselves
into what they call countries, whose boundaries they often dispute,
which causes them to go to war.
The pattern seems to be that the winner of the war then goes into decline
while the loser prospers.
We have also deduced that the people of this planet choose
leaders according to the oddity and profusion of their facial hair.
They worship money, soup, marker pens, something called dental floss
- and this man, whose name is Cowell.
- Oh, terrifying!
JAMES: He's known for his strange accent, being very, very rich,
showing off, wearing glasses indoors.
I like him.
One hundred and six advanced life-forms have landed on the Dark Planet...
- What?
- ...to attempt friendly fairst contact.
Not a single one has returned.
KIP: Uncle Scorch!
Hey, Kipper!
You were awesome out there.
Thanks, pal.
Does your dad know you're here?
I'm supposed to be waiting in his office, but Mission Control is boring.
I know. Isn't it? It's all...
(MIMICS BEEPING BUTTONS)
(LAUGHING) I'm more of an astronaut, like you.
Take me with you this time.
Wow. That sure would upset your dad, which is something I love to do.
But I'll tell you what, Kipper...
If I get into trouble, you come rescue me.
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kip,
Junior Adventurer, at your service!
Junior Adventurer, are you? Hmm.
- Well, what have we here?
- Blast tape!
Ready for a training mission?
OK, we've crash-landed.
We're surrounded by a tribe of slimy, green aliens, and they are closing in on us.
What do you do? You do this! Watch!
- Take that!
- Cool!
- Time to take out the trash!
- Awesome!
Scorch me, baby! (WHOOPS)
Oh, they got me! (GROANS)
- Kipper, it's up to you.
- Wicked!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Astronaut training.
Blast tape?
Kip shouldn't be playing with it.
He shouldn't even be looking at it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
GARY: - Sorry, Barry.
(ALL) Ooh!
- Back to my office.
- See ya, Uncle Scorch.
Scorch...
Mission Control, we've got a mad-dad situation here.
You're darn right I'm mad.
(STAMMERS) Why is this ship on?
Oh! (LAUGHS)
You sent me upstairs so you could rush off to the Dark Planet.
- Yep.
- Ah!
I thought we'd agreed to postpone the launch.
JAMES: Launch in T-minus 30 minutes.
It's too risky to send
Scorch out there. Please.
Drop it, Gary. I'm warning you.
I'm the mission controller.
Does nobody here care what I think?
- No.
- Not really.
- Nope.
- Then why am I even here?
It'll be fine, Gary.
He's done this a hundred times.
We've done this a hundred times.
We're a team.
I'm the brains and you're the brawn.
That's what you always said.
I said it to make you feel better, little brother.
Scorch, stop calling me that.
You've been trying to control me your whole life.
Isn't that why you joined Mission Control?
I'm looking out for you.
That's what brothers do.
Oh, please.
You sit around here pushing buttons while I am out there risking my neck.
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you do it without me.
Any time. Any place.
Little brother.
If you insist on going through with this idiotic macho stunt, you can count me out.
Buh... wai...
You're gonna quit?
Well, you can't quit!
You... you're fired!
You can't fire me.
Because I quit! Humph!
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, space ranger.
KIP: Come on, boy.
Let's go play flisbee.
- You're home early.
- Scorch fired me.
What? He can't fire you.
That's what I said, so I quit.
So you quit after you were fired?
Hey, whose side are you on?
I think someone should lock the two of you in a room until you figure out how to get along.
I hope he gets stranded.
What are you doing, Dad?
Uh... Oh, nothing.
Just working on the old rocket boots.
Cool! Can I help?
Following in your dad's footsteps, eh, Kipper?
Hey! That makes this an official father-son moment!
What's this do?
Whoa! Look out!
Aah! Ah, incoming!
GARY'S WIFE: Gary! Why is there a rocket boot in our bathroom?
ANNOUNCER: This is BNN.
GABBY: We are live as
Scorch Supernova investigates
a mysterious intergalactic cry for help.
Brought to you by Dark Planet Cola.
Dark Planet Cola!
Scorch is stepping off the Supernova-9 now.
Oh boy, is he looking good in that suit.
Mmm.
Oh! Let's go live to the Dark Planet's surface.
This is Scorch Supernova, live from the Dark Planet.
I'm here responding to an intergalactic SOS call,
and on the lookout for helpless victims.
Yeah!
Switching over to remote cams, Gabby.
Wish me luck.
GABBY: Our planet's greatest hero, risking life and limb...
He's so awesome. I'm gonna be just like Uncle Scorch someday.
Well, better have another kid.
- Gary.
- Just what every father wants to hear.
My son wants to be like my dim-witted brother.
Oh, relax. He's excited.
Besides, what could Scorch possibly give your son that you can't?
I dedicate this planet to my nephew, Kip!
I got my own planet? Awesome!
- OK, that's pretty hard to top.
There appears to be a light source coming from a light of some kind.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't do it!
Do not go into the light.
- Going to the light.
KIP: - Wow.
It's so beautiful.
- Oh...
Huh?
A victim! Commencing rescue op.
Greetings! We've heard your call for help and have come to save you.
I am Scorch Supernova.
Strange. On my planet we shake hands, but we can do it your way.
(CHUCKLES) That's humiliating.
Boy, you sure love to wave.
I love it, too, but my arms are getting tired.
- What was that?
What...?
Hmm...
- No!
No! Hang on!
Look at me. Look at me!
Don't you die on me, buddy!
No!
Moving in.
- Scorch!
- We got a blue one!
All he wanted to do was wave!
Peter, Jackson is down!
Man, what is it with aliens and this desolate roadside 7-Eleven?
MAN OVER BULLHORN: Halt! Alien! Do not use your advanced technology against us!
- Marty, Quentin, move it out!
- Scorch me, baby.
- Get out of there!
- Time to take out the trash!
Who's next?
Yeah! Look at him go!
Not now!
Scorch is in real trouble.
Aim for the space-suity thingy!
- Look out!
Uh... uh-oh.
Time to get outta here.
That's not good.
Gary, we better find another way outta here.
Gary?
Scorch.
(MUMBLING) OK, I take...
You know something?
I love you guys.
Welcome to Earth.
Tag him and bag him, boys.
The Baabian Aeronautics and Space Administration have confirmed
that all communications with Scorch Supernova have been severed.
At this point, we can only assume that our planet's greatest hero is...
...is dead?
(SOBBING) I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Oh, no.
- You said you hoped he got stranded.
You wanted this to happen!
I'm sure your father didn't say that.
Did you?
We've gotta get to the Dark Planet and find him!
GARY: Just hang on, Kip.
Come on. Come on, pick up.
Oh, hello, Gary.
I thought you quit.
This is important.
Scorch has been captured.
- We've got it under control.
- Come on!
Dad, Uncle Scorch told me to come rescue him.
- We can be the rescue team.
- Kip!
We're his family.
We need to go save him.
I'm doing everything I can.
You're not doing anything!
- You're talking on the phone!
Go to your room.
Kipper?
Kipper, I know you want to rescue him, and it's very brave of you.
Even though your uncle and I fight sometimes, we're still brothers.
And I will do whatever it takes to get him home, I promise you.
I love you, buddy.
Come on, give us a hug.
- Huh?
Kip? Kip!
Kira! Kip's gone! Kip's gone!
- What?
- The rescue pod.
(GASPS) We've gotta get to BASA before he does.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
We're using the rocket boots.
Are you crazy? The gyroscope is off, the thrust mechanism is broken.
They're not ready to fly.
I spent 15 years as a BASA test pilot.
It's not rocket science.
That's exactly what it is.
They're rocket boots!
Gary, turn off your brain and hang on.
This is staggeringly dangerous!
You're not even in a rocket boot lane!
Look out!
(GRUNTING) - Oh! Ah,
- Sorry!
- This is so emasculating.
- Do you want to drive?
- No, I want to live.
You're actually very good at this!
Look out! Look out! Look out!
- Sorry, Barry!
We're coming, Kipper.
- Where is he?
- Kip! No, Kipper, no!
- Kip, stop!
- Kip, up here!
- Kipper, please!
JAMES: Automated launch in T-minus 60 seconds.
Kip, up here!
Gary, look out.
(GASPS) This is a bad idea.
Mom! Dad! Are you coming?
No, honey, this isn't a game.
(GRUNTS) It's stuck!
KIRA: - Gary, do something!
I'll shut down the launch.
JAMES: Twelve, eleven...
You've chosen Terminate Launch.
- To confirm, say yes.
- Yes.
- You said "banana." Is that correct?
- No.
- You replied "no."
- Gary, hurry up!
Terminate Launch canceled.
GARY: - No! I mean yes!
- Ow!
- Is that a yes or a no?
- No.
- Did you say yes?
- Yes!
- Yes, you said yes, or...?
- Yes! Yes!
It's stuck!
Sorry, Gary. Did you say yes to Terminate Launch?
- Yes!
- Launch terminated.
JAMES: - That was close.
- Oh, Kip, you scared me.
I'm sorry. I promised
Uncle Scorch I'd go save him.
Don't you ever do that again.
No. Kip's right.
Scorch is my brother.
KIRA: - Honey?
- I've gotta go save him.
KIRA: Wait. What are you doing?
JAMES: Excellent.
Launch sequence reengaged.
KIRA: Gary?
- Dad!
- I love you guys!
- Dad!
KIRA: - Gary!
Lena, I need your help.
- Kira!
- Gary was on that pod!
(GASPS) Don't worry.
We'll make contact as soon as he lands.
No, no, no. You have to send someone after him.
I don't have to do anything.
You don't give the orders around here anymore.
Gary will never survive out there alone.
Please, bring my dad back.
Don't worry, little guy.
We're doing everything we can.
What can I do to help?
You're the one who wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.
So why don't you stay at home and let me do my job.
JAMES: Prepare for final approach,
Gary. Fasten your seatbelt.
Huh?
Oh!
(GROANS) I thought this movie was supposed to be in 3-D.
Shh. It is in 3-D.
OK, that's better.
JAMES: - Area 48.
Area 49.
Area 50.
JAMES: - Landing gear deployed.
JAMES: Landing gear destroyed.
JAMES: Please exit with caution, Gary.
Contents may have shifted during the flight.
It's all over the place, isn't it?
OK, OK, don't panic.
Remember your training.
The safest thing to do is wait in your pod.
JAMES: Self-destruct sequence initiated.
What? Self-destruct?
You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.
JAMES: - This one does, Gary.
- This is ridiculous!
JAMES: - Twenty-nine, 28, 27...
- Hey, anybody! Help!
JAMES: Is that your plan, Gary?
Panicking?
- Sixteen, 15...
- Come on!
JAMES: Ticktock, Gary.
Come on. You're running out of time.
- Water landing, monster attack... Aha!
JAMES: - Ten, nine...
- Foolishly trapped inside pod!
- ...eight, seven...
...six, five...
Time to panic.
...three, two...
- ...one. We're toast.
Ah... the technology in this suit is incredible.
- Now open it.
MAN: - Yes, sir.
Yuck!
Blubonium.
Ten thousand times more powerful than atomic energy.
Hey. How'd that get in there?
Oh, you're awake.
(GRUNTS) Let me go! Let me outta here!
Shh. Go back to sleep.
MAN: You're listening to Far-out,
Far-right Hour on C-Dub FM.
Let's go to the phones! Caller?
This is Hawk calling.
I work at 7-Eleven near Area 51, and after years of waiting, it finally happened!
MAN: You had a date with a girl.
What? No. A close-encounter, man!
We looked out the window and this blue dude was standing right there.
(CHUCKLES) - It was awesome.
MAN: - Hawk, Hawk, Hawk, listen to me.
If what you say is true,
they're here for one reason and one reason only: abduction!
- Huh?
It's OK, bro! We're friends.
- What are you doing?
- We gotta make a good impression.
We need a peace offering.
(CHUCKLES) Huh?
It's OK, little guy.
Welcome to Earth, blue buddy.
In an effort to avoid enslavement,
I offer you the finest chilled refreshment known to the human race.
MAN: He likes it!
Of course he likes it.
Where's your brand loyalty, man?
(BOTH) No!
(MUFFLED) You're gonna regret it!
Don't do it!
OK, OK, OK.
Calm down, blue buddy. It's OK.
It's called a brain freeze.
If you're gonna hang with us, you need to learn to sip.
Take him away!
- Put me down!
- Little blue buddy...
Ah!
GARY:
Stop this! Let me out!
Huh?
Hello, creature from another world.
Welcome to planet Earth.
You are now a guest of the US government.
When interacting with the inhabitants of Earth,
or humans, you should abide by the following basic etiquette.
Handshake, good.
- Death ray... bad. No vaporizing.
Modern Earth culture also frowns on the following:
eating human flesh, probing, silver jumpsuits,
abduction, Communism, nudity.
If you or someone you know is responsible for building the pyramids,
we'd like to know about it.
If you've been to the Bermuda Triangle and brought someone home with you,
please return them immediately.
And, finally, if you're a resident alien,
please report to the immigration desk on level 316.
We hope this has been an informative look at our planet,
and urge you not to seek war against us.
Enjoy your stay here at Area 51.
Let's take a peek into that head of yours.
COMPUTER: Brain scan processing.
- Stupid. Simple. Dimwit. Average.
Smart. Genius. Genius. Genius...
MAN: We got ourselves a real genius!
Shanker's gonna want to meet you.
- Here's the brainiac, sir.
So... you're the genius.
What are you gonna do to me?
Probe me? Dissect me?
- Chop me up and eat me?
- Relax.
I'm a big fan of your work.
Scorch!
What have you done with my brother?
We'll get to him soon enough.
This is your design, isn't it?
How do you know that?
Well, color me impressed.
And I consider myself a connoisseur when it comes to alien technology.
I could use a man with your brain power.
You see, Gary,
I run a work release program.
You work, then I release you.
You are going to make sure my latest project goes off without a hitch.
I'm not doing anything until I see Scorch.
You can whine till you're blue in the face, but I call the shots around here.
- Hmm?
Everyone out, now!
Double-time!
Wait! Wait! We're not finished!
Where's my brother?
Hello, Shanky-panky.
Hello, my darling.
You look ravishing.
Oh, you always say that.
That's because it's true.
- Did you get my present?
- Yes.
- I did.
- So do you like it?
It's... OK.
Pookie, what's wrong?
Nothing, it's fine.
I just... I was expecting more.
Well, that was just a sample.
There's more coming, I promise.
I'm bringing enough so we can rule the universe together.
Hurry, my love.
Gentle, gentle.
Just set me down nice and easy.
Hello? Anyone?
You can't do this! I know my rights!
Ugh.
Hey! Hi there, roomie!
Hey, are you finished with the toilet?
Huh? (GROANS)
I'm Thurman. Pleased to meet you.
Hello. Oh, my goodness.
You're all covered in slime.
- Ugh! You're all dried out.
- Not anymore.
I'm from Zaddlebrok 475.
- Never heard of it.
- You've heard of Zaddlebrok 473.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
- It's two planets over.
Makes sense.
Anyway, you should settle in.
Throw your stuff on the bottom bunk.
I gotta get outta here.
Don't I get a phone call?
Oh, yeah.
A phone call? A big-screen TV?
Egyptian cotton sheets?
- This is Area 51, man. Wake up!
Keep it down!
I'm trying to get some shut-eye.
Oh, I get it.
Shut-eye. You've got one eye.
Are you making fun of my one eye? (ROARS)
Easy, Io. Remember the program.
GROANS: Just stick to the program, stick to the program.
I apologize for my outburst.
My name is lo, and I'm working through some anger issues.
She seems nice.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, great gal. I'm Doc.
- You're a doctor?
- Radio talk show therapist.
Same thing without all the training, credentials or qualifications.
So, Little Boy Blue, you got a name?
Gary. I'm here looking for my brother.
Have you seen him?
What's he look like? Blue like you?
Yes, exactly like me except with huge muscles
and a chiseled jaw and perfect teeth.
OK, so you're the ugly brother.
Oh, well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Oh, it's not a question.
Look, Scorch can bust us out of here.
He's got a ship. He can get us home.
There's only one way out of here.
Invent enough cool stuff and Shanker lets you go.
That's how Area 51 works.
He lures the smartest aliens from across the universe
and throws us in jail.
Take Thurman. He was a professor.
Those four hands invented touchscreen technology.
Or Io. She used to be a librarian.
She got so mad looking stuff up for people
that she invented the search engine.
And most importantly, me.
After my radio show got famous,
I invented social networking.
I've got five billion pending friend requests.
That's how Shanker bankrolls this place.
He rips off our technology and sells it to the world.
He's got deals with everybody.
Apple, Facebook, them Google guys.
You think humans could build this stuff?
I don't think so.
Who do you think invented the Internet?
Cell phones? Computer animation?
We did!
Thank you. I love tech history.
But have you seen my brother?
MAN OVER PA: Attention, aliens. Please report immediately to the cafeteria.
And remember, levitating in the passageways is strictly prohibited.
- What the heck is that?
There is only one creature in the universe that snores that loud.
- Scorch! Scorch! Wake up!
Space hero test today. Didn't study.
- What the...?
Needs a whole salad to sleep.
Ow! Huh? Gary? Hey, Gary!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to rescue you.
You're rescuing me?
(LAUGHS) I'm still dreaming.
I come 15 light-years out of my comfort zone to save you, and this is the thanks I get from my own brother?
Try ex-boss. I fired you.
No, I quit.
And your first mission without me, you wind up in jail.
- And where did you end up? Jail.
You two should make an appointment.
MAN OVER PA: Attention, aliens. Lunch is now being served in the cafeteria.
Please be mindful of the joes as they are unusually sloppy.
The launch station computer will tell us where Daddy is.
Locate Rescue Pod 13.
JAMES: Self-destruct initiated at 2900 hours.
- What?
- Self-destruct?
Play back in-flight camera.
You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.
This is ridiculous!
Dad!
Only Mission Control can destroy a ship.
Somebody here had to give that order.
- Huh?
(WHISPERING) - Quick, get down.
Lena.
Keep still.
LENA: OK, that's good.
- Hurry up and get it loaded.
- You got it, boss.
KIRA: That much Blubonium could blow up the whole galaxy.
- Cool.
- No, no, no, not cool.
Very, very not cool.
We have to tell somebody.
LENA: - Tell somebody what?
KIRA: Lena!
Run!
- Go, Kipper!
- Hey!
Let me go! (GRUNTING)
Hey!
I gave you a chance to go home, sweetie.
You should've taken it.
Little rat got away.
LENA: It doesn't matter, he's just a kid.
- Tie her up and bring her with us.
- Wait! What about Gary?
(CHUCKLES) Gary? That coward?
He's never coming back.
Thank you.
Hit me with some jiggly cubes.
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
Hi, guys. Not sure if you guys are guys. (CHUCKLES)
Or ladies. Either way, no problem.
Those are the Greys.
No one knows what Shank has got on them, but they do his bidding.
So don't get on their bad side, understand?
What's up, eggheads?
Give me two of everything and one more of anything.
(LAUGHS) Hey!
Some things you just can't teach.
Uh, mmm...
What are... what is all this?
We have lots of alien delicacies.
Blorm, Phrebbish, Zumft, diet Zumft, free-range Zumft, non-dairy gluten-free Zumft.
And if you're looking for something a bit more refined, we got fresh plarbe.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Oh, hello.
Hi.
You know what? I'm not hungry.
- Oh. Uh...
- Aliens.
- After you.
Gary! (BURPS)
I've seen a lot of jailbreak movies.
All we need to break out of here is a diversion, a shovel and a blowup dummy of ourselves.
(LAUGHS) It's not that simple, Scorch.
Don't be reckless.
(WHISPERS) And from now on, let's whisper our escape plan.
That's your problem, Gary.
Always wishy-washy, never taking action.
That's what makes me the heroic brother.
You're some hero.
Without me, you're nothing.
Ooh, big words from a computer-loving mama's boy.
No, they're regular-sized words.
You're just too dumb to understand.
Good thing Kip's gonna be a hero like me, not a coward like you.
Ugh! You take that back!
Oh! Nice, Gary. Nice. Real mature.
- Whoa!
- Oh! Right in the kisser!
- Food fight!
We have a food-related disturbance in the cafeteria!
- Get him!
- Stop! Get back here!
- Come here, you little runt!
- How the tables have turned.
- Hey!
Well, that was lucky.
Stop this right now before somebody gets hurt.
All right, that's it.
- Bull's-eye!
DOC: Oh, it's on!
THURMAN: - Ugh! Now you've done it.
- Bruce, look out!
- Willis, run!
People, people, where are your manners?
You're the one talking with your mouth full of yourself.
Do you have to do that now?
Hey, practice makes perfect.
George! Lucas! Let's go!
- It's the fuzz!
- Get 'em!
Christopher! Nolan! On your feet!
Hello, my dear.
- Oh!
- Stop right there!
How dare you slap a commanding officer!
- Ah!
All right, alien...
- Scorch, behind you!
- Nice!
- Thank you.
- Guess who!
Let's get outta here.
Oh, yeah!
Ten-hut!
I'm king of the world!
You missed.
Ooh. I told these guys, "You'd better not food fight," but they did.
I'm gonna sweep this up.
Report to the peace shield, on the double.
DOC: This is the peace shield.
THURMAN: It's an asteroid gun.
Nothing says peace like a giant gun, huh?
It's overkill if you ask me.
But it's America.
They supersize everything.
You guys built this thing?
DOC: Took us almost ten years.
Now we're just waiting for one last piece: the power source.
Then we can go back to our home planets.
- Or sun.
- Or sun.
Seriously? You live on the sun?
Yep. You can't beat the weather.
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, even though you didn't work on it, you've gotta sign the floor.
Anything for a fan.
That's a lot of names.
Where are all those guys?
Shanker's been building this thing for years. He probably let 'em go.
- Get your hands off me.
- You'll never get away with this.
The beauty of it is, I already have.
With Scorch and Gary gone, who's gonna stop me?
Hi-yah!
- What the...?
- Time to take out the trash!
- Kipper, no!
- Scorch me, baby!
Come back here!
- Let my mom go!
(LAUGHS) - "Scorch me, baby."
- You monster!
- Aw, I wish I had my camera.
What a perfect family portrait.
Look alive! General's coming in hot!
Shh. Don't do anything stupid.
Soldiers of Area 51, the final piece of the puzzle has arrived.
(GASPS) That's a Blubonium reactor.
How did he get his hands on it?
Somebody smuggled that thing in my suit.
What's the big deal?
Do you have any idea how powerful that stuff is?
Prepare for test firing.
- You heard the man!
- Go! Go! Go!
My old friend, Halley's Comet.
Not back for another 50 years.
So... who's gonna miss it?
COMPUTER: Targeting Halley's Comet.
Preparing condolence card for Halley's family.
Target acquired.
Hasta la vista, Halley.
- Yeah, baby! It works!
We're going home!
- Yeah!
- Awesome!
Hot diggity!
- This is not good.
- Oh, yeah!
Boom!
Come on, guys, lighten up.
It's party time!
Get down with your bad self!
There's enough Blubonium in that thing to blow up a planet.
Well, are we gonna sit around
"Garying" this to death or are we gonna do something about it? Ha-ha!
- Scorch!
- Are you nuts?
- Put that down, now!
MAN: Get him!
- Ha!
- You're going down!
- James, Cameron, get the alien!
- Scorch me, baby.
MAN: Brace yourself, boys!
SHANKER: Stop him!
MAN: He's walking all over you.
Stop him!
How you like me now?
- No! My reactor!
Whoa!
Get him out of here!
- No, stop!
- Gary, stay out of this!
Bring the little one, too.
THURMAN: You got him right where you want him, Gary!
If you can't fix that reactor, nobody's going home. Ever.
His quiet anger is even angrier than his loud one.
Uh-huh.
You useless blue moron.
Do you realize what you've done?
I saved millions of innocent aliens,
'cause that's what heroes do.
You failed at your evil plans,
'cause that's what villains do.
And this crumb got stuck on my face,
'cause that's what crumbs do.
- Scorch.
- It's OK, Gary.
Do what you want with me.
I'll never help you.
I thought you might say that.
Whoa!
Scorch! No!
- Any last words?
- Yes.
Friends, aliens, countrymen, lend me your tentacles.
Don't think of me as a hero.
Think of me as a guy who acted heroically while full of heroism.
Have you been practicing this?
Gary, tell Gabby I love her.
Tell my fans I love them.
Just as a general rule, if anyone asks, tell them I love them.
Hey, Gary, I love you too, little brother.
- Goodbye, cruel galaxy.
- No!
Huh. Well, looks like
I've got time for a few more.
Tell the guy that waxes my ship... what's his name again?
It doesn't matter.
Just tell him that I love him.
And the people at Dark Planet Cola,
- tell them I love them.
- Stop. We get it.
No. Stop! I'm a BASA engineer.
I can fix the Blubonium.
Don't help him, Gary!
We did the right thing!
- No!
- No! Scorch! Let him go!
As soon as you fix my peace shield.
Oh, and one more thing.
If you tell any of the others about this, I'll freeze you all!
- Get in there, alien.
(CHUCKLES) You got some nerve walking in here after that stunt.
- I... (WHIMPERS)
- Where's your brother?
- Shanker's got him.
- Why'd he let you go?
- Because he thinks I can fix it.
- Can you fix it?
- Of course. I'm a BASA engineer.
Oh, thank goodness.
- But I don't think I should.
- Say what?
- I fix it, we all go home, right?
- Exactly. What's wrong with that?
Shanker ends up with the most powerful weapon in the universe.
So he's got a toy for shooting down asteroids. Big deal.
You saw what it can do.
Who knows what he'll blow up next.
What if it's your planet?
Don't be paranoid, Gary.
It happens to smart people all the time.
You start thinking too much and it gets the best of you.
(GROANS) You guys actually trust Shanker?
- We're kinda low on options here, Gary.
- What choice do we have?
We refuse to fix it.
Then what? Stage a silent protest?
Come on, man!
You want us to be stuck in here forever?
I don't know what to do, OK? Just let me sit down for a second and think!
You mean sit around and do nothing.
Well, we're gonna try to fix it.
Are you coming or not?
You know what? We don't need you.
Come on, Thurman.
- Cut the red wire.
No, no, no! Cut the green wire.
- Scratch that. I'm colorblind.
- Quiet! I need to concentrate.
My third eye, it's messing me up.
I can't do it!
So that's it? Game over?
Step away from the Blubonium.
(LAUGHS) My man!
Thurman, you're fired.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I scored a 12.0 on my galactic engineering exams.
Do you know what that means?
You had no friends in high school?
It means in a galaxy filled with nerds,
I'm their king.
I hope this works.
We're going home!
It's time to pay my parking tickets!
Uh, Gary? Is that normal?
- Come on, Thurman, don't be paranoid.
- OK.
- Whoa!
(ALL CHANTING) - Gary! Gary! Gary...!
Speech, Gary!
Pack your stuff and be ready to go.
I'm going to get my brother back.
- This one was asking for you, sir.
- Leave him with me.
I'm here for my brother.
Ah, Gary... finally a team player.
I did what you asked.
I fixed the reactor.
And just in time.
Imagine how powerful I'll be with all this Blubonium.
- What? How did you...?
- You call yourself intelligent life.
(LAUGHS) These are fun.
- I could do that all day.
Let us go! You got what you wanted!
Why let you go now, only to hunt you down later?
Hunt us down?
But we come in peace.
Nobody comes in peace.
I was six years old when they took my father from me.
Think about this, champ.
With that many stars out there, there just has to be intelligent life.
- Golly! Can I have a look, Pops?
- In a minute, son.
What? What is that?
Good gravy! It's a UFO!
(LAUGHS) Son, you wouldn't believe it!
This is the moment
I've been waiting for my entire...
(ECHOING) No!
Before you join your brother, there's one last thing
I'd like to show you.
Hey, don't ask, don't tell.
Not the hair, you idiot.
- Lena!
- Ugh. Hello, Gary.
I see you've met my fiancé.
- Fiancé?
- We met online.
Get with the times, Gary.
LENA: Your whole family has been meddling in my business.
- Time to say goodbye, Gary.
(GASPS) - Kip! Kira!
Lena, please, he's using you.
He's using all of us. (SCREAMS)
OK, he's just jealous he couldn't have you.
- Hmm?
- Ta-ta.
- How could you do this?
You think I'm actually in love with an alien?
When she leaves your planet with my Blubonium, I'm gonna blow it up.
- But Baab's just the beginning.
I'm gonna wipe out the alien infestation one planet at a time.
If you destroy every planet with intelligent life, you'll have no stars left in the sky.
My stargazing days are over.
Let me out! (GRUNTING)
Hey, congratulations. You're free! Not!
- No, you can't do this!
Please! Let me out of here!
I don't know if you can hear me, but... I'm sorry.
My plan was to get you out of here, not end up frozen beside you.
I failed you. I failed my family.
All the planning in the world doesn't amount to anything without a hero to make it happen.
I tried, brother!
I'm sorry!
Scorch...
(WHISTLES) So that's Gary's wife?
How'd he make that happen?
I know. Isn't he all like...
Oh, Kip, I told you to run.
You shouldn't have come back.
I couldn't leave you, Mom.
A Junior Adventurer never leaves a man behind.
Kipper, this isn't a game.
I know. I'm not a little kid anymore.
That's why I came to rescue you.
And you're very brave, but now we're both stuck in here.
That's because
I'm not done rescuing you.
Blast tape?
You let them catch you.
Mom, I'm gonna need you to be quiet.
- Kip, be careful.
I can't believe we're guarding a lady and a kid.
- It's embarrassing.
- Is this a daycare?
- Here goes nothing.
Hey!
Open the door! Open the door!
Hurry up!
(GRUNTS) Kip, look out!
Uh-oh.
Consider yourselves scorched! (GRUNTS)
(WHISPERING) Come on, we don't have much time.
I've gotta stop that ship.
You go hide in Mission Control and lock that door behind you.
Copy that!
JAMES: This whole villain thing, it's not you.
You know? And the stress is aging you, if I might be...
LENA: Shut up.
Don't you have a mute button?
- It's locked.
Our government thinks asteroids are Earth's biggest threat.
But some of us know better.
The biggest threat to planet Earth?
(WHISPERING) - Global warming.
- Mm-hmm.
- Aliens.
- Oh.
We will wipe out their planets before they come for us.
- Our first target? Planet Baab!
That's Gary's planet!
COMPUTER: Targeting planet Baab.
Target acquired.
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me, sir?
Sorry to interrupt.
Just wondering approximately what time you'll be sending us home.
- Is he really this stupid?
The only place you're going is the freezer.
Oh! I trust there'll be no more outbursts?
IO: - No!
COMPUTER: Danger. System malfunction.
(GRUNTS) Why isn't it working?
Gary?
No! It's a trap!
Shut it down! Shut it down!
- No!
COMPUTER: System overload.
Evacuate! Evacuate!
Seriously. Get out of here.
Everybody, out!
Scram. Gotta go. Uh-oh.
- Ooh!
- They're off! We're free! Whoo!
You're all gonna pay for this!
Freeze the aliens!
SHRIEKS: Io, get up!
It's time to get mad, girl.
- What about the program?
Forget the program!
MAN: - Tasers to full power!
- Yeah! Take that!
That's what you get when you mess with the Doc!
MAN: - Huh?
Uh, guys?
We might wanna get out of here!
Scorch!
Scorch, hey! Come on!
- Scorch!
(GRUNTS) Gary?
Oh, it's good to see you.
- Huh?
- Are you OK?
Of course I am.
Nothing can stop Scorch Supernova.
Whoa!
Ow! I'm having a bit of a leg situation over here.
You're still thawing out.
Gary, I'm too heavy.
Go! Save yourself.
Scorch, I couldn't.
I'm not serious!
Come on, put some back into it!
- Get me outta here!
I'm free!
- Ooh!
- A Snarkbeast.
Don't worry. They look mean, but they're completely harmless.
(LAUGHS) I'm free!
(MUFFLED) I'm not free.
Uh... Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
- Oh, dear.
- Yummy!
- Oh, no!
- I don't think so.
SNARBEAST: Got outta that place!
I'm starving here!
- Let me go!
Oy vey.
- Io!
Come on, now, you saved us.
We couldn't leave you behind.
Us aliens gotta stick together.
Whoa! Hello, talking rat.
Why you gotta disrespect me like that?
Gary, I could kiss your brain!
Destabilizing the Blubonium was brilliant.
I taught him everything he knows.
He's still frozen. Grab a leg.
I'm covered in slime. I can't do this!
Come on!
MAN: They're heading for the elevator.
- Locking it down.
- Leave them.
They're sitting ducks in there.
(LAUGHS) Alpha Team, they're headed your way.
Copy that, sir. All right, boys, set your freezers to ice cold!
Move! Move! Move!
So, Gary, what's the plan when we reach the top?
Uh, just give me a second, let me think.
You'd better think fast.
MAN: Here we go.
- Aliens, come out to play.
- Hmm?
- Huh?
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- I don't see 'em!
- They're not there!
They're gone. Huh?
- Now!
- Whoo-hoo!
Freeze 'em!
- Get 'em!
- Fire!
- Oh! Oh!
- There he goes!
- Find him! Find him!
- I'm out!
I can't believe you talked me into this!
- Shoot him!
- Don't freeze up out...
Hey, Gary, check it out!
The freezing wore off!
Aw, come on!
Huh?
Whoo! Did you see that? I am the man!
(MUFFLED, GRUNTING) - My lips!
- Come on, come on, let's go!
(MUFFLED) Ouch! My lips got stuck!
It's a simple binary lock circuit.
I'll just reconnect the main IC control switch...
Haven't I taught you anything?
- Got it.
- Yes!
- Freedom!
- Nice work, brother.
- Scorch, where's the ship?
Follow me! It's this way!
Actually, it's this way.
JAMES: I get it.
Being the villain can be lonely,
but you're looking for love in all the wrong places.
He's using you.
What's wrong with Zane in Sector 113?
- He's a lovely chap. Just...
LENA: - Shut up already!
Get me Shanker.
What do you want?
I'm kinda busy right now.
What's going on?
What happened to your hair?
Those blue idiots you sent ruined everything.
- Nothing's ruined.
- This is all your fault.
If you screw up this delivery, we're through!
No! I'll make it up to you, please!
- Turn this ship around.
(GASPS) Huh?
Kira? What are you doing here?
Let's go home.
I bet it makes you happy seeing me like this.
No, of course not.
How could I have been so stupid?
He used me.
It's never too late to do the right thing.
You're just like Gary.
So innocent. So naive.
Please! Lena, help me!
It doesn't have to be like this!
You thought you could stop me, didn't you?
Little Miss Housewife saves the day!
You've betrayed your people!
You've betrayed your planet...
...and you're not fit to wear this uniform!
What? You think just 'cause a chick has kids she can't dish it out?
- Pshh.
Computer, reset course to planet Baab.
Hurry up! The ship's down there!
(PANTING) Whoo!
I gotta lay off the burritos.
I cloaked it as one of their spaceships.
Come on!
- Sorry!
- Dude, don't you knock?
Hammer, get out here!
You're never gonna believe this!
Whoa!
- Awesome.
I'm going! I'm going!
Nope! Two down, a hundred to go.
Scorch, which one is it?
Blue buddy, what's up?
My brother cloaked our ship and lost it.
WOMAN: - Close the door! I'm changing!
- Nope! Ha!
No problem.
- False alarm?
- Yeah.
(BOTH) Tornado!
- Tornado?
- Out of my way!
MAN: - Take cover!
- Oh, my God!
- My cooler!
Come on, quick!
Aha! There it is!
Yes!
Hi, honey! I'm home!
- Sweet ride!
- There it is!
Wait! Aren't you going to abduct us?
Uh, we don't really do that.
- They come in peace.
- Awesome.
- Whoa.
- Fly, blue buddy! Fly!
(LAUGHS) - We're going home!
- Yes!
Gary, I love it!
Trashing bad guys, flying spaceships, we might be related after all.
You know, in some strange way,
I'm gonna miss this place.
- I hate this planet!
- We got company!
- Hang on.
(LAUGHS) Yee-haw!
Sweet flying, Gary!
I didn't think you had it in you.
DOC: Nobody panic! I mean nobody else!
I'll panic for all of us. (SCREAMS)
- Ugh!
I don't fly well.
When I feel queasy, I try breathing deeply through my nose.
PILOT: Careful with your warning shots. Shanker wants 'em alive.
(GASPS) Incoming!
- Oh, we're hit!
- Oh... no!
- What's going on?
- The computer's fried!
- Our steering's gone.
DOC: - Oh, no!
Oh, no! I've seen this in a movie!
It does not end well!
Mayday! This is Supernova-9!
We're going down!
(OVER RADIO) Mayday!
I repeat, we're going down!
- We're a dead stick!
- Huh?
This is the Supernova-9!
(GASPS) - What?
- We are going down!
- Dad?
- Kipper!
- Yeah, it's me, Dad!
- Where's Mom?
Put a grown-up on, bud, we're in trouble.
I'm the only one here, Dad.
Kipper, this is serious.
We're going down.
No, you're not. (GRUNTS)
Kip, what are you doing?
Supernova-9, you are go for remote assistance.
(GASPS) OK, Kip, this is just like flying your remote control ship.
What? This is nothing like his remote control ship!
- Just a little to the left.
(SCREAMS) Too much left! Too much left!
We got a student driver?
Every man for himself.
Ah! We're gonna hit that cliff! Pull up!
Take out their engines.
Let's force 'em to land.
DOC: - They're shooting!
- We're not gonna make it!
I've got this, Dad. Trust me.
Pull up! Pull up!
- Three...
GARY: - Pull up!
- Kip?
- ...two...
- Pull up!
...one. (GRUNTS)
Get out! Get out!
- Yes!
- We made it!
(LAUGHS) See ya later, suckers!
- Yes! Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.
Mission Control, that's some good flying.
- I told you, Dad, I got this.
SCORCH: - Way to go, Kipper.
Uncle Scorch?
Everyone is on board and accounted for.
- Hey, guys, say hi to my son.
IO: - Hi!
- What's up, little man?
- Pleased to meet you.
(GASPS) Dad, there's something coming up behind you!
- What?
SINGSONG: Gary,
I'm not finished with you!
- It's Shanker!
He's got my mission suit.
I made some modifications.
You like them?
What's going on?
Why aren't you moving?
We're caught in a tractor beam.
You've gotta get us out of it!
It's not working. We're burning up!
We gotta knock off that tractor beam.
Nice one, Gary.
How do we do that?
We take it out at the source.
(GASPS) You mean go down there?
Be logical, Gary. You're asking me to jump with no chance of survival.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
Gary!
- He made it!
- Come on, Gary!
Get your hands off my brother!
Whoa!
- Scorch, what are you doing?
- We're a team, brother!
- Don't you remember?
- Aah! Help!
Hey, pal, we're having a moment here.
- Ow!
SCORCH: Get your face out of my hand!
Let go of my hair!
SCORCH: Hurry up!
Oh!
I guess this is it.
We were a good team!
You know, I always looked up to you.
- You looked up to me?
- I'm serious.
Great wife, great kid.
I always thought
I could do that one day.
You would've been a great dad.
- Hey, uh, Gary?
- Yeah, brother?
I'm sorry for firing you.
Actually, I quit.
Huh? What the...?
- Gary!
- What...?
(GASPS) You! Thank you.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Don't mention it.
- You can talk?
- Of course.
- Occasionally.
- From time to time.
Why did you save us?
I thought you worked for General Crazy.
At first, we felt bad for squishing his dad.
Turns out he was a psychopathic megalomaniac bent on destroying every known form of intelligent life in the universe.
Who knew?
What are you gonna do with him?
- Can't say.
- It'll give you nightmares.
Huh?
You're gonna pay for this.
I thought I told you, we come in peace!
Ouch! Oh, wow.
- First punch-out?
- Yeah.
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, feels great.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Uh-huh!
That was amazing!
I would've jumped, too, but it looked like you guys had everything under control.
This little guy's great.
- Can we keep him?
- Put me down!
- Let's go home.
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!
Ah, it's good to be home.
Mission Control, bring us in.
KIP: Check your six, Supernova-Q.
- Hiya, honey!
- Kira? How did you...?
That's my wife!
Oh, Gary, how'd you hook that up?
I always thought you were a little...
What does that mean?
Everybody always says that.
- Beats me.
GARY: I've come to expect the unexpected working with Scorch,
but I don't think anything could have prepared me
for working with my family to save our planet.
I guess life's pretty unpredictable after all.
- Yay, Scorch, you're the best!
You're so awesome!
- Yay, Scorch!
I love you, planet Baab!
- Yeah, Scorch!
- Yes!
- Way to go, Scorch!
- You saved us!
(SIGHS) No more hero stuff for a while, OK?
Are you kidding?
I'm never leaving the house again.
- Dad! (LAUGHS)
- We love you, buddy!
Kipper!
Kipper, that was amazing.
We're so proud of you, bud.
You were awesome out there, just like your uncle.
You are gonna be a great astronaut one day.
Maybe even as good as me.
Thanks, Uncle Scorch.
But I'm more of a mission controller.
Like my dad.
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN, coming through!
Oh, it's good to see you!
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN.
Tell us what it's like to be the greatest hero in the universe.
You're gonna have to ask him yourself.
Give it up for my little brother,
Gary Supernova!
Hey, I'm older than him.
(CROWD CHANTING) - Gary! Gary!
- So Gary, we still a team?
(SIGHS) Somebody's gotta watch your back. Little brother.
GARY: That's my brother, Scorch.
He's in trouble, again.
Seventy-two hours later,
he was on the most terrifying mission of his life.
(WHISPERING) Scorch, do you copy?
Yeah, brother. I'm scared to move.
GARY: Remember your training.
You can do this.
- I'm not gonna make it, Gary.
GARY: - Don't say that.
I'll be by your side every step of the way.
My wingman?
Your best man.
(PIPE ORGAN PLAYS
"HERE COMES THE BRIDE")
And do you, Scorch Supernova, take Gabby Babblebrock to be your lawfully wedded wife,
- to have and to hold...
- Oh, lo, are you crying?
No, I just got something in my eye.
Let's never break up, guys.
And do you, Gabby Babblebrock, take Scorch Supernova
- to be your lawfully wedded husband?
- I do.
And so, by the power vested in me by the Intergalactic Association of Radio Talk Show Therapists,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
(ALL) Aww!
Let's party!
- Hey, Scorch, way to go, man!
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Yeah!
(GASPS) No! You're OK!
I can't believe you made it!
Nice to meet you.
(SIGHS) Here we go again.
Yeah! That's it, that's it!
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Come on, Gary.
Well, this is humiliating.
GARY: You know, you don't have to travel millions of light-years
and defeat a deadly intergalactic enemy
to find out that the greatest story of all is right here on your home planet,
with your brother, and your own family.
(LAUGHS) Love you guys!

Hey, hey! Hey, hey, you!
We've gotta get a clean
Uh, no .. Yeah, no worries
What is his beef, huh?
Doesn't matter
I can't do it anwyay.
I can't shoot a mate.
What can I get you, mate?
Uh just a beer thanks.
So, what's wrong with the dog?
Oh, baited strychnine.
Why would anyone
'want to poison a dog?
Maybe someone set it out for the roos or the dingoes or someone just doesn't like dogs, you know?
There are people, sick people.
Sorry.
Are you his master?
No, no. He has no master.
Well, not now.
That s not just any dog
In there, you know?
No?
Oh no, no
No, no, he's a famous dog.
He's probably the most famous dog in all Australia.
Red Dog.
Yeah, the one that warned those people about that fire.
No no, no.
The one that saved that child.
No, no, not him. Wrong dog.
Didn't he...
No, no, no, no.
Look, mate, you're looking at it all the wrong way
It s, uh.
It's not what he did. lt's who he was.
Is, I mean.
Red Dog?
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Vet's coming.
Yeah? When?
Soon.
How's the poor thing doing?
Oh, l'm sorry, mate
Jack Collins, publican.
Thomas Baker, trucker.
Yeah, yeah.
It was me that brought Red Dog to Dampier, me and Maureen, near on 10 years ago now, back in the mean old days when men were men and dogs were... dogs, rougher, hotter, brighter, redder.
Why would anybody build a town out here?
Why would anyone live in a town built out here?
I know. Money.
Yeah, I know that.
What's that?
What's what?
On the road.
It's a dog.
I can see that.
What's it doing out here?
Hello, boy!
Hey? Hello.
Hello. Aren't you a pretty boy, hey?
Hello.
Are you lost?
Do you need water?
Cheeky bastard.
Struth!
Is that the dog?
Well, it's certainly not me! Eugh!
Ohh! Oh, Lord what did that thing eat?
Stop the car
I can't breathe! Ohh
Eugh!
Oh...
Oh this is like... Wow.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Hey, Maureen, Maureen.
Come and have a ook at this.
Oh, that poor little bugger.
Oh!
Oh, g'day, Rick.
He's out the back, mate.
Thanks.
Hey, Rick.
That's the vet.
Here you go, Vanno.
Hey.
Vanno, this is Tommy boy.
I've just been telling him about Red Dog.
Vanno here's one of his first mates from back in the days.
Yes, 'the days'.
Wild days?
Very wild, very lonely.
A dog of a certain type can do well in a lonely town.
I know.
I come from a small little
Village in Italy - Abruzzi.
Here we go.
Ohh!
Yes, yes, you all bloat, but my little Village was beautiful.
In spring, flowers are like Turkish carpet and the wine would make you see the Virgin.
Why did you leave?
Same as all these fools, money!
We all follow the money.
They come from everywhere.
From all the countries, they come for the money, for the work.
From Poland, New Zealand,
Ireland, Greece,
Latvia, America.
Even Melbourne.
Living together, eating together and crapping together.
Money crackpot.
They may look normal, but not normal.
Sun has burned out their brains.
See, I know sun in Italy, in Abruzzi, but I not know the sun until I come here.
Very dangerous, this sun.
I knew a man, Goran.
Remember Goran?
The sun, it kill him.
And also Sam.
Remember Sam-Man?
He work in the sun for five hours without no hat.
Fool!
Afterward he spoke
Chinese for two days.
Before the sun, he know not a word of Chinese!
Yes, it was crazy place when
Red Dog arrive in Dampier.
Men are no better than wild animals.
They drink much and they...
How do you say? 'Imbulge'.
And their hair, it goes funny.

In Abruzzi, no-one would fight over moustache.
What do they fight over?
Women!
Abruzzi has the most beautiful women in Italy.
Slender, with a wonderful breast, like a nut.
Nuts?
Yes! Big, beautiful nut!
To come from a place with such beautiful women to a place with no women...
I don't think you can understand such pain.

Pushy bloke. no doubt about it.
What? He only does that to people that he knows?
Of course not.

Oh-ho-ho!
What's next? What's next?
A chicken!
Why wouldn't he eat a chicken?
A live chicken!
Enough!
I won't let Red Dog eat a live chicken for your sick amusement.
What's it to you, huh?
It's not your dog.
No chicken, mate.
Says who?
I do,
Ooh!
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
OK, OK!
No chicken, no chicken.
Red Dog, come!
Huh?
Come on, boy.
We ride together now.
And from that day on
Red Dog had a master, the only master he would ever have.
Hey, but enough said about that.
Hey, quiet! Quiet! Shh!
Turn the jukebox off.
Uh...to tell you the truth,
I should put him down.
But he's a strong old dog and God knows he deserves a last fight so l've given him some anticonvulsants, he's resting easier.
We wait. Hopefully, he'll make it through the night.
Come on, Red Dog
Poor Red.
What are we gonna do with you, huh?
A shame, that is.
Yeah.
There's a lot of history there, you know, with Nancy, John, Red Dog.
Down!
Bad dog!
You'll never get him out of there, Miss.
No-one sit there when Red sit there.
Ohh!
Well, aren't you a charmer, huh?
Stop that!
Bad dog!
Hang on, Miss. Hang on!
Ever since he became a union member he thinks he's got rights.
I'm not moving, so you'll just have to put up with me.
Stop that! Now, be a gentleman and move over!
Now!
Ooh.
Hello.
Hello.
You're sharing a seat with my dog.
Yes, I am.
Wow!
So, what will you be doing at Hamersley, Nancy?
A secretary.
Quite a change from Perth.
An adventure, to be sure.
That's a good way to look at it, an adventure.
Is alright yet?
Don't wanna be too late.
Give it another minute or two to air out, boys.
Wouldn't want anyone to get sick from the fumes.
So, Nancy, there's a new movie playing at the open-air.
Would you like to come and see it?
What's it about?
Uh, I can't remember.
Alright, then,
Still 'rip'.
'Ripe'?
Yes, the rip is very ripe.
Oh, yeah?
Hi, John.
Uh, I need to borrow the wagon so I can take the new girl to the movies.
What makes you think that she'd be interested in a skinny little Yank like you when she's got us proper blokes around?
I bathe.
Also, do you think you could watch Red?
I think he's a touch...
...J-E-A-L-O-U-S.
J-E-what?
Jealous.
Oh! Huh?
Pfft! No troubles.
We'll have a right party, we will.
Won't we, Red?
Thanks, Peet. See ya, Red.

Bring back my bloody yarn!
Red! Red!
Hello, kitty.
Whoa,
Hey, hey. Go on, take off.
Red Cat was an horrendous animal, no?
He was - how do you say? - a destroyer of many pooches.
Hey, what are you doing to my cat?
Nothing. I...
What's going on?
Oh, this cat tried to attack me.
It must smell Red Dog on me.
Visitors have to park on the road. It's a rule.
Sorry, Mr Cribbage.
Rules are rules, Miss Grey.
With all the riffraff the company's hiring
It's only rules that separate us from the animals.
Goodnight, Mr Cribbage.
He's the caretaker of the park.
I'm trying not to get on his bad side.
Does he have a good side?
There you are.
Thank you.

Ohh!
Oi! I can't see:
What the hell is that?
Hide. It's my dog.
Ohh!
You, dog, be needing an ed-u-cation.
Hey, can I show you something?
Careful.
So a few years back, this old dude, Jumbo Smelt,
'Was swimming right out there and he got attacked by a great white.
Bit him in the leg and pulled him under.
Did he die?
No, no.
The shark spat him out, didn't like the way he tasted.
Not a surprise if you knew Jumbo.
It took 73 stitches to get his leg sewed back together.
That's awful.
Hey, no-one swims out there anymore.
Most days you can still see the shark swimming back and forth.
He's been spotted so often the boys have given him a name.
Mmm?
Lord Nelson.
I don't see anything.
Maybe we should go out a bit deeper.
What's that?
What?!
Nothing.
It's not funny!
Maybe he's asleep.
Sharks don't sleep.
They have to keep moving, just like you,
Mr Never Lived More Than
Two Years in the Same Place.
Are you calling me a shark?
Maybe.
Nah, you got me wrong.
Moving is part of my romantic nature.
Hmm.
You're just scared.
Scared? Of what?
Of finding something worth staying in one place for.

Yep, Red was a real matchmaker, alright.
Red Dog is reason
I met my most bella wife.
Do you remember? It was the day Red Dog was shot.
Red Dog was shot?
Oh, yes,
After his first great fight with Red Cat.
Why would anyone shoot him?
Because he won
No, he did not win his first fight with Red Cat, but Red Dog was not a normal poochie.
He was smart, very, very smart, and brave.
Get out! Get! You diety, filthy, whoring hound!
Johnny boy!
Yeah?
Phone.
Hello.
He's over here!
Hey, buddy. Hey.
Oh, what have they done to you?
Ohh. What do you think?
I can stop the bleeding, but
'we have to get him to a vet.
That's four hours.
Three and a half, mate, the way I drive.
Don't you dare die on me, you damn dog.
Don't you dare die.
You're OK.
So, who do you think did it?
Evil Cribbages.
They live on pig snouts and they hate the doggies.
What makes you think he has a rifle?
I know.
How do you know that?
After Jumbo Smelt was eaten in the leg all the men with gun...
...went out to kill the sharky.
I'm glad they didn't kill it.
Why?
You never know when you might need a shark.
What in God's red earth would you need a shark for?
Say you woke up one fine morning and didn't find it so fine.
Being eaten by a shark is rather a memorabie way to go.
You would not taik this way if you laugh once in a while.
I laugh.
Never.
He's right, mate.
I've never even heard you chuckle.
Maybe you haven't noticed, but Dampier's no three-ring bloody circus, is it?
In my home Village of Abruzzi there was always laughter, always.
I don't even think there is an Abruzzi.
You probably come from some piss-ugly town in Albania and are trying to pass.
Vannoski!
That is not funny.
Yuri Vannoski.
Dimitri Vannoski.
Knitter.
What did you call me?
I called you a knitter!
What kind of a man knits a sweater?
Shut up! Give Red Dog some peace, for Godsakes!
It's OK. It'll be OK.
Well, he got lucky.
The bullets missed the bone.
I saved them for you.
Well, look at that.
How long will he need to stay?
Just a coup e of hours.
It's my shout, boys.
You alright?
Red's gonna need to come back in two weeks.
That's a long bloody drive.
Yeah.
I could try and take the stitches out for you.
No. l will take him.
It would be an honour.
Idiota, Idiota, Idiota!
His nose, it is, uh, very dry.
I cannot sleep.
Yes, a worm.
A big white worm. l am sorry they give you enema last time.
This time I promise to ask her out.
OK, OK, OK.
I ask her out and give you big meat, huh?
No. After.
I can't see any glass.
I wonder, you know, sometime,
I and you together maybe...
Are you asking me out?
I do.
Arggh!
Well?
Yes, I, Vincenzio
Albeto Girolomo, ask you, bella Rosa, out.
A round of drinks on me for my bella Rosa, my bello child Giovanni and Red Dog.
He saved my life once. True.
Yeah? How did he do that?
Everyone that ends up in this part of the country has something they're running away from.
Hang on.
Lack of money, broken heaet, violent acts, loss of hope.
We all have a story we left behind.
10 years ago, my wife and girl were killed in an auto accident when I was driving.
Oh, Jesus, I... I'm sorry.
What Vanno said was true.
I... I hadn't laughed in years.
Then one fine morning I woke up and I didn't find it so fine.
Oh, g'day, Jumbo.
Couldn't stand a drink for me poor nerves and me throbbing scar, could you?
No worries, Jumbo.
Throbbing something horrible all night.
And what do I hear this morning?
Me old nemesis. Lord Nelson. is back off Hansen's Cove, swimming back and forth, carefree as a kiss.
Huh.
I feel like
Captain bloody Hook.
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Hey, mate, can you grab us a cold one out of the esky?
Oh, g'day, mate.
Get it!
Where are you, you lazy-arse fish?
Hey, get out of it, you mongrel!
That's my steak!
Drop that steak!
Jocko!
Get out!
Shark!
Faster!
Get in, Jocko!
Ah!
Do you want to die?
Get rid of the steak!
Get in!
You alright?
Wasn't for Red Dog and that prime hunk of red meat, you'd be looking at fish bait.
Hello?
Oh. uh. Wait.
Wait a second. Uh...
A gentleman.
Four sisters.
Ah. Well...
Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry.
Yeah.
So, whatever happened to them?
Who?
Nancy and John.
Uno, dos, one, two, tres, cuatro.
Up, up, up, up.
Yeah!
Not that song!
Hey.
Excuse me, guys.
Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
Speech!
Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech!
No. No, no, no, no, no.
What do you think I'm standing up here for, the weather?
How's the weather?
Hot!
Now, most of you blokes have no idea what we're celebrating here tonight.
You heard there was free beer and food and you came swarming out of the night like locusts.
He's not a bad bloke for a seppo.
But I'm here to tell you there's something deeper going on here tonight.
We're celebrating a unique moment in my life.
Sedentariness.
Did he say he was on drugs?
Nah, I think he's joining the priesthood.
Now, I've been in Dampier two years and one day.
That is one day longer than I've ever been
In any single place my whole life.
Why, you ask? Why? Why?
Why?
Why in this glorious armpit of the North-West?
One reason.
One incredibly beautiful reason.
I am hopelessly in love with Nancy Grey, and I am not afraid to tell the world about it, or her.
Uh... Huh.
Nancy Jane Grey...
...will you marry me?
John Grant...
...I will!
Now, go home!
Lovely party.
Mmm
I think we should go to my place.
Or we could just go into my bed.
Which two of your mates are passed out in.
Red Dog, you stay.
You hear me?
I'll be back in the morning.
Go back to sleep, beautiful.
I'll see you tonight, OK?
Hello?
Oh, hello, Nancy.
It's Jocko.
Hello, Jocko.
How's your head?
What head?
Some joker's replaced it with a swollen pumpkin.
Have you seen John?
Why?
Well, he never showed up for work.
He left my place early to go back to his house
He probably went back to sleep, is all.
I'll... It's nearly lunch.
I'll pop over and take a peek.
Call me when you find him.
Will do.
See that?
What?
Turn around.
Slow down.
Here!
Oh!
No. Oh!
With all the sadness and the...
...arrangements for the funeral, everyone forgot about Red Dog.
Wasn't till three days had passed that anyone noticed that...
...he was still waiting outside John's house.
Nancy made an effort to claim him, but...
...he was a one-master dog.
So he waited.
In the heat and the cold, day and night.
For three weeks, he sat in front of John's house and barely moved, his eyes always on the road.
Then one day,
Red Dog made a decision.
If John wasn't gonna come home. then he, Red Dog, would go out in the world and find John.
Walked in the transport... and looked into the face... of every man there.
He was asking a single question.
''Have you seen John?''
''Have you seen John?''
''Have you seen John?''
''Have you seen John?''
He looked everywhere at Hamersley. Every department.
And when he couldn't find him there, he went to the saltworks.
And then the mall.
And then the pub.
And even the harbour.
Most dogs would have stopped there, in Dampier.
But most dogs weren't Red Dog.
And this is how he became famous.
This is how he became the Pilbara Wanderer,
Dog of the North-West.
You see, mate.
...he went everywhere.
He travelled for years.
Town to town to town.
He was spotted down in Perth more than once and as far north as Darwin.
And I have it on good authority that he even hitched a ride on an ore ship from Poet Hedland to Saganoseki, Japan.
But in the end, after all the looking and the travelling...
...the grief...
...I think he finally knew. lt was time.
Time to come home.
Red?
Red?
Red Dog! Red!
Red Dog! Hello!
Red Dog. Red Dog!
You came back!
Did you hear?
I got a promotion.
I'm an executive assistant now.
Which is really the same as a secretary except I get paid a bit more.
They've put me on the list for one of the new houses at Karratha.
Oh.
And I finally let that Kurt bloke take me out.
I don't think so.
Bad dental hygiene.
Shh.
Hello.
Miss Grey.
Mmm.
It's come to our attention that you're in serious violation of park rules.
And what would they be?
You know what.
No dogs allowed!
It's a silly rule.
We know you have a dog in there. No point in denying.
Red Dog is not your average dog, Mr Cribbage.
He has privileges.
Everybody knows that.
I don't care if he's the Queen's bloody corgi.
If you don't get rid of him, we get rid of you.
Aha!
Red, stop that.
Your contract clearly states that you cannot own a dog.
I don't own Red Dog.
Nobody does.
Then he's a stray.
No. He's common.
What the heck's common?
He's accepted and cared for by the town.
The community.
Now, there's a laugh.
That's no proper town.
And there's no such community.
It's just a bunch of dirty miners working, drinking and whoring.
What happens in this park is what I say.
And I say that dog is a dangerous stray, plain and simple.
And the next time I see him,
I'll shoot him for sure.
Listen to me, you little bug.
You as much as harm a hair on that dog's head and you will have me and the entire Pilbara to answer to!
You've been warned, Miss Grey.
And so have you.
Now, once more.

Who was it?
Everyone
Stop that!
Who are all you people?
Well, they would be the community of Dampier.
But since there is no proper town and no such community,
I guess they're just a bunch of dirty, drunken miners.
Yeah!
That's right. Dirty, drunken.
I'll call the police, I will.
There's no need, Mr Cribbage.
Back here.
Get these people out of my park!
Now, Mr Cribbage, you're just the caretaker.
Hamersley owns the land.
So what?
I take care of the land.
You got a problem with that?
What do you all want with me?
Oh, we just have a small delegation that would like to have a private word with you.
That's all.
Oh, whoops.
Seems to be my break time.
Call me if you need me.
We had a little chat.
It was very civilised and all.
You were very persuasive.
It was nothing, really.
All the Cribbages needed was a bit of ed-u-cation.
Well, they were so educated that they ran away and took their caravan with them.
The only thing they left behind... ,.was their cat.
So as Red Dog would never be accused of being a low-down dirty stray again, we all had him registered at the shire as common.
Oh!
But...
...there was a reckoning still to be decided.
The Cribbages
'were gone, true, but let us not forget that a dark, sinister force still ruled over the caravan park.
Good versus evil!
Civilization versus chaos!
Doggie do versus cat poo!
Red Dog and Red Cat are going at it! Place your bets, gents!
They fight!
They fight!
What?
Spectacular.
Nobody knows how or why.
Perhaps it was a grudging respect.
Certainly, they were the scrappiest and the rangiest their two kinds have ever cooked up.
Perhaps they saw more than a bit of themselves in each other.
Who knows?
But know this.
Mates, they became.
Red Cat and Red Dog
Red Cat and Red Dog.
Shh, shh, shh.
There's an iron statue outside brought up from Perth by this fine man, Thomas, here.
It's of that old English explorer William Dampier
Paid for, as in all things, by Hamersley Iron...
.to stand at the entrance of this town.
Dampier sailed into the harbour in 16-something-or-other, spent five minutes, sailed out again.
The only thing he wrote about the place was,
''Too many flies.''
That's it!
''Too many flies''!
Well, I say, to hell with that!
Why should we have a statue honouring a poncy Pommy fly-hating aristocrat?
Or, for that matter, a fat bloody general, or, God help us, a stinkin' politician?
Yeah!
We should have somebody that understands this place.
Somebody that lives and breathes this vastness and desolation.
Somebody that's got red dust stuck up their nose and in their eyes and their hair and up their arse!
Somebody that's like all of us.
Men...
...and women... who understand the meaning of Independence and the importance of a generous heart.
Mates who are loyal by nature, not design...
...and who know the meaning of love and loss.
Somebody that represents our home.
Somebody that represents the Pilbara in all of us.
And I say that somebody...
...dammit...
...is a dog!

Agent Cortez? This is Danger D'Amo.
Give me a status update.
Visual ID has been made.
The subject has entered the location right on time. be on the alert.
Subject known as Tick Tock has the stolen OSS mini disc.
Alpha and Bravo teams, move in to apprehend the target.
Freeze!
He's got time bombs!
Be careful what you wish for!
Tick Tock has the stolen
OSS mini disc and is on the move.
Sorry I can't hang around.
On-site arrival in four minutes.
We don't have four minutes!
I'll get him faster with the zip line.
If I don't catch him now, who knows how many people he'll freeze?
You're pregnant.
Yeah, well, they say you can exercise up until the last day of pregnancy, so, here we go.
- Contraction!
You're about to become a mom.
All the more reason to get the job done now.
We can't let Tick Took escape again.
- Breathe.
- Try not to hit that bus.
- Mute road noise.
- Call Wilbur.
- Calling husband.
Oh, there she is. How's my girl?
You just leaving work?
Yeah, just tying up a few things.
Nine months pregnant and still working around the clock.
You've got to be the most dedicated interior decorator that ever lived.
What can I say? I love my work.
- Ooh!
Here's what I really called about.
Guess who decided to pay us an early visit?
Is this it?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Meet me there?
Right. Hospital. Don't panic.
I'm here for you.
- All you have to do...
...is breathe easy and breathe often...
I love you so... much.
Keep breathing.
- You're gonna be just fine.
- Yep. Gotcha. See you there.
Wait for backup!
Contractions are only
OK, Tick Tock. Hand over the mini disc.
- Ah, man.
Don't underestimate her.
- I think my water just broke.
I hope that was my water.
Clean her clock.
Cut me some slack,
I'm having a contraction.
- Congratulations...
I look forward to doing this again.
Swell work, Agent Cortez.
Aces. I knew you had it in you.
If this got into the wrong hands, our world would've stopped in its tracks.
Looks like an old OSS file. the ultimate weapon.
This baby not only takes out your enemy, it takes out everyone.
No one ever notices time until it's gone.
This was our agreement.
One last mission and I'm out for good.
You're really gonna take a powder on us? Leave us high and dry?
No more dangling from zip lines or high-speed chases.
My family needs me now.
And they can never know I was a spy.
I respect that, agent. But a word of advice: tell 'em who you are.
Life's too short for secrets.
Push out a good one, a nice little fire-breather for us, all right?
The future of the OSS depends on it.
Let's not stand around bumping gums, people.
I wanna figure out what makes Tick Tock tick.
Go.
Hey, kids. I got a new idea for a reality show.
It's called
Wilbur Wilson: Spy Hunter where I hunt real spies on TV.
- What do you think?
- Uh, it's pretty out there, Dad.
- Got you.
One point for me. Yeah, I mean, where are you gonna find a spy?
- Hi! Honey!
- Hey, sweetheart!
Hey, you look great.
You owe me a dollar.
Told you we would get here before her.
I said take it slow, but that was a night shy of eternity and a morning past forever.
Stepmother is always late for everything.
Technically I'm early, 'cause the baby wasn't even due until tomorrow.
Ease up.
What took so long?
Uh, just must have lost track of time.
- Here we go! Oh!
Jeez! Guys, guys, guys, guys.
From this point on, everything'll be different.
In a good way, right?
Yeah. And you'll have a new baby sister
- in five, four, three, two...
I put my life on the line every time I search for...
...the spies among us.
Look!
I'm Wilbur Wilson...
...Spy Hunter.
Mondays after your local news.
Last piece of bacon.
Is the baby throwing food again?
- I would say so.
Can you watch her, please?
I have to go change again.
Again.
- Ah! Seriously?
Her gas bombs are gonna take the paint right off this house.
- You watch her.
- No. You.
- Breath-holding contest?
- You're on.
One point for me.
- Good morning, little Spy Hunters.
Do you have time to eat breakfast with us?
- I sure do.
- Yes!
No, I don't.
I swear I had an extra five minutes...
...just a few minutes ago.
- Where'd the time go?
You owe me a dollar.
Hey...
Do you remember our five-year plan?
If my show does well, then I'll have all the time in the world to spend with you and you, OK?
Meanwhile, time is just slipping away.
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, bye, honey.
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh, um, OK.
- Uh, good-bye hug?
- Oh, yeah.
Uh...
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Rebecca, behave at school. OK?
- I know.
And, Cecil, uh...
...feed the dog.
He doesn't really eat.
He just watches us.
Here, Argonaut.
It's kind of creepy.
Time is speeding up.
You're not cranking my chain, are you?
This is on the up and up?
- Good night?
What are you talking about, doll face?
You just got back from lunch.
- But it's five o'clock, sir.
- Five o'clock?
We're running out of time. and jelly sandwich in your face and then he stole your homework?
Technically, it was his homework.
I was just doing it for him.
And what about you, Miss Rebecca?
How was your day?
Same old, same old.
- So I heard.
The principal called me about your pranks.
- Hey, kids!
- Dad! Come, sit by me!
Sorry, kids, but I have to go write up this report before I can do anything.
Save me some leftovers.
Hey, Dad? Can you teach me how to be a Spy Hunter?
Well, there's always time for that.
OK. Repeat after me:
"I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter, and I'll catch you... later."
I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter, and I'll catch you... later!
Here's the important part.
Lift the eyebrow.
Respect the golden arch.
That's my secret.
How many spies have you caught?
Um... Well, none.
Um... But that's not really what the show's about.
So you're not a spy-catching superhero?
_..but.._
How's my girl?
She made two poopies today.
Two poopies?
She's six away from the house record.
- Oh!
I lost my appetite.
I'll go talk to her.
What am I doing wrong?
I've tried so hard to connect with her
- but she just hates me.
- No, she doesn't hate you.
- She totally hates me.
- No, she doesn't. Maybe a little.
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I think she's just trying to adjust to a new situation.
We've been married for two years.
Right. ever since Stepmother entered the picture.
And she's keeping something from us.
I can feel it.
She's not who she says she is!
You don't think she's really an interior decorator?
Well, look at this place!
She's obviously evil.
Well, I think she's nice.
There is something she's hiding from us.
Doesn't mean she deserves your blue cheese dressing bomb.
My best prank yet.
Not hearing very well increased my other senses.
Don't worry, she never comes into my room anyway.
Do you have a sec?
Yes.
I was going through the basement and I found somethings that I thought you might wanna have.
Mom.
I know you miss your mom and I could never replace her.
I just would really like it if maybe we could be friends?
Mom always said she loved my practical jokes.
I love your practical jokes.
I think you're hilarious.
You think I'm funny?
The one you did last month to your father when you filled his toothpaste with blueberry filling?
And his teeth were blue for like four days.
That was epic.
I hooked up his nose hair clipper
- to a power saw?
Some of my best work.
Or the baby powder in the hair dryer trick?
I had meant that prank for you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's OK. It was just a joke.
There's something, um...
...I would like you to have.
This is something my parents gave me when I was around your age.
And my mother said it would always protect me, even in my darkest hour.
What I think she meant by that was,
I would always have her love and support.
You're really giving this to me?
It's something that's very special to me and my family and I want you to have it...
...because you're so very special.
Rebecca. _ _
...I'm really looking forward to us being friends.
MS, too.
Good night.
Marissa, wait!
I'm so...
...sorry.
Good going.
I tried to warn her!
You got to make it up to her.
Why do I have to be the one to always apologize?
Like what about that time that you just kept on talking and I was...
I turned off my hearing aids.
OK! I'll make it up to her!
He's right, you know.
I mean, the show is called Spy Hunter.
At some point,
I should actually catch a spy.
He thinks I'm a complete loser.
That's not what he meant.
They just wanna spend more time with you.
What is that smell?
Oh, did the baby spit up on you again?
- Something like that.
...Our worst fears have been confirmed.
According to scientists, there are now, literally, less hours in the day.
Studies show that time is running out.
Time is speeding up.
At first, we were losing nanoseconds, but now we're losing hours.
By tomorrow, we'll have lost days.
By the day after that, a year.
At this rate, we will be completely out of time... in no time.
Experts are divided on what's causing this phenomenon, although one man has claimed credit.
We received this video moments ago.
Citizens of the world,
I find you all guilty of wasting time.
You fill your days with meaningless pursuits instead of treasuring moments with those you love.
You will no longer take time for granted, for I am taking all of the time in the world from you.
Project Armageddon has been activated and I will continue to speed up time until time runs out, and the world will end.
I am the Time Keeper and I want more time!
Only minutes ago, OSS Director
Danger D'Amo addressed the threat.
The OSS will find this Time Keeper, and when we do, we will punch his clock.
There 's a decrease of one minute per hour as now...
Oh, this is not good.
Actually, this is awesome.
Could you imagine the promotion I would get if I landed an interview with this guy, the Time Holder?
- Time Keeper.
- Not to mention the hero factor for tracking down an international supervillain. Not too shabby.
Honey, I think being a hero isn't really what the kids need from you right now.
It's just what they need now.
It's what the world needs.
Where is the Chronos Sapphire you promised me?
Time waits for no man, no man but me.
That one little rock is the only element that can stop the Armageddon device.
Trust me, it will be ours.
Time and my temper are short.
You waste my time...
...and I'll waste you.
We will find the Chronos Sapphire...
...and when we do...
...no one will be able to stop us.
NO One.
OK, princess.
You're a little sleepy head, huh?
Oh, no.
OSS directive. For your eyes only.
Time Keeper threat confirmed.
Chronos Sapphire needed to stop Armageddon.
Deliver Chronos to OSS immediately.
Oh, Rebecca.
I hope you're working on that apology.
Make sure you write
"P.S., Cecil is innocent."
A handmade coupon, good for one free month of all household chores.
And no pranks for a whole month.
"And no pranks for a week."
Hey, Rebecca?
Do you have that necklace from last night?
Yeah. Why?
I was just wondering if maybe I could, um...
...maybe I can have it back?
You want the necklace back?
I realized it needs to be cleaned, and, uh... you know, it's old.
Oh, I get it.
You can't trust me with it.
What happened to "This necklace is so special, and so are you"?
Am I supposed to pretend that you really meant that?
I just need the necklace back.
I can't really explain it right now.
You can have it!
I never wanted your stupid necklace anyway.
You only care about yourself!
You don't care about us at all!
I have to go on an important mission,
I mean, errand.
There are snacks in the fridge.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Do you guys need anything?
My mom.
We'll be fine.
Right.
Argonaut.
Watch the kids.
House is now armed.
Buckle up, baby.
- All right.
Let's go for a ride.
Hey! I thought you gave that back to Marissa.
Wait till she looks in the box.
Is that the Chronos Sapphire?
Without that, our goose is cooked.
Give it to Mommy. Thank you, pumpkin.
Here, give it to me.
Another prank.
- Baby food.
- I'm sorry.
My stepdaughter is a little... upset.
She has the necklace.
- I can get it back.
- Chronos Sapphire can wait.
Your old pallie Tick Tock has just been made and you're the only one that can scoop him up.
Pop the clutch.
You're back on the clock.
What about the Chronos?
You nab Tick Tock, he'll lead us to the Time Keeper.
We don't need the Chronos.
So Rebecca can keep the necklace.
It would mean a lot if she could.
OK. I'll do it.
I just have to go get my kids first.
Those ankle biters'll be fine!
This is Seeker 17. We have a lock on the Chronos Sapphire.
Repeat, we have found the Chronos Sapphire.
Prepare to breach the entrance.
You really shouldn't do that.
But if you're going to, give her vampire teeth. subject to immediate attack.
Please take shelter in the panic room now.
You're really stepping up your game with these pranks.
That's not my prank. subject to immediate attack.
Take shelter in the panic room now.
- Where's the panic room?
- Don't fall for it.
This is obviously Marissa's attempt to get me back.
Take shelter in the panic room now.
Oh, and if we don't, I suppose something really terrible will happen to us.
Scanning.
Identity match.
Please enter the panic room now.
- Enter the panic room now.
- Let's go, Rebecca.
Enter the panic room now.
Well, this is obviously the panic room.
- Why?
- 'Cause it's a room, and I'm panicking.
Hello, children.
I had this panic room installed when I married your father in the event that my work ever put the family in danger.
Her work?
There 's something
I never told you about myself because it was a matter of national security.
I am a spy.
Our stepmother's a spy?
Impossible.
She's not cool enough.
Argonaut is an Advanced Robotic
Guardian Operative designed to protect you.
I still think this is a prank.
The dog is talking.
Well, it's not the sort of thing you'd miss, is it, really?
A small, handsome dog talking with an English accent, like James Bond.
Anyway, I've been assigned to protect you, so give me five.
That's what cool people say, isn't it?
Anyway, let's shake hands.
Hello. How do you do?
Ah! Oh, no! I hate when that happens!
I am gonna need that back.
I think you better keep it in sentry mode. any time you're ready.
- Good thinking.
Can I have it back now?
'Cause I am gonna fall over.
The panic room is being attacked.
You must leave now.
The jet luges will take you to OSS headquarters.
And sit. Do you get it?
It's what humans usually say to dogs.
I reversed it, I flipped it.
Oh, this is gonna be great.
- I tell you, we're gonna have a...
I usually have to eat grass or a slipper to feel this sick. Oh.
I wasn't ready, that's all.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Do not let the
Chronos Sapphire get away!
A mini camera is not that impressive any more.
People have them in their phones.
Well, how small is it?
- That's impossible.
Sorry. What?
Sorry, there was an air show behind me.
There's no such thing as invisibility powder.
All right, Argonaut. Start talking.
Who were those guys with the giant goggles? What do they want?
How long has Marissa been a spy?
OK. Your stepmom will answer all of your questions post-mission.
I have a question.
Who's flying this thing?
I thought you were.
Oh, no.
They do not look like pet lovers.
Hello, children. if you're watching this, your escape jets are under attack.
We are going to have to initiate evasive maneuvers to get you to OSS even faster.
- Brace yourselves.
- Oh, great.
It's like a big video game.
Grab your controller and steer slowly!
- Whoa!
- I'm gonna crash!
I'm gonna hurl.
Right.
Puke goes in the bag, not on my fur.
They're gaining!
Cecil!
Do something!
He is doing something. He's puking.
We might need a bigger bag.
In fact, we might need a bigger spaceship.
It smells like fish socks in here.
Can we at least open a window?
Ugh. it's not much fun in here.
Hey! You opened up mine!
Fresh air. That helps.
I love this. I love sticking my head out the window. it's my favorite thing.
Sorry!
Cecil!
How may puke bags do you have left?
Good job, Cecil!
Never underestimate the power of puke.
Agent Argonaut reporting.
Listen, the kids are fine.
I can't say the same about the house.
Why? What did they do?
They didn't do anything. They didn't destroy the house. Tick Tock's men did.
What?! Argonaut,
I told you to watch them!
I am watching them.
I'm watching them puke and scream.
- We've gotta discuss hazard pay.
- Just get them to the OSS.
I want a raise!
There's only one person
I want waiting there to greet them.
OSS Headquarters.
How can I direct your call?
I saved your life. One point for me.
Whatever. The puke bags were my idea. everything? You're brother and sister.
You're fighting like cats and dogs, which I could understand why cats and dogs fight.
Cats are awful. Just chillax.
Part "chill," part "relax."
I fused 'em to make a trendy word.
Who are you?
Carmen Cortez, secret agent of the OSS.
Your stepmom is my aunt.
So, a word of caution to you would-be supervillains out there...
Your best defense may be... a jelly donut.
What am I saying?
What are they gonna do with that?
What, are they gonna throw them at 'em?
Just say it. I'm too attractive.
Let's face it.
I've never caught a spy, and I probably never will.
I say we go after the Time Keeper.
Oh, that's realistic.
Where are you at with that piece for Spy Week?
It's not due till Friday.
It is Friday.
Time's speeding up, Wilson.
Don't you keep up with the news?
Get me something on someone, anyone!
And get it to me yesterday or there won't be a tomorrow for you at the station. Got it?
It's time to get serious.
Marissa's not picking up.
Maybe she's under radio silence.
She's got a lot of explaining to do, man.
She never told you she was a spy, huh?
Well, in her defense, she was retired.
- Well, hello.
You're a big girl now.
Is that titanium alloy?
- Treat?
- Yes, please.
Cool.
Wanna see how I got started as a spy?
This is the old Spy Kids division. ago due to budget cuts.
Really sad. It was ahead of its time.
Spy Kids were an elite juvenile division of the OSS.
I'm going to explode you.
Established to go where adult spies couldn't go and do what ordinary spies couldn't do.
Ralphie, it's me!
We went to the academy together.
How you do...
Oh. Now I see what, they've turned him off. Just as well. He's annoying.
I'd like to bring back the Spy Kids division one day.
We call those Stompers and Hammer Hands.
They use electron fields to create superhuman impact force.
These SFS 3WeSOI'T1€.
You can crush things. on-the-spot booby traps ambushes, mass confusion, and pranks.
- Pranks?
- I'll tell you what.
I'll let you guys pick out one gadget each as a souvenir.
- Mine.
- Mine.
Don't get too excited. I said that
I'd let you guys pick out e gadget, but I didn't say I'd activate it.
Back in the day, the kids who made the best spies were the ones who didn't wait around for the perfect gadgets.
They made stuff happen with what they had on hand.
Who's that?
Me and my brother, Juni.
We were the first and last of the Spy Kids program.
We shall not speak of him. Let's go.
And this is where our grand tour ends.
Wait here. Marissa will pick you guys up in a minute.
Can we be candidates for the new Spy Kids program?
Time will tell. Sorry, guys, gotta go.
OSS has us working around the clock.
We have to stop the Time Keeper before the Time Keeper stops time. much of a villain's name, is it?
Oh, the Time Keeper.
Has he got a watch, has he?
It's not a scary name at all.
Rubbish. your destination for this mission.
Good luck, agent.
So Tick Tock attacked our house and chased after your brother and sister.
What do you think we should do?
Annihilate.
Annihilate?
Good thinking. to the big-time, agent. Suit up.
Intel places Tick Tock at this location.
Spot him and let him lead us to the Time Keeper's Armageddon device.
Then call in and wait for backup.
I need you at six o'clock, right here.
Come on! Bring it in.
The Armageddon device will be here any minute and we must be ready for its arrival!
Uh, cover the exit.
There you go. Good work.
Focus up, focus. Focus!
What are you doing?
We're moments away.
My plan is almost complete.
I just need to get the Chronos back from those meddlesome kids.
Shh...
Oh! Are you kidding me? Is that you?
Did you drop your transmission?
Oh, my God. Gentlemen, please.
That smells like lentils and desperation.
My God, that's mental.
It's following you.
Get back on your marks. Focus.
I'm blinded. OW!
It's here, it's here. it's finally here.
Places, everyone. This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
Right on time.
Hickory-dickory dock.
The spy ran up the clock.
The clock struck one, and the spy was done.
Game, set, and match, Tick Tock.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
This is your sidekick?
A nose-picking baby?
Gentlemen, get in here.
Baby, looks like we've been set up.
Finish her. Boom.
Boom.
Better luck next time!
The bigger the crime, the better the time!
He is really starting to tick me off.
J" Ten green bottles hanging on a wall
J" Ten green bottles hanging on a wall
J* And if one green bottle should accidentally fall J'
I'm still mad at Stepmother...
Marissa.
...For not telling us she was a spy.
For not telling Dad.
Maybe she quit to make more time for us.
Yeah, right.
Well, wouldn't you wanna be a spy?
I will be.
Even better spy than Marissa.
What are you up to?
Carmen said that the best Spy Kids were the ones who didn't wait around.
They went out and made stuff happen.
It would have to be something really amazing.
- Like catching the Time Keeper?
- Bad idea.
First person to get the bad guy wins.
No. Not another competi...
What part of "chillax" don't you understand?
Game on.
Aw, man!
This Electric Shock Gumball doesn't work, either.
While you're chewing gum over there,
I'm hacking into my Hammer Hands.
- I think I got it!
- OW!
Why?
I just don't understand.
It says batteries are included.
Read the fine print.
"On and off button...
...not included."
Let's get out of here.
Good idea.
- Hey!
- Hey!
What are you kids doing? You don't have security clearance to be out here.
Um... We lost our dog.
Yeah, but we just found him. See?
Hello. I mean, bark.
I mean, woof, woof.
- Definitely, I meant...
Yeah, they're not falling for it.
Looks we're all in this together now.
Run!
- Hey!
- Hey! Stop right there!
Coming through. Nice shoes.
- Oh!
- Sorry, sorry.
Stop those kids!
- We'll never outrun them!
Yes, we will! Pull my collar!
- Oil slick.
Uh-oh.
- They're still after us!
- Pull my tail.
Butt bombs.
This is the coolest dog ever!
That's an award and I accept it.
Wait, wait, one more. One more.
Pull my finger.
Do it.
- Wait for it.
What was that supposed to do?
It just makes me laugh.
Silent but lethal.
How are we gonna find the Time Keeper?
I don't know, if it was that hard just getting out of the lounge.
Organism Oscillation Transporter...
...otherwise known as TOOT.
Carmen said not to rely on our gadgets, but to use our heads.
Argonaut, what do you know about the Time Keeper?
First, type in my passcode.
Double-0-Woof.
They've intercepted several coded messages as to the Time Keeper's location.
But no one's been able to crack the code.
It's not a code. it's an anagram.
Drop all the numbers, switch all the letters around, and it spells something else.
"Big Time Watch Repair Shop"?
The bad guy is holding the world hostage from a watch shop?
Well, he is called the Time Keeper.
Villains do love their secret hideouts to have a theme. to the Time Keeper's shop without having to leave the building.
You better not disintegrate us.
- I think that's sort of the point.
- What?
They took the Chronos Sapphire.
Don't let them get away!
You vaporized us!
I've lost face.
Something stinks around here.
I always knew you were a butthead.
I'd give you a knuckle sandwich if I knew where my knuckles were!
Oh, I think my stomach is inside out.
I think I'm missing a kidney.
I'm just pulling your leg.
- Brilliant.
- A comedian.
- Marissa's on the line.
- Marissa?
- Hello?
- Give Mommy the comlink.
There we go. Thank you.
Sorry, technical difficulties, Carmen.
How are the kids?
They're, uh...
...lnapping?
OK. Where are they really?
I'm really sorry. They TOOTED themselves out of the OSS.
Send me their coordinates.
I'll meet you there.
You know, she's a lot like you, Carmen.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Are you sure this is the place?
He's called the Time Keeper.
This is a room full of clocks.
Nah, let's go, let's check out that cheese shop across the road.
It's another anagram.
Switch all those letters around and what do they spell?
- Elevator.
This must be the access panel.
- Oops.
- You could help, genius.
- And risk losing? before we call you the winner.
You should have a competition to see which one of you is the most annoying.
All my own stunts, all my own stunts.
And it's... a giant clock.
So, what's...
_..that? the cut-you-in-half hand.
- Well, I'm going home.
- There's a door over there!
So?
First person to get across without getting smushed...
...wins.
Now, listen, just because one person jumps off a cliff, it doesn't mean you have to follow them. Does it?
Oh, it does, apparently.
Brilliant. Here we go again.
Here comes the cut-you-in-half hand!
- Jump!
- I'll duck, thank you very much.
Whoa!
There's gotta be a better way to pass the time.
It's moving faster!
That's because time is speeding up!
Listen, I was told to watch you kids, but not watch you die!
Cecil! Hang on!
Now this is fun to watch.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
I win.
One point for me.
- OW.
- Come on. This way.
- Hey... Hey, it's working!
Sweet.
I Spy 8 SPY-
Go get the camera.
It's show time.
My five-year plan is coming together.
This is my big break.
Now we just build on this success and maybe someday hit primetime.
Primetime means free time... to spend with my kids.
Great plan. Only in five years, they won't be kids any more.
What are you saying?
Spend the time now.
'Cause the one thing you'll always find time for later...
...is regret.
Jeez. cut in half for a computer?
- There's a lot here about...
"The Boy Trapped In Time."
And that's gonna happen to us if we don't stop the Time Keeper.
According to this, he was part of a time travel experiment.
People sure did talk funny back then.
Test Footage, 1936.
Chronos Sapphire, discovered to be the only known element able to stop the Armageddon device."
- We have to get out of here!
- What's wrong?
They're after the necklace!
That'll stop your clock.
Watch your head!
Oops! Sorry about that.
Well, the good news is, you're tall enough to go on all the rides.
You children think you have all the time in the world, but soon I will.
Hand over the necklace. found a more secret lair.
- What?
Leave my kids alone.
Stepkids.
Shh! She's here to save us.
How dare you waste time bickering about that?
If you have no interest in being a family, then you don't deserve any time together.
Well, he's right about one thing.
If we're gonna get outta here, we need to work as a family.
Fire up your gadgets.
They're not activated.
- They're just souvenirs.
- Not any more.
Hammer time.
Cool.
A watch shop?
Slight left and proceed around building.
Turn right now.
Spy detected.
- It's a dumpster.
Walk forward now. Turn left now.
Left foot, right foot, left foot, big right foot.
Center and stop.
Proceed below.
The annoying voice is saying there's a spy right here. Look.
- Proceed below now.
This is more than a dumpster!
- Sorry!
- It's OK! Do it again!
Oh, shiitake mushrooms.
Come here. Come here, come here.
OK, ready?
Wilbur Wilson, Spy Hunter here.
As you can see, I'm in some sort of underground secret lair where the battle for freedom and justice is being fought by our country's top spies.
I really can't see much from up here but we can zoom in with our
Spy Hunt Cam and get a closer look.
Oh, the kids are gonna flip when they see this.
Did you get that?
You got it? Go, go, go.
Argonaut, do something!
What do you want me to do?
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
- Attack mode activated.
It's show time!
Oh, someone put that on YouTube!
- Time flies when you're having fun.
My necklace!
Let's get the kids out of here!
Argonaut!
Release!
Oh, come on!
I was gonna bury him in the backyard!
Let them go. It's all part of the plan.
We have the Chronos Sapphire.
Nothing can stop us now.
Sorry about the necklace, Marissa.
"Sorry about the necklace, Marissa."
I should've given it back to you when you asked.
Yes, you should've.
We had no idea the Time Keeper wanted it.
"We're just dumb kids."
You couldn't have known.
It was classified.
The whole world's in big trouble.
Don't look at me.
It's all our fault.
And I'm sorry I didn't share with you that I was a spy.
But it was important to me that you were both protected and safe.
What's important is stopping the Time Keeper.
Give us another chance.
You two have been so very brave and I'm so proud of you.
That sounds like something my mom would say.
- They want us back for a debrief.
- Take the kids back to OSS.
- I'll meet you there.
- Got it.
Thanks for rescuing us.
Any time.
I used to get in trouble like this all the time.
Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed you.
Great news!
I got the most amazing footage of a real spy battle at the watch shop!
I'm gonna put it on the air tonight, primetime!
- The kids are gonna be so proud.
- Oh, no.
Love you, miss you, need you. Bye!
Call me back!
That's great!
We're gonna win an Emmy for this.
A Pulitzer.
Whoa, go back, go back.
Does she have a baby with her?
Oh, she does! Oh, that's priceless!
OK, we're gonna need a graphic that reads "Spies Are Unfit Moms."
And, Wilbur, see if you can get a quote from Child Protective Services.
If we're lucky, they'll take the kids away, put 'em in foster care! Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Wilbur!
- Sorry. I'm a Klutz.
It's all right. I've got the original tape right here.
Hm!
Tastes like chicken! Want some?
Out!
Oh, really? Great.
Hi, honey.
Don't "honey" me.
There's no "honey"ing any more.
- You're a spy!
- You found out.
- Well, I'm a Spy Hunter.
And apparently I'm not a very good one, since I've been living with one.
I retired the day we had the baby...
...because our family is the most important thing in the world to me.
And...
...I'm so sorry.
Wow. I feel like such a fool.
Why did you marry me?
- You must've lost a bet, right?
- You're the man I love.
Well, uh, now I'm the man without a job and maybe without a family.
Where are the kids?
They're under protective surveillance at the OSS.
They're probably safer there anyway.
I mean, their own dad can't protect them.
Just tell them I love them.
What about us?
I just...
...need time.
We 're all running out of time.
Some predicted it would come in a blaze of fire, a giant flood, but it was the ancient Mayans who got it right when they predicted en end to the human calender, the end of time itself
Can anyone save us from this impending apocalypse, this final doomsday, this...
Armageddon.
Also known as the Wells Experiment.
Back in the day, this contraption almost caused the end of the world as we know it.
That's why the OSS shut the experiment down and placed the device in Level 13 lockdown, where it remains today.
The fate of the world is on the line here.
That's why I'm calling upon one of our most valued and skilled operatives,
Agent Cortez.
He has even come out of retirement to help us.
Yeah!
- It's good to be back.
- Then you never should have left.
Where have you been the last seven years?
If I told you, then it wouldn't be called a secret mission.
It's not like I missed you or anything.
I needed a break from your face.
Oh, what an incredible coincidence.
- I needed a break from yours.
- Oh, whatever.
What's going on over there?
Family reunion.
- This isn't about us.
- Gosh.
Carmen, this is about saving the world.
- You don't deserve to wear this badge.
- Uh...
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
All right, agents.
Let's make sure there is a tomorrow.
- Let's go save the world!
What do we get to do?
What's our assignment?
Man! Why are we in time-out?
We found the Time Keeper.
So, why are we grounded?
And why do we have to watch the baby?
Technically, I'm watching her.
Sometimes you're the dog, sometimes you're the baby entertainment center.
Danger D'Amo, director of the OSS.
I wanted to commend you on your brave service.
You bobbleheads really take after your mom.
Stepmom.
Let me give you some advice, kiddo.
Don't get balled up over that kind of baloney.
She takes the time to love you... you love her back.
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.
It was a gift from my pops.
- You sure talk funny.
- Danger D'Amo.
- Yeah.
Did you know your name is an anagram?
Switch the letters of your name around, and it spells...
...Armageddon
As in the Armageddon device.
Either that's a coincidence...
...or that's just an incredible coincidence.
- You're ticking.
It's an old watch.
- But you're wearing three more.
You're the Time Keeper.
Yeah. I'd love to stick around and chat but time is running out.
The head of the good guys is actually the head of the bad guys?
I did not see that coming.
Look around for a comlink or a phone!
We have to warn Marissa!
Agent Wilson.
- Turn around!
- It's a trap!
- That's his secret identity!
Look, I don't have time for your pranks right now. OK?
Watch Argonaut watch the baby.
Thank you.
- The Armageddon device.
It's tiny.
If time's the test, family is best.
It's a trap.
Hello, agents. You're right on time.
The kids were right.
...who you thought I was.
So where's the real Armageddon device?
Back at the OSS, where it's always been.
And now...
...I must get back to it.
- What's that?
A really nice watch.
It's also a freeze transmitter for all agents at the OSS.
It's time to take out the competition.
Danger, don't.
Now... to stop the world.
Why didn't I freeze?
I'm... trapped in here.
I need reinforcements.
But there are no reinforcements.
They're all frozen.
Except...
Time has run out for most of the planet.
Eighteen time zones have been frozen by the Time Keeper's
Armageddon device.
One thing's for certain... it's heading our way.
But we must not lose hope.
Who are we kidding? It's over!
We 're toast!
Attention, Spy Kids.
You have been activated.
I repeat, you have been activated.
Is he talking to us?
At this very moment, the Time Keeper is taking over OSS Headquarters.
Your time has come to save the world.
Every OSS agent has been frozen.
It's up to you to shut down the Armageddon device.
Get the necklace back.
It's the only thing that can stop him.
And how are we supposed to do that?
Spy Kids have always been able to beat the bad guys because adults over-think things.
But to a kid, everything is possible.
Trust me, I know.
Just use your imagination and work with each other, not against each other.
So no more competing against each other?
Good.
- Argonaut!
- Attack mode, por favor:
- Attack the door.
- Argo smash!
What about the baby?
Spy Kids.
Spy Dog.
Spy Baby. activated as Spy Kids, you are part of an elite team, and we need to work together, like Juni said.
No more competitions.
We've got to break into the OSS vault, get to the Time Keeper, find the Chronos Sapphire, then use it to stop the Armageddon device, and, of course, save the world.
Cecil, you take the vault.
Rebecca, you're on pranks.
And I, of course, will take the toughest assignment of all...
I'll watch the baby.
So I realized the only way he could freeze agents was through their OSS badges.
There you go.
Thanks for trashing mine, Carmen.
Thanks, Juni. Unfreeze your sister.
OK, but first...
...this is how I remember you.
And there we go.
- Juni!
- Hm?
Unfreeze her.
But it's so peaceful and quiet.
There.
This never would've happened if I was mission leader.
- I activated Rebecca and Cecil.
- What?
They're more ready than you think.
If anything happens to those kids, you're toast.
This way.
- Real smooth, diaper lady.
I was just following my instincts.
Well, your in-stinks!
You two were the best spy team ever.
What happened?
Yeah.
Where have you been all these years?
I tried to strike out on my own, and I struck out. OK?
OK, but Mom and Dad left the family business to the both of us.
Yeah. Well...
I guess I thought it wasn't cool to keep working with my sister.
It's what would've made you cool.
Where's Marissa?
- It's quicksand!
Don't make me punch your lights out.
Now you've seen my dark side.
- Low battery?
"Don't rely on your gadgets."
Hmm...
Hello?
Is anyone in here?
You get the door open yet?
- I think we need another way in.
OK. I'll be there in a minute.
You caught a kid.
Enjoy the ride!
Now what?
- We give up. it's the only way we'll get the necklace back.
Just follow my lead.
Hand over your weapons.
All of your weapons.
OSS agents have been frozen in time.
Is there someone, anyone, out there that can save the day?
Hello, Wilbur
Yes, this is your dog, and I'm talking, but never mind about that now.
Rebecca and Cecil are in danger.
They've been captured by the
Time Keeper and they need your help.
I know it's hard to believe, sin but you're their last hope.
I 'd hurry if I were you.
What's with the jazz hands?
Huh, kiddies?
My brother's hearing impaired.
And your goon took his hearing aids.
Give him his hearing aids back.
We're not monsters here.
No. You're only trying to end the world.
Why are you doing this?
The Armageddon device was not meant to end the world or stop time.
It was meant to travel back in time.
To get me back to that.
- My father.
- Son, come here! Take a look at this. was an early attempt to time travel.
That's me before the accident.
My father was working on the original prototype.
They were just about to test the machine when it went haywire.
He told me not to play near the lab.
But I never listened.
It trapped me in time for so many years I almost lost count.
You were the Boy Frozen In Time.
My father spent his entire life...
...trying to set me free.
...and, eventually...
...die.
The OSS shut down the experiment with a solution that literally fell from the sky...
...the Chronos Sapphire.
When the effects wore off
I was a grown man in a boy's body.
All my friends were gone.
My father... gone.
Everything and everyone
I cared about was no more.
And all of this is so you can see your father again?
I want more time!
With him.
He gave me everything.
And I couldn't even give him the time of day, because I didn't know...
...that our time would be so short together.
But now when I go back, things are gonna be different.
- No, they won't.
- Excuse me? travel through time.
Time stays the same.
You're just creating multiple versions of yourself that appear at different points in time.
He's wrong. Our plan will work.
You've tried this before and failed.
And my guess is that you've...
...already gone back in time a lot.
This isn't the first time you've traveled back.
And every time you return, you come back worse.
Each time, your plan fails.
You try it again with another you.
But when are you going to learn...
...you can't change the past?
You will only cause Armageddon.
Don't listen to him.
This time, it will work!
You will go back and you will have all the time in the world to spend with your father.
Danger, when my mom died, it was the worst thing that could ever happen to me.
I wished I had more time with her.
There is no going back.
Honor the years you had with him.
Those brief..
...Special moments...
...are the ones we'll remember.
It's not about how much time you have.
- It's what you choose to do with it.
T minus 20 minutes until Armageddon.
The Time Vortex is opening!
How'd you get outta my sand trap?
With my bare hands.
Actually, it was my Atomic Lipstick.
Keep away from my stepkids.
Make that your kids.
All right.
Make that your Spy Kids.
Stay away from my Spy Kids.
Too late!
It worked! It worked!
Everyone in the world is frozen except us.
The Chronos! of the watch or you'll freeze!
We have to use the necklace to stop the Armageddon device once and for all!
Get into the Vortex.
Wait, you don't have your Hammer Hands.
I don't need Hammer Hands.
- Yeah!
- Cecil!
Hey, Marissa gave that to me!
- Don't do it, Danger!
- You can't bring back the past!
Time is the enemy of youth.
I'm getting mine back.
You won't change anything!
I thought you said nothing would change.
Wait for it.
Who's that?
That's Danger.
You were right.
You can't go back.
I tried.
My father still died...
...no matter what
I tried to do to save him.
He did tell me one thing that was very important.
You have to live life moving forwards, not back.
This time...
...I'm gonna listen to him.
Kids!
Marissa!
I was so worried about you guys.
Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I brought you into this.
Worst stepmom ever.
Yeah.
But best spy mom ever!
I like when you're being yourself.
- Come here.
- You think you've stopped me?
You've stopped nothing.
We're just gonna keep doing this over and over and over again until I get what I want!
Because this time, time is on my side!
Yeah. Hard time.
- Clocked ya.
Lucky punch!
How'd you find us?
I'm Wilbur Wilson, your father.
You're the coolest dad ever.
I'm not gonna wait until I have enough time for us to spend together.
From now on...
...we're gonna make time.
Now that's heroic.
So...
So...
You're a spy?
Yeah. I'm a spy.
Well...
...I'm a Spy Hunter.
Got you.
And I'm never letting go.
Now this is family time.
Juni and I have decided to become co-leaders of the new Spy Kids program.
We're gonna need some new recruits with ingenuity, creativity, and heads-up thinking.
Rebecca, Cecil?
And of course...
...Spy Baby.
Yeah. Baby's got a surprise for you.
Don't get... This is it, group, that's it. Just...
Baby's first steps!
You're more impressed by a kid standing up than a dog that can talk?
Hold on a second, I...
Nice!
Oh! Baby's first bad guy!
- Wow!
- I taught her that.
Well...
...you can never start 'em too young.
Mommy's so proud of you!
We are back on the clock, back to taking our own sweet time to laugh, to cry, to embrace our loved ones.
We have all the time in the world.
Or do we?
Operation Spy Kid Recruitment.
Setting filters to max.
You have been activated.
And you have been activated.
I now declare you all Spy Kids.
That's one point for me.
Ouch.

There's a moment when you realize that something's changed
And all the bits and pieces start to fit
It's so fab!
When nothing that you know will ever be the same
Ring the bell
That's my cue
Gotta try something new
Gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
Yeah
Listen up, fellas.
Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back
Bye, Gab.
No endless night can keep me in the dark
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack
- But he'll live
- He'll live
- And he'll see
- He'll see
What his girl is meant to be
Gonna shine
And leave the past behind
Gonna try to fly so high
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine
Then I'll write my name in letters across the sky
I'm gonna shine
And if my present luminescent state is second rate
I'll turn it up a notch past nine
And watch the world go blind
Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch
Like an angel in Armani
I'm too fabulous
They'll be lining up for blocks
Once I bop to the top
With a poochie in my Gucci
I just can't be stopped
I'm gonna shine
And make the moment mine
Now my time has arrived
Gonna shine so bright
The sun will run and hide
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky
I'm gonna shine
There she is. Wonderful!
Hi!
- I know, I know.
- I loved it.
Excuse us. There's our little superstar!
Princess, you had better watch out for law enforcement.
They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!
Honey, on a scale of one to 10, you were an entirely different scale.
And you know my aversion to scales.
Sharpay!
Yes, I know. And thank you.
We'd like to introduce you to Jerry Taylor.
He's a good friend of our family, visiting for the week.
May I just say how wonderful you were?
As many times as you'd like!
I really see a unique talent here.
I mean, a true gift.
And your kind, true words are a gift as well.
It was so nice to meet you.
But if you'll excuse me, my friends have been waiting.
I'm a casting agent from New York.
And will keep waiting until I tell you how much I love your suit.
I'm about to start casting for a new musical on Broadway.
Broadway? As in "Broadway?"
Yeah. And I think that there is a perfect part.
I would be more than happy to arrange an audition if you happen to find yourself in the Big Apple any time soon.
That would be... I would be...
It would be, like...
The show is gonna star
Amber Lee Adams.
- No.
- Yeah.
Stop. Seriously, stop.
Who's Amber Lee Adams?
She's only the most amazing performer ever!
We have so much in common.
I won't keep you.
It was so nice to meet you, Sharpay.
Congratulations again.
And, who knows, maybe we'll see you in New York. Okay?
- Congrats!
- Bye.
Toodles!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
- No!
- No?
I don't understand!
What language is that?
No, I don't think going to New York is a good idea.
See, there you go, believing everything you think.
Do you really believe you're ready for such a monumental step?
Daddy, the main reason
I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps.
Sweetheart, when you graduated from high school almost a year ago, do you remember what you said to me?
"How come no one makes a cap and gown in hot pink?"
No.
"How come you get a car and driver and I don't?"
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone
"to fill the talent-less void of boring and unattractive
"that will exist in these hallways
- "once I graduate"?
- No.
Yes, but you also said that you needed a year to find yourself, to figure out what came next in your life.
That year's almost up, and you haven't found anything.
It's a small town. I mean, there's only so many places to look.
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.
This is more than just a show.
You're talking about going it alone in the big city.
Right! To star on Broadway with Amber Lee Adams.
Could you really deny the world that opportunity?
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me convinces me you're ready for something like this.
Okay, ladies. Team Sharpay.
New York.
Daddy says I'm not ready for this.
So, what does that mean?
You pout, throw a tantrum, and he buys you a new Burberry bag to make you feel better?
That's good, but no.
It means we show him I'm determined.
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.
...my mind looks amazing.
Okay, here's your assignments.
I texted Bridget, who e-mailed
Constance, who tweeted Bethany, who IM'ed Jenn, who Facebooked Kara, who has an ex-friend who she caught with her boyfriend, who she then dumped, so now Kara's her friend again, who knows of a New York apartment available in a luxury townhouse.
That is, like, the best house you can get in terms of towns.
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.
- It can't.
- But it does.
It is equal distance from both Chanel and wicked.
Okay. Now, on to travel plans.
That's right. Albuquerque to New York.
One adult and one dog.
Excuse me? Coach?
Hi,
I'm calling for Sharpay Evans.
Mr. Taylor wanted to set up an audition with her for a new musical.
Two weeks from today is perfect.
Now, new outfits.
And this would be for opening night.
The beading actually doubles the reflection of paparazzi flashbulbs!
You can wear anything.
You should have your own reality show called I Can Wear Anything.
Where you wear anything.
All right. I'm ready to show Daddy what we've accomplished.
Ladies, and people I don't know,
New York is calling.
And this is one call that is not going to voice-mail.
So, by way of review, this is my shoe closet, that is my bedroom, these are my new clothes and where I'll wear them, and then I'm a star! See?
I'm just not totally convinced.
Daddy, you said
I haven't shown you anything to let you know I'm ready for this.
But, look, I took matters into my own hands, and without even chipping my manicure.
Sweetheart, it's not as easy as putting pictures on boards.
But I've worked everything out!
And used this pointer.
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.
Alone, in New York?
My dear college friend, Michelle, has a son that goes to NYU.
I've met him. He's a very nice boy.
I could ask her to make sure that he keeps his eye on you.
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?
I know I can do this.
I know it like I know purple washes me out and that my eyes are the exact same distance apart to be a supermodel.
What I don't know is whether you believe in me.
Mom seems to.
Okay, you have my blessing.
Thank you, Daddy!
I'll call my friend Michelle and have her talk to her son.
Thanks, Mom.
There's just one condition.
Fine. I love a good conditioner.
You have one month.
I'll fly you to New York,
I'll pay for your penthouse, but you have to get yourself in that show and prove to me you can take care of yourself.
One month.
- Deal?
- So deal!
But if it doesn't work out, you come back here and work for me.
At the country club.
- Work?
- A job.
That's the deal.
Prove yourself, or come back in a month and work for me.
Fine. Prove myself it is!
Look!
Look, Boi, look!
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Marjorie Grande, the manager for the building.
My pleasure.
Please, follow me to the penthouse.
Ooh!
I hope this is to your liking.
No. It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.
Sure there are. See?
The members of the co-op board have a strict no-dog policy.
Well...
My father heads our country club board, so I'm sure that gives me some kind of board immunity.
Miss Sharpay, this building is pleased to have you.
This dog...
Not so pleased.
Miss Grande, Ma'am. If he goes, I go.
What are you doing?
Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Do you always just film totally stunning people on the street that you don't know?
Only when I think the subject is interesting.
And you look baffled and scared and really pink.
So, yeah, interesting.
Are you paparazzi?
I'm a film student at NYU, working on a short film.
The assignment is to capture one unique New York story.
Maybe you're it.
So, you decided to film me without my permission, just for a school assignment?
- Yep.
- How dare you!
And my left side is better for close-ups.
I'm Peyton.
Sharpay Evans. Actress, heiress, soon to be Broadway legend.
- Wait!
- About 105,
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...
I should know my own weight, okay?
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?
Not really.
When I rented this apartment online, it never said they don't allow dogs.
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!
Actually, the only place
I have to go is home.
And trust me, that is not an option!
Listen, there's an empty studio in my building, if you're interested.
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.
And...
Well, I'm sure I can make a call and arrange something.
Maybe get you to see it.
Well, since I don't seem to have any other options.
Bellman!
Oh, yeah, right.
Seriously?
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on until the truck arrives with the bulk of my things.
Oh! That's good.
Okay, now, go outside, and then come back in and give me even more of that it's-the-end-of-the-world look. Okay?
- Hey, Peyton.
- Hey, Peyton!
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.
"Maggie, the cat is alive. I'm alive!"
Singing lesson.
Cool, guys. Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.
Hi, Sharpay. Hi, Boi!
Anyways, gotta go. See ya, Peyton.
- Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
- Later, guys.
Okay. Really, you're going to love this place. Okay? Up you go.
Sorry. It's a pre-war building.
And during the war, they didn't fight for an elevator?
Listen, the building has two things going for it.
It's got something available, and I live here.
Fine. But if I break a heel, or a sweat, you're responsible.
Get my bags.
See? That wasn't so bad.
Yeah. Down the hall.
The one with the police tape and chalk outline.
Really?
Kidding.
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.
No way! MGM was a studio! This?
This is a roach motel with no room service.
Yeah, a studio apartment.
Sure, from certain angles, it's a bit small.
A two-karat engagement ring is a bit small!
This is a doll house!
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!
I'd need an entirely separate apartment just for my lipsticks.
And where am I supposed to sleep?
- What is that?
- It's your bed.
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.
You can't be serious!
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.
See? This is my place!
Looking better, huh?
Am I missing something? Oh, right.
Space! Luxury! Maid service!
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.
I'm not used to it. I just expect it.
You know, half this building is filled with performers who came here with the same ambitions you did.
What makes you so much better than them?
Money, breeding, talent, great hair, perfect jaw line, chic taste.
How much time do you have?
All right, fine.
I tried to help you out like my mom asked, but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.
The only problem is if I call my father and tell him how I messed up on the other apartment and how I have nowhere to go but here, and I ask for his help, he'll make me come home and...
Work!
- So?
- So? Then I'll never get my big break.
Oh, and promise you won't call your mother and tell her about this, because then she'll call my mom who will tell my dad, and I don't think he really believes
I can make this happen.
He only gave me one month to prove it.
Well, then you've got one month to prove him wrong.
Why did I do this?
I want my canopy bed and my housekeeper.
And a shower that doesn't share a room with a kitchen.
- Come on.
- Where to?
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.
Yeah. Point taken. Come anyway.
Come on.
I hope you're taking me to a better apartment than what you just showed me.
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way! Absolutely no!
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.
I need luxury! Are you kidding me?
That was like a green, dark hole that I never wanna be in ever again.
All right, here you go.
Butchy!
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see. Come on.
- Why are we here?
All right, all right. Now, you're gonna have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.
- Why?
- Because! Just do it.
All right, now. Keep them closed.
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't. I got you.
All right, all right. Keep them closed.
All right.
- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.
All right, all right. Perfect. All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.
Keep them closed. All righty.
Keep them closed.
All right. Open them. Hit it, Butchy!
Wow.
I know.
When I left Indiana to go to school here,
I didn't know a soul either, and I was just as overwhelmed as you.
But I had two things, my dream and my camera.
And look at me now.
You still only have your dream and your camera.
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.
Well, whenever people meet me, things get better.
Look, you just have to adapt to your surroundings.
And remember that for now this is all just temporary.
Right. Like prom dresses and first boyfriends.
Look, anything you have to do will be worth it to get your dream.
Okay.
I'm gonna meet with that casting director, get the part,
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.
That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled, optimistic pink hurricane
I've been seeing through my lens.
And I like how perceptive you are.
Okay, New York. Bring it on.
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day
When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox
Gotta hold myself down
"Cause I just can't wait till you write me
You're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now
And don't it feel good!
Hey!
All right now, yeah
Hi!
Turn it off. Turn it off!
Just waiting foryou
Just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
What?
I want you to stay
I'm walking on sunshine
- And don't it feel good!
- Hey!
All right now
And don't it feel good!
Oh, yeah!
Looking good. So pink.
You're good.
- Do you wanna try some?
- No, I don't want any!
Lay down. Lay down.
Night, Boi!
Boi? Get help!
- Knock, knock.
- Come in!
Wow! And wow.
Hey, are you on your way to meet with the casting director?
No, I'm on my way to change theater history.
You think this is a good outfit for changing history?
Perfect! Mind if I tag along and film?
Not that you could ever mind me, right?
I think you should. After all, not many people can say they were there to film the creation of a legend.
Sharpay! You made it after all!
Destiny called, and I get great reception!
Well, your timing is perfect.
What's tomorrow like for you?
The first day of the rest of my fame.
Well, all right.
I'll set up your audition for 3:00.
I'll e-mail you the musical number that we'd like you to prepare.
And could you make sure that he's well-groomed and, you know, takes care of any business beforehand.
- What?
- What?
- He?
- Yes.
- Him?
- Him.
- He?
- Yes!
Wait, what?
It's your dog that we want to audition.
He was amazing!
Oh.
What?
I mean...
I sent you all the information in response to your e-mail.
I mean, didn't the title of the musical give you any indication?
A Girl's Best Friend?
A Girl's Best Friend!
And I'm here for the girl!
You're here for the girl?
Well, I'm never the best friend!
Oh, no. No, no. We wanted Boi.
As the girl?
No, as the best friend.
Wait, wait. You wanted Boi as the best friend of the girl?
Not me as the girl with the best friend?
Exactly.
Oh, Sharpay, I am so sorry for the confusion.
If you don't want Boi to audition,
I would totally understand.
Sharpay. Sharpay! Hey, stop.
Hey, don't touch the car!
Look, slow down. Even New Yorkers can't keep up with you.
It's not even me they wanted!
Well, to be fair, the role is for a dog.
If they wanted you,
I could understand you being upset.
Why did I come all this way?
Leave my friends, family, a dry, self-hydrating climate?
To follow your dream!
Or at least that's what I thought.
Nothing is turning out the way I planned it!
Plan A. Live in a penthouse and star on Broadway.
Plan B... Don't have a plan B!
What do I tell my father now?
That you came to a very special city determined to be someone very special, which you are.
Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.
Maybe a little better.
Look at it this way.
Boi is your dog, and he has an opportunity, so be happy for him.
You're right.
I'm being, you know, what's the word?
When you do something for yourself even though it's not so good for other people?
- Selfish?
- No!
Oh, yeah.
Look, Sharpay, you can't give up. Okay?
And, anyway, you're officially the star of my film.
I am?
Yeah, you are.
Oh. So now it's all about you?
Only because I need you here.
Fine. I'll star in your movie.
Okay. Good, good!
Okay, change of strategy.
I didn't know you had a strategy, but I like the way you think.
If Boi becomes a success, everyone will see me as well.
After all, I am his entourage.
I am the one who's holding his leash.
His fame will ultimately lead to my fame.
That's what I came here for, right?
Still a little selfish, but heading in the right direction.
We're gonna do this.
It's like I tell the housekeepers.
If you can't see the bright side, polish the dull side.
Yeah, not quite what I was talking...
They want Boi to audition?
It's Boi they will get! when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is
Yes, rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
Two, three, four
We're gonna sit and shake your hand
That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark
In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us
That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my Boi
Me and my Boi
My Boi and me
Wait!
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
I'm Gill Samms, the director.
Neal Roberts, writer.
That was amazing!
Chills. Feel my hand...
I won't feel your hand, but I believe you.
I won't feel your hand either, but I believe you, too.
That is one special dog.
We've done special here.
Special has been done, people!
Boi was meant for Broadway.
We both were.
So, when do we start?
Well, there's one more waiting.
One more!
One more, people!
Could you take a seat in the front row, please?
There.
Now.
Roger Elliston the third.
And his dog, Countess.
FYI, I'm Roger.
As you can see by our extensive resume, hand-printed on carbonless, environmental-friendly rice paper,
Countess has numerous major
Broadway credits under her paws, including The Collar Purple
Three Puppy Opera, and the original
Broadway cast production of A Wagging Tail of Two Cities, a musical opera in German.
Major pedigree.
I'm impressed.
This is us impressed.
Plus, she can bark a high C with sustained vibrato.
Sure, but only dogs can hear it.
All right.
Let's see what Countess can do. when a sign ofthe times is the times are extremely tough
When you look at the world and the world that you see is rough
When you feel like a long lost pup
And you need some cheering up
Sit back, relax and watch us do our stuff
We're gonna sit and shake your hand
That's how it starts
We're gonna nose our nosy way into your hearts
We'll sing and bark
In two-part harmony
You're gonna love us
That's our guarantee
We'll bow together on the count of three
Me and my girl
My girl and me
We make the perfect pair
We've got that savoir-faire
Me and my girl
My girl and me
That's the best audition I've ever seen!
- Amazing! I weeped!
- Wept.
I wept!
- I wept!
- And not just regular weeping.
Theater weeping!
Amber Lee, what do you think?
Yes. Amber Lee, thoughts?
Wow...
We are so meant to be BFFs!
Wow! "Wow" is a word, right?
Right. Wow!
I just hope that the palpable chemistry surging between you and I right now like nuclear fusion won't in any way influence your decision towards our clearly superior audition.
How old are you?
Twelve.
I think I'm good.
And you, also!
Your dog...
Wow! Wow.
I know, right?
He's just saying hi.
Sharpay Evans of the New Mexico Evans. I'm a mega fan.
Oh, you are not!
So am!
I am gonna tweet about you right now.
Shut up! I follow your tweets.
She did! She tweeted!
Okay, I don't know how we're gonna decide. You're amazing!
All this and a grade school diploma.
And you, amazing! Wow.
I would be excited to work with either one of you and your dogs.
And can I just say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Because Broadway...
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, real people are watching.
- Wow.
- Me, too.
I am just so excited to be performing on the Great White Way!
Not that I don't love all colors.
Well, I know both these talented dogs want to work with you.
But only one can be in the show.
- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.
How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals?
Wait! How about we work with both dogs during rehearsals!
That way I could see which one I work best with.
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!
Can I just say how totally great I think you are?
You do, and I'll never wash my ears again.
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't because I just thought of it, but I think they loved you!
I like the way you think!
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.
It totally shows.
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant give you my phone number.
If there's anything that you need, you just let me know, okay?
We girls gotta stick together, right?
- Here.
- Wow.
I mean, this is actually your number!
It looks like any ordinary number, but it's not. It's yours!
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Can you believe it?
You were great!
Boi was great.
This new strategy just might work.
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?
She inspires me. There. I said it.
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.
- How do you know?
- Easy. I don't do rejection.
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.
Oh! That's so nice of you.
And suggest that you give up now, while you still have your dignity.
Distant though it already might be.
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?
True, you have talent.
But you lack both the experience and the finesse to ever achieve the Holy Grail of possibility.
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.
I'm sorry. For a minute there you just bored me to death.
I have a foolproof strategy of getting what I want.
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.
All right, Boi. This foot. That foot.
Good boy! Yeah!
Okay, let's try our next one. Stay.
Catch your tail. Catch your tail!
Good! Yeah, good.
Sit. Stay.
We are so going to take them on.
I'm not gonna let some hobbit get in my way.
And, look.
All Boi can do is think about how horrible that other little mangy dog was.
If you want success so badly, then you will get it.
All you need is one shot to make it happen.
Yeah, and this is my shot.
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,
"and look how well it did for him."
Doing this is all I've ever dreamed about, especially since
I already have everything else.
Well, there's still humility.
What's wrong with being confident?
Confidence is when you know you're good.
Arrogance is when you think others know you're good.
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as good as I think everyone thinks I am without them knowing
I know they think it.
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.
If my professor loves my film, he talks about it.
Then there's a buzz, then it gets in a festival, then it gets distribution, then I'm signing a studio deal, then I'm getting an Oscar.
I always knew I wanted to be an actress the first time I produced and performed the entire production of Snow white.
Full dance, musical numbers, handmade costumes.
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.
Everyone in that pre-school worshipped me.
I just want to wake up every morning and be onstage.
Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.
A Girl's Best Friend!
And you are all amazing.
- No, you are!
- Him or me?
- You!
- No, you!
Me? Okay!
And heading our superb cast, we are thrilled to welcome one of the biggest stars around,
Amber Lee Adams!
Oh, stop!
- Yes!
- Guys, come on.
Can I just say that this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
Broadway's not like film or television, because with Broadway, people can see if you write your lines on your hands!
All right. Let's rehearse.
I want everybody downstairs with piano, rehearsing the music for the opening number.
Amber Lee and Judith,
I want you onstage so we can block that first scene.
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!
All right. Let's start with Boi.
Let's go!
What a perfect goodbye party.
Thank you, Mom!
I can't believe my little girl is going out into the world on her own for the first time.
I have to, Mom. And who knows, maybe I'll find fame and fortune!
Actually, reverse that.
- Why is that funny?
- Well...
Because you'd rather have the...
I'll explain later. Just keep going.
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Pick it up! Go, go!
A star is about to be born!
Shelby!
Oh!
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.
Gasp!
Actually, that's a stage direction.
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."
Simple mistake. Keep going.
Shelby! Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.
I wish I could just pack you up in a widdle doggie bag.
Okay. Let's get Countess in there and continue.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Shelby and I will both be here when you get back.
You're killing me.
Oh!
That is adorable!
You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?
Any place that doesn't want you,
I don't wanna be.
Let's see what New York has in store for us together!
Good.
Let's talk about the scene a bit, and we'll do it again.
And both dogs, great work!
Shelby! Trying to run away with my boarding pass won't change the fact that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.
6:00 a.m.
What's going on? The dog.
What is this?
Somebody, please.
The dog is licking me.
All right, all right. Get me the other dog!
Sorry. What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go, go!
- Why is she twirling?
- What is she doing?
- Gill?
- Roger!
Figure out what's going on with the dog.
It's not helping me.
- Not helping, people!
- Meanwhile, get the other dog!
Sorry. What can you do?
There's only one thing that breaks my heart.
Leaving Shelby behind.
Okay, go!
Oh, hey!
How is this helping? Really.
Am I the only one bothered by this?
Gill?
Okay, everybody, that's 10!
I'll admit you're good. But we're better.
Give up!
Give up?
Not until there's a Broadway marquee with a picture of my dog so big you can walk by and smell his puppy breath!
I have to take the dogs for a nap.
Union rules.
Thank you.
- You break first.
- No, you break first.
Oh!
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah! Yes, they are!
I just wanted to tell you something.
This is my show.
I'm America's sweetheart.
They're paying to see me, not you two over-bred fur balls.
So, until I can figure out a way to get rid of you, you better watch your step, otherwise you'll find out the real meaning of going home in a doggie bag.
This film is cutting together really well.
Do I look amazing?
- The camera loves you.
- I know!
Oh, no! My dad's video-chatting me.
He thinks I live in a penthouse.
I can't let him see that I live in a tiny studio in a filthy tenement.
With a boy in my room!
A boy, by the way, that has no money, and lives in a tinier studio, and who, apparently, has never heard of the word "maid-service"! No offense.
What of that could possibly offend me?
Oh, my! Oh, my!
I don't know. Hyperventilating!
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Come on.
Come on. Hurry!
- All right, scoot over. Okay, go, go.
- Okay, I gotta get this. Stop!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, princess! How's my little girl?
Overpaying for everything and yelling at total strangers.
You're practically a native.
Hey, where are you?
That view is spectacular.
Well, there's hardly a penthouse in the city that doesn't have a spectacular view!
So, you the toast of Broadway?
Daddy, you know how I feel about carb references.
Just a little concerned, sweetie.
The last time no one's heard from you for this long was when you found out your gold card wasn't actually made of gold.
Well, I've been busy with rehearsals.
Outstanding! You got into the show?
Well, it doesn't quite work like that.
It's complicated.
But I know it's gonna work out.
Sharpay, is there something you're not telling me?
You remember the deal, right?
If things aren't working out...
I know, I know. I have one month to get in the show, and then...
Two weeks, sweetie.
You have two weeks left.
You're sure everything's okay?
It's fine, Daddy.
Well, okay. We miss you, angel.
Miss you, too.
I love you!
Boi has to get that role. I can't go home.
Not as a failure.
I need some sort of subtle, visibly crushing advantage over Roger.
Look, why not just trust Boi is talented, that you've trained him well,
- and let fate take it from there.
- Fate?
Fate gave a girl in my graduating class one long eyebrow.
I can't trust fate.
Some matters you just have to take into your own hands.
What do you mean you forgot my bottled water?
Well, I was going to get those magazines that you said you wanted from across town, and I got hit by a bike messenger.
So I went to the hospital for, like, just one second to get these stitches.
And meanwhile, I had no water!
I will get it for you right now.
Now I've had to drink tap!
- I am so sorry.
- "I am so sorry."
- I will do better.
- Forget it, okay?
Aside from catching some shade from the shadow cast by your madam's apple, you're of no use to me.
You're... fired!
God!
Amber Lee?
Oh, wow! You look so cute, Sharpie!
- Sharpay.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
So, tell me, what's on your mind?
I just saw your assistant leave in tears.
She's not my assistant. She quit.
No wonder she was crying.
Yeah, I don't think she even really cared.
Next time I should probably just hire a best friend instead.
Wait!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
What are you thinking that I should be thinking?
I could help you out until you replace her.
That is what I was thinking about thinking.
Of course this can't, in any way, affect your decision of which dog gets the starring role.
Oh, it won't.
I couldn't live with myself if I thought I did anything unfair.
You have my word. Hey, I know!
How about dinner?
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?
Get me a reservation for two at someplace fantastic.
Then call my agent, have her meet me.
Right. Sure.
Oh. I won't forget this. And I promise, it won't be because you're helping me if I happen to take a little extra liking to Girl.
- Boi.
- You changed it.
I like that even better.
Oh, and can you take my mic down to the sound guy
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.
You're the best.
Amber Lee says the wire is hurting her scalp.
Personally,
I think she's using the wrong shampoo, but she's the star, and you know,
I don't wanna say anything.
You're hot.
Excuse me?
You're hot.
Okay. Even though theater lighting highlights my natural skin tones, thank you for noticing, that's a little rude, don't you think?
No. Your mic's hot.
It means it's on.
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that, it means it's on and it's going through the entire theater.
Well, you could have led with that part, thank you.
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!
You're hot.
Then she asked me to help her out after her assistant quit.
And after I suggested it.
Are you sure this is wise?
I'm sorry. Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.
It's perfect. Amber Lee will see that she and I are exactly alike, we'll become BFFs, she'll make sure Boi gets the role, then his fame becomes my fame!
I mean, this is the advantage
I've been waiting for!
Isn't it more like taking advantage?
And my father thought
I couldn't do this in a month.
It's turning out better than I imagined.
Hello?
Sure. Be right over.
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness. In here, quickly.
I just... I can't reach that.
Can't reach it?
Okay, it was a little bit of a test.
Only a true friend would come all the way down here at this hour and help me with something like that.
- So, I passed?
- Yes.
- But, seriously, the purse.
- Okay.
Thank you.
All right, here's your bag.
Here's your other bag.
Oh, and don't forget your photo shoot.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
You must be at that photo shoot to make sure I look as fabulous as you always do.
- Are you serious?
- Serious? You're now also my stylist.
You have to tell me all your secrets.
Okay, gotta go.
"Life is so strange.
"Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune,
"and instead, we find love."
Hey! How about dinner?
Split some egg rolls at Wok This Way?
Can't. I have to highlight script changes for Amber Lee, then highlight her hair.
Highlight of my night!
Okay.
But I miss spending time with you.
And you did promise to shoot some more stuff for my film.
You know, what I'm doing is important, too.
Oh.
For a minute there, you sounded like Amber Lee.
"Good to see you. Good to see you. Good to see you. Good to see you."
Bad news. My maid quit.
So, here's a list of chores.
Chores?
And I want to talk to you about Boi.
But you have to promise it'll stay between us.
Okay.
I think I'm going to ask the director to give Boi the part.
- Are you serious?
- Almost positive!
You won't be sorry.
Trust me. I know.
Oh!
Oh, no.
There are some changes for the blocking in the dog scene, top of act two.
Countess can learn these in no time.
She's got a memory like a digital hard drive.
- No bark and all mega-bite.
- Funny.
I need to find Sharpay and make sure she gets them.
Boi is doing the first run-through tomorrow.
I'd be more than happy to deliver them to her.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharpay?
That's unfortunate.
And I've been here ever since.
Life is so strange.
Shelby and I travel halfway across the country to find fame and fortune, and instead, we find love.
Lenore, I have something to ask you.
We have something to ask you.
He's supposed to come from the other side of the stage with the ring box!
Yeah, sorry. We changed that blocking.
What happened?
What is wrong with this dog?
And is he okay? It's not his fault.
He's just a little dog! He's just so sweet.
Okay, everybody.
Let's break for a few.
That's 10, people.
I'm aware. I know.
I don't know what happened.
We sent out the script changes, but Boi didn't do them.
But I didn't get any new script change.
I looked everywhere last night to give them to you.
I guess working for Amber Lee has its drawbacks.
- You did this on purpose.
- That's a complete...
Yeah.
You're threatened because you know
Amber Lee is gonna choose Boi.
Not after today she won't.
Okay. Countess doesn't have half the personality that Boi has.
And Boi doesn't have half the talent that Countess has.
Isn't that right, girl?
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Has anyone seen Boi?
- No, sorry.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Anyone seen Countess?
- Nope.
- Countess?
- Boi?
- Hello?
- Boi and Countess are gone!
Gone! What?
We have to find them!
Wait, where are you now?
Leaving the theater.
We're gonna look around here.
Can you look near the apartment in case they come back?
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Just keep me posted, and I'll call you if they show up.
Okay. What if they were dog-napped?
Do you think we pushed them too hard?
- I don't know.
- Countess is über-sensitive.
She cries watching dog food commercials!
I just hope they're not huddled in a corner somewhere.
Afraid, lost, at each other's throats!
You knowyou love me
I know you care
Just shout whenever
And I'll be there
You are my love
You are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'
"We're just friends,"
What are you sayin'?
Said, "There's another"
And looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine
I'm goin' down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby...
What if we never see them again?
They're smart dogs.
Smarter than we are. They'll be okay.
Oh, no. It's my dad. I just...
I can't deal with him right now.
- Countess!
- Boi!
Hi!
I missed you!
You're back!
It's amazing.
They came back to the apartment.
Thanks, Peyton.
Oh, and Sharpay, it's still on.
Bring it.
You're back! Yeah!
You bad, bad boy, Boi.
I'm just glad you're okay.
He and Countess had an adventure.
She probably coaxed him into joining a doggy gang or something.
We'd better check him over for tattoos.
Are you so lost in what you're doing that you haven't noticed?
Noticed what?
Boi and Countess are in love.
- With what?
- Each other.
No way!
You're right. He's dilated.
He's got puppy dog eyes.
How could I have not noticed puppy love?
Well, there's a lot you haven't noticed.
Like lately, you've had no time for me.
You know, I was counting on you to help me finish my film.
I said I would, and I will.
Things have become complicated.
It's not that complicated.
Amber Lee is using you, and you're letting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No!
Where's the Sharpay that was determined not to go back home because she didn't want to work for anyone?
Why don't you tell me?
Working for someone, that's where.
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.
You've sold your soul to get Boi in that show, rather than trust in the dog that you raised.
Even worse, you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go.
And maybe you're jealous because I'm on my way up with a new famous friend, and you're just a student making a film about someone else's life instead of your own.
You don't have to be in my movie anymore.
I get it.
You have more important things to do.
Fine!
One question?
What happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition
I saw through my lens that first day you got here?
I mean, that girl knew she was special.
That girl knew she didn't have to do any of this to succeed.
What happened to her, huh?
Hello.
Oh, and Sharpay, can you remember to invite as many people from my fan club as possible to opening-night dress rehearsal?
I want the theater filled with people who love me as much as you do!
Sure.
You know what would be great after all this work?
A long, luxurious spa bath.
Sounds amazing!
Thank you.
Run one for me, will you?
And then you can finish these.
You're the best!
- This is a big change.
- Huge change!
I don't think you're hearing me!
New Jersey can hear you!
The name of the show is
A Girl's Best Friend.
I didn't tell you to change the title.
But you want the best friend written out!
Oh. Right. Change the title!
How are we supposed to get rid of one of our main characters a day before our dress rehearsal in front of an audience?
The audience is coming to see me.
You change that dog's part to a bark and play dead, or I don't go on.
Let's be reasonable here.
I'm a star. I don't have to be reasonable!
Look, those mangy mutts are bothering me almost as much as their disposable owners.
I actually had to have one of them clean my toilet just to keep her away.
She thinks she's an actress.
She acts all right.
She acts just like every other obsessed fan.
Wait.
Everything you said... You were...
Right?
Yes.
Thank you.
You must think I'm a total fool.
No. Not total.
Maybe my dad was right.
Maybe I'm not ready for this.
Maybe I should just go home and... work for him.
I mean, did I really think
I was just gonna come to Broadway and be a star?
Yes.
Because that's exactly how you think.
It's perfect.
Perfect is so hard.
And it doesn't prepare you for disappointment.
Well, if it helps, you still look adorable, even when you're disappointed.
Yeah, that doesn't help.
Look, Sharpay.
There is not a marquee big enough or lights bright enough to contain the fame you're gonna have.
Yeah, but not the way I've been doing it.
Like you said, the Sharpay you know isn't the Sharpay that has become the Sharpay that is this Sharpay.
Did all the Sharpays follow that?
I sacrificed integrity for opportunity.
I let someone insecure distract me.
I cleaned a bathroom!
But worst of all,
I disappointed someone I care about.
I forgot what was really important to me.
I lost track of what I want.
And other than maid service and a canopy bed, what is it that you want?
A fair fight. A lifetime in the spotlight.
And maybe you'll still let me be in your movie.
I guess.
Okay, I can't say I approve of dating beneath your station in life, but fine. Go.
Hey, I got your text.
What's C-Q-M-T-W-I-L-G-T mean?
"Come quick. Major trouble.
Wow, I look great today." Duh.
I really should have gotten that.
Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.
A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young alive on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?
Okay, she's what you think.
Listen, I don't care if her parents had to tie beefjerky around her neck just to get the family dog to play with her, as long as Countess is at her side on that stage.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
She wants the part of the dog written out completely!
- That's not fair!
- Too far.
Well, I am 12, remember?
Roger, we've been fighting the wrong battle, each other.
We need to form an alliance and work against a common enemy.
- Zits?
- Amber Lee.
Trust me, the zit battle is one you won't win.
But what can we do?
Tonight is the dress rehearsal.
The audience will be filled with members of Amber Lee Adams' fan club.
I know, I saw the tweet.
Fine. Yes, I follow her, too.
Okay, we need to show people exactly who Amber Lee really is.
It's time someone taught her how to behave in the theater.
I like the way you think.
It's manipulative, but for a good cause.
Tell me what you need me to do.
- Hey, Amber Lee, I...
- Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you all day.
Oh. Sorry, my phone must have been turned off.
Without asking me first?
I just wanted to say good luck.
You know, I know you chose Countess for this performance tonight, and I'm fine with that.
Well, it was nothing personal, but your phone was shut off, so I couldn't talk to you about it.
I guess that won't happen again, will it?
We're good.
Hug? Okay.
Hello, everyone. I'm Gill, the director.
And I'm Neal, the under-appreciated writer.
And we are thrilled that you're here for our first performance in front of an audience.
Does everyone here know how to applaud?
Okay, how about the balcony up there?
- Okay, now.
- Can you hear us? You're good!
Will somebody please control these wannabe werewolves?
Hello? People?
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to do a show with dogs!
I'm the star, not them! Stage people?
Could somebody please put these rats with rabies out of my misery? Anyone!
Finally, you idiot! What took so long?
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten fur bags out of here!
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.
You think all those boring freaks with no lives came to worship two no-name mutts?
I don't think so! I'm the one they love!
Me! They came to see...
I knew I forgot to tell you something.
Careful, your mic's on.
You did this to me. You ruined me!
News flash! You ruined you!
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!
The only reason you even wanted to be my friend is so I'd choose your dog!
No, no. At first, I idolized you, even more than myself, which isn't easy.
But you're not at all what I thought you were.
You and I are exactly alike.
Except I don't enjoy letting people down.
I don't use people to feel better about myself.
And I definitely don't wear yellow and orange in the same week, let alone the same outfit, okay?
Maybe I did think you and I were alike, but not anymore.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed if someone thought I was like you.
Well, I quit!
And without me, there's no show.
Now neither one of your furry little friends will have their shot and neither will you.
Blame her!
I'm sorry. Someone had to say it.
I'll go talk some sense into her.
You, out of this theater right now.
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.
No. You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.
You win.
That's not what it feels like.
- Hey. Can I come in?
- Sure.
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Move home where there's enough room for my pores to open, spend months in the spa getting this layer of New York grime off my skin, and mostly...
...miss you.
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.
I already talked to my dad.
I guess I'm gonna start...
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.
What about your dream of being a star?
It's still there.
It's just a little bit more of a dream than a reality.
- You know what today is?
- What?
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.
Well, so then you still have eight hours.
This isn't how my movie's supposed to end.
I guess it is.
This is Sharpay.
Uh-huh.
Sure. No, no. I'll be there.
That was the stage manager.
They want me to come to the theater and clear out Boi's things.
I can go with you if you want.
I want.
And, so, Amber Lee has quit.
- Gone.
- Kaput.
The producers feel, without a star, we can't open.
The time it would take to find someone who could learn the role and do it well might take weeks, and it would cost too much to keep the production going.
But we want you all to know, it was great almost working with you.
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.
Thank you for your hard work.
We are so, so sorry, people.
Wait! Wait, it's not over. It's not over.
Look, it doesn't have to be.
Look, there is someone who knows the part by heart and who is amazing.
All right, maybe she's not a star yet, but she will be.
This show will make her one.
Just watch.
Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.
Boi, go mark. Go mark. Good!
Okay, stay. Stay.
I love when you use that accent, but...
We're not supposed to be in here.
Okay, now let's do the scene where the character Lenore thinks she's lost everything and you come over to console her.
Come on.
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.
Nothing is working out the way
I planned it.
I got something inside ofme
Something that needs to be heard
Deep down a voice is guiding me
Hidden emotions have stirred
Why have I let others lead the way
When all along I know what it is
I want to say
Whatever it is
I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want
Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
I thought I had a perfect plan
Where I would wind up on top
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"
Next thing you know, I'm a flop
Why did I ever play this silly game?
I got to shake up the rules
And stake my claim
Whatever it is
I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want
Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
What if I missed my window?
What if I blew my shot?
What if the only chance
I was going to get
I already got?
I'm not ready to turn the page
Until I'm on stage in a show
No, nobody move
I've got something to prove
Don't you know?
Whatever it is
I'll do it
I'm the answer to your prayers
Whatever you want
Stop looking
Nobody else compares
Whatever you've seen before
I'll give you so much more
You'll be totally impressed
I'm New York's best kept secret
Well, did I tell you?
- Amazing!
- Amazing! You're amahzing!
You have more depth, range and tone in one note than Amber Lee had in her entire surgically reshaped body.
We'll promote you as
"The girl who we're promoting."
The producers will love it.
Wait, wait. What are you saying?
We need you to save the show.
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.
- A gamble.
- A risk. Did I do "risk" already?
You did. And, true, we did fire you.
- He fired you.
- But now I'm un-firing you.
- Can we do that?
- Just did.
- Good for us!
- We need you.
What do you say?
Um... I guess we could take the costumes in a few sizes and get everyone used to hearing the songs sung on key, but there's one condition.
Boi and Countess split the role of Shelby the dog equally.
Done!
We've a lot of work to do, people!
- Are we crazy?
- Crazy for theater!
- Let's rehearse!
- Let's rehearse, people!
Where are those wonderful dogs?
- Thank you.
- This is it.
The chance you've been waiting for.
- What if I'm not ready for this?
- Oh, you're ready.
"Ready" isn't as ready as you are.
- What if I'm horrible?
- Won't happen.
- What if I forget my lines?
- Impossible.
- What if I...
- Everything in your life so far has been leading you to this moment.
Your moment. Embrace it.
I'm scared.
Finally.
Let's rehearse, people!
Over here!
Mr. Pinto, Mr. Pinto, over here. Mr. Pinto, look this way.
I've got a feeling inside of me
Running all through my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world about to change
It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights
So light those lights
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I could be
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And ride this ride
The rest of my life
I want fabulous
That is my simple request
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring to help me get along
I need a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
A summer like never before
I want more!
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best
She needs something inspiring to help her get along
She needs a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?
Absolutely...
Not!
English - US - SDH
- Who is it?
- Room service.
Ls it eggs?
I don't know, sir. I didn't order it.
You want some water with that?
No, no. No, I don't.
Looks like you had a night.
They look perfect.
Get out.
I intended to bring that to the attention of a member of staff.
I had some difficulty getting it to open.
It's the little key on the door key, sir.
Right.
I was looking for some nuts.
I tend to avoid alcohol.
When I can.
I don't speak Spanish.
Cuatro cincuenta. No change.
No, no, no, no, you're not listening.
I said the Pirates, not the Yankees.
It's going to be Roberto's year, I'm telling you.
Looking for Mr. Lotterman.
End of the room.
No, no, the Pirates.
You guys are going to be all over.
It's Roberto Clemente, man.
And by the way, I want to talk about...
Not now!
He's having the Friday crisis.
- You Kemp?
- Yeah.
He was expecting you yesterday.
We had some weather.
Yeah, I heard.
Big snow in New York.
He's still on a call. You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
What's all the fuss out front?
You came in the front?
We don't use that door.
Not when losjibaros pitch up.
What do they want?
I don't know.
Some fucked idea of a living wage.
They've been out there on and off for months.
By the way, my name's Sala.
Bob Sala, staff photographer.
Pleased to meet you, Bob.
Yeah.
He's off.
You might want to try another subservient knock.
Yeah.
Kemp.
Don't notice the wig.
Yeah. What?
If you're who I think you are, you better sit down.
You find it a little bright in here?
I'd take them off, but I have a medical condition.
What do you mean, you're blind?
Conjunctivitis, sir.
The old red eye, huh?
You arrive at a very, very trying time, Mr. Kemp.
One of those days stacking up.
So, why don't we cut through the niceties and just get right to it, huh?
That's how I like to proceed.
Okay. Your resume here.
Very impressive CV.
Yeah.
You worked your way up some interesting titles.
I really like the "fluent Spanish."
Wow.
This CV is a bunch of bullshit.
Ls it?
This is two days on the wire.
A day dead. We don't have it.
What is the matter with Moburg?
He's about as useful as a dug-up body.
You see, the problem with this newspaper, Mr. Kemp, is that I am among many who don't enjoy reading it.
We have an ailing circulation, and I just have to look around this building to understand why.
Lack of commitment and too much self-indulgence.
So what I'm looking for is some enthusiasm, some energy, some fresh blood.
And the question that I'm asking myself is how much alcohol is usual in yours.
My fresh blood?
How much do you drink?
I suppose at the upper end of "social."
I'm poised to give up.
Well, Puerto Rico may not be the best place on Earth to do that.
Don't look so anxious, Mr. Kemp.
I wouldn't have paid for your hotel if I hadn't already hired you.
But this is not the Last Chance Saloon, and I do not need another heavy drinker.
Which I perceive, from the condition of eyeballs behind glasses, that you might very well qualify as.
This is a medical condition, Mr. Lotterman.
I know it might look like something else, but this is a...
Looks like a fuckin' hangover.
Does it?
Come here.
That's the kind of commitment I like to see in a man.
Determination, balanced with appropriate humanity.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Which side do you dress, Kemp?
I beg your pardon?
Politics.
I kind of hang in the middle.
This is a schizoid society, Kemp.
They got two languages, two flags, two loyalties, two anthems.
We bring them stuff they never had.
They either hate it or they want more of it.
It's a reluctant part of America.
It's like an England with tropical fruit.
Bob.
Just the man I wanted to see.
This is Paul Kemp.
He's joining us from New York.
Yeah, yeah, we already met.
That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.
And this is Mr. Hubert, accounting.
Listen, do me a favor, will you?
Show him around, the dos and don'ts.
Introduce him to some of the guys.
I'll take him up to Al's.
The hell you will.
You take him to the library.
You pull out some volumes.
I want him to get a sense of the paper.
You know, make some notes, go back a few years, paying particular attention to bowling alleys.
There's bowling and bowling alleys.
Very big here. They're up like mushrooms.
A new one premieres every week.
- Been to Puerto Rico before?
- No.
You're going to fall right into it.
There's a boom on here, Kemp.
It's an open door.
You play it right, you can surf the place.
What do you know about horoscopes?
Nothing.
Well, if I can write one, you can.
So it's every day with a special "Star's Star" featured Saturday with Betty Grable and Neil Sedaka, things like that.
So here, everything you need is right there.
It's called "Madam La Zonga Predicts."
What happened to Madam La Zonga?
He got canceled.
What do you mean, fired?
They raped him to death.
They raped him to death?
There are very few places on this island
I decline to visit, but the toilets frequented by sailors on the west side of Candado Pier is one.
They raped him to death?
La Zonga died in a cubicle.
Say, you're not artistic, are you, Kemp?
Oh, no.
You might want to rethink those menthol cigarettes.
They don't do a thing for you.
Come by the house.
I will.
I like your stuff.
The cuttings you sent to Lotterman.
It's good writing.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
One more floor!
They put in automated packing machines about six months ago.
They mechanized almost everything.
There used to be 50 guys down here.
Now there's five.
Hence happiness in the street.
Souvenir, day one.
Here's to pretty women with filthy thoughts.
- Want a burger?
- No.
- Burger?
- No, thanks.
Try it. Dos.
So how was the induction?
Somewhat fraught.
No disrespect, Paul, but he didn't have a lot of choice.
You know how many people applied for the job?
One. You.
Ls that right?
Even then, I thought I'd blown it.
Zeroed in on my weakest spot.
Which is what?
Two and a half unpublished novels and references of equal fiction.
You're a novelist.
In a manner of speaking.
Can't even get read.
So I figured I'd do some words for money, see how it's looking in a year or two.
At El Star?
Hate to tell you this on the way in, but this publication's on its way out.
And as far as I'm concerned, it can't come soon enough.
Not going to happen.
You like a little vonga on that?
I'll give you 1 3 to 2 this thing's over by June.
They're going to cut the cord.
Then why put in all the new machinery?
Precisely my point, and he can't answer it.
Well, like I'm tired of arguing the obvious.
Come on. Let's eat.
Now, I got to go and see a man about a horse.
Good to meet you, Paul.
Another night unfolds over Old San Juan.
You been here long?
Too long.
This place is like someone you fucked and they're still under you.
Why don't you quit?
Life's full of exits.
Because I'm waiting for it to collapse so I get the payoff.
Three grand redundancy puts me in Mexico.
Don't look left.
That's an introduction you don't want to have.
Who's he?
Living example of everything that's wrong with this paper.
His name's Moburg.
Our Crime and Religious Affairs correspondent.
Lotterman can't fire him because he never sees him.
He's rarely out in daylight.
Looks like he enjoys a drink.
The entire substructure of his brain is eaten away with rum.
I'm telling you, this enterprise is doomed.
There's maybe three or four professionals in the building running the entire show.
Wait a minute. Who is Hal Sanderson?
In the library. Who's he?
He used to work for the paper.
Now he's what he says he is.
A PR consultant.
Selling this place street by street to the Yankees.
Keeps a greasy little bastard of a contact called Segurra.
I saw him. We didn't meet.
Wouldn't bother.
Piss on the make.
The boy, Segurra, is at the property wickedness.
I'm not sure where Sanderson fits.
But Sanderson's worth cultivation.
He's got some good connections.
He's good for some freelance.
This place is depressing me beyond belief tonight.
You're at Plage Xanadu, right?
Come on. I'll give you a ride.
I was thinking, if you need somewhere,
I got a room for rent.
Not the best address in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.
60 a month.
Sounds inviting. I might remention that.
Meanwhile, bleed it dry.
Sir...
I was hoping for a swim.
The pool is closed tonight.
Really? Why? What's going on?
It's a Union Carbide party.
It's a private function.
Sorry.
I didn't realize anyone was there.
I thought it was just floating.
Lt is just floating.
You doing what I'm doing?
I don't think so.
What are you doing?
Escaping the dreadful party.
I just snuck out and unzipped.
Well, that's very courageous of you.
I thought maybe you were a mermaid.
They tell me the coast is infested with them.
I'm from Connecticut.
My boyfriend's making a speech.
Takes exactly 21 minutes.
Well, then I guess it's pointless, me inviting you for a drink.
What you got?
No, I mean at the bar.
Pointless.
I'd better go before they wonder where I went.
Wait a minute. What's your name?
Let's keep that a secret.
I don't even know it.
Well, then you'll keep it even better.
What about your star sign?
I'm an experienced astronomer.
Could try Pisces.
The fish.
Oh, God.
Why did she have to happen?
Just when I was doing so good without her.
What would you say you like most about Puerto Rico?
The bowling alleys and the casinos.
Course, she likes the duty free.
Well, the more you spend, the more you save.
Have you seen a lot of the island?
We don't leave the hotel.
Lt isn't safe.
But you're having fun?
Oh, yeah! A lotta, lotta fun!
Have some fun with a fucking Luger.
These alleys are magnets to the glutton.
They come off the boats like locusts.
Beasts of obesity.
Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow.
The great whites.
Probably the most dangerous creatures on Earth.
There's your baby.
Walt and his woman.
Bowling alleys isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Tread it till the snow melts, then join the exodus.
Red light!
Looking for Kemp.
Too many adjectives, too much cynicism.
Nobody wants what's wrong with the place, they want to read about what's right.
- It's a rewrite.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.
And while you're at it, you might want to rewrite the title and call it
"Ten Things That I Love About Puerto Rico."
So, how's the sobriety coming along?
I'm cutting down.
By that,
I assume you mean the size of the bottles.
How does anybody drink 1 61 miniatures?
You're averaging 93 miniatures a week.
What, do they stock the place four times a day?
Are they not complimentary?
No, Mr. Kemp, they are not.
And neither is wine and long-distance phone calls.
So, as of Monday, you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.
And what exactly brings you into the building?
Don't hazel me.
I got the X-rays back.
I got less than a week to live.
Hazel you? What are you talking about, you Swedish twerp?
You know, it may have crossed what's left of your mind that I have a newspaper to run here, that we have something called news going on out there.
But as far as you're concerned,
I might as well look out of the fuckin' window!
What are you doing here?
This is a newspaper.
There's nothing here for you.
Two of the best scoops you ever had came out of my brain.
And you better moderate your language or I'll go elsewhere.
Elsewhere where?
You couldn't get work as a fly repellent.
You're worthless, Moburg.
The last onion in the jar.
Don't push me, Lotterman.
I'm dangerous when pushed.
I know why you're here.
It's payday.
But in your case, deferred on a permanent basis.
You're fired!
You can't fire me.
You owe me money.
And you better pay it, or I'll come through the roof and turn this place into an insurance claim.
Are you threatening me?
Hey, guys, let's take it easy.
You want to suffer some voodoo?
You twerp!
Eat the death pill, Lotterman!
Come on, we're walking.
Did you hear what he said to me?
This guy's my blood pressure.
This guy's going to kill me.
And I want the negative of that picture destroyed!
I don't want that animal in this building again.
He is hygienically unacceptable.
Did you see the side of his nose?
Blackheads like Braille.
They should have him put down.
Moburg is history.
He's out of here at the earliest opportunity.
And the earliest opportunity is you.
You understand what I'm saying, Kemp?
I think I get the drift.
I want you to immerse yourself into this paper,
'cause you got the talent and I think you got the will.
You make it grow and you grow right along with it.
I'm not best placed to do that.
You think it's my intention to keep you on horoscopes and rewrites and bowling alleys?
Matter of fact, I'm gonna move you right now.
Take a cab to the airport.
The mayor of Miami's coming in.
Make him sound nice.
I want a picture and an interview.
Make it work, Paul.
You leaving us already?
I'm moving into an apartment if this mayor guy ever shows up.
They keep changing "delayed" to "delayed."
You want to have some breakfast?
Little lobster on the beach?
Twenty minutes away.
Sounds inviting, but I got to wait for the mayor.
Isn't coming.
Canceled.
That's not what it says on the board.
Lt will in a minute.
I just called Miami.
Come on, let's have some breakfast.
I got a couple things might interest you.
I better call in.
You can call from the car.
All right. Yeah, thanks.
There's only two of those on the island.
Maybe three.
No one told me it was so pretty here.
God's idea of money.
You know what makes this place a gold mine?
Something that doesn't exist.
How's that?
Land.
There isn't enough of it.
Those who know how to get it get the gold.
Chenault?
Paul's joining us for breakfast.
Looks like it's gonna be a lunch.
This is Chenault.
You two know each other?
I don't know,
I thought maybe we met on the plane.
I don't think so.
I flew Boyfriend Airlines.
Tell me, do you like lobster, Paul?
You know what, I might not have time today.
I didn't realize the drive was gonna take so long.
How much time you got?
In 1 5 minutes, I'm late.
I'll cut up a pineapple.
You might want to put on some clothes.
She sunbathes in the nude.
A few of the over-tanned locals tend to treat it as a tourist attraction.
Doesn't surprise me.
I mean that in a very tasteful way.
It's a private beach.
They shouldn't be here.
Sit down, Paul, sit down.
We'll grab you a cab.
His name's Harry.
Got the idea from a book.
Paul, I wanted to talk, because I'm looking for someone who can assimilate contradictory points of view and make them into one voice.
You're a novelist, right?
Who told you that?
Oh, please. Newspapers are full of gossip.
I'm looking for someone who's good with words, next day, you turn up.
And 'cause I believe in good luck,
I thought maybe you were it.
What I need is someone with the right kind of eyes.
For looking at what?
Looking at that.
An ocean of money.
Hey, you made it.
Door at the end.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey. Just give me two minutes.
Walk right in.
All right.
I was trying to get the place shipshape before you arrived.
Adolf Hitler Speaks?
Not mine. Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.
Moburg lives here?
He keeps his uniform here.
I never see him from one month's end to the next.
So, you can see, it's quite spacious.
Don't look in the kitchen.
The water's off.
There's a problem with the valve.
Thought you said you had a TV.
I said I kind of have a TV.
The guy across the alley has a TV, I have binoculars.
His wife's deaf.
With the window open, you hear every word.
Here it comes.
Water's coming up.
I noticed you had some chickens in the bedroom.
Cockerels.
Yeah, I'm sweating the grease out.
Don't worry about them,
I'm moving them to my room.
What do you do with them?
- You eat them?
- Eat them?
Nah. I don't eat them.
Come on, baby, come on!
Get in there, get in there!
Come on!
Hey, on a trade wind, my boy!
On a trade wind!
Come on, bump it up, there, Bobby.
Bump, bump, bump, bump. Yes, sir!
Hey. They call him El Monstruo.
Say he's never lost a fight in three years.
Come on, we're out of here.
Come on, rapido, rapido.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Come on. Go on.
I tell you, we were on a roll til that thing turned up.
That's $21 7.
Not bad.
$21 7 is a shitload of money.
Relatively a shitload.
They're expensive to train.
I've seen guys win 2,000, ten on North Beach.
Why didn't he take El Monstruo down there?
You're talking the environs of the Hilton Hotel.
They wear bowties and shiny shoes.
There's no hope for his kind of hat.
The question, again, is not one of goals.
We're for those goals.
It's one of means.
Were you claiming that the Eisenhower administration...
How long can this blizzard of shame go on?
Look at this ingrate besotted with his own righteousness.
Black is a very dark shade of white.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Nixon.
I can't listen to any more of this.
Lies like he breathes.
Imagine spending your entire life lying.
Holy Christ.
Never got worse.
The only eventuality worse than him is you know that one day, some filthy whore-beast is gonna show up, make him look like a liberal.
The only upside with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.
He's got the grin.
He ain't gonna win.
Irish guy's going to win.
But they'll never let him live.
How do you know that?
I do "horror-scopes."
Thought you said he never came here.
He's got filters.
What filters?
He goes over the wall at the Barcardi plant.
These filters are the last in line in the distillation process.
They contain more ethanol than rocket fuel.
What's it like?
A hand on the brain.
Off the scale.
470 proof.
No such thing as 470 proof alcohol.
Certainty you might be required to moderate.
No smoking in the extraction area, if you please.
Don't be ridiculous.
Not for the social drinker.
You want to quaff?
No.
Not right now. I got to write.
I got a deadline.
What's he writing?
He's lifting the stone on the American Dream.
Guayanilla Bay.
Oh, yeah. It's bad down there.
You might find such a topic attracts a limited readership.
Only need one.
Taking it to Lotterman.
Yeah. Did I hear somebody say "good luck"?
Yeah, I went down there this morning, he unfired me on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.
I'd like to bring something in to Lotterman.
Like a slide-action, "fuck you" gun.
Don't drink that here.
Just a nipperoo, old boy.
Quality test.
Man, slow-motion murder, just like they do in the movies.
See him flying back, fuckin' arms flapping in the air.
Okay, mother.
Look upon the last face you'll see this side of hell!
Bam!
Down he goes, morsels of vital organs spinning off into flesh orbit.
Bam!
There goes his asshole.
Bam!
There goes his dick.
Bam! Bam!
Fuck you, Lotterman!
You're in a B-fucking movie, and I am the death machine!
Shall we have some Adolf?
Definitely not.
On your way, on your way, Moburg.
Hey, we're expecting guests.
I thought you said he was writing a book.
Said I was writing an essay.
And it requires some shut mouth.
Don't waste your time on those junkyard losers.
This country was built on genocide and slavery.
We killed all the black guys that were here, and then we shipped in new black guys of our own, and then we brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.
Let's go.
You know it.
I am the religious correspondent.
Fuck off with your Jesus Police!
If the Bible's God's book, why didn't He give it to everyone?
"We give more money to parking meters than we do to kids to eat."
Don't read me like that.
I've done the research.
1 2,000-ton rust bucket went down in the bay full of hydrochloric acid.
Killed off everything in the sea.
Killed off the fishermen.
Their kids are picking garbage.
All right, don't get angry.
It's hot outside.
You want a Scotch?
Yeah.
Ten years ago... Five. Five years ago,
I might have said go after it.
Now I say go with it.
There's nothing you can change.
Sometimes you just got to spew over the side and keep rowing.
Lnto a nut brown sunset.
It's the land of multiple outrage.
Thousands trodden on before you wake up for breakfast.
That isn't news, it's a commercial reality.
And providing it isn't their sunset, nobody gives one-fifth of a fuck.
You underestimate your readers.
I don't think so.
You underestimate me.
You told me to make it work, that's what I want to do.
Wind down this La Zonga crap and make a newspaper.
Let me tell you some home truth.
This paper's been on its knees to a bank since the day it opened.
And like most every other newspaper on Earth, it's financed by its advertising.
And without advertising, not only is there no La Zonga, there's no paper to put it in, so, thus, there are one or two things that we don't write about.
In other words, nothing at all.
In one other word, discretion.
You're not a foreign correspondent in some far-flung foreign land, this is America.
This is Puerto Rico.
This is America.
You think some plumber from Normal, Illinois, saves up for 25 years to come here on a cruise ship to read about bad times in the sugar plantation?
They don't give a fuck!
The average guy don't rock the boat,
'cause he wants to climb aboard it.
And our readership is vividly average.
They don't care who the losers are.
They want to know who won.
Who won the bowls, who won the races, who won the pot at the slot machines.
Look at me, Kemp.
You're not sleeping, you're wide awake.
And this is the American Dream.
So many hotels, you can't see the sea.
You can see the sea by checking into the hotels.
Pay to see the sea?
What's the matter with that?
You're paying to be in the dream.
There's a thin veneer, Kemp, between the dream and the reality.
You wake them up and the people might start asking for their money back.
You're the boss.
Not quite.
The editorial policy of this newspaper is owned by the dream.
Oh, God.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, God, look at that.
Oh, God!
Hal?
No, no, I'm a friend of Hal's.
I was looking at his boat.
She's a sweet little beauty.
You been aboard?
No.
Great little island hopper.
We've all been down on her.
It's a wonderful experience.
You two are early.
You got lucky.
Yeah.
Did you meet?
Yeah, we got first names.
Art Zimburger, late of the U.S.
Marines, great friend of mine.
This is Mr. Paul Kemp, New York Times.
You're the writer.
Paul's a novelist.
New York Times?
He don't know one from the other.
Just go with it. This guy's key.
Key to what?
Key to the discussion we're about to have.
Look at those mothers.
Come with me, Kemp.
This is a private beach.
We are not on it.
No, but we are!
And what we do is private!
Now get the fuck gone!
Get the fuck out of here!
I see your face again, you're gonna have a 1 2-gauge shotgun telling you what to do.
Talking about Satan...
If there ever was a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.
The only way to come to terms with Communism is to destroy it.
Hit it before it hits us in a devastating democratic strike.
No more for the major.
They're looking for a man to push that button,
I am that man.
Yes, you are, honey.
You look ravishing, Chenault.
Thank you.
You need rescuing?
Don't take him away.
He's very entertaining.
We were discussing Cuba and, I don't know, we kind of veered off, didn't we?
Paul presents us with a somewhat liberal point of view.
There is no such thing as a liberal.
A liberal is a Commie with a college education thinking Negro thoughts.
Well, here's a fact for you.
76.4% of all Negroes are controlled from Moscow.
That's why Castro gets such an easy ride.
In my view, we ought to bomb
Cuba off the face of the Earth,
- let its people live in peace.
- Art.
Hey. Come on, let's eat.
Come on.
Who's the guy in the shades?
Segurra's Daddy.
It's who you're waiting for.
Thank you for my roses.
I didn't think you noticed.
Of course I noticed.
Paul, would you mind joining us?
How do you do, sir?
- Mr. Kemp.
- Nice to see you.
Mr. Kemp.
Okay.
Let me just start by saying this is a purely informal meeting.
And, incidentally, you don't worry about Lotterman, okay?
Lotterman?
What the hell's Lotterman got to do with The New York Times?
Mr. Kemp subs for a variety of newspapers.
Occasionally, he writes for the news.
What he does in his spare time is his affair.
That's how I like it.
We'd like you to do some writing for us.
So I gather.
About what?
In a sentence, we want to set something up, and have the public as our friends.
And there are a variety of ways we can do that.
Let me tell you how this kind of thing works, Paul.
Suppose, by way of example, you wanted to put up taxes by 5%.
The smart way of doing it is to float the idea of a 10%¤ hike.
Let them all shout about it, get themselves in a fuss, then you offer concessions.
"How about 7%?" "No way," they'll say.
"All right, let's stay friends and make a compromise at five."
Bingo.
They think they won something, you get the 5% you wanted in the first place.
Same thing applies to real estate.
You want to build five houses, you put in a planning application for 50.
How many do you want to build?
None.
We want to build one hotel.
Well, looking around this place,
I don't think anyone would notice.
Lt isn't in this place.
It's an island.
Sensitive for a variety of reasons we don't want to get into now.
Nobody wants a paradise choked with hotels, but everybody will be pleased to compromise at one.
This is going to require some clever writing in various carefully placed articles.
Isn't that kind of thing illegal?
If I may say, Mr. Kemp, that's an inappropriate comment.
Where's the island?
Can't tell you.
Not yet.
Discretion is paramount, Mr. Kemp.
If you want to join us, you'll have to sign some papers.
We're having a meeting tomorrow in Hal's office.
If you want to be part of what will be a very exciting project, come along.
There's a man outside in a funny little car for Paul.
Oh, yeah.
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.
I have to run.
Can't stay?
I hear the mermaids come out in the moonlight.
From the moment we met, I knew there was going to be something between us.
It's called her fiancé.
God, I'm so hopelessly and progressively in love.
Do not confuse love with lust, nor drunkenness with judgment.
You want my advice?
No. If it involves her, no, I don't.
Stay away from her.
And stay away from Sanderson.
You're way out of depth.
I got no brief for Sanderson or his pissy rip-off island.
I just want some apple blossom lipstick and fucks.
You are in total denial.
She's fucking someone else.
And as I understand it, about to be married to him.
You won't even make an invite.
I don't believe this.
We're right back where we started.
That is the same Cabrones we passed ten minutes ago.
We need directions.
Let's get in there and get something to eat.
No.
Please, no.
I haven't spent all day on a beach munching lobster with criminals, and I'm starving.
Two beers, two rums, one steak.
The kitchen is closed.
All right then, two beers and two rums.
And one steak.
Cerrado, Mister...
Yeah, but let's not bother me with that.
You got a sign down there saying, "Food til midnight," and I want a steak.
Girl of the swamp.
Which reminds me, we need a map.
You know what I think?
I think we're drinking too much rum.
There's no other way.
I'm getting double ashtray and double salt pot.
You got a Moburg bifocal.
Christ, this is heinous.
Imagine what it must be like to be an alcoholic.
You pay and you go.
I don't see a steak.
No steak.
What do you mean, no steak?
I think he means no steak.
The kitchen is closed.
I got no way of serving you.
Listen, you don't want to hear about my bad day, and I don't want no grave side out of you.
If you can't cook it, bring it like it is.
I'll eat it raw.
Two dollars, you pay and go.
Don't bother me.
You pay now, or I call the cops.
If you have no intention of serving me steak, why don't you do your best to fuck off.
Lt seems to me there's a bad vibe developing.
There are one or two oddities giving us the eye.
Don't get paranoid.
He's on the phone.
For what?
Ordering food in a restaurant?
Let's hope he's through to the FBI.
What's the matter?
What are you smiling at?
I'm not smiling.
I'm maintaining a casual face.
A man just walked in and has good reason for regarding us in a negative light.
- Us?
- Me.
And he's just seen me.
And he wants revenge on the white man.
The fuck are you talking about?
How about the one with the dent?
The one with the eye?
The very same.
Do we walk or run?
Walk.
I'll push the car.
Let's walk and hope he's happy.
Hey, Yankee.
Yankee!
Don't let me see headlights.
Please don't let me see headlights.
I just seen headlights.
Put your foot down.
Where exactly do you think I got it?
Can you go faster?
Going fast as I can.
Jesus Christ, man.
We're gonna be killed!
We're gonna be killed!
Hey!
Get ready to run.
Run in opposite directions.
Give me the brew!
Give me the fucking brew!
Paul!
Piece of luck. I just saw Moburg.
At least I think he saw us.
They got some kind of night court going.
He says we were animals on a rampage of drunken anarchy, poured gasoline on one of his cops.
Oh, my God, we're doomed.
You have something to say?
Yes, Your Honor, I do.
Firstly, this guy handcuffed to me, I never seen in my life.
And second, we'd like a translation of the charges.
You heard what they said?
With respect,
I heard people speaking Spanish.
What kind of language do you think we speak in this country, Mister?
He's not with us.
The cops attached him to get a conviction.
Did you leave the Café Cabrones without paying?
Did you set fire to the police officer, yes or no?
Unfortunately, Your Honor, he got in the way of our flame.
That's right.
No way did we pour gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.
Lt wasn't like he said.
Like he said?
Like you say you don't speak Spanish.
Mr. Kemp doesn't speak Spanish.
Well, he will have plenty of opportunity to learn.
The charges against you are grave.
Resisting arrest carries a tariff alone of one year in prison.
Never mind assault with a deadly weapon.
I'm going to refer this case to a higher court.
Meanwhile,
I remand you both in custody for 30 days.
If I may, Your Honor.
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Lt isn't my purpose to interrupt proceedings, but if the intention is to remand these gentlemen,
I would respectfully ask for a brief recess to allow me to contact their counsel.
Who is who?
Alfredo Quinones.
Lt would necessitate getting him out of bed, of course.
But given the importance of these gentlemen to various interests,
I'm sure that he would be as pleased as I to come down here at 3:00 in the morning.
How much did we cost him?
About $1,000 apiece.
I can't thank you enough.
Don't be late.
Mother of balls!
We got to rescue the car.
Not now. We'll do it later.
I've got a meeting.
We do not have later.
They've already had it 1 2 hours.
I know how these bastards work.
They can strip a train to axles in 1 2 minutes.
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.
How long is this gonna take?
How would I know?
I can't be late.
I don't know why you're going at all.
That guy is bad company.
He's a manipulative prick.
He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?
Now he fucking owns us.
I got a tongue like...
Like a towel.
Want a beer?
Do I want a beer?
No, I do not.
I am never gonna touch alcohol again.
What fresh hell is this?
Front seat's gone.
That's a write-off. Isn't it?
You know what, I've got a brilliant idea.
What's that?
There's too much weight on the axle.
Try and move forward a bit.
Gonna be late.
I'm gonna be a week late.
What are you doing, Sala?
I suddenly realize how much I like you.
What do you mean, what am I doing?
There's something wrong with the axle.
Oh, my God, it's the cop we set on fire.
Try and look normal.
Make a right! Make a right!
- What right? There is no right.
- Any right!
There he is. Paul, come in.
Sorry. There were unexpected developments.
I had to go home and start the day again.
Tell me about it.
Some days are two sizes too small.
Well, I'm afraid some of us had to leave.
But, Mr. Zimburger you know.
And this is Mr. Green of First National Maritime Bank.
You want some coffee?
I think we should move right along, Hal.
- l gotta go.
- Sure.
Sit down, Paul.
As you may know, Mr. Kemp, the island is owned by the U.S. government.
Part of it presently used as a target range by the Navy.
We know from internal sources... ls that what you're calling me?
That the government is preparing to relinquish the lease, and this place wakes up as 32 square miles of magnificent and untouched real estate.
Knock your eyes out.
No prettier beaches in the Caribbean.
Orientated around one hell of a beautiful marina.
Thought it was one hotel.
We start with one hotel.
It's a foot in the door.
Once we're up and running, we're servants of a market.
- Like here?
- Like here.
You look worried, Mr. Kemp.
He's not worried.
Paul and I shared a tricky little night.
Right, Paul?
Neither of us got much sleep.
I gotta go, guys.
Well, we'll leave you gentlemen to it.
Has Mr. Kemp signed the papers?
Doing that right now.
What am I actually signing?
Just a confidentiality agreement, affirmation of trust.
Just so we're all sitting in the same Jacuzzi.
In case a turd floats up, if you know what I mean.
Come on, Paul, let's go over here.
Here you go.
It's just a technicality, Paul.
Means you promise not to talk to anybody about the project.
How's the head?
Unpleasant.
Gotta thank you again for putting up the bail.
It's held on my cognizance.
And I think it more than likely to slip various minds.
This place is a sea of money, Paul.
Unbelievable money.
Practically every major corporation hides its cash offshore.
No, thanks.
And that is good news for us, because we are the shore.
Not one dollar that wings its way into Puerto Rico pays a cent in tax.
- Nothing?
- Not penny one.
That includes chemical companies, oil companies, mining companies.
There's $1 2 billion worth of copper in mountains less than 20 miles from here.
A dozen billion dollars.
And there's people like me who know how to get it out.
So, putting it into context,
I don't envisage the breaking of bones to get at a thousand bucks.
Because you weren't here,
I agreed to an itinerary with Zimburger on your behalf.
You'll be traveling down in the morning.
Hope that's okay.
What do you need, Paul?
Well, just in the context of this Zimburger thing, do you think there's a possibility of an advance?
I don't like to ask, but Lotterman's pretty erratic with the paycheck, you know.
Need to get a hold of a car.
You don't have a car?
Nothing too reliable.
Plus, sooner or later, I'm gonna have to find a decent place to live.
Well, we can help you with that.
When you get back, we'll sort you out something with a view.
Carol, what do we have in the garage?
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you.
Got you a car.
She'll give you the keys on the way out.
Feels like 500?
Yeah. Thanks.
Paul...
How's your afternoon?
A half-written horoscope.
Do me a favor, will you?
Drive out to the beach and pick up Chenault.
I need her downstairs by 6:00.
All right.
So, this one?
Or...
This one?
What are these for, a party?
It's for carnival.
Didn't he say anything to you about it?
- No.
- You've got to come.
We're all going down on the boat.
He didn't invite me.
Well, it isn't his carnival.
This one.
I like the other one.
Yes.
Love this car.
Did he give it to you?
I wish.
Fast.
You want a little bet?
A bet about what?
That you scream before I do.
That I scream before you do, in relation to what?
Well, how fast does it go?
I don't know.
That's the bet.
I already crashed one car today.
It's okay. I'll just go sit in the foyer and wait for him.
What do I get if I win?
I'll let you know if you do.
Come on, I'll take you back.
Christ, where'd they get this?
I don't remember.
I've been slightly avoiding Lotterman.
You have me to thank for your freedom.
Thanks.
I got a feeling of total anxiety trying to put my anxieties together in a single, coherent lump.
I'm fucked without a car.
I got us a car.
It's the Chevy downstairs.
Lt belongs to Mr. Sanderson.
So what?
I gotta go type this up.
I don't know what's going on.
He's freaking out and we're down 1 2 pages.
You better frigging do it!
I see your filthy animal face in here again,
I'll have you locked up!
What part of the building are you creeping towards, Sala?
- Darkroom.
- Cops are looking for you.
- Looking for me?
- Looking for you.
And it ain't just your mug in the paper!
What a day.
What a week.
I tell you, I'm out of here.
One way to friggin' Mexico.
Listen, I got a trip tomorrow.
Sanderson's island.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, dear.
It's green money, and I'm thinking of cutting across for the carnival.
You know they got that carnival in Saint Thomas.
I know.
Why don't you come with me?
Give the cops a few days to forget.
Yeah. Fun.
Our guys. 1 2-inch Naval, 14 miles out.
Nobody lives here?
No one who's staying.
Lazar!
Mr. Zimburger.
This is Mr. Lazar, our much put-upon site architect.
- How do you do.
- Hello.
Mr. Monk, I think you know.
I assist Mr. Green, First Maritime Bank.
This is Mr. Kemp from The New York Times.
What did you say your name was?
- Bob Sala.
- Yeah, Sala.
From American Travel Writers Association.
Mr. Kemp is preparing our brochure.
"Wish you were here."
Beer in the cooler, gentlemen.
I have everything next door.
This and this are the main hotels.
22 floors.
Guardians of the bay, so to speak.
Why the different colors?
Blue is for public dissemination, red is for the investors.
Yeah. Hill villas, ocean condos.
Marina.
Parking for 2,000 cars.
There's no roads.
Damn it, Lazar, you forgot the roads!
We're building them. We're building them.
Let's have some lunch.
1 0,000 waiters, maids, bellhops, janitors, clerks.
Plus, whores for the fat man.
Hard to believe they'd do it.
I was talking to that architect kind of guy.
He's going to Saint Thomas, if you want a ride.
When?
How do I know when?
When he's finished here.
You know what Oscar Wilde said?
"They know the price of everything,
"the value of nothing."
Two rums.
I thought you'd given up.
Finally beat my willpower.
Come on, let's go here.
Hey, mi amigo!
Hey, Rosie's a singer.
Paul!
Where's Hal?
- Boat.
- Boat?
Help me find my girlfriend.
Hey! How are you?
Watch your step.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Look at you.
Good. Grab some champagne.
Hey, Captain.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you take Sala to the island?
You shouldn't have done that, Paul.
It's why we have a confidentiality agreement.
He isn't interested.
He's got a mouth like an AP wire.
I just don't know what he was doing there.
And I sure as shit don't know what he's doing here.
Not going glum on us, are you?
Just thoughts.
What's the book?
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.
Lt was written in 1 797 by a junkie called Coleridge.
He wrote that when he was 25 years old.
I've been dragging a typewriter around with me for 1 0.
I've written nothing.
You've written some books.
Nah.
They had no voice.
I don't know how to write like me.
I resent that.
No, I really have to say he's all right.
I have to admit.
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.
Thank you for the afternoon.
Maybe we'll see you in town.
Where you going?
Her friend's playing in a band.
We're gonna go check it out.
We want to come.
I'll rephrase that.
We don't want to come.
Yes, we do. Us girls want to dance.
You're dancing tomorrow.
What's the point of going to carnival if everything is preplanned?
I want to dance, and if you're not going to take me,
- I'm gonna go with them.
- She's got you trumped, Hal.
Sit down. You're drunk.
So what? So is everyone else.
Come on.
Come on, let's do it. lt might be amusing.
Oh, cuidado. Careful.
Here we go.
Yeah.
We're done. We're spent.
- You're gonna go?
- Yes, we're gonna leave.
You're done?
I can't dance no more. Really.
Hold on. You know what? I'll be out.
Let me just get Chenault.
You want rum or beer?
Both.
Dos rum, dos cervezas.
- Whoa, whoa.
- We're gonna go.
- Hey.
- We're gonna go.
- What?
- Natalie's leaving,
- so let's go.
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no.
Chenault, come here. We're leaving.
- Chenault.
- Stop it!
Chenault!
Chenault, come here! Chenault!
Get your hands off me, you motherfucker!
You want to fuck with me?
You know who I am?
You motherfucker!
You know who I am?
- You're a dead man!
- Go! Go!
Get your hands off me.
- You're a dead man!
- Go!
Forget it.
- We'll call you a cab.
- Fuck off!
I gotta get the girl.
She's having a good time. We closed.
You deaf?
I said we closed.
No way, Paul.
No way.
I looked everywhere.
I went to the gendarme.
And?
We went up there.
Nothing. Nobody there.
But an old woman with a mop.
She was more help than the cops were.
"What can I do if your girlfriend likes someone else?" he said.
He's right about that, Paul.
She's not your girlfriend.
Maybe she went back to the boat.
Did you try the boat?
No.
I don't think he'd let her back on.
Ls she with you?
Why don't you mind your own goddamn business?
I want the keys.
The Chevy.
You blew it, Kemp.
It's all rust.
I've seen better tires hanging over the side of a tug.
You want it or not?
Yeah, we want it.
Everyone turns up for their Friday check, right?
No check, no Lotterman.
So I go around to see that unforgivably ugly wife of his.
She tells me he's gone to Miami.
For what?
You don't know, I don't know.
But the scabs are back.
Since Morell went, the paper took a turn for the worse.
Ls there anything in the spinner?
We need a fresh sack.
Well, maybe I can interest you gentlemen in something else.
Like what, death?
Like the most powerful drug in the history of narcotics.
I'm not at liberty to discuss or disclose.
All I can tell you is this stuff is so powerful, they give it to Communists.
Who does?
The FBI.
Why would the FBI get Communists high?
That I can't help you with.
You take it like eye drops.
In the eye?
So I understand.
Lt makes the eye see things.
You see a different reality.
What do you want for it?
I'll throw it in with the bike if you do me a favor.
What's the favor?
I want you to come to the bathroom with me.
He's your man.
- $50, right?
- Yeah.
He wants me to look at his dick.
I flatly refused.
What does he want you to look at it for?
Says there's something wrong with it.
It's a gentleman's matter.
I'm not looking at it!
All right, give me the drugs back.
No! Wait.
I'll look at it.
I'll view it in the mirror.
Ls it clap?
A standing ovation.
You see anything?
No.
Neither do I.
We'll give it another five minutes.
Trouble making ends meet?
- Then, you need the Lending Man.
- Right.
Call the Lending Man now.
How long since we took it?
I don't know.
A while.
Bullshit, isn't it?
Ls it bullshit?
Jesus.
Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet.
For Christ's sake, keep it out.
What are you talking about?
Your tongue belongs to Satan!
Are you out of your mind?
Keep it out!
If it goes back into your mouth, it'll kill you.
We've got to get it into the sink!
You're giving me fear.
Stop it! I've got fear!
Fuck you. So do I.
You're high, you fool.
Drink some rum.
I thought I was losing grip in there.
What did we take?
I don't know.
We need to get some more.
That explains it.
Doesn't it?
Explains what?
The world.
And us.
I wonder what it is you might think about our different worlds.
He looked at me kind of sideways and said,
"Human beings are the only creatures on Earth
"that claim a God.
"And the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.
"Does the world belong to no one but you?"
And when he said it, I was taken aback.
Not because of who was doing the talking, because I finally understood the connection between children scavenging for food and shiny brass plates on the front doors of banks.
Gotta go.
Come in.
We gotta go.
Give me a minute.
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.
How nice of you to drop in.
I was covering the carnival.
That's not what I heard.
I heard you were in the moonlight for Sanderson.
I was what?
Moonlighting for Sanderson.
Where's Segurra?
Mr. Segurra's no longer with us.
I got a story for you.
Yeah, you may have noticed that I'm somewhat busy.
This is real important, involving
Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.
I'm gonna tell you how important it isn't.
I got 21 jobs on the line and a newspaper going under.
Print this, and you'll sell it.
A planning scam.
Literally despoliation of a paradise.
A thousand people will be swept into the sea like garbage.
You are weird, Kemp.
It's not what it's doing to them, it's what it's doing to you.
It's called journalism.
Make me laugh.
I asked you to tidy up the booze, you couldn't even sweep out a room.
Why do you think you're working here?
'Cause you're everything that's wrong with a journalist.
And you're everything that's wrong with this insult of a newspaper.
Unanimously agreed.
Why don't you shut it, Moburg?
You are a waste of human sperm.
Die a prolonged and relentlessly agonizing death!
Enjoy her.
Made you some tea.
You should try and sleep.
I stole your bed.
It's okay.
I'm going to write.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry.
You did me the best favor I ever had.
There is no dream, Chenault.
Just a piss puddle of greed, spreading throughout the world.
I want to make a promise to you, the reader.
And I don't know if I can fulfill it tomorrow or even the day after that.
But I put the bastards of this world on notice.
That I do not have their best interests at heart.
I will try and speak for my reader.
That is my promise.
And it will be a voice made of ink and rage.
Sit down. I made you coffee.
Thanks.
One for you and one for me.
Oh, man, I would rather not start the day with this.
- What is it?
- It's a writ.
Means we're going to court.
Lt means they can arrest us, should they so desire, any damn minute they please.
We need to speak to a lawyer.
We don't even have a phone.
I know an old guy, Spanish Advocate.
Kind of owes me one.
You should get dressed.
We'll go down there.
Water ran out. I'm covered in soap.
Fuck it. See what I can do.
What's it for?
It's Hal.
He put up a bond for us on this thing, and now he's pulled it.
Here.
You know he's a crook, Paul.
And we get the writs.
What is it?
It's Hitler.
It's over.
What is?
They shut us down.
He just stood there and lied to us.
He hasn't got the morality of a clapped out cash register.
I hate to tell you this, guys, but it was to avoid severance.
We all know what it was for, Charlie.
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.
There's nothing we can do, except report him to the labor board, which is the same thing as doing nothing.
I disagree.
We gotta strike back and nail this bastard to his own front door.
And how, pray, do we do that?
By printing the paper.
We got tons of stuff on Lotterman.
Every happy maggot with his hand in the till.
Lt may be the last-ever issue, but we go out in a blaze of rage.
What are you talking about?
Lt costs $2,200 a shot.
We bring in the scabs.
They're picketing for money.
You're through the looking glass.
We haven't even got enough money for drinks.
It's not worth the fight. This has been coming down the pike for a long time.
You got to know it's over when it's over.
This lousy little Caribbean rag is nothing but a wrapping for fish heads.
Plus, it's a lockout.
Fuck the locks.
I say we just walk in.
Anybody with me?
Bob?
You know I'm with you.
We didn't pay the bill.
Where's Chenault?
She's gone to New York.
She left me $1 00.
I don't believe it.
She didn't have any money.
You should use it to go with her.
Red-eye for 50 bucks.
No.
I'm not going anywhere.
By some means or another, I'm gonna put the paper out.
Print the bastard, then we're gone.
Face the reality, Paul.
There's no job, no money, no girl, and a warrant out for our arrest.
There's no contest.
Donovan's right, it ain't worth the fight.
I'm not Donovan!
And I'm not like the others.
I'm telling you right now, next time some greasy moron starts bullshitting me,
I'm going after him.
All the way up to the president of the United States.
I just want to win one once.
One sheet.
You ain't gonna get far on $1 00.
Some of the scabs will do it for nothing.
We're gonna need 20 guys, plus vans.
No, no, all you need is two grand.
We're out of rum.
It's as if God, in a fit of disgust, has decided to wipe us all out.
Yea, the cock crows thrice.
What about El Monstruo?
Bet the $1 00 on El Monstruo.
How do you know he lives here?
I saw him come out.
You better let me do this on my own.
If he gets it, we should bring it to Papa Nebo.
Who's that?
My witch doctor.
She's a hermaphrodite.
Stop here! Stop here!
By day, she drives a garbage truck.
By night, she becomes Papa Nebo, the hermaphroditic oracle of the dead.
When permission is granted from Papa Samedi, the keeper of the cemetery, she'll visit, and she'll dig up a corpse.
Certain organs of the disgrounded stiffs are indispensable for use in ouangas.
This is horse shit, isn't it?
She cured my prick.
She wants to know what you want.
We want her to empower this fowl.
We want it blessed and anything that tries to fight it, dead.
Bring forth the fowl.
She says that no fowl on Earth could challenge this cockerel and survive.
Great.
How's she off for curses?
Pretty good.
Let's have a curse on Sanderson.
Make his dick fall off.
And that fucker at the bank, Green.
Mr. Green.
Jesus!
Curse active!
Okay, come on.
One down, two to go.
Okay. I'm gonna call Moburg.
Okay.
Come on. Come on.
He isn't there.
He has to be.
He isn't there.
- Where have you been?
- Sorry.
I never heard the phone.
How's it going?
Winning, man. We're winning.
Ls everyone there? ls everyone there?
Yeah, everyone's here.
What about the vans?
What about the vans, Moburg?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, vans.
You hear that?
We're on our way.
What the hell is going on?
He said he had the men.
"All claims against the former owners will be..."
"Signed on behalf of First Maritime Bank, Miami."
Sanderson's pal, Mr. Green.
Sorry, Paul.
I didn't know how to say.
They took all the machines out.
Not everything, but just the parts that matter.
I'll let you in.
All I wanted was a front page.
Probably for the best.
Probably would've never pulled it off.
How much did you guys win?
Just under six grand.
Oh, yeah, well, you...
At least you can pay off the bond now.
Screw the bond.
We're out of here.
It's over with.
There's a midnight Pan Am.
I'm not risking the airport.
No.
I figure this island owes us a boat.
And I'm fuckin' taking one of Sanderson's.
You smell it?
It's the smell of bastards.
It's also the smell of truth.
I smell ink.
I got to take the hen back.
Find yourself a trade wind.

[Laughter]
- [Tyres screech]
- Hey, move out of the way you crazy turtle!
Humans, huh...
..seems to me like they're always in a hurry, but they have nowhere to go.
That was my old mate Ray back there.
He almost got himself run over.
Huh!
We were born on this very same beach, some fifty years ago, and we've been mates ever since.
Today is a special day, we're both going to be granddads. Imagine that!
'It could take awhile before the little ones hatch though,
'so, let me take you back in time,
'and tell you about our first encounter with the humans.
'There was a time when this beach was practically deserted.
'Nothing out here but us turtles,
'and the sound of those beautiful waves.'
Ohh!
[Seagulls screeching]
Oh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Hey, come on, you need to hustle a flipper!
I can't get out!
Let's go... to the water.
We're wasting time.
See you in 30 years!
Or not!
Ohh!
Oomph!
Ohh!
[Sighs]
[Seagulls screeching]
Hello... hello?
Is anybody up there?
'I was only five minutes old and already I had the sinking feeling
'that I was not going to make it.'
[Screeches]
Ahh!
[Squawks]
Help, let me go!
Ah!
Oh!
Ohh!
Oh-ho, oh!
Hi there!
Watch out!
Ahh!
WOO!
That was well cool with those birds, eh?
It was as if we were flying!
- [Groans]
- You know, you don't look too good.
[Groans]
- Can you move?
- Huh?
We have to get going.
We've got some good waves coming in now.
Come on, we gotta go, Shelly!
Birds are everywhere!
Wait, we have to help him!
Come on, Shelly.
There's nothing more you can do for him.
Shelly?
Oh!
Come on, don't give up.
You can still make it!
You have to try.
Get up, I'll help you.
[Screeching]
Ah, let go!
Help me, help!
Shelly?
[Gasps]
[Sighs]
Oh!
'And so it began for me.
'A little nudge to start me off.
'Nonetheless, I was on my way.'
# Let this love be a fading sky #
# We could drift all night
  to the new sunrise #
# Because we'll be free #
# I know you know you're free #
# Feels so good to be free #
# Mm-mm, baby #
# Free #
# There's nothing in between #
# What we are, what we've seen #
# What we are #
# We are just free #

# Free... #
[Grunts]
Oh! Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh, hi there, new to the current?
Hatched yesterday.
You're awful young to be alone out here.
It can get really scary.
Scary?
It is a big pond out here, in case you hadn't noticed!
Lots of creatures out to get you, as you'll find out soon enough.
- Find out what?
- Where do I start?
- Well, what about barracuda?
- Barra what?
Cudas, fastest predator in the ocean!
- And you got your Great Whites!
- White?
Faster than the fastest, they are, and big teeth, too.
Oh, never mind them.
Just go with your instincts, and you'll be fine. No reason to be scared.
I'm not scared.
Well you should be!
You're not even a snack for most creatures out here!
Just follow your instincts, and good luck on your journey.
What am I supposed to be looking for?
When you find out, let us know!
And watch out for the nets.
If they get you, you're turtle soup!
And watch out for the plastic.
Seaweed good, plastic bad.
OW!
What did you do that for?
Do I look like food to you?
Oh, crazy fish!
What a way to start the journey.
Hmm.
Ah!
How's it going, guys?
Looking mighty cosy up here.
- Get off, you big oaf.
- [All] Yeah!
Who put a dent in your shell?
He's gonna eat all our food.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Get out of here!
- Yeah.
Go! We don't need some eating machine hanging around! Sling your hook!
I wouldn't ride on your stupid whatever, if you were the last turtles in the ocean!
- Good!
- Go away!
Hiya, fellas.
Hoy-oy-oy, don't even think about it!
Beat it!
All right, I'm not one of your kind.
Got that right!
- Hey, watch out!
- Ow!
Ah, this is not my day!
Now why'd you whack me upside my head?
But, I...
Lucky I didn't pass out!
Look at that!
Got a bump the size of a barnacle.
Probably get bigger, take over my whole head.
I, I, I don't think it will...
You ever seen them barnacles?
You let 'em hitch a ride with you, they never leave, bunch of freeloaders!
Hello?
Oh! Goodbye.
What is that thing you're on anyway?
You make it?
Oh, I fell on it.
It's a long story.
How's your bump?
Ah, no worries.
Us Leathers got heads like rocks.
The name's Ray.
Sammy.
Pleased to meet you.
How long you been on the journey?
- Just one day.
- Me too! Caught the drift up north.
- So did I!
- Say!
We have a lot in common, you and me.
- Would you like to hop on?
- Nah, I'm OK.
Oh, OK.
It was a joke!
You know, seeing how we're supposed to be floatin' around until we grow up and all, this little raft of yours could come in handy.
This ain't bad.
Now, you're sure about this?
I don't wanna get all friendly like and then you go crackers on me one day,,
- and wanna kick me off.
- I wouldn't do that.
Besides, we were hatched on the same day, probably on the same beach!
We're practically brothers.
Brothers...
I like that.
Ah, the sun feels good, doesn't it?
I like laying out in the sun. it's good for my skin, cos you know, when a turtle, you know, gets all dried up, everything gets all ugly and flaky, but I like that.
I like that, it's good to have a turtle tan.
'And that's how I met Ray.
'He was definitely a character.
'Always fun and never at a loss for words.
'For ten years or so our life in the open sea,
'consisted mainly of floating and waiting.'
You should try some. it's good!
You've got to be kidding. My taste buds are a little more refined.
[Laughs]
That's what you call refined?
Hoo, I love 'em!
[Burps]
They do gimme gas though.
[Laughs]
# I'm feeling happy #
# And warm all over #
# I hold you in my hand #
# And you spillover #
# So come on,
  we're having a good time #
# We're happy people,
  We're having the best time ever #
# We're happy people,
      Oh-oh #
# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh #
# Oh-oh-oh-oh... #
'You know, despite all the stories I heard,
'the ocean didn't seem like a scary place after all.'
# I'm the way it should be #
# So come on,
  we're having a good time #
# We're happy people,
  We're having the best time ever #
# We're happy people,
        oh-oh #
# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh #
[Horn blasts]
# Why don't you take a look around #
- [Both laugh]
# Take a look all around you #
# I'm feeling happy
 Take a look around #
# And warm all over
 Take a look all around #
# I hold you in my hand
Take a look around #
# And you spill over... #
'It was a pretty great life out here.
'Time just seemed to fly by.
'Before we knew it we had...
Well, we had grown up.
'Well, almost grown up, that is.'
Oh, this is the life, my friend.
No gas problems today, Ray?
I'm feelin' pretty good.
By the way, did you notice those two cuties leaving
- when we were comin' in?
- Nope, didn't see them.
Come on, they were checking you out!
- No, they weren't.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, do you think we'll be pals forever?
Of course, forever and ever.
- Don't you?
- Definitely.
But, at some point, now I'm not saying now, but, some time in the future, well, we're gonna have to choose a mate, right?
OK. So?
Have you ever thought about finding that someone special?
I suppose.
So, what's your type?
- I don't know.
- Come on, everybody's got a type.
For me, she's gotta have a great laugh, and of course, share my thing for jellyfish.
Of course.
You still haven't told me what your type is?
Actually, I met someone once that I think could be my type.
Oh, really?
Well, come on, come on, this is major! You gotta tell me!
You're gonna make more of it than it actually was.
You already made more of it!
OK.
- Her name's Shelly.
- Go on.
She was... she was kind of sweet.
Mm.
Where'd you meet her?
She was um... an important part of my early life.
What?
We met a day after you hatched, been together ever since, and she's a big part of your life?
- She is!
-Mm?
- Was.
- Well, OK, I want all the juicy details.
There are no juicy details.
Start talkin' or I don't stop bugging you.
OK, OK, fine.
- Come on, I'm listening.
- [Laughs]
Wow, that was some story.
You saved her life.
It was more of an accident.
The birds collided.
You spit sand in that bird's face.
You saved her life!
I don't even know if she made it.
There you are, you never know.
It's a small ocean out there.
Maybe someday me and you'll run into her.
- Maybe.
- [Both] Ah!
- Whoo!
- Ha-ha, is this great or what?
Better than great!
'Ray was truly the best friend
I could have hoped for.
'He was always fun.
'Always good humoured and always looking for new adventures.
'One thing though, I could have done without his stinky jellyfish.'
[Crash]
[Groans]
[Alarms]
[Crash]
'Come on, don't give up.'
You can still make it!
You have to try.
Get up!
- Come on Sammy, get up!
- Oh!
It's about time you woke up.
What?
Oh.
What have you been doing?
Exploring! Made friends with a cool old octopus.
You gotta check him out.
Have you eaten yet?
I'll get something on the wing.
Picky, picky, picky.
Where are you taking me to?
You'll see, we're almost there.
Hey, Slim!
Well, hello!
Grab on, boys!
Come on, Sammy, you're not scared, are you?
No, of course not.
Come on then! it's gonna be fantastic!
- Welcome aboard.
- Here we go!
Pick a tentacle, any tentacle.
Fasten your seatbelts, it's going be a bumpy ride.
Here we go!
Round and round and round.
Love it!
I Teach you to carry on
I Watch now, but now it's gone away... I
Oh!
Woo-hoo.
So was that fun or what?
My head's still spinning.
- Where's everybody going?
- Whoa, we've got a situation here!
What's going on?
It doesn't look good.
- Smells bad too.
- Oh!
What is this stuff?
It's all around us!
We'd better take cover!
We'll be safe in here... I think.
Slim, you ever seen anything like this?
No, not like this.
However, I do remember a cargo ship once ran aground on some rocks, and dropped a whole batch of Icelandic bananas!
These aren't bananas.
Most certainly not.
Oh.
Good lord, that's disgusting!
I'll wager a guinea that that ship is rammed to the gunnels with the stuff.
You chaps should head out, it's not safe staying around here.
What about you, Slim?
Oh, Slim'll be fine.
I like staying put.
I'm a hermit, not the crab, you understand.
But anyway,
I've got a lot of cleaning up to do.
Take care my turtle friends.
- Thanks.
- Take care of yourself!
This looks horrible.
It was so beautiful here.
Why would anybody do this to us?
I don't know, it doesn't make any sense at all.
[Helicopter]
'Humans were strange creatures.
'Some made a mess, while others cleaned it up.
'That was our first contact with humans.
'It wouldn't be our last.
'Over the years, I learned that many things would change,
'but one thing was always a constant.
' People would affect our lives
'more and more.'
[BANG!]
Wow, what was that?
That hurt my ears.
Look at that!
What is it?
Some kind of aliens?
No, humans.
They're everywhere.
I think we need to get out of here.
This is a little too close for comfort.
Hey!
What did ya do that for?
There's no room on here, especially for your stinky jellyfish.
What are you talking about?
We can't even move on here any more.
Maybe I should just take my jellyfish and hit the current myself!
Then you could stretch out and have all the space to yourself.
- I wasn't saying you had to...
- Whoa...
Uh-ooh!
Well, there you go.
I guess we won't have to worry about being crowded any more, now will we!
Look, Ray, I...
What?
What's the rush, guys?
Oh, Ray!
The net, it's got me!
Hold on, I'll get you out of there.
Don't panic.
I'll tear this thing up.
I already tried.
It's too hard!
I can't bite through it!
Ah!
- Ray!
- Sammy!
Wait for me here! I'll find a way out.
I'll be right here, Sammy!
You hear me?
Right here!
Ah, they got me.
- Sammy?
- Ray?
We'll get out of this.
'That was the first time that I saw real fear on Ray's face.'
- Sammy!
- 'I was pretty scared myself]
Sammy!
Oh!
Ohh!
[Grunts]
Ohh!
Oh!
Whoa!
Oh!
Ah. Oh!
Ahh!
[Grunts]
[Sighs] Oh, Ray.
'This was one of those times
I could've used a little luck,
'one of those little nudges.
'I had the feeling
I was never going to see Ray again.'
Gotta be thirty degrees out here.
Away with you, I'll give it 35.
What you got there then, boy?
It's a little greenback.
Think we should we make some soup?
- [Both laugh]
- That little boy's overcooked already!
Chuck him!
[Both continue to laugh]
[Groans]
# Oh-ho-ho #
# If you ever find yourself
  stuck in the middle of the sea #
# I'll sail the world to find you #
# If you ever find yourself lost in the dark
        and you can't see #
# I'll be the light to guide you #
# To find out what we're made of #
# When we are called

  are supposed to do, oh, yeah... #
Hey, what's this?
Oh, isn't he a cute little turtle?
See turtle, Fluffy?
- See?
- He looks so scared, doesn't he?
We'll get him some food, and we'll take real good care of him.
OK?
Fluffy, turtle eat food.
And it's time for your dinner, too.
[French accent] OK, let's get one thing straight, little turtle.
-these are my humans.
- I didn't ask to be here.
Your humans brought me here.
If I may suggest, you should plan on getting your little shell out of here as soon as possible, unless of course, you prefer to end up like my ex-amis, ze chicken.
- Chicken?
- Absolument!
Whose playpen do you think this was?
They eat animals?
But she seems so nice.
Do not let the mumsy-wumsy attitude fool you.
She will stuff you like a goose, then, it is r-r-r, pâté for everyone.
Shh, here she comes now!
Here you go, little man.
You are so skinny.
We need to fatten you up, don't we?
Come here, don't be afraid.
Do not forget.
You have been warned.
Bon appétit!
"You have a strange way, Ralph,
"of proving that the world has grown smaller.
"So, because you can go round it in three months..."
"In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg.
"That's true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan.
"Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad,
“on the Great Indian
Peninsular Railway, has been opened.“
So, have you given any more thought to your escape?
You are starting to look like ze fat goose more and more every day.
Ze time will come. it's a sure thing.
You and your chicken stories!
Is it true? Can you really go around the world?
But of course you can!
I myself have travelled all over with my humans.
Since they rescued me from the murky waters of the Seine in Paris, oo-la-la, it has been magnifique!
So, wait, there are other oceans out there?
'One day, Snow found a female turtle.
I think she wanted us to...'
Mate!
You've got to be kidding!
I suppose she wants more turtles.
I know what mating is.
That is so not happening.
And who's your hairy friend?
That's Fluffy.
These are his humans.
Exactement! You just stay away from my humans, sister.
Oh, you can keep your humans as far as I'm concerned.
Bunch of wack-a-doodle-doo creatures!
The further away from them I am, the better.
Tell me, sugar, how long have they been holding you prisoner?
I'm not a prisoner.
Really, then why are you still here?
This is the same question
I have been asking for weeks!
Back off, whiskers.
Let me break it down for you.
Where I come from, this here fence looks a lot like a prison, but, OK, believe what you will if it makes you feel better.
Fluffy!
Dinner calls! À bientôt!
- I'm Sammy.
- Vera.
Speaking of dinner,
I am starving!
Do they just feed hairball or us, too?
Yeah, when the sun goes down.
Beautiful!
Don't make any sudden moves on me.
Go ahead and give us a wake-up call when it's time to eat, will you?
[Yawns]
[Sitar music plays]
There you go.
You'll be our little peace ambassador.
Merry Christmas, little man.
Hey, what did she paint on my shell?
Turn around, let me see.
It is zat, stupid... ze sign!
What can I say.
I have told you.
You are marked, mon ami.
Oh, there you go again with the chicken and the funny words routine.
Never mind him, Sammy.
It looks cute on you.
Why do you think they dress up like that with those silly hats?
Incroyable!
You really don't get it?
Because it's Christmas!
You get presents.
Hey, maybe this mark is Snow's present to me.
Doubtful.
In any event, don't get any ideas,
Monsieur Hard Shell.
She is only being nice because it's Christmas.
? Jingle bells
? Jingle bells
? Jingle all... ?
'I still don't know if Fluffy's chicken story was true or not.
'I wanted to believe Snow was a kind human and wouldn't do that to me.
'But you never knew, when it came to humans.
'It didn't take long before the hippies realised,
'Vera and I weren't going to mate.
'They said we had different karmas...
'or auras - whatever they were.'
Zat should be you out there.
Hold on, I thought you liked Vera?
Vera's too old and too tough for turtle soup.
But you...
- Ow!
- ..I'd say you were just about right!
Vera!
[Man] None of you kids belong on this beach! I want you all off here now!
Snow, they're taking Sunshine away!
[Sirens]
The cops! The army!
They're shipping them out to Vietnam!
[Man] You with the love beads, start that bus up.
Vite, vite, go, go, go!
What's going on?
You, you're coming with us.
This is it, it's chicken time.
You have to hide now!
They did the same thing before.
They... you know what I mean.
Stay put, and don't move.
You don't want to end up as fricassee, do you?
[Man] All right, shake a leg.
Come on, get out of it.
[Young man] We have rights, man.
[Snow] Wait.
Where's the little man?
Has anybody seen him?
I can't find him.
Quiet.
[Man] Right, you horrible lot, everybody get off this beach.
Get your stuff and move out!
[Sirens]
Have a good life little turtle!
Peace.
"The whole time I was with the humans,
Fluffy wanted to get rid of me",
"but in the end, it was them who left".
"I never quite understood what happened".

'At that point I thought, maybe
I wasn't meant to go on this journey.
'Maybe I'd spent too much time with the humans.
'But there was no turning back now.'
Oh!
[Grunts]
Argh!
Well, well, well, look what the trash brought in!
Vera!
I see you escaped one prison and got yourself all tangled up in another.
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah, lots of rubbish out here.
Got to be careful.
What brings you here?
- Food.
- Yeah!
Follow me.
What did I tell you?
This is just what I needed.
[Faint] Help!
Hold on a sec, what's that noise?
- I didn't hear anything.
- [Faint] Oh, oh!
- This is so tasty!
- [Screams]
Shh!
Ah-ha! Shark!
Help! Help!
[Screams]
Oh!
- Are you hurt?
- He bit me pretty hard but I'm fine.
He's coming back.
Quick, this way.
Hurry, he's gaining on us.
Quickly. Here.
- [Screams]
- Oh!
Quick!
In here.
. Oh!
. Oh!
Ohh! Quick, no!
- Keep going!
- Oh!
Faster, faster!
- Ohh!
- [Screams]
Come on, keep going!
[Both gasping]
Keep going! Down here!
Ohh!
That was close!
Too close.
[Screams]
Leave us alone!
Hey you, big teeth!
That's right, hot shot!
I got your scaly botty on my radar!
You picked the wrong turtle to be messing with!
Ohh, you want some of this?
[Grunts]
Is that all you've got?
I'm gonna call you the Great Wimp not the Great White! Ah!
- Oh, no!
-Vera!
Hey, you think that hurts?
What?
Please!
That's all you got?
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna make cat food out of you, pal!
Look at you,
I've got one tough shell, fish breath!
You heard me.
And don't make me swim after you!
Woo, that felt good.
No need to worry about mister shark any more.
You were incredible!
Are you two related?
No, we're just friends, well, sort of.
Well, got to go.
Feed the boy, cos, a fat turtle is a happy turtle.
Take care you two.
You know, you don't look too good.
Are you OK?
'Don't give up.
You can still make it! You have to try.'
[Gasps] You're...
Wait, you're... you're Shelly!
How do you know my name?
Is this a dream?
No, I, I don't think so.
Are you the same "fell out of a bird's beak when you were hatched," Shelly?
Just a minute.
[Gasps]
I knew you looked familiar, too!
You saved my life - twice!
What? No!
The first time was an accident.
That was no accident, that was fate.
You know,
I don't even know your name.
Sammy.
Well, Sammy, this is incredible!
It is, isn't it?
How's your shell?
It's just a scratch.
Are you as hungry as I am?
Famished!
'Life is strange.
'Just when you thought the going was pretty tough,
'out of the blue things happen,
'and everything's suddenly great again.'
Hey, Shell, you ever get bored just drifting, going round in circles?
It's what we do.
I know, but wouldn't it be great just to travel around the world?
What do you mean?
This is our world.
I think there's a lot more than these waters.
For instance?
Well, the humans talk about ice oceans and strange islands.
I want to see them!
You're definitely a different type of turtle.
- I guess that's why I like you.
- [Gasps] You like me?
What's not to like?
So, just how exactly do you plan on seeing the world?
Have you ever heard about a secret passage?
You really think one exists?
- I do.
- The humans again?
Maybe they made that whole thing up.
Maybe, but I want to do something no one else has done.
I want to see the world, ice oceans!
So, you wanna come along with a weirdo turtle like me?
Is this a proposition, Sammy?
Yes, I suppose it is.
- I'd love to go with you.
- [Gasps] Really?
It's not every day you get a chance to see the world, right?
How do we find this secret passage?
I'm not sure.
Let's head south, we'll ask around.
'Everything suddenly fell into place.
'I had a purpose, a journey.
'And best of all, someone to share it with.'
? Destiny is a funny thing
? We hear people say things are meant to be... ?
All I know is that I see a lot of ships heading that way.
A secret passage?
That, I couldn't tell you.
I stay as far away from those humans as possible.
That must be the way! I feel it!
I feel it, too!
Good luck!
? Never to feel love
? And you will see that nothing at all is impossible
? Because love will find a way... ?
There's loads of boats.
I don't see any secret passage.
Let's move on.
Of course he's not crazy!
We have a plan.
We want to see the world.
Thanks anyway.
This is not as easy as I thought.
Wait! Over there!
? Because mountains and valleys may come between us
? But time nor space will ever defeat us
? And you will see that nothing at all is impossible... ?
This is not the secret passage.
Look at all this nasty stuff around here.
This can't be it.
I think you're right.
[Birdsong]
Taste the water!
- It's sweet!
- Wait!
I remember the humans mentioned something about sweet water
- flowing through the secret passage.
- Do you think we're close?
Yeah! This must be it.
Let's check it out.
It's so different and so beautiful.
It's amazing!
[Bird call]
Wow, did you see that?
There's birds everywhere!
We've got to be careful.
Look at that! I've never seen a snake that big in the ocean.
Maybe he's the guardian of the secret passage.
- [Hisses]
- Let's keep going.
That is one strange looking beast.
It looks like a real monster.
[Gasps]
Did you see that?
- What?
- I'm not sure.
I feel like we're being followed.
[Gasps]
Sammy? Ohh!
I don't think they're anything to worry about. They're not that big.
OW!
Ah!
True, unless you count the fact they have a whole lot of nasty teeth...
There seem to be quite a lot of them.
[Growls]
- [Growls]
- [Scream]
See, I told you they were...
- Ah!
- Sammy!
Let me go!
Ahh! Ahh!
[Grunts]
Why did you bring me up here?
- [Cheeping]
- Ow!
OW! Ow!
Stop it!
Ow! Cut it out!
[Gasps]
- [Cheeping]
- Ahh, cut it out!
[Chainsaw]
[Screams]
Great!
Now how do I get down?
Oh!
[Ship horn]
[Sawing continues]
Ohh!
[Screams]
Oh!
Sammy, I was so frightened!
I thought I'd lost you forever.
[Gasps] Duck!
Maybe looking for the secret passage is a bad idea!
I think I know where it is!
When I was up in that tree,
I saw all these big ships heading towards a place in the distance.
I think we're close.
Really close!
[Ship horn]
We made it!
You were right!
Yeah, and getting through is gonna be another story.
Sammy, you're too close!
Follow me!
We've gotta get ahead of the ship!
Maybe we should go back!
They already closed the door behind us.
We've come this far!
We can make it!
Oh!
Oh!
- Sammy!
- Shelly!
I can't hold onto the rope!
Hold on, I'm coming to get you.
- Sammy!
- Stay! Stay!
Hold on. Just hold on!
- [Screams]
- Shelly!
- Help!
- No, no, no!
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, where are you?
Shelly?
Shelly? Shelly?.
Oh!
Shelly! Shelly.
Oh!
Ohh!
Argh!
Oh!
Ohh!
Ahh!
[Gasps]
Ohh!
Oh, Shelly!
'Losing Shelly was all my fault.
'My big idea to see the world, and now here it was.'
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? it's not warm when she's away
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away... ?
Yo, what's up with you?
- Nothing.
- Is you lost?
I suppose I am.
? ..when she's gone
? Wonder if she's gone to stay
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
? Anytime she goes away
? Mm-mm-mm-mm
? And I know, I know, I know, I know
? I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know... ?
- Well, hello there, young turtle!
- Hi.
What's that funny looking mark on your shell?
Humans painted it on me.
Oh, you poor thing.
No, it's not what you think.
You're the second turtle we've met with a strange mark on its shell.
A shark bite?
Yeah, I think that's what she said it was.
Yes, I think you're right, dear.
Oh, she was a lovely female, too.
A bit strange though.
Sure was! Told us some crazy story about going through a secret passage, heading for the ice oceans.
You sure she said secret passageway?
Heard her plain as day!
Indeed we did.
She was going on and on and on about sweet water, giant ships...
That's Shelly!
Why, I do believe that was her name.
Shelly's alive! She's alive!
Oh, thank you, thank you!
You just made me the happiest turtle in the whole ocean! Thank you!
Good luck, dear.
We truly hope you find your mate.
Oh, to be young and in love again.
'I searched everywhere.
'I talked to anyone who would listen.
'For a long time, Shelly seemed to have vanished without trace.
'But, once in awhile,
I'd come across turtles who'd seen her.
'They gave me hope, fleeting as it was,
'because every time
I was close to finding her,
'I'd lose all trace of her again.
'If only she had known
I was looking for her.”
? I've been searching
? Across the lonely water
? Arms wide open to take you
? Seems like forever
? Since we last were laughing
? Do you remember it the way I do?
? Just know you never are alone
? We just need to find our way back home
? You're not alone
? We just need to find our way... ?
Hey there, turtle!
What's that crazy do-malarkey on your shell there?
Helipad or something?
It's a human marking.
- A peace sign.
- Peace sign?
Where have I heard that before?
Thinking, thinking, och aye, that's what she called it.
- Who?
- Oh, a cute little greenback like you.
Big talker she was.
Going on about sweet water, a secret passage, and propellers!
You saw Shelly?
I sure did!
She had to go to the ice ocean.
Made no sense to me, but then again what do I know, I'm just a bird,
- you're the turtle.
- I've gotta get there, fast!
Hold on, it's mighty cold there.
Please, just tell me how I get there!
This current you're on will get you there in no time.
- Wouldn't stay there too long, though.
- Ow!
Frozen stiff ain't too attractive, if you know what I mean.
[Laughs]
Gotta fly, got a date with a pelican.
'Funny how things had a way of repeating themselves.
'I guess it was all a matter of circumstance and how you looked at it.
'This time around, strangely enough,
I was really happy to see a bird.'
[Thunderclap]
[Thunderclap]
[Wind howling]
I say, little man, what's that you're riding on?
I don't know.
The humans threw it away.
I think it's some kind of boat.
Looks pretty seaworthy.
What brings you to these waters?
You're a long way from where you should be?
I, I know. I'm freezing.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for...
Look out!
Oh!
Put down your weapons!
You cannot do this!
You're in violation of the law!
The world is watching!
- Hey, look at that! It's a green turtle!
- Give me a hand.
Pull him up here.
- You found another one?
- Yeah, you believe that?
What are they doing in this part of the world?
I know the climate's changing, but turtles in Antarctica?
That's crazy.
Shelly?
[Barks]
[Barks]
[Chattering]
[Trims]
[Trims]
Here you go, my friend.
[Man] Her vital signs are good.
She's made a remarkable recovery.
We'll give her one last check up when we get back to base, then we'll tag her and she's good to go.
Yes, I was right, it is you!
I've got to get out of here.
[Bangs wall]
Open! Open!
Shelly? Oh.
Oh!
- Shelly!
- [All chatter excitedly]
Sammy?
[Mimics] Sammy!
[All chatter at once]
Hey, easy! You're gonna hurt yourself if you fall off there.
All right, all right everybody.
Shush!
Shelly, is that you?
Not today.
Sorry,
I thought you were someone else.
Do you know what's going to happen to us?
I heard the humans talking about this place.
They're gonna take good care of us, put some kind of tag on us, and release us back into the ocean, man.
I say, "Relax and enjoy the food.“
I heard they got good cheese Fritos, man, and that stuff is good.
OK?
Level
Easy.
Sacré bleu!
Well, look who it is!
You are so fat, mon ami.
Oh, it's you, Fluffy.
But of course it's me! Don't I look just as fantastique as ever?
I should be mad at you for tricking me that day on the beach.
Oh, yes, ze chicken story.
Well, you got me zere.
I made it all up.
I was a little more insecure back then.
You're not going to hold a grudge, are you?
No. it's good to see you, Fluffy.
You, too, mon frére.
So, how did you end up in here?
I practically got myself frozen in the ice ocean.
Really?
So you did it, you went and saw the world after all?
Yes.
But you do not sound too happy about it. Pourquoi?
It's a long story.
Oh, mon dieu, speaking of stories,
I have to admit I did miss you, whenever Snow started reading her books to me.
Snow's here?
Mais out! Somewhere.
- Shelly!
- Shelly? Who is that?
Never mind! You have to help me get out of here, now!
OK, OK. For being so slow, you turtles are always in a hurry.
Fluffy!
What do you want me to do?
I need you to get the door open.
Certain.
What are doing in there bothering the animals, again, Fluffy?
Oh, I don't believe it.
Fluffy, you recognised him?
It's our little peace ambassador.
Look at you, little man, all grown up.
What happened to you?
How did you get here?
I was afraid you wouldn't make it after I dumped you on the beach.
It's so good to see you.
I know, I know, you're in a hurry to get back to the sea, aren't you?
Well, we're gonna get you out there soon enough.
First we have to tag you. I need to get some more from the other building.
It's so good to see you, little man, isn't it Fluffy?
Back in a jiffy.
Fluffy, hurry!
All right, stand clear,
I will get ze door open!
Oy, oy, oy, stop that.
Come on, outside, Fluffy, come on, outside and play.
Leave the animals be.
Sorry, mon ami.
OK, here we go.
You find yourself a mate, little man.
And stay away from the cold water, OK?
Bye-bye.
'For a sea turtle, the odds of surviving in the ocean are pretty slim.
'Shelly and I made it through some tough situations,
'with, at times, a little help from the humans.
'But somehow, no matter how hard we tried,
'fate was determined to keep us apart.”
- You have to help us!
- What's wrong?
He's trapped! He's gonna fall over!
- Who?
- Hurry! Follow us!
We found someone to help you!
Good, cos this thing's about to go!
Hold up, hold up, is that all you could find?
You might as well have brought me a shrimp.
He's too small!
What's he gonna do?
How's he gonna help me?
Stop moving! You'll send yourself over the edge, and you're done for!
Wait a second.
You sound familiar.
Come here.
Come on, come closer.
Let me get a better look at you.
Well, twist my shell cos I can't believe this! Sammy?
Sammy, is that you?
Ray?
I thought you were...
Go ahead, go on say it- turtle soup, huh?
[Laughs]
How did you ever get away?
Ah, it takes a lot more to stop old Ray here. You know that.
It took me two days.
This kid, a first-timer on the boat, found me, tossed me in a bait bucket.
- Hoo.
- Good thing, too, cos I was starving!
After I ate all the bait,
I jumped overboard.
By then we were miles away from each other.
I blamed myself for us getting separated.
No, Ray, you...
Whoa!
He's gonna fall over if you don't get him out of there!
I can do this.
How did you end up in this thing anyway?
OK, let me tell you about it, right?
It was full of frozen squid when I found it!
It was gonna be an easy in and out, but it slipped and I got trapped, so I just started eating them one by one, cos they thawed out real slow.
But as I was eating, I started getting full, then I started moving slow, then I couldn't move and you know me
I got the trots.
OK, OK, no more talking, it's time to get you outta there!
[Grunts]
No, no, no!
Easy, Sammy.
Don't move, Ray, stay still.
No! Ray!
Sammy, can you get me out of here?
Get me out of here!
-Ahh!
-Oh!
Ahh!
[Grunts]
Whoo! I knew you had my shell all the time, my friend. Whoo!
Ladies, my heartfelt gratitude goes out to you.
Your bravery is only exceeded by your collective beauty.
[Both giggle]
Good line, Ray.
Isn't it? Aside from the obvious reason, it's really good to see you, Sammy.
It's been a long time.
So what are you doing out here all alone?
It's a long story.
- Now where have I heard that before?
- I need your help, Ray.
Hey, we're practically brothers.
What do you need?
I have to find someone.
Someone very special to me.
The trick is to know where to look.
And this time of year, there's only one place she would be headed.
That would be the magical place.
Look at this. It shines like this all day.
You never want to leave.
This is amazing!
If you're looking for a mate, this is where you wanna be.
There's Rita! Hey, Honeybee!
- Rita, I'm back!
- Huh? What?
[Gasps] Ray!
What took you so long?
Oh, shnookums, I was... entangled, so to speak, OK?
And then I swam into my very old friend.
Honey, sugar pie, this is Sammy.
[Gasps] Sammy? For real?
The one and only.
Hi, Rita.
Very pleased to meet you.
I thought you was dead?
I mean, Ray always thought...
I know, turtle soup.
I'm glad you finally tamed his wandering ways.
[Both] He's cute.
Hey, hey, hey, relax, girls, he's got a mate already.
Well, where is she?
I'd love to meet her.
- I wish I knew.
- That's why we're here.
See, we need to find her.
They were separated quite a while ago.
Oh, you poor dear.
They've been looking for each other ever since.
[Both] Oh, how romantic.
She's got a shark bite on her shell.
- Anybody seen her?
- I believe I did. What's her name?
- Shelly.
- Yes, that's her!
Where did you see her?
Where did she go?
I'm pretty sure she went in there.
What are you waiting for, buddy?
Let's go find her.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, but sugar bee...
You stay right here.
Sammy needs me.
You brought him here, now it's up to him.
Oh, OK then.
I'll be right here if you want me.
[Both] You'll find her, Sammy.
Love always finds a way.
Yeah.
# Always finds a way #
# I know you're somewhere out there #
# - Somewhere far away
- Shelly? #
# - I want you back
- Shelly? #
# I want you back #
# - My neighbours think I'm crazy
- Shelly? #
# But they don't understand #
# You're all I have #
# At night when the stars light up my room #
# I sit by myself #
# Talking to the moon #
# Trying to get to you #
# In hopes you're on the other side #
# Talking to me too #
# Or am I a fool #
# Who sits alone #
# Talking to the moon? #
# Oh-oh-oh #
# I'm feeling like I'm famous #
# The talk of the town #
# They say I've gone mad #
# Yeah, I've gone mad #
# But they don't know what I know #
# Cos when the sun goes down...? #
Shelly? Shelly?
Oh!
[Grunts]
Shelly?
Oh!
What's wrong?
You didn't find her?
She's here all right.
She's got a mate.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I saw them together behind the boat.
Oh, no.
I'm really sorry, Sammy.
What are you gonna do now?
I know, I know you're probably not thinking this way, but there are lots of other turtles out there.
Stop it, Ray.
That's not what he wants to hear right now.
Hey, Ray, you's back, how's it going?
- Could be better.
- Ooh, hi, Rita.
Robbie,
Clara's been looking for you.
Well, that figures. With all the good-looking gals out here, she does not want me to be wandering around too much.
- [Both giggle]
- Well, I better get going.
And later.
You too, manana banana, you know what I'm talkin' about.
- Who's Clara?
- Robbie's mate.
I thought... Shelly and...
Robbie were...
Mates?
[Laughs hysterically]
Yes, that's the way it looked to me.
Robbie?
Oh, oh, he'll flirt with any gal that says hello, and that's why Clara keeps him on a tight leash.
That... would be Robbie.
I should do the same with you.
Me on a leash?
Oh, sugar, you know you're my baby bee.
So that means...
Shelly may not have a mate after all.
You might be right.
What do I do?
I wouldn't be waiting around here.
But what if she doesn't...
Doesn't what?
Duh!
Want him as her mate.
Oh, yeah,
OK, hold on, hold on.
I got it! I got an idea.
All right, listen to me, this is what you're gonna have to do,
You're gonna need to make a big entrance, Sammy.
Is Albert still hanging around?
He is.
What crazy idea are you trying to pull off this time?
Trust me, eh!
Ohh!
[Screams]
Help!
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
You were so brave.
I suppose I was finally in the right place at the right time.
Sammy?
How did you find me?
Look out! Behind you!
It's OK... he's a friend.
What?
What, what's going on?
I knew this was a bad idea
Oh, I see.
After what happened at the secret passage, I wasn't sure if...
If what?
If you and I were meant to be.
Come here, silly.
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
J Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-bi-do!
Yeah!
I - Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
- [Both] Whoo!
? Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
? I was born, by a mother at the school of understanding
? And raised, by a sister, who taught me I could be standing
? At the age of seven,
I fell in love with Blackie
? And nothing could come in my way
? When women go smiling
? I start running
? When women go talking
? I start blushing
? When women start asking
? - Why I keep on falling
- Keep on falling
? I can't stop running away
? They call me little love child with a thorn in my side
? You shouldn't be talking to me
? They call me little love child with a thorn in my side
? You shouldn't be talking to me
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
? Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
? I soon turned eleven
I was lost and separated
? It was head over heels that got me stimulated
? Like John McEnroe, my sky kept on falling
? I knew I had something to say... ?
Look, I'm getting all blubbery and soft-shelled.
Oh, you poor dear.
Next thing you know I'm gonna put a little pink pom-pom on my tail.
Oh, I'm so sensitive.
? Asking, asking, we're falling, we're falling... ?
'The day I was born, the odds were
I wasn't going to make it,
'and I didn't have a clue as to what I was supposed to do.
'Ray showed me how to have fun and the meaning of true friendship,
'and then I met Shelly.
'She made me complete, gave my life meaning,
'and that, by any measure, is pretty great.
'As for humans,
'I must admit, we're going to need their help more and more,
'to protect us and keep our oceans alive and beautiful.'
Looks like the little ones made it out pretty good this time.
Well, looks that way.
So, where did we say we're supposed to meet the women again?
Tristan da Cunha.
Tristan da what?
It's in the middle of nowhere.
- Any humans?
- What can I say?
You know they're everywhere!
Hello?
- I've got this one.
- Go for it.
Hello, hello, is anybody up there?
Hi, there.
Uh, hi, I can't get out.
Could you help me?
I know exactly how you feel.
Let me give you a little nudge to get you started.
The first steps are always the hardest.
What exactly am I supposed to do?
Just put one flipper in front of the other and you'll be all right.
# OO oo oo #
# OO oo oo #
# Sometimes I get my head in a dilly #
# Feeling so lost, ticking you off #
# Now, boy, you know me well #
# Said, I'm that kinda filly #
# That kind of soft, that kind of silly #
# But when I'm in doubt,
I open my mouth #
# And words come out, words come out like #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# There's something underneath my bed #
# Oh, please believe I said #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# I caught them barking at the moon #
# Better be soon #
# High in the sky, the song that I'm singing #
# A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry #
# Rabbit out the hat #
# Yes, that's what I'm bringing #
# Got some tricks up my sleeve #
# For noticing me #
# Oh, yeah #
# I wouldn't cause you any harm,#
# I just want you in my arms #
# I can't help, I can't help myself #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water #
# There's something underneath my bed #
# Oh, please believe I said #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# I caught them barking at the moon #
# Better be soon #
# Better be soon #
# Right is right
Rules are rules #
# This is more like April fool #
# I'm just winding you up I #
Money, money, money. Hey!
You got a date with justice, one-Eyed Bart.
Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man.
One-Eyed Betty!
I think you dropped something, mister.
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!
You've reached the end of the line!
I always wanted to go out with a bang!
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
Hold him steady!
Woody, hurry!
No!
Glad I could catch the train!
Now let's catch some criminals.
To infinity and beyond!
Reach for the sky.
You can't touch me, Sheriff!
I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs.
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"
"You're going to jail, Bart."
"Watch out!"
Mom!
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I 'm not here.
Oh, no, Molly!
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.
Happy birthday!
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!
"I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"
"Got it, Woody."
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
"Good work, Buzz."
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.
Wait! I can't find my other eye.
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind squeezing next to you?
Is it hot in here?
Here they come!
Sarge, you got it?
Mission accomplished.
Hooray!
Careful. Careful!
All right, guys. We got one shot at this. Everyone ready?
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.
Target is on approach.
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.
Hello?
Hello? Anyone there?
Molly, stay out of my room!
I wasn't in your room.
Then who was messing with my stuff?
It wasn't me.
Well, that went well.
He held me! He actually held me!
This is just sad.
Who we kiddin'?
The kid 's 17 years old.
We ain't ever gettin' played with.
Guys, hey, hold up.
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!
Not again!
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.
We are gathered, Woody.
Okay. First off, we all knew operation Playtime was a long shot.
More like a misfire.
But we've always said this job isn't about getting played with. It's about...
Being there for Andy. We know.
But we can try again! Right?
I 'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.
What?
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.
We're going into attic mode, folks.
Keep your accessories with you at all times.
Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition.
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.
Yeah, but now it's here.
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.
- Moving on?
- You're going AWoL?
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.
And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go.
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.
You're gonna need it.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.
How do you know?
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?
- I thought we were goin' to the attic.
- I hate all this uncertainty!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.
I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way.
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?
Yeah. Even Bo.
All good toys who've gone on to new owners.
But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!
He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here.
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm...
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!
There's games up there, and books, and...
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.
And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right?
Yeah.
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.
And he'll play with us then, right?
We'll always be there for him.
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready, and go out on a high note.
I 'd better find my other eye.
Where'd you leave it this time?
Someplace dark. And dusty.
Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay.
Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. I guarantee it!
You guarantee it, huh?
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?
Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together.
For infinity and beyond.
- Can I have your stereo?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I 'm taking it with me.
- Can I have your computer?
- No.
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.
Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash.
- Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.
Why do you still have these toys?
Molly, out of my room!
Three more days and it's mine!
Molly, you're not off the hook either.
You have more toys than you know what to do with.
Some of them could make other kids really happy.
What kids?
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.
What's daycare?
- Mom.
- No buts.
You choose the toys you want to donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside.
Poor Barbie.
I get the Corvette.
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.
Like what?
Like what are you gonna do with these toys?
Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.
- Maybe sell them online?
Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys.
They're junk.
Fine. You have till Friday.
Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.
That's what's happening.
- You need a hand?
- I got it.
Here.
So, you gonna miss me when I 'm gone?
- Lf I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.
Then, yes, I 'll miss you.
I can't breathe!
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?
Andy!
That's not trash. That's not trash!
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!
Okay, boy. To the curb!
No, Buster! No!
Get up. Buster!
- We're on the curb!
- I knew it would come to this!
Pull, everyone! Pull!
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!
It's triple-ply, high-density polyethylene!
There's gotta be a way out!
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?
Point. Point. Point!
Push! Push!
I can hear the garbage truck!
It's getting closer.
Buzz! Jessie!
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?
This doesn't make any sense.
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!
Fellas, I know what to do.
What the heck?
- We should 've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.
Now we need to go!
You're right. Come on.
- Buzz?
- Woody!
What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated?
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.
We're going to daycare!
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.
Attic? So how did we end up on the curb?
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.
And called us junk!
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.
Sure thing, college boy!
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.
Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone.
Great. Great! It's gonna take us forever to get back here.
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.
Well, Molly and I have been growing apart for years.
It's just... I can't believe she would throw me away!
- Welcome to the club, toots.
- Okay, everyone, listen up.
We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.
We'll hide under the seats till we get back home.
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.
Andy doesn't want us anymore.
He was putting you in the attic!
He left us on the curb!
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.
Just wait till you see what daycare's like.
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place for washed-up old toys who have no owners.
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.
As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home.
Can anyone see anything?
- There's a playground!
- Wow!
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!
So much for sad and lonely, huh?
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.
Perspective? This place is perfect.
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.
- Hey there!
- Wow!
Haven't seen you in ages.
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.
- What?
- Can you believe it?
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?
- Look!
- Wow!
What? What is it?
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I can't see!
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!
- So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.
Careful. These toys might be jealous of new arrivals.
- I want to see!
- Hey!
- Rex!
- It's my turn!
New toys!
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.
Buzz Lightyear at your service.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Thank you. May I?
The claw!
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I 'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.
But please call me Lotso.
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...
First thing you gotta know about me,
I 'm a hugger.
Look at you all. You've been through a lot today, haven't ya?
It's been horrible.
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.
We been dumped, donated, yard-saled, secondhanded and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait, you'll find being donated was the best thing that ever happened to ya.
Mr. Lotso, do toys here get played with every day?
All day long. Five days a week.
But what happens when the kids grow up?
Well, now, I 'll tell ya.
When the kids get old, new ones come in.
When they get old, new ones replace them.
You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten.
No owners means no heartbreak.
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.
Because we're Andy's toys!
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?
Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying.
Folks, if you want to step right this way...
Hi, I 'm Ken.
Barbie. Have we ever met?
I would 've remembered.
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.
Folks, if I can share, here at Sunnyside, we've got, well, just about anything a toy could ask for.
Spare parts, superglue, and enough fresh batteries to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.
Well, stop your worryin'.
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, puffed, and lightly buffed.
And this, well, this is where I live.
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.
And a whole room just for trying on clothes.
You have everything!
Everything except someone to share it with.
You need anything at all, you just come talk to me. Here we are.
Well, thank you, Big Baby.
Why don't you come meet our new friends?
Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him.
Abandoned by the same owner.
But we don't need owners at Sunnyside.
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.
We control our own destiny.
Watch out for puddles.
And here's where you folks'll be stayin'.
The Caterpillar Room.
- Look at this place.
- Wow!
Holy moly guacamole.
Jackpot, baby.
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
It's so beautiful!
What the... Hey, little guy.
How long 's it been since you all got played with?
It's been years.
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring, and you'll get the playtime that you've been dreamin' of.
Play! Real play! I can't wait!
Now, if you'll excuse us, we best be headin' back.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.
- Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.
- Will I see you again?
- I 'll see you tonight in my dreams.
Ken, let's get a move on.
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe, but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...
- Made for each other.
...made for each other.
- Yay!
- Yes.
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.
This is so exciting!
Sounds like kids to me.
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?
How many you reckon are out there?
They sound so sweet.
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.
But we need to go home.
We can have a whole new life here, Woody.
A chance to make kids happy again.
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!
And if he wants us at college, or in the attic, well, then, our job is to be there for him.
Now, I 'm going home.
Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz.
Buzz?
Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody.
What?
And what's important now is we stay together.
We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy!
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.
Whose name is written there?
Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore.
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.
You can't just turn your back on him now!
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!
Okay, fine. Perfect.
I can't believe how selfish you all are.
So this is it?
After all we've been through.
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"
Look,
I don't want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay.
Bonnie?
I gotta go.
Bonnie, you in here?
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.
What... What the heck?
Now, that's better.
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.
No, no, no, no!
Reach for the sky!
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...
You're my favorite deputy.
- Bonnie!
- Coming!
Great.
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.
Toys are for playtime.
Speaking of playtime, they're lining up out there!
- How many?
- There must be dozens.
I can hardly wait!
Places, everyone!
At last! I 'm gonna get played with!
- Rex?
- Come to papa.
'Here's a snake in my boot.
I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song.
A sheriff!
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?
It's good for you. But don't drink too much, or you'll have to...
Be right back!
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.
Can you tell me where I am?
The guy's just asking a question.
Well, excuse me.
I 'm trying to stay in character.
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.
Hello, I 'm Trixie.
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.
We're either in a café in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey.
I 'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor with life-changing news.
We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!
"I know where to hide."
She'll never find us in here.
What's wrong?
She found us! We need a spaceship to get away from the witch!
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?
Look, I just need to know how to get out of here!
There is no way out.
Just kidding. Door's right over there.
Well, cowboy, you just jumped right in, didn't ya? I 'm Dolly.
- Woody.
- Woody?
Really? You're gonna stick with that?
'Cause now's your chance to change it, new room and all.
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!
- Told ya.
- I found a spaceship!
Showtime.
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.
Three, two, one, blastoff!
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.
I got a kink in my slink.
My tail! Where's my tail?
Someone need a hand?
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.
Honey, the mustache?
I don't recall playtime being quite that strenuous.
Andy never played with us like that.
We're just gonna have to make the best of it.
But these toddlers, they don't know how to play with us.
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.
Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room.
- With the big kids!
- That's right.
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.
I 'll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room.
Blast. Try that one.
It's locked!
- Same here.
- Try the windows.
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.
Finest childproof lock in the world.
- We're trapped!
- Wait.
Did anyone notice the transom?
Oh, great. How do we get up there?
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...
- Three!
- Whoa!
Let go!
Go!
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!
Way to go, Buzz!
Yeah, you think they had a fun playtime?
They might hear you.
- Okay, now you start.
- I...
- Love...
- You.
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...
- Love...
- You.
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.
You are so smart.
Come on, Romeo. We're late.
- I 'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.
- All right.
- Here we go.
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.
Come on, duck.
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.
Let me have the duck, let me have the duck, let me have the duck!
Here is a duck.
- I won!
- Ah, man!
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.
Hey, what do you guys think of the new recruits? Any keepers?
Oh, please! Landfill!
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.
But that space guy, he could be useful.
He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives.
Neither are you, Chunk.
You got a little keeper yourself, didn't you, Ken?
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.
What do you expect from a girl's toy?
I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?
All them toys are disposable.
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.
Well, well. Looky who we have here.
Let me go!
Take him to the libary.
No!
1225 Sycamore.
Woody, what are you doing?
I gotta get outta here.
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?
Well, of course I did, more than I 've had in years, but, you see,
I belong to someone else.
- Who's "Yid-nuh"?
- I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."
Guys, it says "Andy."
He's my Bonnie.
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?
I 'll fire up the computer.
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!
Zip it, Buck Rogers.
You don't talk to Lotso till we say you can...
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?
He got out, Lotso.
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.
F-A-oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I 'm so sorry.
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?
The children in the Caterpillar Room are not age-appropriate for me and my friends.
We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room.
Well, request granted!
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.
Why, I 'd say we've found ourselves a keeper.
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!
We're calling you up to the big leagues, son.
From now on, you'll have anything you want.
Excellent. I 'll go get my friends.
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.
Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with.
But my friends don't belong there.
None of us do, I agree.
Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear anymore.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.
Family man, huh? I understand.
Put him back in the timeout chair.
What are ya... Unhand me!
Bring in the Bookworm.
Here it is.
It was filed under "Lightyear."
Let's see here.
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.
"Remove screws to access battery compartment."
What are you doing?
Stop!
Let go of me!
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure to its original factory settings..."
No!
"...slide the switch from
Play to Demo."
Stop! No! No! No!
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.
I 'll see what it was.
What do you see? Anything?
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!
I see Andy!
- What?
- That's impossible.
No, no, I really see him. In his room.
My other eye! The one I left behind.
'His is so weird. He's packing up.
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.
He's looking in the attic.
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!
He's looking for us?
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!
I think he did mean to put us in the attic.
Well, then,
Woody was telling the truth.
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.
Hey, you didn't believe him first!
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?
There's been a mistake.
We have to go.
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.
We were runnin' low on volunteers for the little ones.
They just love new toys, now, don't they?
"Love"? We've been chewed, kicked, drooled on.
Just look at my pocketbook!
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.
"Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?
I have over 30 accessories, and I deserve more respect...
That's better.
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth, except me.
Give it back, you furry air freshener!
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.
Whoa there, missy.
You're not goin' anywhere.
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?
Buzz! You're back!
Buzz?
Hey!
Look out!
What are you, nuts?
Buzz!
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!
You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance!
- "Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?
Oh, boy.
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!
Yes, sir!
Where do you think you're going?
Buzz! We're your friends!
Spare me your lies, temptress.
Your emperor's defeated, and I 'm immune to your bewitching good looks.
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!
Not him.
I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners.
Take him to the box.
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?
Bad baby! Bad baby!
Ken? What's going on?
Barbie! I told you to wait in the Dream House.
What are you doing to my friends?
Get in there!
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...
And give me my scarf back!
Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations.
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.
Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box.
Roll call at dusk and dawn.
Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box.
Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to.
Any prisoner talks back, spends the night...
In the box! We get it.
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.
But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself.
Don't worry, Commander.
Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy.
Listen up, folks.
We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside.
If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true!
But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.
Woody! What did you do to him?
You all get a good night's rest.
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.
1225 Syca...
Who's Velocistar237?
That's just a dinosaur toy down the street.
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.
Sycamore. Okay, enter!
Please don't be far. Please, please!
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!
I 'm going to college! Look at me!
I 'm big toy on campus! Hello!
- Hey, I 'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.
Hey, listen. If any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home.
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?
Well, it wasn't easy.
What do you mean "escape"?
Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair.
Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.
Lotso?
The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster.
But... How do you know that?
Chuckles. He'll tell you.
Yeah, I knew Lotso.
He was a good toy. A friend.
Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy.
A was there when Lotso got unwrapped.
Daisy loved us all.
But Lotso,
Lotso was special.
'Hey did everything together.
You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love.
One day, we took a drive.
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.
She never came back.
Lotso wouldn't give up.
It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's.
But by then, it was too late.
Something changed that day inside Lotso.
Something snapped.
She replaced us. Come on!
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.
Didn't she?
She don't love you no more!
Now come on!
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.
'Hen we found Sunnyside.
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.
He wasn't anyone's friend.
He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.
So how'd you get out?
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys, they don't stand a chance.
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.
Returning now would be suicide!
But what about your Andy?
Isn't he leaving for college?
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.
But he ain't ever comin' back.
Rise and shine, campers!
Commander Lotso, sir!
All quiet, nothing to report.
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.
Wait! What've you done with my husband?
Big Baby.
Sweetheart!
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!
Hello?
You shouldn't have come back, cowboy.
'Hey've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols.
You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.
I made it out once.
You got lucky once. Want my advice?
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.
Yeah, for how long?
I've been here years.
'Hey'll never break me.
'Here's only one way toys leave this place.
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.
Then it's off to the dump.
Look, I appreciate your concern, old-timer.
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I 'd sure be grateful.
Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through's the doors.
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.
Got it. What else?
Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long.
Hallway, lobby, playground.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.
You go over or under.
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.
The monkey's the eye in the sky.
He sees everything.
Classrooms.
Hallways.
Even the playground.
You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere.
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!
Recess! Come on, kids!
Hey, guys.
- Woody?
- Woody!
Woody!
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!
- You're alive!
- 'Course I 'm alive!
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?
Lotso did something to him!
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Return of the astro-nut.
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.
No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys.
From now on, we stick together.
But Andy's leavin' for college.
College? Hog-tie the mailman!
We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow!
Tomorrow? But that means...
It means we're busting out of here, tonight.
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!
No, there is one way out.
One way.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- Springy dog.
- Present.
Green guys.
- Cowgirl.
- Here.
Horse.
- Piggy bank.
- Y o.
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.
- Barbie.
- Here.
Potato Head.
Potato Head?
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!
Impossible!
Hey!
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, smoothie.
Well, well, well. You're turning out to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?
What did you think you were gonna do? Waltz right out of here?
Yeah, and I would 've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!
You're a purse with legs.
Take him back to the box.
No! No, not the box! I 'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.
Really. No, no, no!
Okay, check.
Good work, Lightyear. All right, resume your space-guy-thingy.
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!
Ken! Ken?
What do you want?
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go to the Butterfly Room. With you!
Yeah, well, you should 've thought of that yesterday.
I was wrong.
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!
Darn it, Barbie!
Okay, but things are complicated around here.
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!
Wait. I 'll do anything!
I 'll change your diapers!
Go get the tape!
And this is where the magic happens.
Look at all your clothes!
I can't believe you never brought me up here!
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.
Campus hero with matching sports pennant, huh?
Flower power! Oh, Ken!
No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie. No one.
Ken, would you model a few outfits for me?
Just a few?
Go get the key.
Where is it, where is it?
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff!
Make a move, porky!
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.
No wonder you're extinct.
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!
Help! Prison riot!
Get the tortilla.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Barbie?
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?
And how do we switch him back?
You can't make me talk. You can't!
But I 'd like to see you try.
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.
Barbie! Those were vintage!
It's okay. All right, go ahead, rip 'em, I don't care.
They're a dime a dozen.
Glitter tux.
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?
A Nehru jacket.
Barbie! Not the Nehru.
This is from what, 1967?
The groovy formal collection, yes!
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!
There's an instruction manual!
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!
Where's that manual?
I don't know why this couldn't wait until morning, Ken, but here you go.
What's takin' so doggone long?
So how do we fix Buzz?
What are you looking at, feathers?
Hey!
Yeah, fly away, you coward.
Well, that's just great.
Help! Prison riot!
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.
- What?
- I said, "No one can hear you."
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."
Shush! Will you be quiet?
Woody! You're back!
Stop him! Don't let him get out!
Star Command! I 've been taken hostage by my own prisoners.
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!
Unhand me, Zurg scum!
The Galactic Courts will show you no mercy.
It's not working. Why is it not working? Where's the manual?
Here we go! There should be a little hole under the switch.
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!
What?
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.
"Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds."
It's not my fault!
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!
Amigos! We're all amigos.
We gotta switch him back.
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.
Good luck, cowboy.
Here they come.
Come on, Buzz!
What took you so long?
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?
We haven't seen him.
Buzz.
Did you fix Buzz?
- Sort of.
- Behind you.
Someone's coming.
You would not believe what I 've been through tonight.
Darling! Are you okay?
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.
You've lost weight. And so tall.
You're a sight for detachable eyes.
All clear.
Come on. Come on.
We're almost there.
Back up. Back up!
Come on.
Woody!
Come on. We're almost there.
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.
- Is it safe?
- I guess I 'll find out.
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.
Come on down. But not all at once.
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Geronimo!
- Look out!
Thanks, Jess.
Almost there, guys.
Slink, you think you can make it?
Well, I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step.
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.
Okay, climb across.
You lost, little doggie?
Well, well. Look who's back.
I'm sorry, cowboy.
They broke me.
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?
He don't want you no more.
- That's a lie.
- Is it?
Tell me this, Sheriff.
If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving?
You think you're special, cowboy?
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.
Speak of the devil.
Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room and you need to avoid that truck.
Why don't you come on back, join our family again?
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!
And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours!
Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force.
If that's what you want.
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.
Not to me, there's not.
Fine. Then why don't you join her!
Oh, Ken!
Everyone, listen!
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair.
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top!
Anyone concur with Ken?
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.
Wait! What about Daisy?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Daisy? You used to do everything with her?
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!
She replaced you.
And if you couldn't have her then no one could.
You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since.
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.
She never loved me.
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.
Mama.
What? You want your mommy back?
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!
Push 'em in. All of 'em!
This is what happens when you dummies try to think.
We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is!
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.
Come on. Hurry!
For crying out loud!
Woody!
Oh, boy. Incoming!
Come on!
Barbie, no!
Woody!
No!
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.
We all here? Slinky? Rex?
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!
Buzz!
They'll never make it!
Look out!
Buzz!
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.
Buzz, you okay?
Buzz! Buzz!
That wasn't me, was it?
Buzz, you're back! You're back, you're back, you're back, you're back!
Yes, I 'm back. Where have I been?
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.
Woody! So where are we now?
In a garbage truck on the way to the dump!
Hold on, we're going in!
You got all your pieces?
The claw!
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!
No!
Hang on!
Woody! What do we do?
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...
- Woody!
- Slinky!
It's a magnet! Watch out!
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.
You might wanna take a look at this.
Quick! Grab something metal!
You heard the guy.
It's not working!
Help! Help me. I 'm stuck!
Help, please! Help!
Woody!
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.
Woody!
Go, go!
Thank you, Sheriff.
We're all in this together.
Right, guys?
Guys?
Woody! Down here!
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.
Woody, look. I can see daylight.
We're gonna be okay!
Hey!
I don't think that's daylight.
Run!
Sheriff! The button! Help me!
Come on!
Go. Go! Hit the button!
Hurry!
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?
No. No!
Lotso!
No!
Rex!
Buzz! What do we do?
The claw.
You know all that bad stuff I said about Andy's attic?
I take it all back.
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.
Oh, darling. You were so brave.
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.
My boys!
Daddy!
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?
Yeah. I 'd like to loosen his stitchin'.
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.
- Hey!
- What you got?
I had me one of these when I was a kid.
Strawberries.
Hey, buddy. You might wanna keep your mouth shut.
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.
What about you guys? I mean, maybe the attic's not such a great idea.
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!
Wait, I 'll check!
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?
Yeah. Just a few more boxes in my room.
Okay. Come on.
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!
All right. Go. Go, go!
Okay. All clear.
There you are.
- There you go.
- Buzz.
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.
Yeah, but not too much fun.
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.
Sure thing.
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?
'Course I will. Besides, I know about
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?
Honey, you want some food for the road?
I 'll get something on the way.
You know where to find us, cowboy.
Did you say goodbye to Molly?
Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times.
Andy.
Mom, it's okay.
I know. It's just...
I wish I could always be with you.
You will be, Mom.
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye to Buster?
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?
Who's a good doggy? I 'm gonna miss you. I 'm gonna miss you.
- I 'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.
Come on. Get the rest of your things.
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.
Hey.
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"
Mom.
- Andy?
- Hi.
Wow. Look at you.
Well, I hear you're off to college.
Yeah. Right now, actually.
So, what can we do for you?
I have some toys here.
You hear that, Bonnie?
So, you're Bonnie?
I 'm Andy.
Someone told me you're really good with toys.
These are mine, but I 'm going away now, so I need someone really special to play with them.
This is Jessie, the roughest, toughest cowgirl in the whole West.
She loves critters, but none more than her best pal, Bullseye.
Here.
This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!
The Potato Heads. Mr. And Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,
'cause they're madly in love.
Now Slinky here is as loyal as any dog you could want.
And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.
These little dudes are from a strange alien world.
Pizza Planet.
And this is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!
He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg.
To infinity and beyond!
Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys.
They mean a lot to me.
My cowboy!
Woody? What's he doing in there?
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha?
There's a snake in my boot.
Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember.
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.
And kind. And smart.
But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you.
Ever.
He'll be there for you, no matter what.
You think you can take care of him for me?
Okay then.
Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking the haunted bakery!
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
And we'll actually need the rocket.
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.
Look! They're being attacked by a real dog!
You can eat my poisonous scones!
Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head are in trouble.
Get on, Woody.
It's my friend Woody.
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.
Thanks, guys.
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.
Come on. Let's get some lunch.
So long, partner.
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.
New toys!
Noses.
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all super excited about your new home.
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."
That Barbie has some nice handwriting.
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!
I 'll do it! This is it! This is it!
- Yes!
- We did it!
High-five! Hold on.
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.
Yeah, she really got your smile.
What the...
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
Romeo, o Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Next season, we're doing Cats.
Or might I suggest Hamlet?
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.
I don't know what came over me.
Just go with it, Buzz.
SRI IS GOD
There is an ongoing struggle in which
Both teams really go for it.
Now it's a tie and Ice
Wolf is strong ...
And here they come!
What a struggle.
- Come on, body to body!
Take them widely.
- He flies over the ice.
Go there.
- He shoots. Nice rescue.
What a blow.
They are devastated.
There is a recognizable melody.
The coach calls for the Great defender, Derek Thompson.
And here comes the Tooth fairy!
Go for it!
What a disservice!
My tooth! My God, my tooth!
And the Tooth fairy, Derek Thompson, has struck again.
You may not tooth!
And that is the whole tooth and nothing else!
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.
Open the door for a tooth fairy.
Sanctions Pause No. 14, Derek Thompson.
Fifteen minutes.
Who is the Tooth fairy?
I I'm Tooth fairy!
Stop it. Stop.
I'm not scared, I play hockey.
We have a good time ...
What's going on?
- Thompson, come here.
Meet our future.
- New kid.
He will not be long before he is detected by the Kings, but ... while he is here, please protect him on the ice.
The rest is unimportant. Mick.
Derek Thompson, Mick Donnelly
Our First Line Server.
Donnelly, Thompson this is your bodyguard.
How's it going?
- Welcome to hockey.
Was there a veteran game today?
I did not know you've played.
I was a big fan of you.
Well, see you later.
Mr. Thompson! Tooth fairy!
I get your autograph?
- Yes, of course.
What is your name?
- Gabe.
I am in my third team in hockey league.
And my team won championships.
Fantastic. Good for you.
- When I play so high as you did.
You are doing a lot of hockey, h?
- Yes, almost every day.
And I take him almost every day.
How old are you?
- Eight.
Ok, so you have eight.
And you are third after two others?
Almost nine.
Somewhere in this country is a
7-year against the 12-year record ... and he makes them.
As if they are overwhelmed of a Cambodian lion.
And so many children in each league.
And when the time comes, kids will do.
Imagine reaching the NHL.
Probably not, but do it.
Put them out of your school ... but should not you, and before you can do something ...
They are nowhere.
Lower your expectations.
Then you'll be happy.
Please.
I want to suck your blood.
What?
What are you looking at, and why are you laughing so?
Why are not you afraid?
- Because the chips.
I can not eat?
They are bad for vampires.
I'm going to die.
I have an idea.
- I can not speak.
Feel dead.
Mom, my tooth came out.
Congratulations.
- The Tooth fairy visits me tonight.
Let's see.
You are such a big girl.
I'm the tooth fairy.
You were a vampire?
This is contradictory mythology.
I have a lot of homework.
Can I go?
Mama, it's time to go as Derek can make the child is ready.
Not yet. You take your pajamas?
Would it help if you
Randy deals again?
I will do it.
If I'm not alone with him.
Renee is here. A little ketchup.
Tooth Fairy ...
- I got it.
Listen, I have my pajamas.
- Dracula is back.
Chips, I love it!
What do you think about Donnelly?
- He's quick.
You think the next Kruchky.
- I love him already as a long lost brother.
Can we just play?
- Part.
I have some money shortages, but this signature ...
Tooth fairy says.
Ten U.S. dollars each, so this is a $ 100
I'm in..
You really should pay.
- I.
I insist warranty.
I'll be back.
- He took his card.
Seriously?
- Passport, so we can play.
Do not take the kids or something?
I'm home.
- Hello, darling.
H guys.
What juice?
- We have just juice.
I am a little tired.
Mother, mother!
What is it, honey?
- My tooth is gone.
The Tooth fairy took him.
But there is no money.
I saw all
Let's see, it will be stored somewhere.
The Vampire is back!
- No vampire time.
It is neither.
She went down first and see what your teeth worth the money they bring.
Right, Derek?
- How it works.
No, it does not.
You put your tooth under pillow ... flies in the Tooth fairy, tooth and
Leave a dollar.
Where is it?
Tell me if the Tooth fairy has been because I have 5, 10 ...
You're a big girl now, so we solve it as if ... there is no ...
Here it is.
- How was it there?
You have it in your sleep on site has undergone.
I forgot.
And then tell them that they
Tooth fairy is not real?
There are so many people unhappy because they stick to "what if".
So dreams are bad?
But if they lead to unrealistic expectations.
This is ridiculous.
- I know.
I go to bed.
You ... 're gone.
Word is not dramatic.
- I?
I tell her fantasies stops.
What?
Think of a fee. Subpoena.
What?
Thompson, Derek Thompson?
- Yes, God, I am.
Are you God?
- Thompson Are You?
Are you God?
- No, your social worker Tracy.
What is this?
How disappointing.
- Come on, please.
No thanks. Very elegant.
But what is?
- No idea.
But what is?
- Who is this guy?
Slayer dreams, illuminates your soul.
What have I done?
Why am I here? Where am I?
Nobody likes you here, or your position ...
The way you go, "Why here?
What is the big wings? ".
We have a problem?
- Yes, because you just said.
Tracy was nevertheless what a beautiful girl.
Not laugh, it's not funny.
This is strike 2, strike 3, you will not.

4th Strike
We take care of your uniform so as your registration and your workout.
Training for what?

A Tooth fairy ...
Excuse me.
Quiet all, he is harmless.
Okay?

Hands off.
It is very elegant.
Where were we?
- Help, please!
I'm in a nightmare!
Please, help me!
- The nightmare begins.
Did you try to the title?
Feeling Lucky?
Maybe. Hold it down.
I can not see anything.
Give them back not a good idea.
You want a piece?
Ready to start.
You have just one big mistake.
He has a magic wand.
Now a rabbit from a hat.
Feen fight!
Give him.

In just imagine the hammer.
Sladge Brothers and Jack.
Who do you want?
Fantastic.
You chose the wrong fee.
Wand. My heaven.
I've broken him.
What's going on?

Leek that so?
No idea that everyone here has a British accent.
- You took me back.
I must not effective enough?
I understand why men are not officers or suspended firefighters, but ... a pair of wings to fly all the way out the door.
Would not you have more respect for a person with wings or without wings?
You have no idea which

I can fly out and do something crazy.
Maybe I spit fire.
You do not know.
Sorry I interrupted.
It was better.

It seems that you will do it.
- No, I turn on your nose.

It looks like an iPod adapter.

Listen to your iPod.
Before you charge your iPod?
No. Really?

Sometimes when I get home
I double portion ... my feet dangling over inkwell.
When she sleeps, I go over her body ... when she wakes his footprints everywhere.

Taste it, come on. Very good.
Come test them.
They are very good.
They are good ...
Dogs bark, very handy.

How often should I apologize?
- Six times.

Who is your hobbit friend over there?
You stay here, OK.
You must learn from the best.
No label them as best dude.
And I will not fly.

Fist because we broke the ice.
No, it disappears.
Come to my home.

Dear Dog.
Do not hurt me, dog.
What is it?

That's it.
You could very well be the
Tooth fairy worst ever.
Besides, I need some things.
- Stuff?
Things.
The magic powder.
Stuff. Q. Tell
No more things.
- It's amazing.
Although half weeks of my job, how do I do?
Sorry, we have very little money.
Want to know why?
- Not really.
Because children are no longer faith, as they did.
We are not alone.
Even unicorns, leprechauns, dragons.
All these departments. All gone.
If this trend continues, no longer tandfeenland.
No child will still receive more visits from the Tooth fairy.
Ever.
- No visits from the Tooth fairy.
So what?
You really do not understand.
You do not understand that fantasies for children ... their ability to imagine something that is important?
Thus ignoring their souls.
It is the foundation that gives them to dream.
Dreams are bad.
Useless.
You're done.

Yes.

You kill me.
- How do you like that ending?
Can I check?
Oh no.
Can you see me?
This does not work.
- What is it?
What are you doing?
What Ziggy has given me?
Stay calm.
I just need the tooth.
- There is an alien on my balcony.
You are fantastic.
Lily is so pissed because they had a fee to post your trade fairs.
I've learned my lesson.
Never buy black market stuff.
I can not even 2 weeks continue.
- Yes, you can be friend.
Just make a bigger impact.
One day while taking it.
Social workers decide who can see us and who is not.
They wanted to know if you have ever given attention to me, or would listen to me.
But no.
Shut up.

You should really take the renovation.
If you want I can give you a pamphlet.

You need a week. Well done.
Great. Just what I need.

From now on, follow the rules.
You embrace the spirit of fairy.
And then listen again.

I will always be the best tooth.
You always draw you back from me and then ... you never call.
And when I finally fall something from you ... is that your deposit to pay.
What happened to you?
I would like to tell you, but I can not.
Why not?
I just can not.
I know what it is.
It is that you prefer.
You are afraid of a commitment to go.
You are nervous because it seriously.
Yes, that's it.
You know me so well.
I am nervous about how serious it is.
- What?
You are a woman, and quite frankly, you would not understand.
What?
I'm not nervous, because it is between us seriously.
I must not even think.
What?
I was a little sad.
And I love you so much.
I'm afraid to spoil and lose weight.
I understand.
I am so happy to you re doing well.
Can I get any of it?
What are you doing? Have you already started training?
- I come.
Hurry.
It is for me stood, flushed, beaten and arrested.
Stop complaining.
They promised to embrace the feengeest.
I really include feengeest.
But I do it ... on my way.
It is outside the rules.
- Yes.
I'm just here for a tooth.
Only tooth.
I take my glove.
Good.
Now enter the tooth. Easy.
Let it go.
I said, 'let loose'.
Very good.
Good evening.
Who are you?
I'm the tooth fairy.
Yes.
Okay? Ok.
Mick, how you doing
So far with you?
I'm the new player and ... some teeth from the Wolfs are long, if you understand me.
This reference, Derek Thompson, the Tooth Fairy?
No, I respect my parents.
Thompson takes you beneath your wings?
- No, its wings are bad ... mine is new and ready to fly.
I want my own thing.
A secure young player, good luck.
- Thanks.
The Ice Wolf makes them simple.
Mick, you are.
- Finally.
Good luck, kid.
I mean it.
I think you are doing great.
You are the best hockey player ever.
Whatever.
Come on.
Donnelly, ending the game, and go straight past.
The Ice Wolf pass the blue line.
Haig is on the web.
These two rivals go some battles with each other.
Here we go.
PUK is in the corner.
Donnelly goes after him.
What happened to Donnelly, Jim?
- What are you doing?
PUK is extracted from Donnelly and picks it up.
Save him!
He is terrible.
What happened, Jim?
Has anyone found him, Jim?
What's going on?
He laughs?
Is everything okay?
What?
Try to test me?
- Get off the ice.
If you want to play games but you go on the bench.
But on Thursday. Hurry.
What did I miss?
Why do you bark?
I do not know.
I blew it right now.
It's okay.
We must continue practice.
Everyone will laugh at me.
Maybe I should not do.
Maybe they do, or ... you can blow taken out.
You can not score if you do not shoot.
Yes? When did you last shot?
When I started, I was a goal scorer.
First Round, 'The Devils' ass.
In 'The Bigs' game.
What happened?
- I broke my shoulder in Chicago.
They have put me in a lower class to to recover, and it lasted forever.
I was so angry and frustrated that I am a night a person from New Heaven took to grazing.
Hit a couple of his teeth out the audience was crazy ... and when they called me
'the tooth fairy.
And it was with me.
And I have not scored for years.
But I have more penalty minutes than anyone else in the league.
If you are not completely healed or shoulder?
It is not the same.
- How do you know?
You try not agree.
You can not score if you do not shoot.
If you do, will
I do it.
Well adopted.
And a tooth.
It must have been a good time when you handed the tooth.
I genteresseerd how it feels.
- Find it out yourself.
I'm not a fairy with wings.
Put it out again.
Why can not you have wings?
Want to know something about evolution fairy?
Who wrote it?
"Charles Darwing?
Developments Feen Feen cultivate some wings, and some do not.
I am one of the unfortunate.
- Tooth fairy if you not have wings.
You have it all.
- It's true.
You must show them your power.
Speed, masculinity, flexibility.
How do I do?
To peasants around.
No, come back.
Where are you going?
- Check that door again.
It is almost one meter high, you is nearly 2 meters long ... go back.
A dinosaur!
- No.
Again, I am.
- Is everything okay?
Why save the child?
Back to my roots, it is my worst nightmare.
The success of all
You look like a reindeer so beautiful with your legs.
You dance.
Not with the child in themselves.
Amnesia Powder.
It sounded good.
You make them away tomorrow.
What do you think?
Nice. Great. Randy Harris.
Talent Show.
I think the thing is fun.
You think I can be a famous rock star.
Like Clapton, Hendrix, or Stevie revons?
Fair?
- Yes.
You're pretty good.
Let's say that you work very hard to continue.
Let's say you 13jarige the best guitarist in the neighborhood is.
It is so.
You should know that there
Many neighborhoods.
And a lot 13jarige guitarists, but somewhere out there a 12jarige ... that kill guitar.
You know what? Yes, it is possible.
Take them to graze.
In the third half of the match was the Arrows ... 43 and this is yet another great game.
The arrows face and get away.
You're back.
- Do you clean your pants on?
It's okay.
You want them to wonder.
The Ice Wolf pushed the PUK on Arrow's half, and the Lion is chasing.
The coach leaves Donnelly back to the game.
Now they've got the puck behind the blue line.
And here comes the bank of Thompson, and replaces Dobs.
Thompson fits Browley and takes him over.
Thompson goes back into the game while Donnelly is on the side.
Thompson takes the puck with his stick, and Donnelly is with him.
It is against two n with Thompson take the lead.
Donnelly shouted that he would give off.
Thompson appears to fit, he makes the pass,
He has left wide open goals, the goal is open.
What can he do?
The arrows are on the ice, the shoot and score.
Jim, it appeared Thompson would
Just shoot, and he suffocated.
You're not a hockey player, but
An example statement attraction.
Look at the game tomorrow from the bank.
Asshole.
Come on, guys.
Great.
How was your race?
Not good.
- Dad, I have a loose tooth.
Great, baby.
- What?
Everything. Nothing. Forget it.
- Can we go practice?
Can we skip the lesson today.
I tried just did not.
Talent show is tomorrow.
- I can you.
I should have at least n times through.
- You do not.
I did need.
I need some more practice, so I can win.
No matter what you do the talent show ...
You will never be a famous rock star.
Only one other child with a guitar.
Do yourself a favor and give up.
It is for his own good.
Believe me.
Come on, Tess.
- What happened to you?
I had a bad day?
- A bad day?
A bad day, huh?
- No, it is not good.
You never talk with my children.
It's over between us.
You know what your problem is?
You can not say
'what if'.
And it never will be.
Who wants to hear good news? In.
Come on.
Why are you here?
- Lily has given me this.
Feen Teachers Proof.
- It is only a proof but I am on the road.
You should now be on the way home, because I go to bed.
This is due to you.
We must celebrate.
I know a place where all good mothers are fairy.
Are you crazy?
I just lost everything means something to me.
My friend, children ... and I probably have my skates for good on willows hung.
Just because I like an idiot the Tooth fairy crap you think.
And see what it has brought me.
You do n trial after all these years, it will not work and then simply pass?
So it would not be easy.
And you know it.
I will tell you what I know.
I know you do not have wings.
This means that you can not fly.
This also means that one never may be a tooth fairy.
And what happens if you have a ten-storey building to flee?
I will tell you.
Plat! So.
You know what really sad?
The person who makes you most all your dreams is not murder ...
Carly or randy, or
I find it yourself.
Go away. Well.
Fine.
I go to bed.
A 24 minute sets the third time.
The Ice Wolf still 1 to 0
And Derek Thompson is still trainer in his dug-out.
I think that whole game has he has not seen the ice.
Come on.
- When the game goes ...
Andreas Patrinkle replace the newcomer,
Thompson continues.
What is this?
Another blow.
Donnelly picked up along the PUK.
He goes across.
He has plans to return.
Donnelly makes every
Motion is just good.
Donnelly will be to go and almost get out of position and Donnelly goes along.
He will shoot. And he ...
Against the bar.
Rick, what happened?
He blew his whistle.
Offscreen Patrinkle were killed, and I think he does not stop.
Thompson, go there.
Go.
Come on, guys.
- The Ice Wolf 1 minute ... to score, or an extension.
Thompson looks at the clock.
And they start to hunt, when the clock counts down.
It seems that Thompson take part because he must.
Thompson got a shot.
How can there be no punishment?
He was beaten mess.
I think the Tooth fairy was a payback.
Look for Thompson, Jim.
His legs seem to get back on track.
Thompson flies over the ice, and
I can not make friends.
This is gonna hurt.
No, he thought he not hit.
Unbelievable.
He takes the puck out and flying over the ice.
Thompson makes movements we have not seen.
Who is that guy.
He is only through the n defender.
He becomes the defender,
I think he will decrease.
No, he stops, see what the guy leaves.
He shoots.
Derek Thompson has been nine years not shot ... and so a great shot I've ever seen.
With my arm.
Tommy Mayor Would Shock we do it again.
Not bad.
Great shot, dude.
Here we go.
Even 20 seconds, while both teams go to the center spot.
Oh, no.
The Ice Wolf, the puck, and a pass to Thompson ...
Who give away.
- Why would he do it, Nick?
I have no idea, Jim.
- I can not abandon them.
This is my last chance to play the game.
To leave when I arrived.
- From what I have viewed, you earn it.
Thompson, what are you doing?
Are you not a student?
You break the rules or not?
Please, I have learned from the best.
Look here first to solve ...
Before he takes its decision.
This is Carly's house.
- 14, come on.
Thompson, go back in the box.
I can walk. Lily does not know.
But I want to know.
I need this for home care.
Let us do it.
- How? You can not fly?
Good time to learn.
Yes it is.
Take them to graze.
If you want to fly, you must believe.
No panic, but it is a huge memory gun.
It does not hurt and you feel nothing.
Remember me.
That you do.
Good luck with your car find.
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.
You have a nice costume.
I must tell you something.
I was wrong, it
Tooth fairy is real.
And it's me.
I do not think hockey.
I'm the real Tooth fairy.
- No, you do not.
"You are the real Tooth fairy.
- Did our secret, ok?
Randy.
What are you doing here?
I need talking to you.
Go away.
- Listen here ...
I was wrong, what
I said yesterday.
I do not care.
- You must continue playing guitar.
You really have talent.
And something you love is never a waste of time.
I'm so sorry.
Even if I would, it still can not.
I have destroyed my
Guitar, remember?
So no talent show.
Hold on.
Maybe this helps?
That's great!
How did you do?
- Magic generator for all purposes.
What clothes do you have?
There you will find out.
And now for the clothes and talent show.
Come on.
Derek.
Mama! Derek is the tooth fairy.
You have a fairy costume rental property to do with Tess.
Yes.
That is what I did.
Derek is giving me a new guitar, and brings me to the talent show.
What time is it?
You never get.
Do not worry, it will we make it on time.
You like that.
And you get dressed we see you there.
Oh yes.
Where is your car?
- No car in front.
Hold on.
How can it be?
- It's good.
How is this possible?
On one particular evening, I found an appeal under my pillow.
What is a call?
This is an invitation to go to feenland.
Feenland?
- Yes, I got these wings.
I have met a person who called Tracy.
He looks like a tooth maker but with the eyes of a tuna.
Moreover, I could shrink me to ten centimeters.
Will we again?
What is it?
Sorry mate, but
I have enough rules.
Randy, there you are.
I searched everywhere. You're turn.
Quickly and be ready.
Another tooth.
- Thanks.
Sure.
Now I will go to a concert.
The best have some rules violated, Mr.
Thompson.
But I have helped Carly and then Randy ... and Tess is only six years, so that it will soon forget.
Although they do not forget that they now at least ...
... They will always
- Always know what?
They will always have faith.
Like me.
I get it now, dreams are good.
For all.
Mr. Thompson ...
I hereby relieve you
Tooth fairy from service.
You're right.
- She is a pro.
Congratulations.
Stop it this way.
I prefer that no physical contact.
You can find me funny.
I know you liked me.
You have now very much away, I know ... but somewhere in there, do you like me.
Not doing so frisky.
I really must go.
- Can you still waiting?
Tracy, I must also speak with you.
What is it?
- Everybody that Mr.
Thompson can recover ... deserves it more than any other.
Is there ...?
- These are your wings, Tracy.
Wear them with pride, each once you download a tooth.
You are a dental, companion.
- I have my wings.
You have your wings.
See that you need fixed.
I just do not know why
I talk so crazy.
Thank you, Lady.
This is all good and I am very proud of you ... you are the biggest Tooth fairy world, but I really need to go.
Someone must help me down here.
Tracy, you will do, or should I do?
A gift?
I'm afraid not.
You will soon no longer remember what happened here.
Why?
Because we always do.
I will never forget.
I still can not believe you came into the game.
This is because it is here.
Thank you, Tracy. For everything.
You big giraffe with your four eyes.
Back to the zoo.
And you and running back to Easter Island.
Brothers are still in town.
Let me once again meeting the guys.
You are my husband.
- And you are my fee.
Maybe we should keep in touch.
With e-mail?
We will meet best email.
Do you blog?
- I blog too.
I would like to read your blog. Facebook?
- Really?
I can bury you.
- I think that is fantastic.
There you are, I found you.
Yes, I had to ...
I am so excited.
- I.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.
Come on, Randy.
Still a big applause for our newest artist ...
Randy Harris.
Randy!
You go, Randy!
Well done Randy!
I wondered why we do not marry?
What if we get married?
Did you hear what I said?
I said "what if".
Yes.
We get married.

Oh, after you.
You worried?
- Superman does not worry.
Lex?
Right here.
You diseased maniac.
I'll take it from here.
You feel okay, Superman?
Lex, I'm surprised you took time away from your presidential campaigning and came to Gotham city for this.
Oh, dear lady, as a nominee it's my pleasure and privilege to be here.
Especially, if you win.
And now, ladies and gentlemen.
The moment you've all been waiting for.
We're here tonight to honor a great man.
A man who has proved time and again
'his first priority is helping those in need.' this year's man of the year award goes to... Bruce Wayne.
Next year, buddy.
I despise that guy.
Bruce, will you say a few words?
Well, there's not much to say.
I do what little I can.
Since every once in a while everyone needs a helping hand.
Though I'm not sure
I deserve an award for it.
'You heard him.
He doesn't deserve it.'
'which is just as well, since we got a last minute entry.'
'who has been there for you?'
'one man who has made it his mission'
'to improve the lives of people around him.'
'he has remodeled our buildings.'
'helped keep our banks free of unnecessary clutter.'
'you have always shown your appreciation.'
'what you need?
We'll do anything for you.'
'and why stop now?'
A standing ovation!
Did not expect that.
But I'll take it.
And also, everything else.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm going to purr-loin your valuables.
Riddle me this.
What's green and found in your wallet?
Money?
- Um, no. Not anymore.
Wait!
Sorry, to rain on your terrain, my dear.
Thanks so much.
Well, well, Lex Luthor.
Presidential candidate and Superman's least favorite bald person.
No, thanks. I don't want to get joy buzzed.
Oh, don't worry,
I didn't want to shake hands.
I want your watch.
Nice running into you.
Let's do it again some time.
- Oh, we will.
Speech.
- Come on, joker.
Speech.
- Come on.
What a night, such an honor.
I'm speechless.
Ah, who am I kidding?
When am I ever speechless?
Look at that face.
It's like, what's he gonna say?
What's going to come out of that mouth of his?
Sorry, to wipe that grin off your face, joker.
You're not sorry, you're not sorry at all.
Riddle me this, Batman.
What wears a mask and is unconscious?
You.
Let's get him.
Let's ask the coin?
'Get going, Robin. '
- 'I was waiting for you. '
Ah, my kind of party.
Good food, good people.
Good goody bags.
Hey, bat-lame and slobin.
Why are you guys hanging around?
You see what I did there?
We're here to get those valuables you stole, joker.
And Bruce Wayne's man of the year award.
This is my award it very clearly says, me, joker.
Oh, you just-you ju...
You just stuck that on there.
Robin, focus on your flying.
'Sorry.'
Oh, I missed.
You like shark, Batman?
'Because I think they're going to like you. '
Oh, come on!
I can't keep up.
I'll take it from here.
You like missiles, Batman?
Because I think they're going to like you.
Let's see, what do we have?
Oh, good. You like pie, Batman?
'Cause I think...
Ah, forget it.
Where does he get these unbreakable toys?
Oh, come on!
Oh, see, now you get out!
You are afraid of a real fight.
Yeah, you're so scary.
Watch the suit, boys.
Thanks for helping out, Batman.
Hey, you know,
I also was... part of this.
Hey, guys, need a hand?
With what? Parking?
Yeah, sorry. I wanted to be there for your award.
Ah, I mean, uh,
Bruce Wayne's award.
Me too. Kids weren't invited.
So, saw you put a big hole in the theatre.
I'll get it repaired.
I already did that.
Also, I put your boat back in the water.
Hey, thanks!
Yeah, thanks.
You know, you should really try not to make such a mess while you're fighting crime.
I can see you smirking in there.
X- ray vision.
Aren't there people somewhere else that need your help right now?
Yeah, actually there are.
I should go. See you, guys.
Bye, Superman!
He's so nice.
- Yeah, he's great.
You were kinda rude.
I was doing a systems check.
See you at the batcave.
Scenes of chaos tonight at the Gotham city theatre where the joker has interrupted the prestigious man of the year awards.
Watch the suit, boys.
This was the fifth annual man of the year ceremony held in Gotham but only the second to be brought to a premature end
'by a gang of rampaging villains. ' computer... I have an election to win.
Looks like another stay in arkham asylum for the joker.
Love you, joker!
I'll win in a landslide.
Oh, come on.
'First Batman, second Superman. '
Kryptonite.
'Batman seems to have recovered all the stolen property' including Bruce Wayne's man of the year award.
The only thing left for joker, a swift return to arkham asylum.
Along with the title, goon of the year.
This is Clark Kent on assignment in Gotham city for daily planet online.
'Hey! '
I was watching that.
Too much television is bad for you, pumpkin.
How does he sneak all that stuff in?
Clark Kent!
Really despise that guy.
Coming all the way to Gotham city to insult me.
Me, a hometown boy who made good.
'You're right.
You don't deserve that. ' that's right. I don't.
Eh, wait. Who said that?
'How would you like to be out of arkham right now'
'and given a chance to take revenge on Batman'
'and the rest of this ungrateful city? ' well, I'd have to be crazy to say no to that offer.
Unless you're just one of the voices in my head.
In which case,
I'm crazy anyway.
What?
Oh, hey, Lex!
You've come to get your watch back?
Or did a bus from Metropolis get lost and breakdown?
First, I don't take the bus.
And second, yes, give me my watch.
So, what you got there?
This, my friend, is the deconstructor.
It emits a unique energy.
One that is absorbed so quickly by any... shiny black object that it causes it to pull itself apart.
What?
Nifty! What's it got to do with me?
First, I need help replacing its power source.
It doesn't run on aa batteries.
Kryptonite.
And second, I might need some of that joker gas you are so good at making.
Oh, yeah.
I guess that could come in handy for someone running for president.
You help me, you can use the deconstructor to your heart's content.
Know anybody who has lots of shiny, black, unbreakable toys?
I don't know who you're referring to.
Come on! Batman!
You were...
Joking. I'm the joker.
'Prisoner escape!
Repeat, prisoner escape! ' we should be going.
Can I just have one try?
Joker, come on.
It's a shame.
Now someone's going to have to fix this.
But the good news is, I'm out of prison.
Joker!
Hey, what's going on?
It's a riddle.
- Oh, come on!
That's my thing.
'Justice league watchtower calling Batman. ' justice league watchtower calling Batman.
This is Batman.
Just checking your location in case of emergency.
I'm in the batcave.
Sounds like an emergency.
It's alright. I got it.
You got dressed fast.
Well, I've just started sleeping in the costume now.
May I?
Oh, well,
I think I should do it.
I thought you were going to let me play with that thing.
Dah! What's this?
Do I need this?
Joker, could we move things along?
You're no fun to shop with, Lexie.
Hey!
Wait!
Stop!
Okay, we can go.
On second thought,
I have an idea!
Joker, come on!
I'm an artiste.
I like to challenge myself with a bigger canvas.
Commissioner.
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
No problem, Jim.
Commissioner Gordon is what you need to call him.
What's the situation?
There's been a breakout at arkham.
'The bridge automatically submerges'
'during a prison break. '
'unfortunately, it's so old'
'it takes a long time to raise again. '
I'll get over there and start cleaning up.
Batman, wait for me.
You won't make it.
- Oh, yeah? Watch me.
Uh, Robin, I think you should listen to your-your-your Batman.
Don't worry about me, Jim.
Uh, commissioner Gordon.
Oh, man, should've listened.
Should've listened.
Yep, should've listened.
Hey, come on, get him.
Yeah.
Eat a brick, Batman!
What do we do?
You put your bike back together,
I'll take care of this.
'They've got the high ground. ' but I've got better aim.
That was easy.
A little too easy.
They were only meant to distract us.
From what?
Holy baloney!
Totally scared catwoman.
Did you see that?
Oh, Robin.
Come on, you've got to give me this one.
Now, Robin, what were you saying?
Something catty, I believe.
Alright, everybody, back inside.
Let's ask the coin.
Yeah, the coin says "no. "
You know that's where you're gonna end up eventually.
Not this time.
Perfect!
You brought my bike.
Can I drive?
I wanna drive.
You gotta let me drive.
Sorry, Harley Quinn, the coin says "no. "
You take catwoman.
I'll get the three in the Jeep.
What about the others?
- We've got time.
Bane's mole machine is not built for speed.
Go.
Bad news, two-face.
Batman's on our tail.
So, we'll lose him in the sculpture garden.
Okay.
Oh, for crying out loud!
Left or right?
Left.
What are you doing? Turn!
Oh, without the coin
I don't know which way to go.
Oh, stop it.
Riddler baby, you should've...
Let you drive.
I know!
You're not gonna find any cheese in this maze, rat-boy.
Rat-boy?
You get rat-boy from Robin?
You were saying... something catty, I believe.
It's defined now!
I can't control it.
Well, we contained the break out.
All the prisoners are accounted for.
Except the joker.
He must've been the first one to break out.
Smuggled in some kind of explosives.
No, I don't think so.
There'd be blast marks, powder burns, something.
It's as if the bricks just flew out.
Well, yeah. No, I mean, you didn't let me finish.
I was gonna say, was gonna say smuggled in some explosives which would be the usual way, he would break out.
Which he didn't, because there is no sign of an explosive.
Hey, look at this.
Looks like some kind of residual radiation.
Packaging remote tie-in.
Bat computer.
Remote tie-in, active.
Identify residual radiation.
Radiation consistent with energy signature of u. S. Defense department project.
J.s. G- 817 currently under development at Lex corp.
Well, I think we know who broke joker out of prison.
Lex Luthor.
What would an upstanding presidential candidate like Lex Luthor want with the joker?
I've heard that Lex Luthor may not be so upstanding.
You might wanna tell somebody.
Election day is tomorrow.
Sir, there's been a break in at Ace chemicals.
Wouldn't be surprised if that was joker's first stop.
Wait!
Joker, how's it coming?
You can't mess something like this.
Lex! It's a boy.
Just like arkham.
So, I can stop carrying this?
I mean, now we have other samples.
I can't go anywhere without making a mess.
He didn't just break in here to do this.
Come on.
Promethium, xenon, Mercury, tantalum and dialum.
And those aren't the chemicals he spilt all over the floor?
No.
So, uh, we're gonna leave now, right?
Yes.
Got to give it to the joker, that is kinda cool.
It'll be really cool when that fire ignites the rest of the chemicals in the building.
What's that?
Acid. It'll soften the planks.
Hey, guys.
Calm down.
Again.
That is great.
Isn't that great, Batman?
Destroyed all the evidence of the crime scene.
So, who blew this up?
Long story.
We've got it covered.
Okay, well, just let me know, uh, volcano in Mexico.
Call me, if you need me.
Uh, Batman, maybe he could help with this.
I mean, he's had a lot of experience dealing with Lex Luthor.
We don't need him.
Well, it seems like just now we needed him.
We'd have been fine jumping off the roof.
I think we would have broken our legs.
We've broken our legs before.
Yeah, but I didn't like it.
I mean, if we just call him.
Robin. We can't go through life expecting Superman or anyone else to save us whenever things get tough.
The only people we can rely on, is ourselves.
Bat computer, tie-in.
Bat computer remote tie-in. Active.
Access chemical database.
What substance can be produced to recombination of the following chemicals?
Promethium, xenon, Mercury, tantalum and dialum?
Accessing.
No substance found.
What substance can be approximated through the combination of the chemicals?
'Accessing. '
'listed chemicals can combine to form'
'an approximation of kryptonite. ' kryptonite?
We better call Superman.
We're not... going to call Superman.
Activate tracking systems.
Detect nearby sources of kryptonite.
Affirmative.
There it is.
Maybe, we should let Superman know.
We do and we'll be putting him in danger.
Can we ever leave together?
No! You tricked me.
Oh, don't worry.
Nice job.
So, Lex, when you're president can I be vice president?
I think we've got company.
You didn't answer my question.
'Auto drive, activated. '
Kryptonite.
Batman!
Oh, my goodness. Beaten again.
No hard feelings.
Where's your car?
Substance is 84% similar to kryptonite.
No harmful effects to natives of Krypton.
'That doesn't make sense. '
I had the bat mobile tracking kryptonite.
It wouldn't have picked this up.
There must have been kryptonite in the Van.
What's the point of making kryptonite that wouldn't harm
Superman anyway.
We'll put it away with the other kryptonite just to be safe.
'Why do we have so much of this stuff? '
I keep it in case Superman decides to be a bad guy one day.
You expect the worst of everybody.
Yeah.
What's happened?
We've lost the signal.
Don't worry.
It's directly ahead.
Beyond these walls, friend lie the keys to the destruction of Superman.
And Batman too, right?
Sure. Yeah. Fine.
'Intruder alert! Intruder alert! ' someone's broken into the batcave?
'Fake kryptonite. ' it was a homing device.
We were set up.
Hello! Anybody home?
We're here.
And we brought deserts.
Come on, we're guests.
You can't offer us a lousy cup of coffee?
Hey, is that the batboat?
Oh, gee.
Could've sworn it was there a minute ago.
Hey, look.
The batwing.
Must be seeing things.
We gotta get outta here.
But, Batman...
- Go.
Hey, Batman, penny for your thoughts?
Are we going upstairs?
I'd love to see the rest of the place.
Going down.
We don't have a lot of time.
Jump!
Let him go, we have to find the vault.
You're right. It's time to serve desert.
Where does he keep the kryptonite?
I just know he has it.
Not where he hides it.
Computer, where is the kryptonite?
Kryptonite location is protected by security access codes.
Computer, do you know who I am?
Lex Luthor, presidential candidate owner and founder of lexcorp industries.
Very good. Now, I'd like...
A corporation that serves as a cover for a variety of Luthor's criminal operations.
Involving smuggling, robbery, extortion, bribery.
Yeah, alright. That's enough.
Here. Let me do it.
Yeah!
Security access, verified.
How much time do we have before those pies go off?
Oh, like five minutes.
Maybe that was five seconds.
Run.
Maybe we should call for Superman.
Go ahead.
Hey, Superman!
See, you can't rely on anyone.
Nice job.
Art is always better if it's bigger.
Hey, isn't that
Bruce Wayne's mansion?
Bruce Wayne?
Really despise that guy.
Hey, guys, sorry it took me a second.
Hey, Batman, I think
I fixed the whirly-bat.
I'm... gonna go work on the batboat now.
Why didn't you tell me
Luthor was involved?
I was handling it.
Yeah, looks like you had it all under control.
Look, I'll hang around and give you a hand.
Remember, I can do anything.
You know what was in there?
What?
- Kryptonite.
That's what they wanted the whole time.
It must be what powers that deconstructing device.
I picked up Krypton on the Batmobile scanner.
So, now they can neutralize your gadgets and my powers.
Question is why?
What are they up to?
I don't know.
Tomorrow is election day, so we're running out of time.
We'll just have to go ask Lex Luthor.
You're just going to walk right into lexcorp headquarters?
Yep. You worried?
Superman does not worry.
'We can take this to get there.' introducing, the new, flying batboat.
You need a hand?
- No, I'm good.
Vice president joker.
Doesn't quite sound right, does it, Lex?
Not really. No.
Alright, sun will be up soon and the voters will be heading out to vote. Let's shut it down.
'Okay, did not need to turn off all the lights. '
Not the way I like to travel.
Come on, cheer up, sourpuss.
Not cool.
Oh, after you.
We're here to see Lex Luthor.
And you are?
Seriously?
Seriously.
I'm Superman. He's Batman.
Are those last names?
Even his receptionist is evil.
Just one name each.
- Like Madonna.
Oh, I see, you're down here.
Mr. Luthor is expecting you.
First elevator.
What's that song?
Sounds familiar.
I don't listen to music.
Either of you guys know the score of the game?
I don't follow sports.
Seven-three, St. Louis. Ah.
Ah, shouldn't have asked.
Nice costumes.
Lex?
Right here.
I'll take it from here.
'You feel okay, Superman? '
I hope you voted before you got here.
'Because you might not be leaving. ' you diseased maniac.
No one is going to elect you president.
Oh, yes, they will.
Once we've flown over the country dispensing my friend, joker's gas, I'll win in a landslide.
I was going to be vice president but I changed my mind.
It wasn't working for me.
Since I was deprived of the man of the year award in Gotham city, we're starting at their city hall.
Sorry, you won't be there.
'When I'm president,
I'll build a statue of you. '
You're not going to build him a statue.
No, I'm not. But you won't be there to call me on it.
Wait a second!
What are you going to do to the dynamic dumdum?
Joker, I have an election to win.
But who will I play with if he's dead?
Robin's still around.
If we eliminate Batman
Robin will probably put on the suit and say he's Batman.
No, it won't be the same.
Wow, did not expect that.
Let's go get out the vote.
'Alright. '
What the...
Joker, do you know how expensive that was?
I've no idea what it cost, no.
Nice plan.
Now, we know what they're up to.
We have to get to Gotham city.
- I should warn you.
I fly close to that kryptonium...
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
I thought I took care of him.
If I had a dollar for every time I said that.
Keep flying.
I'll deal with this.
Ah! Lex, we're losing altitude.
You alright?
- Yeah.
Being that close to the kryptonite weakened me.
We bought ourselves a few minutes.
We've got to get to the centre of town.
I don't think I can fly yet.
I guess we can get there some other way.
Two dollars or a token.
I have tokens.
Fellow citizens, thank you for joining me today.
I don't want to keep you from voting for too long.
I just wanna say a few words.
'What do you think of your presidential candidate? ' we love him.

I... think I'm going to cry.
Get goin'.
Take a left up here.

Where have you been?
- Getting some help.
Well, Batman, any last words?
Yeah. Look, you're on TV.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's also visible from space, you idiot.
Calling all justice leaguers.

Well, that was fun.
There is a little good news.
At least, you're not going to be president.
- Great work, Batman.
- I have to admit.
I couldn't have done it without a little help from my friends.
Uh, a little?
Well, Bruce Wayne said, when he was given the, man of the year award...
...that "everybody needs help now and again."
Well, he was a wise man.
What did you do with all the kryptonite?
I put it in a safe place.
We might need it one day if,
Superman decides to go bad.
See! I'm not the only one.
- You know, I can hear you.
So bats, you need a little help rebuilding the bat cave?
No, Robin and I...
- Yes, we'd like some help.
Say it with me.
Okay, we probably could use some.
Are, are you asking me?
Are you asking me to help you rebuild the bat cave?
Well, no. I was asking, green lantern.

 Then the king ...
 Once upon a time there was a kingdom ...
 dad told me when my birthday is ke10.
 I love my father's story ...
 A future where all people will live forever!
 Eventually everything becomes strange, crowded population of the kingdom began.
<font color=cyan>  Subtitle By: GingErwan
Removing  royal mandate to reduce the Population ...
 decree of the King.
All my people, please select a family to die.
A mass executions bring back much-needed space.
I Apologize for the inconvenience, but it is a necessity.
Each family was murdered.
 Except for one family.
Your honor, we are unable to decide.
We loved each other so that we all die together.
No! They can not die! They guard the bakery!
 They make the best cinnamon bread in the kingdom!
And if we each own pieces?
With the discount will be combined as one person less to stay here.
Interesting.

 But her daughter refused.
Dad, I love my legs.
Do not be selfish! Like one of us dies?
- You can save my arm!
- After my right ear!
There is no problem about losing one of my fingers.
I walked with my nose!
I guarantee the foot, wrong!
LEG x 2.1 = LOVE Well, I have another.
Okay, I'll do it.
 Once in a sense they qualify ...
 The family is not getting better, and the business got worse. So ...
 family began selling their bread cinnamon ...
 by mail to the neighboring kingdom.
 Since there is no need to look at them, it was a success!
 They obtain a lot of money.
 And the farmer said to his daughter ...
"See what you can accomplish when we unite?"
End
 This is the last birthday party.
 There are two things I love in this world more than any ...
 that is running and Mathematics.
 My father was a mathematician, so math is love love my dad.
What's this? What are you reading?
- Pre-calculus?
- Yes
We both feel safe in numbers.
In my family, 1 and 1 equal to 3.
- I hope when I grow up ...
- Life is beautiful.
My father was a track star in college ... and I dreamed of the day I actually ... will run faster than him.
But the last good day my dad has ... no one wins.
What?
That's when I started knocking on wood. hit each number, each number and give me security.
Without them I would be alone.
They knew the body repair ... but to fix his head?
My father looked much ... but I knew he was there, somewhere.
And I'm determined to bring him back ... then make a deal with the universe.
I'll give it all you like ... and the universe will come back to me my father.
I gave up dessert ...
I gave up going to the movies ...
I gave up my friends ...
I gave up flipping through the atlas ...
I give up runs.
The more I liked one thing, more is needed to destroy it.
The only thing I did not give figures.
If I can jump rope 43 times without a mistake ... or if I can catch the ball 27 times in a row ...
The number of fallen leaves that I have to say ... is equal to the number of letters in the name of my father ... then maybe I'll be back.
Never stop counting ...
I never stopped hoping.
Rate insurance ...
Trusted ...
Perfect.
Then, suddenly, my mother decided that three is too many.
Is my drive?
You have no friends, no job.
It's time to go.
But I like it here!
You lie, Mona.
And the worst part is that you do not realize it.
I should care.
You do not.
On the third night, my math book and I agree.
We can help you with the first month's rent.
I save a little, and his father have a disability pension.
He will never find an apartment with a private well as us.
FOR RENT
Suddenly I knew what it was like eternity.
Very long.
Mother!
Mona Gray?
"There we go! I finally got to the point.
- Here is Miss. Gelband.
I am the head of his elementary school.
- Yes.
I just found her mother in front of the bakery.
Our math teacher, Miss Swordstrum ... fled to Paraguay to be revolutionary.
Then his mother told me ...
You live in the city ... who are unemployed but have a college degree ...
- Math. It's you! "Me?
Our new math teacher!
I remember playing when you were a child ... while other children were playing dodgeball ...
You sit in the swing to make the division.
You work for the mayor, Mona Gray!
Why say I have a degree in Mathematics I left college?
Need to turn to pay the rent.
Why? It was you who threw me out.
- You may want to teach.
- I hate it.
The Committee welcomed to come to accept it!
I like to think of ourselves as being above average.
A teacher for every subject.
I think that makes you our Pass the Math!
We will want to brighten the decor.
Something optimistic and fun.
You make a mistake. I am not a teacher. I do not ...
There is an old saying: "There is no teacher to become a teacher."
I studied mathematics in space with Mr. Jones.
Who can tell me what is the next number in this sequence?
- Ms. Gray? 34%
- Yeah right.
I've never seen him without wax number around his neck.
Number varies according to mood.
High when he was in a good mood ... lower when he feels depressed.
I wondered whether he had a father figure that I needed.
To the world, only the number ... but for us ... signs are visible.
Mr. Jones quit teaching and opened a hardware store.
And I was the only one who understands why.
He tried to increase their numbers.
We did not talk more ...
And then I can count on you?
Hi!
First class?
I Miss Gray.
- Really.
Can I call you "mom"?
Series Second, look at the numbers on the board.
Child
Take a look!
Figures are cool.
I liked the second.
I love the ninth.
I like 5.

Okay. Thank you.
Please sit down
Let's go! make jokes.
How to say ...

He hit me!
-What is your name?
- Danny O'Mazzi.
Danny can not throw things in the minds of others.
Go to the corner and stood facing the wall.
"Cool." It's not fair!
Why he'll stay in the corner facing the wall?
Not a good thing. This is a punishment.

He has a change of clothes in a room nurse.
So go get changed, Ellen.

As a show of numbers.
And let's call ...
"Figures and Materials."
- Can I be first? Is that OK? "
Lisa ... Venus ... bring very good.
I'm glad you became a new math teacher.
-Dad?
-Dad?
-Dad?
Father, today is my first ...

It is called "Shape of Health."
Come here. I'll show you. Come here.

Then he ran off with a nurse. That's funny. They stole my car.
Sorry.
This is a tragedy. Sorry.
That's all right. I made a mistake.
All my calculations are wrong.
They must be tired of hearing this, but you ... very similar.
Really? Everyone says that ...
- Mouth ... No doubt.
How you ever been to Science?
I have always had an interest in ... know why things are like them.
My father also influenced me, but ...
"I want to be a scientist!"
I think I'll buy what you ask.
Mona, do not!
"We do not ..."
- Can I help you, Miss Gray. Just wait.
- A 2.5 kg bag.
- But this ...
- Should I go with you?

It's your birthday! It was his birthday.
Congratulations!
Mr. Jones.
I came to show the new catalog Panida tool.
I have everything I need.
This is my card. Go find me.
I hope your day fun!
He says one thing about that number for the first time ... when she was 9 years old.
Hi, Mr. Jones! Glad you better. Nine times better than yesterday.
Yesterday you 2.
It is remarkable that a child's record.
You're a great observer.
Notification?
I woke up and thought ...
"If Mr. Jones to use even numbers, my dad would laugh today."
"If he uses an odd number, the new drug will work."
"He must know the number that helps."
But if he knew, he said.
It was just a neighbor who was looking the other way.
So I decided to throw 60 eggs at his car on Halloween.
Hi, Mr. Jones.
- Hi, Mona. "Well?" why do you use this number in the neck?
I think you know.
Know.
Know what?
I also wear an invisible sign.
I say ... "Fuck you, hypocrite!"
I'll take the ax.
Is $ 28.
See what we can achieve when we unite?
See what we can ...
You are the 3? You are the 4?
You are the 5? You're 6?
You are the 7? You're an 8?
Are you a 9?
Why do it?
At home, the ax. At school he was 7.
A little wrapping paper and some stickers ... and turned my nightmare into Numbers and Materials.
- Levan, what happened?
- It's scabies.
Scabies?
Who said that?
Ann? What about you?
My tongue was swollen!
My tongue!
My God! His tongue?
Danny, what's wrong with you?
Malaria!
Emergency calls 911.
- I want to report the epidemic.
"Where are you?"
- Something like chicken pox.
- You know, you can ...
"Miss."
You can make a week of malaria ... if you make a good tuberculosis today. How do you think?
- What are the symptoms?
- Tired, coughing. Coughing a little.
"Miss."
- With strength.
I'll send an ambulance.
More power! Perfect.
- And cramps.
"Miss."
- Curve as if gas. Is that OK? "
So: "There we go, I finally got to the point.
Rocks!
Very nice, Elmer. It was as if he has too much gas.
"What happened?
We are representing life.
- Lady?
- Help children understand ... symptoms of the disease.
You. .. is ... fired!
I did not say two words ... and then reject me?
Wake up, Lisa. You are not sick.
I suffer from cancer. my mother's wig is made of human hair.
They have some that are not, but you can tell.
Come on.
Wait. Still more must be done a little cancer.
Mlle. Gray?
What is it?
It's a ... 7.
- It's not a 7! This ax!
- It's a 7.
- Love Guru!
- Enough, Ann!
Ann was angry because his father had a girlfriend ... and my mother, a lawyer his mother ... have pictures to prove it.
- It does not exist! Yes!
Levan, just gossip. Do you have to sit in the corner!
Very good does anyone know what this is?
Bird beak.
- It's like the mouth ...
- It's ass bird!
Danny!
As for the singing!
Let's pretend it was a mouthful.
And the mouth is always hungry.
And 179 ... less than 255.
Mouth always wanted to eat the higher number.
Mouth larger because come 5556.
Right.
This is called "greater than" and "less than".
Who wants to come here and make your own?
I'm dying of diphtheria!
Get out of my room now!
Not again, Ellen!
"Faking sick is very difficult."
"The disease is less false than true disease."
Car accident?
- Do not know if I can compare ...
- Yes, I can.
I had a car accident once. I survived.
War
Old age?
Old age is nothing more than war.
Disease is the biggest of all!
Murder
Mine is the largest.
No,
They say psychopathic serial killer.
Sad, but true.
Cancer?
Fight! Fight!
Stop, you two! Stop!
Or I call your parents!
His mother would not know.
Silent ...
- Ann!
Better you should control the classroom, Miss Gray.
Remember to create a "greater than" and "less than"!
Lisa ... no one is bigger than anyone else!
This is not true.
You're the best teacher in the school.
You know, my father was sick.
Lisa, do not be late to class?
I went, Miss Gelband.
Mlle. Gray ...
Lisa seems happy in his class!
Must create a great atmosphere!
Although I do not understand why, at lunch yesterday ... he took a cigarette, bologna ... margarine and a packet of sweetener!
Have you heard that?
Looks like a theme lunch.
A lunch with the theme of "cancer."
- Yeah right.
Thank God. he has someone as well-balanced ... like you in her life.
Thank God.
Well .. see you tonight!
- Tonight?
- Open School Night.
Ace 20h sharp!
- Why not move?
- Why do not you move away?
We're here. We must speak with all teachers in Ann.
We'll leave the math to the end. Ann says that she is a bit strange.
Hi!
You must be a math teacher.
I am the aunt Lisa.
Lisa is one of my students are smart.
I always hated math, but Lisa is a strange child.
Well, should not be easy for him ...
Now?
And for me?
I crossed the state to care for her e. .. and did not get a "thank you" from anyone.
He had to get my license to work as a broker.
Maybe go back to school. Now I can not do anything about it.
- Maybe when her mother is better ...
- Increase?
What spacecraft are you falling?
Forgive me now.
I sing seductive lure you here?
No, I ...
If anyone asks, this is a scientific demonstration.
Environment.

Me too.
"Well?" agree on something?
It is a smile?
- No.
- Yes
This is very pretty when she smiles.
I must go.
No, do not go.
We are making progress. The last time he saw me, you fired me.
You fired me.
Do not worry. If there are people who would be fired here, is you.
May saw that Ellen made with pork yesterday.
That's ... gave me nightmares!
You put ... Lisa to represent the cancer!
"Yes, I know.
She knew that her mother had cancer?
Sei. That's why she chose.
- He will die! Of course.
That's why she chose.
Wait. Want to try?
Try it.
- I do not bubble.
- Who is not? Bubbles are ... circle ... This math. 360 St. Think about this.
Everyone loves bubbles.
When I first saw you is ... teaching, and children in front.
They are ... representing numbers.
I like that.
That's why I ...
That's when I realized there was something special about you.
You know,
I need ... must go.
- You did it!
- Good evening, Mr. Smith.
Good night, Miss Gray.
Once ... a woman from Texas ... write all the numbers from 1 to 1 billion.
He spent several years ... and lots of paper.
He uses recycled paper?
I do not know.
If you're using, is a good story. If not used, it is bad history.
Should I ask for your aunt to prepare lunch for you better.
Can not live up to basic chips and chocolate.
Yes, I can. That's what pirates eat.
Why do pirates prefer?
My father took me into a pirate ship when I was little.
Can I stay with you after my mother died?
- I have a small apartment.
- I'm not too good.
You can not. because it would be unfair to other students.
I mean, I could help him with math lesson e. .. would not be fair.
Makes sense.
- They are very angry.
- You are a brilliant teacher.
'Back Avoiding me, Miss Gray? ora.
I thought I had dropped something. Window.
Like what? A quadratic equation?
Type a decimal point.
I see a decimal point. He flew in that direction.
- Decimal point can not fly.
- What are they doing?
They were leaning.
You are a strange woman I have ever encountered.
"So what?"
Then ...
Come on.
I help you find ... decimal point is tilted.
Going to the movies.
I do not like the movie.
Okay. He did not invite you.
Okay, you can go to the cinema with me if you want.
I do not ... go to the movies.
What folly! It's like saying you do not hear the music.
- I hate music.
- What is this lie? The third?
I have to go to the hardware store to buy nails.
Lying 4.
I hate thrillers!
This is a 5!
- This is 5.
- The first is the music.
Is 5. You lie a lot.
Everything about you is funny. Come to the movies with me!
You can pay for popcorn.
Or you hate popcorn, but not really?
I need a nail.
I sat in the middle of the media.
Come on guys!
Hi.

Did you know?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I asked: "Are you okay?"
What happened?
I just - not in the mood.
- Your previous.
- Not.
- What are you doing in the bathroom?
- Go away, please.

And it was my turn to do Numbers and Materials.
Now it's your turn again?
I'm not lying!
See? A number of perfect.
Awesome.
Where'd you get that?
"I see it."
42 plus 5 equal to 48.
Nothing! It's 47!
You do not!
I know who it is.
This is mine and I!
You can go, Lisa.
Fine, but do not let it get away.
Why do not we go to the hardware store together ... to give back the number on Mr. Jones?
He will be very happy that might give you a gift.
A gift? Do not want to reward an idiot!
And could not stop me going to the park to play.
Give me.
- Yes
This.
Weird.
I ....
I would shop with your hardware.
Then you can take me to visit my mother.
Hi Encouraged to experiment with sulfuric acid tomorrow?
Let's kick ass.

I can not. I Science Club meeting after school.

I play clean. Not everyone plays. But thank you for the invitation.
Will lose the fun!
Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones.
If he is not here, why leave the door open?
Maybe it was captured by pirates.
This way.
- "And he fell on the bench, he laughed ..."
- Mother! Nan!
This is my math teacher.
Miss ... Gray ...
It is the unseen teacher?
Mlle. Gray?
This ... is Miss Gray.
Lisa, like potatoes?
- I love.
- Then come with me!
I like your hair.
Cancer is not contagious.
Lisa asked me to bring him here today.
He does not like my brother.
But as you.
I also like that.
His father made a pirate just like him? He said ...
No Lisa has never met his father.
I think ...
- You can ... take care of Lisa and again?
Of course.
Mr. Jones.
Mother!
Mother! Daddy! Did you see Mr. Jones?
Mother saw Mr Jones?
He disappeared. And I do not think the car keys.
Who is missing? Mr. Jones?
No, Mona. His father. Her father disappeared.
What? Where did he go?
I do not know. I do not know where he is!
And I found it behind the washing machine.
He's hiding. I do not know how long ago did not take.
This will never happen if I still live here.
Stop! You can not help you.
And I do not know where he is.
-Dad?
- It's your father?
I tried to take him down, but did not appear.
-Dad?
The energy trapped ... in this round and should be released.

Because it is toxic. And it will poison my body.
No, it will help you.
Here is the end.
I have to dig here.
If I did not open it ...
_____I ... Is.
Please.

- Not that I want to improve?
- It's everything I want.
I took my number and Materials. I knew it was not Friday, but special.
This is my father prosthesis.
- It seems the number one, right?
- Can I play?
Pretty cool, huh?
There seems to be the first. Apparently arm.
Apparently the number one!
Why is her father's arm fall?
Did not fall. He was hit in the war.

Ann ...
- My God! ... Drop the ax.
- I will cut them.
- Go, nothing.
I will cut them to bits.
It will not bite anyone.
- I'm full of it! ____Please ...
And I'm sick of you.
Give me the ax!
There are a few moments ... when you look around ... and expect the cost to help you.
Then you realize that you are responsible.
You're an adult.
You're grown only there.
And not very good.
Life is too ... far more difficult than mathematics.
-Dad?
Mlle. Gray ...
- It took nine points.
- I took 27.
Nine times three equal to 27.
"You're right!
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I imitate you at lunch.
Bank makes the same sound that your table.
Why did you do that?
Why? "
I do this ... when ... I feel ... alone.
So that's why I'm doing. I want to be like you.
Do not do that. Do not be like me.
But I own ...
-Own.
You do not just take an ax to school ... but also lied by saying he has a college degree.
Shame on you ...
You are a great math teacher, Miss Gray ... but forbidden to set foot in my school anymore.
Mr. Jones.
Hello?
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Get out of here!
- You do not die?
- Why do I die?
"What happened? I do not know why.
I think their numbers throughout the city. His shop is open.
- Your car is missing.
- Get out of my room!
- Who is the girl?
- Mona Gray!
Mona Gray, would you please leave?
- Do I have to call the police?
- No.
But keep your number!
How do you know how you feel or who you are without them?
Andrea, I'm back.
Sorry.
Why not have more than their numbers?
What do you get?
This is because I love math!
You taught me that the number is everything! I saw their numbers and not ... bar graph to compare them with their moods.
He made the table?
Want to sit?
I left the store opened, I sold the car ... all because of 42.
Who cares about anything when you use 42?
I saw you that day.
A beautiful day. The best I ever had.
What about 42?
I realized that if I do not need ... number ...
I could be anything.
I do not understand why you are interested.
You're the meanest girl I ever knew.
Threw eggs at my car every Halloween.
- I know it's me? Of course.
What I do not know is ... why you do it.
Because you ignored me.
And do not know my father.
What?
You never ask about it!
- I said yes.
- He asked, nothing.
One day you ... playing in the park ... and I ask:
"What happened to your father?" He seems to wilt. "
I asked! Of course I asked!
You're right there with their green wellies ... threw stones at the tree.
I asked about his father, and you say to me:
"Shut up, Mr. Jones."
I should have asked again.
Sorry.
Maybe that day you ... not good.
I think I have never been better.
What is the problem with your father?
She thought she was dying.
Do you think he will die?
Did you miss work?
Want to know how I hurt my leg?
You did not ask.
Sorry. I think about ... create another form of health in the backyard.
But this time, with a larger radius.
The latter is very small. I'm thinking about making a ... with greater range.
What do you think?
I guess I can not stay with you.
My beautiful daughter. It's okay if you want to wait in the car.
He does not understand.
But I finally understood.
I received this by mail.
HI, MR. MISS SMITH. GRAY
I found through long-winded.
I do not know what to do.
Lisa insisted that I ... come and see it.
How is he?
Quiet than that.
Sorry.
You're right.
I lied.
Just so you know ... next time, whether there will be other times ... when I say I went to the bathroom ... do not leave.
I'm not going to monitor your bathroom, Miss Gray.
Mona! Forgot to say one thing.
I lied.
I will monitor your bathroom.
No need to monitor the bathroom.
Not?
I lied, but it's for your kindness.
Agree?
- I just wanted ...
Thank you for coming back.
Mlle. Gray? Alisha Beeze, mother of Levan.
I am a lawyer and I think it is a major cause ... toward family and school DiGanno Ann.
You can request a large indemnity.
I only want one thing.
And to say that in exchange for their jobs back ...
You give up this process, will graduate Pedagogy ... and promise never to bring tools to the classroom.
Pen?
All this is very unfair.
I could not leave when he is around.
I'm not sensitive.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not just ready.
I know it's horrible ... but I do not want it.
I want
The history of my father around.
Love does not mean having to sacrifice part of himself. the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
What do you see?
- Any takers?
- Also! Also!
- Ms. Gray?
- Okay. I would choose ...
Isabelle ... David ... and Kevin!
There were 122 frogs in the lake ... and 57 in other countries. frog How many total?
Not the history of mathematics is good.
Good.
- Do you know better?
- I should think. I know!
Put 3 in the story. And pirates.

Are you sure you're eighteen?
- Why? Do I look older?
Alberta Scrubb?
- It's a typographical error
- It is suppose to be Albert A. Scrubb.
- Edmund, you are suppose to be helping me with the groceries.
Better luck next time, ay, squirt?
Squirt? He barely had 2 years on me!
I am a king. I've fought wars and I've led armies.
Not in this world.
- Yeah, instead i'm stuck here.
Doing battles with useless Clarence Scrubb.
If anyone so deserve the name.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Come on then.
Dear Diary.
It is now day 253. since my ratchet cousins
Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.
Not sure how much long i can cope living with them.
Hard to share my things.
If only one could treat relatives like one who treat insects, all my problems would be solved.
I could simply put them in a jar.
Pin them to my wall?
- I'm home!
- Hello?
- Note to self.
Investigate legal ramifications of impaling relatives.
And that concludes the war news from the western front.
- Hi, Uncle Harold.
I've tried to find some carrots but all they had were turnips again.
Should I start making soup?
And Alberta is on her way home.
Uncle Harold?
- Father.
Edward making faces at you.
Why, you little...
- Father, he's going to hit me.
Edmund look, it's from Susan.
I do wish you were here with us.
It is such an adventure.
But nothing like our times in Narnia.
America is very exciting.
Only we never see father.
He works so very hard.
I was invited to the British consul's tea party this week by a naval officer.
Who happens to be very handsome.
I think he fancies me.
It seems that the Germans have made the crossing difficult right now.
Time are hard. Mother hopes you both won't mind another few months in Cambridge.
Another few months?
How will we survive?
You're lucky. At least you've got your own room.
I'm stuck with mullet mouth.
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.
Off on adventures.
- Yeah. They are the olders we are the youngest.
We don't matter as much.
Do you think i look anything like Susan?
Lucy, have you seen this ship before?
- Yes, it's very Narnian looking isn't it?
Yeah. Just another reminder that we're here not there.
There once was two orphans who wasted their time. believing in Narnian nursery rhyme.
Please let me hit him!
- No.
Don't you ever knock?
- It's my house.
I do as I please. You're just guests.
What's so fascinating about that picture anyway?
It's hideous.
You won't see it from the outside of the door.
Edmund look, looks like the water is actually moving.
What rubbish, see? That's what happens when you read all those fancy little novels and fairy tales of yours.
There once was a boy called Eustace, who read books for facts which were worthless.
People who read fairy tales are always a sort of becoming a hideous burden compared to people like me.
I read books with real information.
- A hideous burden?
I haven't seen you lift a finger since we've been here.
I hope you won't mind I tell your father it was you who stole Aunt Alberta sweets?
- Liar?
- Really?
- Edmund, the painting!
- I found them under your bed.
And you know what? I've licked every one of them!
Ew! I'm infected with you!
What is going on here?
- Lucy, do you think...
This is some kind of a trick. Stop or I'll tell mother.
Mother!
I'll just smash the whole thing.
Do something!
- No.
Help me.
- Let me go.
Let go.
Eustace, swim!
- What's going on?
Swimming!
Swim.
It's alright! I got you.
Caspian?
- Lucy.
Edmund, it is Caspian.
- You're safe now.
Are we in Narnia?
- Yes, you are in Narnia.
I don't wanna go. I want to go back to England!
I'm going back to England!
Hold on.
That was thrilling!
How in the world do you end up here?
- I have no idea.
- Caspian!
- Edmund.
It's great to see you.
- Didn't you call for us?
No, not this time.
Well, whatever the case, i'm just glad to be here.
Ahh! Get that thing off me!
Reepicheep!
Your Majesty.
- Hello, Reep.
What a pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine sir.
But first, what to do about this, this hysterical interloper?
That giant rat thing just tried to claw my face off!
I was merely trying to expel the water from your lungs sir.
He talks! Does anyone understand? He just talk!
- He always talks.
Actually its getting him to shut up that's the trick.
The moment there is nothing to be said your highness,
I promise you I will not say it.
I don't know what kind of prank this is.
I wanna wake up right now!
Perhaps we can throw him back?
And being abducted by a kind of zeepiratencarnival.
I demand to know just where in the blazes am I?
You're on the Dawn Treader.
The finest ship in Narnia's navy.
Was it something I said?
See to him for me.
- Your majesty.
Men.
Behold our castaways.
Edmund the Just and Lucy the Valiant.
High King and Queen of Narnia.
Aslan.
Look! Susan's bow and arrows.
- Lucy
- My Healing Cordial and dagger. oh, May I?
- Of course. They are yours.
Peter's sword.
- Yes.
I looked after as promised.
Here.
Hold it if you wish.
No, it's yours.
Peter has given it to you.
I did saved this for you though.
Thanks.
Since you've left, the Giants in the North had surrendered unconditionally.
And we defeated the Calormen army of the great desert.
There is peace across all of Narnia.
- Peace?
For three years.
And have you found yourself a queen in those three years?
No. Not one to compare to your sister.
Hang on, so there are no wars to fight and no one is in trouble...
Then, why are we here?
- That's a good question.
I have been asking myself the same thing.
So, where are we sailing?
- To get back the throne from my uncle.
He tried to kill my father's closest friends and most loyal supporters.
The seven Lords of Telmar.
They fled to the Lone Islands.
No one has heard from them since.
So you think something has happened to them?
- Well, if it has...
It is my duty to find out.
What lies east of the Lone Islands?
Uncharted waters. Things that you can barely imagine.
Tales of sea serpents and worse.
Sea serpents?
- Alright captain, enough of your tall tales.
Where skies i want to be, where the waves are sweet.
Descends upon you, Reepicheep.
That's pretty!
- oh! Thank you.
A "driad" sung to me when i was just a "materling".
I can't divine the meaning but i never forgotten the words.
What do you think past Lone islands is?
I've been told the furthest east one can sail is to the end of the world.
Aslan's country.
- Do you really believe there is such a place?
We have nothing if we do not believe.
Do you think you can actually sail there?
Well, there is only one way of finding that out.
Only hope one day I'd earn the right to see it.
Your majesty.
You have grown stronger, my friend.
Seems I have.
Alright! Back to work.
Edmund, Do you think if we keep sailing to the end of the world, we just... tip off the edge?
Don't worry, Lu.
We're long way from there.
I see you're still talking nonsense.
Are you feeling better?
- Yes, but not thanks to you.
It's like I have an iron constitution.
- You're ever "vesitence" ever I see. (?)
Found your sea legs?
- Never lost them.
It's just given a shock of things. (?)
Obviously have the cutest position, (?) due to my intelligence.
I don't think he has "apute" anything (?)
I'll have you know as soon as
I find civilization.
I'm contacting the British Consulate.
Having you arrested for kidnapping.
Kidnapping is it? That's funny.
I thought we had saved your life.
You held me here against my own will!
- Did I?
(???) in that quarters
It's like a zoo down there!
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?
- He is just warming up.
Landfall.
The Lone Islands.
Narrow Haven's portal.
Strange. No Narnia flag in sight.
The Lone Islands always been of Narnia's.
Seems suspicious.
I say we prepare a party
Drinian?
- Forgive me, Your Majesty...
But the chain of command starts with Prince Caspian on this ship
Right
- We use rowboats. Drinian, pick some men and come on shore.
Men the row boats! Throw the sailer and prepare to go out. and get ready to lower the anchor.
En route! (??) lies ahead.
Can't we just wait till the morning?
There is no honor in turning away from adventure land.
Listen!
Where is everyone?
Come on, jelly legs.
- I'm capable of getting out myself!
And you're certain you're related by blood?
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men and secure the place.
We will head up.
If we don't come back by dawn, send the party.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Yeah, looks like nobody is in.
So do you think we should go back?
Do you want to come here and guard...something?
Ah, yes.
Good idea, cousin.
Very..um, logical.
I've got it.
Don't worry.
I'm ready to go when you are!
Who are all these people?
- Why are they've been crossed out?
Looks like some kind of fee..?
- Slave Traders.
Look out.
Unless you want to hear this scum squeal like a girl again,
I would say, you should drop your weapons.
I'm not a girl.
- Now!
Put it down!
- Useless..
Put them in irons.
- Come here you!
Get your hands off me. Let go!
Take these two to the market.
Send those other two to the dungeons.
Listen to me, you insolent fool.
I am your king!
You're gonna pay for that!
- Actually... someone else is going to pay.
For all of you.
You all right?
- Yeah.
It is hopeless.
You'll never get out.
Who's there?
- Nobody.
Just a voice in my head.
Lord Bern?
That was me once.
I do not deserve that title anymore.
Is he one of the seven?
Your face. You remind me of a king that I once know.
That man was my father.
My Lord, please forgive me.
No, please.
No!
- Mommy!
Get back.
Stay with daddy.
- Don't worry. I will find you!
Mommy!
Where are they taking them?
- Keep watching.
What happened?
- It's a sacrifice.
Where did they go?
- No one knows.
The mist was first seen in the east.
Reports of fishermen and sailors disappearing out at sea.
We lords have made a pact... to find the source of the mist and to destroy them.
They each set sail,
But none of them came back.
You see, If they don't sell you to the slave traders
You're likely to be fed to the mist
- We have to find Lucy.
Before it's too late.
- I offer 60.
I bid 80!
- 100 for the little lady.
Anymore bids?
SOLD!
Come on, move!
And now, for this fine speciment!
Who'd kick off the bidding?
Come on now, he may not seem like much, but uh..he is strong.
Yes, he's strong alright. Smells like the rear end of a Minotaur.
That is an outrageous lie.
I won the school hygeine award, two years running!
Come on, someone make your bid!
- I'll take them off your hands.
I'll take them all out of your hands.
For Narnia!
Thanks, Reep. I knew you would come.
- Your Highness.
Grab the keys.
Keys! oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?
I hope that wasn't British consul.
Your majesty!
- Wait.
My wife was taken just this morning.
- Daddy!
I beg you, take me with you.
I want to come.
- No, Gael. Stay with your aunt.
I am a fight sailor, been on the seas my whole life.
Of course, you must.
- Thank you.
But Daddy!
- If I ever not come back...
Now be good.
My king!
This was given to me by your father.
I hid it safely in the cave.
All these years.
- I thought that is Narnian sword?
It's from your Golden Age.
There are seven of those swords.
Gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.
Your father entrusted them to us.
Here. Take it.
And it may protect you.
Thank you, my Lord.
And we shall find your lost sisters(?).
Edmund.
Dear diary.
There has been extraordinary turn of event.
I have been abducted by my cousins and set to drift in uncharted waters.
In some ridiculously looking boat.
What's worse, as I share quarters with obnoxious mouse thing,
My thought banking with my cousins was bad enough.
So far, every person I met in this strange place suffers from the most florit delusions
Chasing for green mists and looking for lost lords.
I can only assume this is the result of poor diet.
Everyone are barking mad.
Cousin Edmund is no exception.
He spends every spare second rubbing that thin sword.
Like it's some magic lantern.
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.
It is going to be magnificient.
Do they come in a smaller size?
Peeving Marmud (?)
He's more delusional than my cousin.
In England we have mousetraps and that sort of things.
Speaking of food, do you think I can get any do you?
Uh, why you talking to that bird?
I just naturally assumed that...
- (Laughs) He's talking to birds.
He is as mad as a looner that one.
Shoo! Go go.
Are you aware sir...
Stealing rations is a capital offense?
Up here.
You.
- Men have been killed for less.
For What?
- Treason and sneakiness...and general nuisances.
Just hand over the orange and we'll let the matter pass.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Allow me to...
I've had quite enough of you.
- Unhand the tail.
The Great Aslan himself gave me this tail.
No one. Repeat. No one touches the tail.
Period. Exclamation mark!
- Sorry.
Now. I will have the orange, then I will have satisfaction.
Puh, puh, please, please, please, um. I'm a pacifist.
Watch it.
- Sorry.
Are you trying to run away?
We're on a boat you know.
Can't we just discuss this?
That is for stealing, that is for lying, and that was for good measure.
(Laughs) That's the spirit! We have ourselves a duel! Catch.
Now, come on.
Take your best shot.
Is that it?
Come on, boy.
Stop flapping your wings like a drunken pelican.
Hoist!
Keep your leg up.
Yoo-hoo! Over here.
On your foot.
On your left, your right.
Got it? Come on.
The Nimble. It is a dance, boy.
Come on now. And again.
Oh, no.
And that!
Look.
Gael, what are you doing here?
It seems that we have an extra crew member.
Welcome aboard.
- Your majesty.
Call me Lucy.
Come on.
Come on, look lovely, back to work!
Good match!
I will make a swordsman of you yet.
Yes, well...it's the plane we look more even it would be an entirely different result.
(Laughs) Indeed.
It looks like uninhabited.
If the Lords follow the mist to the east, they would have stopped here.
It could be a trap.
Or it can held some answers.
- Caspian?
We spend the night on shore.
Scout the island everyone.
Ay, Your Majesty.
Seems they have brought a pig.
This one. It's female.
So is this one.
This one reads.
Let's take her.
There is no escape!
- We are scary.
What are you?
- We are terrifying invisible beasts.
If you could see us, you would be really intimidated.
You forgot to mention that we all are very large.
What do you want?
- You'll do what we ask.
She will!
- Very clear. Well put!
Or what?
- Or death.
Death.
Well, I won't be much use to you when
I'm dead now, would I?
I haven't thought of that.
- No, you hadn't. Fair point.
Alright. Then we'll just kill your friends!
Good idea.
- What do you want with me?
You'll enter the house of the Opressor.
What house?
- This one.
Upstairs, you'll find the book of incantation recite the spell that makes the unseen, seen.
Well put chief, well put.
- Very. Yeah.
Well, go on.
We haven't got all day.
Remember what will happen to your friends
You've been warned.
- Yeah.
Right.
Why don't you do it yourself?
- We can't read.
Can't write for the matter of fact.
All that.
- Yeah.
Why didn't you just say so?
Beware of the opressor.
- He is very aggressive!
What makes the unseen, seen.
Got it? Don't forget that!
Ed, wake up.
Wake up!
Look.
Where's Lucy?
Lucy!
Everybody up!
- Get up.
This way.
- Move!
The Book of Incantation

Susan, what's going on?
I'm beautiful.
No! wait.
Make me she, whom i'd agree.

What sort of creatures are you?
- Great ones.
With the head of a tiger and the body of um-different tiger.
You don't want to mess with us!
- Or what?
Or I'll claw you to death!
I'll run my touch right through you!
I will crush you with my teeth.
- And i'll bite you with my fangs.
You mean squash us with your fat bellies?
Fatty bellies?
- Or tickle us with your toes?
What have you done with my sister, you little pip squid?
Now, calm down.
- Where is she?
Can I tell him?
- Tell him, chief.
In the mansion.
- What mansion?
Oh. That mansion.
Now, I'm getting tired of you leaving me behind.
The thing came back.
This place is weirder and weirder.
He's calling us weird.
- Lucy! Your majesty.
- Caspian and Edmund.
This is Coriakin.
It's his island.
That's what he thinks.
You have wronged us, magician.
I have not wronged you, I've made you invisible for your own protection.
Protection?
- That's aggressive! Opressor!
I have not opressed you.
- But you could have!
If you wanted to!
- Be gone.
What was that?
- Loot(?). But don't tell them.
What were those things?
- Dufflepuds.
Of course.
Silly me.
What did you mean when you said you made them invisible for their own good?
It seems to be the easiest way to protect them.
From the evil.
- You mean the mist?
I mean what lies behind the mist.
It's quite beautiful.
I mean for a made belived that and a made believed world.
There is the source of your problems.
The Dark Island.
A place where evil lurks.
It can take any form. It can make your darkest dream come true.
It seeks to corrupt all goodness
Steal the lights from this world.
How do we stop it?
- You must break its spell.
That sword you carry, there are six others.
Have you seen them?
- Yes.
The six lords, they passed through here?
- Indeed.
Where are they heading?
- Where I've sent them.
Break the spell.
You must follow the Blue Star... to Ramandu's Island.
There the seven swords must be laid at Aslan's table.
Only then can the truly magical power be released.
But beware. You will all about to be tested.
Tested?
It will do everything in it's power to tempt you.
Be strong...
Don't fall to temptations.
To defeat the darkness out there you must defeat the darkness inside yourself.
For reasons beyond my comprehension
We have taken the advice from the senile old coup(?). who doesn't possess a razor, and walks around on a dressing gown.
So we're back in the bathtub and and lost in the tempest. Brilliant!
14 days of being tossed like a pancake, not the slightest sight of land.
The only consolation is that everyone is finally as miserable as I am.
Except for that show-off talking rat.
He is one of the annoying glass is always half full part.
So, we're stuck here... with half rations, we have food and water for two more weeks maximum.
This is your last chance to turn back, your majesty.
Not in this storm.
Needle in a haystack trying to find this remoteless place.
We can sail way past and knocked to the end of world.
We can be eaten by a sea serpent.
You'll see when the men are getting nervous.
These are strange seas we are sailing the lights that which i've never seen before.
Then perhaps captain, you'd love to be the one to explain to Mr. Rince that we're abandoning the search for his families?
I'll get back to it.
Just a word of warning, the seas can play nasty tricks on a crew mind.
Very nasty.
Transform my reflection, cast into affection lashes, lips and complexion.
Let me like whom I agree, cause more beauty over me.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ms. Pevensie.
Edmund?
- You look beautiful, Sister.
As always.
- Peter!
Excuse me Miss,
Can I get a photo?
Mother's gonne love this, all her children in one picture.
Smile!
- Hang on. Where am I?
I mean where's Lucy?
- Lucy, who's Lucy?
Susan, what's wrong?
Come on now Miss.
A nice big smile!
Edmund, I'm not sure about this. I think
I want to go back.
Go back where?
- To Narnia!
What is Narnia?
- What's going on?
Stop this!
Lucy.
- Aslan?
What have you done, child?
I don't know, but that was awful.
But you chose it, Lucy.
I didn't mean to choose all that. I just wanted to be as beautiful like Susan.
That's all.
You wished yourself away, and with it, much more.
Your brothers and sisters wouldn't know Narnia without you, Lucy.
You discovered it first, remember?
I'm so sorry.
You doubt your value, don't run from who you are.
Aslan!
Father.
Edmund.
Come with me.
Join me.
Edmund?
Lucy.
I can't sleep.
- Let me guess. Bad dream?
So either we're all going mad, or something is playing with our minds.
I doubt the Lord stopped here, there is no sign of anything living.
Right. Well, once you have got on shore, take your men for food and water.
The three of us will look for clues.
- You mean the four of us?
Come on, please don't send me back to the rat.
- I heard that!
Big ears.
- I heard that too.
Look. We not the first on the island.
The Lords?
- Could be.
What do you think could be down there?
Let's find out.
What is that?
- I don't know. Looks like some kind of a gold statue.
He must have fallen in.
Poor man.
- You mean, poor Lord.
The crust of Lord rest in him.
- And his sword.
We need it.
Be careful.
Your sword hasn't turn to gold.
- Both swords are magical.
He mustn't have known what hit him.
Maybe, or maybe
He was onto something.
What are you talking about?
What are you staring at?
Whoever has access to this pool, could be the most powerful person in the world.
Lucy, we'll be so rich no one can tell us what to do, or who to live with.
You can't take anything out of Narnia, Edmund.
Says who?
- I do.
I am not your subject.
You have been waiting for this, haven't you?
To challenge me. You doubt my leadership!
You doubt yourself.
You're a child.
- And you're a spineless sap.
Edmund?
- I'm tired of playing second fiddle...
First it was Peter, and now it's you.
You know I am braver than both of you.
Why did you Peter's sword?
I deserve a kingdom of my own!
I deserve to rule!
- If you think you're so brave... prove it!
No!
Stop it!
Both of you.
Look at yourself.
Can't you see what's happenning?
This place has tempted you.
It is bewitching you,
This is exactly what Coriakin is talking about.
Let's just get outta here.
Oh yes, follow the imaginary blue star, to the island of Rabandoedoe...
Like the seven steak knives on the table of a talking lion.
Nonsense.
What is that?
I must be dead.
You are definitely dead.
You wouldn't be needing that one wont you.
Finally, a favorable turn of events.
What foods did you found?
It is volcanic, My majesty.
Nothing grows.
Where is Eustace?
I believe he's out not helping us loading the boats.
Eustace!
I have got a bad feeling.
I'm going to find him.
I'll come with you.
Eustace?
Treasure.
Trouble.
Eustace's.
No.
I'm sorry.
- He was just a boy.
I shouldn't have left him.
What could have happened to him?
In this place? Anything.
And he wasn't the first.
It's Lord Octesian.
We should find this... sword.
What was that?
Is it the volcano?
Oh no, that's not a volcano.
All hands on deck.
Archers, arm yourselves!
Take your positions and wait for my command.
What is it doing?
- Fire!
He will break the mast.
Hold your positions.
Fire!
Edmund!
Edmund!
- Lucy.
I AM Eustace
You've got to be joking!
He must have been tempted by the treasure.
Everyone knows that the dragon's treasure is enchanted.
Apart anyone from here.
Is there any way to change him back?
- Not that I know of.
Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.
Sorry about the hand, oh boy.
I can be a little over zealous sometimes.
The boats are ready, sire.
- We can not leave him.
Well, we can't bring him on board, Your Majesty.
You and others take one boat back.
The rest of us stay here until morning. and work out what to do.
- But you have no provisions.
And no means of staying warm, My Majesty
And you were saying?
I've never seen these constellation before.
Me neither.
We are long way from home.
When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing to the end of the world.
To find my father there.
Maybe you are.
I miss my mommy.
I miss mine too.
Don't worry, you'll see her again.
How do you know?
- You just have to have faith about these things.
Aslan will help us.
But Aslan could have stop her from being taken.
We'll find her, I promise.
Somehow.
Trouble sleeping?
Now now, all is not lost as it seems.
I'll stay up with you if you wish.
To keep you company.
You didn't even believe in dragons this morning.
You know, extraordinary things only happen to extraordinary people.
Maybe it's a sign!
That you've got an extraordinary destiny
Something greater than you could have imagine.
I can tell you one or two of my adventures if you like, just past the time.
Believe it or not, you are not the first dragon I've encountered.
Many years ago, too many that I care to imagine.
I was with a band of pirates and I met another dragon.
Much fierce than you.
Lucy, wake up.
Look.
The Blue Star.
Everybody up.
- What?
It is the blue star.
- Wake up.
Pull.
Put your strokes in there, lads!
Pull!
The wind has left.
So how do we get to Ramandu Island now then?
My guess is something doesn't want us to get there.
Pull.
If I'm getting hungrier,
I'm gonna eat that dragon!
Don't worry, Eustace, they will to deal with me first.
If we don't get to landfall by tonight, they might as well eat them...
What are we hitting?
Eustace, that's brilliant!
En route!
We can't be sure that the other Lords even made it to Ramandu's Island.
You got us there! What did I tell you?
Eustace, you're extraordinary!
Wait.
Lord Revilian.
Lord Mavramorn.
Lord Argoz.
He's breathing!
So are they.
They're under the spell.
It's the food!
Hey, it's the stone knife.
This is Aslan's table!
The swords.
Let me take it.
That's six.
We're missing one.
Look!
Travellers of Narnia
Welcome.
Arise!
Do you look hungry?
- Who are you?
I am Lilliandil.
Daughter of Ramandu.
I am your guide.
You're a star.
You're most beautiful.
If it is a distraction for you, I can change forms.
- No.
Please.
The food is for you.
There is enough for everyone that welcome to Aslan's table.
Always. Help yourselves.
Wait.
What happened to them?
These poor men were half mad by the time they reached our shores.
They threatened each other with violence.
Violence is forbidden at the table of Aslan.
So they were sent to sleep.
- Will they ever awake?
When all is put right.
Come. There is little time.
The Magician Coriakin told you of Dark Island?
Yes.
For long the evil will be unstoppable.
Coriakin said, to break the spell, we need the seventh sword on the Aslan's table.
He speaks the truth.
- But we found only six.
Do you know where the seventh is?
In there.
You will need great courage.
Now, don't waste your time.
How we meet again?
Goodbye.
So what do you think it's in there?
Our worst nightmares.
Our darkest wishes.
Pure evil.
Tavros, unlock the armory
Archers, prepare yourselves.
Dock the lanterns.
Let's get ready.
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.
When you grow up, you should be just like you.
If case we don't get through, whatever this is...
I want you to know I think of you as my brother.
Me too.
You gave up your sword.
It was not mine to keep.
Use this.
But it is...
- Peter would like you to have it.
Here it is, my friend.
The battle awaits.
Eustace, no. Wait.
Stop.
I will not accept surrender.
A true warrior does not flight out of fear.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
I'm a mouse.
You a dragon.
You have a skin of leather.
You breathe fire.
Come on, let's meet our destiny.
No matter what happens here. every soul standing before me, has earned a place on the Dawn Treader.
Together we traveled far.
Together, we have faced diversity.
Together... we can do it again.
So now is not the time to fall in fears and temptations. Be strong!
Never give in.
Our world, our Narnian lives depend on it.
Think of the lost souls we are here to save.
Think of Aslan.
Think of Narnia.
- For Narnia!
For Narnia!
Helene?
We can't see a thing.
The fog is too thick.
You're a great disappointment to me.
You call yourself my son?
And act like a king.
Edmund.
Come with me.
Be my king.
I let you rule.
- Go away.
You're dead.
- You can never kill me.
I will always be alive in your mind, silly boy.
No!
- Edmund?
Are you alright?
Keep away!
Keep away!
- Who's there?
Will we not fear you!
- Not, are you?
Keep away!
- We do not leave.
You will not defeat me.
Caspian, the sword!
Lord Rhoop.
You cannot own me!
- Stand down.
Let's get him onboard, quickly!
Be calm my Lord.
- Off me, demons!
We're not here to hurt you.
I am your king.
Caspian.
My Lord.
You should not have come.
There is no way out of here.
Quickly turn this ship about before it is too late.
We have the sword.
Let's go!
Let's turn this ship around.
Do not think.
Do not let it know your fears, or it will become them!
Oh no.
- Edmund.
What did you just think of?
- I'm sorry.
What is that?
It's too late!
Get on the boat
Come, walk.
Don't let me down.
No fear. No retreats.
For Narnia! Take that.
And that.
Eustace, hang on!
I'll kill it.
- No, the sword!
Eustace!
Come back.
- We are doomed. Doomed!
Turn this ship about.
- Stop him.
Rowers.
To your rowing position.
Forward at double speed.
- Aslan, please help us.
Pull.
Pull!
Where are you?
You must stay here until someone comes and get you!
Ed! We run the serpent, smash him on the rocks.
Stay on the port, I will keep it on the ground.
Look out!
Pull!
Try to kill me, come on!
Come on here.
No!
- Edmund.
I'm still here.
Brace yourselves!
Move!
We can beat this.
We must get closer.
- Everybody to the main deck.
Get ready.
I want everyone here.
Ready... now!
Put his head down!
Heave!
What are you trying to prove, Edmund?
That you are a man?
Do it!
I can make you that.
I can make you my king.
Just take my hand.
Just give it here.
Do it!
Come on!
No!
The spell, it has lifted.
Edmund, Caspian, Look!
Narnians!
Mommy!
- Helene.
Mommy.
Let's have them onboard, clear the decks.
We did it, i knew we would.
It wasn't just us.
- You mean?
I'm here, Lucy.
Here, Lucy.
I'm in the water.
I am a boy again.
A boy!
Eustace! I see your wings have been clipped.
Where sky and water meet.
Where the waves grow ever sweet.
It's sweet!
Look.
Aslan's country.
We must have be close.
Well, we've come so far.
So what was it like?
When Aslan changed you back?
No matter how hard i tried,
I just couldn't do it myself.
Then he came towards me.
It was sort of hurt, but...
It was good pay.
Like when you pull a sword from your foot.
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.
I mean I was a better dragon than a boy, really.
I'm so sorry for being such a sob(?).
It's okay Eustace.
You were a pretty good dragon.
My friends, we've arrived
Aslan.
Welcome, children.
You have done well.
Very well indeed.
You have come far.
Now your journey is at it's end.
Is this your country?
- No, my country lies beyond.
Is my father in your country?
- You can only find that out on yourself, my son.
But you should know that if you continue, there is no return.
You not going?
Can't imagine my father would be very proud that I gave up what he died for.
I spent too long wanting what have been taken from me but not what was given.
I was given a kingdom.
People.
I promise to be a better king.
- You already are.
Children.
I think perhaps it's time we went home actually then?
I thought you loved it here?
- I do!
But I love home and our family as well!
They need us.
Your eminence, ever since i can remember, I've dreamt of seeing your country
I have had many great adventures in this world, but nothing has dampen that yearning.
I know I'm hardly worthy, but with your permission...
I'd lay down my sword for the joy of seeing your country.
With my own eyes.
My country was made for noble hearts such as yours.
No matter how small that can be.
Your majesty.
- Nobody deserves it more.
It's true.
May I?
- Well, I suppose...just this..
Goodbye, Lucy.
Don't cry.
I don't understand.
When will I see you again?
What a magnificent puzzle you are.
And a true hero.
It has been my honor to fight beside such a brave warrior.
And a great friend.
I won't be needing this.
This is our last time here, isn't it?
- Yes.
You have grown up, my dear one.
Just like Peter and Susan.
- Will you visit us in our world?
I shall be watching you always.
How?
- In your world...
I have another name.
You must learn to know me by it.
That was the very reason you were brought to Narnia.
That by knowing me here for a little,
You'll know me better there.
Will we meet again?
Yes, dear one. One day.
You are closest to me I have as family.
And that includes you, Eustace.
Thank you.
Will I come back?
Narnia may yet of need of you.
Eustace! What are you doing up there?
Jill drops in for a visit.
We spoke often of Narnia in the days that follow.
And when all my cousins have left.
After the war ended...
I missed them with all my heart.
As I know all Narnians will miss them
Till the end of time.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madame.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
New delivery. I'm sure you've got some excellent books there.
Got you at last!
Not the first time you've stolen from me, is it, my little thief?!
- Hm? Quick, empty your pockets.
- You're hurting me!
Empty your pockets, or I'll call the Station Inspector.
Do as I say!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
What are you doing with all these?
- And the other one.
- There's nothing in it.
Where's the Station Inspector?!
Ghosts.
Did you draw these pictures?
Did you draw these pictures?
Where did you steal this?
- I didn't steal it.
- You're a thief and a liar.
- Get out of here.
- Give me my notebook!
It's no longer your notebook!
It is my notebook and I'll do with it what I like! Maybe I'll just burn it!
- No!
- Then tell me who did the drawings!
Get out of here, you little thief!
Why are you still here?
- Go!
- Maximilian, do you hear an atrocity'?
Calamity? Corruption? Go!
Excuse me, excuse me!
Move aside!
Move aside! Gangway!
Move, move!
Stand aside!
What?!
- Ah! A wolf!
Move, move! Ah!
As you were.
Move!
Stop that child! Apprehend!
Monsieur Frick!
Hey! Move aside!
Whoa!
- Move!
- Whoa!
- Move!
- Pardon me!
- Sir, move!
Malediction!
Oh! No! Stop the train!
Hold the train! Whoa!
Help! Help! Assistance!
Oh! Hold it, hold the train!
Move the bag! Move the bag!
Ohhh! Oh! No!
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no.
That was very, very bad.
I know you're there.
What's your name, boy'?
Hugo. Hugo Cabret.
Stay away from me, Hugo Cabret.
Or I'll drag you to the Station Inspector's office.
He'll lock you up in his little cell, and you'll never get out, you'll never go to school, you will never get married and have children of your own to take things that don't belong to them.
Give me back my notebook.
I'm going home to burn your notebook.
- You can't burn my notebook.
- And who's to stop me'?
Oh, you look so cold.
I'm very hot.
He's really upset me.
- Who's really upset you?
- That child.
Who are you?
Your grandfather stole my notebook.
I've got to get it back before he burns it.
Papa Georges isn't my grandfather.
And he isn't a thief.
You're the thief.
You're nothing but a... a reprobate.
- You'll have to go.
- Not without my notebook.
Why do you need it so badly'?
I can't tell you.
Is it a secret?
- Yes.
- Oh, good, I love secrets.
- Tell me this instant.
- No.
Well, if you won't tell me, then you'll have to leave.
- Not without my notebook!
-  Shh!
I'll get in trouble.
Just go home.
All right.
I'll make sure he doesn't burn your notebook.
Now go.
What is it?
It's called an automaton.
An aut... An automaton?
I found him abandoned in the attic at the museum.
What does he do?
He's a windup figure, like a music box.
This is the most complicated one
I've ever seen... by far.
You see, this one... this one can write.
It must've been made in London.
Where Mother was from.
She was from Coventry, but she... moved to London.
Magicians used machines like this when I was a boy.
Some walked, some danced, some sang.
But the secret was always in the clockwork.
Huh, look at that.
Can we fix him?
Oh, I don't know, Hugo.
He's badly rusted.
And finding parts to fit will be very hard.
Of course we can fix him.
We're clockmakers, aren't we?
But only after I've finished my work at the shop and at the museum, hmm?
You understand.
We'll put this back in.
Just steady it...
Perfect.
You see this?
Another complication.
Another mystery.
That makes you happy.
Mmm. A keyhole in the shape of a heart.
Unfortunately, we don't have the key.
I fixed the gears and...
Uncle Claude.
There was a fire.
Your father's dead.
Pack your things, quickly.
You're coming with me.
- Quick!
You'll be my apprentice, and you'll live with me at the station.
And I'll teach you how to take care of them clocks.
These apartments were built for them that run the station years ago.
But every body's forgotten they're here.
Your bed is in the corner, over there.
Now get some sleep.
We start work at 5:00.
Oh...
- What about school?
- You've finished with school!
There'll be no time for that when you're in them walls.
Hugo, without me, you'd be in the orphanage.
Ah, time...
- My time is... 60 seconds in a minute.
Sixty minutes in an hour.
Time is everything.
Everything.
Ah, time, time, time...
OK.
Oh, hello.
- I just thought...
- ...rather nice joke.
- Ah, ah, ah!
Oh, oh!
Stop that!
No, Schatzi! Stop it!
- Oh!
- No, no, no, no!
Come back!
Stand back!
He's just a small little dog.
Please be careful!
You've stepped on him!
Don't hurt him!
- Good morning!
- Morning, sweetheart.
Hello, how are you?
Good morning, sir.
Can I help you with anything?
I'll take these.
I thought I might see you today.
I need my notebook.
Why do you need it so badly'?
To help me... to fix something.
Go away.
Please just go away.
Wait! Hey!
- Sorry, I...
- I saw.
- Are you crying?
- No.
Hold still.
Look, there's nothing wrong with crying.
Sydney Carton cries.
And Heathcliff, too.
- In books, they're crying all the time.
- I can do it.
I need to talk to you.
It's terribly important, but...
But not here. We're too... exposed.
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
Only to the most wonderful place on earth.
It's Neverland and Oz and...
Treasure Island all wrapped into one.
- Good morning, Monsieur Labisse.
Ah, Isabelle.
May I present to you
Monsieur Hugo Cabret, a very old and dear companion.
Monsieur Cabret.
Hello.
Well, thank you for this.
I think I'm halfway in love with
David Copperfield. Photography'?
- Back corner, left, top shelf.
- Thank you.
Listen, what's so important?
Papa Georges still has your notebook.
He didn't burn it.
That was all a trick.
- Why?
I don't know.
All I know is the notebook made him very upset.
And he and Mama Jeanne stayed up very late talking about it.
Well, you see, I think he was crying.
Why are you helping me?
Because this might be an adventure.
And I've never had one before... outside of books, at least.
And I think we should be very... clandestine.
OK.
By the way, my name's Isabelle.
Do you want a book?
Monsieur Labisse lets me borrow them, and I'm sure I could get one for you.
No.
Don't you like books?
No... No, I do.
My father and I used to read
Jules Verne together.
Well, come on.
How do I get my notebook back?
Well, I think you should stand up to him.
And don't tell him we talked.
I'll help you if I can.
Be steadfast.
Go away.
Fix it.
I said, fix it.
I know you've been stealing parts from the shop.
You might as well use those you haven't stolen yet.
Give me my notebook.
You've got a bit of talent.
But you'll have to prove there's more to you than being a thief.
- You can earn your notebook.
- How?
Come to the booth every day.
I'll decide how long you must work for each item you stole.
And it will be up to me to decide when... you've earned your notebook, if ever.
- I already have a job.
- "Thief" is not a job, boy.
I have a different job.
But I'll come when I can.
You begin tomorrow. Go away.
I'll begin now.
Not that one, the other one.
Is this your card?
Where is it?
- Little man.
- Ah!
Where are your designated adults?
Answer me!
- Ain't got none.
- Do you have any parents?
- No!
- Excellent.
It's straight to the orphanage with you, isn't it?
What were you doing looking in that man's bottle?
Was that your...
Was that your bottle?! as that your paper bag?
Was that your paper bag?
It states clearly...
Yes, Gustave Dasté here. Yes, Officer, another orphan.
Um, trespass and theft this time.
His hand was trespassing inside a paper bag, with the intent
- of removing its contents.
The object of his plunder? A pastry.
Be quiet!
Keep... Stop your sniffling, you little urchin,
- with your filthy little mitts.
No, of course I wasn't talking to you.
I have only the highest respect for you.
Please.
No, that was not a comment about your wife.
- That's absurd.
I have not heard any of those rumors.
No, I was not aware of that.
Well, I'm sure she will return.
- Come on, you little vermin.
So here's the little pastry thief, eh?
- This is the one.
- Who's a little strudel thief then?
Apologies about your wife.
What do you think I should do about her?
- What? About what?
- Leaving me.
- Oy!
- Hey! Come on!
- Nice try.
Go on, get in there!
- Do you think it's mine?
- What?
I don't know what to do.
She's having a baby, you know.
- Sure it's yours?
- Who else's could it be?
Of course it's yours. When's the last time you had relations with her?
- Uh...
- Any time in the last year?
- No, I don't think so.
- Very suspicious, then.
If you should see her, please...
Oh. You sure you want her back?
Oh, yes, yes.
I love her very much.
Ready?
One, two, three!
- Perfect.
Robin Hood.
I saw this movie.
With Douglas Fairbanks.
Did you see that?
I've never seen a movie.
- What?
- Isn't it appalling?
You've never seen a movie?
Not ever?
Papa Georges won't let me.
- He's very strict about it.
- I love the movies.
My father always took me for my birthday.
Hugo... is your father dead?
I don't want to talk about it.
Isabelle... do you want to have an adventure?
We could get into trouble.
That's how you know it's an adventure.
- How did you two rats get in here?!
Come on!
And I'd better not see you in here again!
Why doesn't Papa Georges let you go to the movies?
I don't know. He never said.
I bet my parents would've let me.
What happened to them?
They died... when I was a baby.
But Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne, they're my godparents, so they took me in.
They're very nice about most everything, except the movies.
My father took me to the movies all the time.
He told me about the first one he ever saw.
He went into a dark room, and on a white screen, he saw a rocket fly into the eye of the man in the moon.
- It went straight in.
- Really?
He said it was like seeing his dreams in the middle of the day.
The movies were our special place... where we could go and watch something and... we didn't miss my mum so much.
You think about him a lot, don't you?
All the time.
Hugo, um... where do you live?
There.
My uncle taught me how to run the clocks.
So I just keep on doing it.
Maybe he'll come back one day, but I doubt it.
Aren't you afraid someone will find out?
Not as long as the clocks keep on running and no one sees me.
- Act natural.
- What?
Just keep on walking.
Act natural.
How am I acting now?
You two, halt!
Come here.
Good day, monsieur.
- Where are your parents?
I work with my Papa Georges at the toy booth.
Surely you've seen me there before.
And this is my cousin from the country, Hugo.
You'll have to forgive him.
He's quite... simple-minded.
Doltish, really.
Poor thing.
Seems Maximilian doesn't like the cut of your jib, little man.
He is disturbed by your physiognomy.
He is upset by your visage.
Why would he not like your face?
Eh?
Well, perhaps he smells my cat.
- Cat?
- Yes.
Christina Rossetti's her name, after the poetess.
Would you like me to recite?
My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot
My heart is like an apple tree
Whose boughs are bent with thick-set...
All right, all right.
I know the rest.
That's enough poetry for today.
I love poetry, particularly that poem by Chris... tina.
- Rossetti.
- She's... yeah.
She's one of my favorites.
I know it's Rossetti.
I know it's Rossetti.
I love poetry, just... not in the station.
We're here to either get on trains or get off them.
Or work in different shops, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Watch your step.
Go on, go.
Doltish?
Now, since I just saved your life, how about letting me see your covert lair?
- My what?
- Where you live, in the walls.
I have to go now. I have things to do.
Hold on!
You've seen my house.
Isn't it about time that I saw yours?
After all, I am your only friend.
You're not my only friend.
Being enigmatic really doesn't suit you.
- What are you up to?
- I've got to go.
I should never have left the station to begin with.
Hugo!
- Where did you get this?
- None of your business.
- I need it.
- What for?
I just need it.
Not unless...
Not unless you tell me why.
Come.
This is marvelous.
I feel just like Jean Valjean.
Oh, this is superlative.
What is that?
It's an automaton.
My father was fixing it... before he died.
Why would my key fit into your father's machine?
He looks sad.
I think he's just waiting.
For what?
To work again.
To do what he's supposed to do.
What happens when you wind him up?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I know it's silly... but I think it's going to be a message from my father.
What an idiot, to think I could fix it.
- Hugo...
- It's broken!
It'll always be broken!
- Look...
Hugo, look, it doesn't have to be like this.
- You can fix it.
- You don't...
You don't understand.
I thought... if I could fix it,
I wouldn't be so alone.
Hugo!
Hugo, look! Look, it's not done.
It's not done!
It's not writing... it's drawing.
That's the movie my father saw.
Georges Méliès?
That's Papa Georges' name.
Why would your father's machine sign Papa Georges' name?
I don't know.
Thank you.
It was a message from my father.
And now we have to figure it out.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Isabelle?
Mama Jeanne, we...
We have to talk to you.
This is Hugo Cabret.
Good evening, ma'am.
Very good manners... for a thief.
I'm not a thief.
What's going on, Isabelle?
Oh, well, it's a terribly long story filled with circumlocutions, but do you remember several weeks ago when...
Wait!
Mama?
Oh, children.
What have you done?
Where did you get this?
You'll call me a liar.
No, Child.
A mechanical man drew it.
Do you have him?
My father found him in a museum.
Nobody wanted him.
We fixed it.
No, but it needed my... my key.
- The key I gave you.
- No, no, Mama, he...
No. No, you take this away.
Can't dredge up the past now.
Whatever happens, you don't let
Papa Georges see it.
- Please tell us what's going on.
- Out! None of your business.
You must both forget this.
My father and I, we worked hard to fix this.
This is all I have left of him.
I need to know what this means.
Please.
There are things you're too young to understand.
You should not yet know such sadness.
- It's Papa Georges.
- He can't know you're here.
Quiet!
Now just keep quiet. I'll find a way to get him out of the apartment.
Not a noise from either of you.
She looked at the armoire.
I already searched it when
I was looking for your notebook.
I'll look again.
You stand guard.
Splendid.
- Where's Fizzie?
- You just missed her.
Not on the stairs? Didn't you see her when you were going past?
- No.
- No? Well, um...
Look.
We have to investigate.
Let me. I'm taller.
- Knock on it.
- OK.
Back from the dead.
Stop. Stop, Georges.
- Stop it! This is your work!
- My work?!
What am I?
Nothing but a penniless merchant!
A broken windup toy.
I trusted you.
This is how you thank me.
You're cruel.
Cruel.
I should get back.
OK.
Thank you... for the movie today. It...
It was a gift.
Sorry, I...
You know this volume?
My father and I used to read it together.
Hmm.
It is intended for... my godson.
But now I think it is intended... for you, Monsieur Cabret.
Might I have another cup?
Still brewing. Soon.
Demitasse, like everything else, must happen at the opportune moment.
If we only knew when that moment was.
Oh, Gustave, be intrepid.
Say hello to her.
Come on, give me your best smile.
Your best smile.
It's beautiful.
Radiant!
Thank you.
- Oh.
- Mademoiselle Lisette.
A very gracious good evening to you.
- Monsieur Inspector.
- Hmm, yes.
Hmm, yes.
Those are lovely posies, those.
Thank you.
Yes, they're from Gourdon.
They come in on the overnight train, so they're very fresh.
Ah, Gourdon.
Splendid country, that.
Robust.
The weather... the cows and such mooing.
Perfectly formed udders.
Yeah.
Are they... Are they smelly?
Are they smelly flowers?
Oh, um... yes, a little.
They're... Please.
You see, I was injured in the war, and it will never heal.
Good evening, mademoiselle.
I lost my brother.
Where?
Verdun.
Good evening, Monsieur Inspector.
Very good evening,
Mademoiselle Lisette.
The Film Academy library.
Excuse me?
The Film Academy library.
You'll find all you need to know about movies there.

The Invention of Dreams...
by René Tabard...
The Story of the First Movies.
"In 1895, one of the very first films ever shown"
was called A Train Arrives in the Station,
"which had nothing more than a train coming into the station."
"" When the train came speeding toward the screen, the audience screamed, because they thought they
- "were in danger of being run over."
"No one had ever seen anything like it before."
"No one had ever seen anything like it before."
"" What began as a sideshow novelty soon grew into something more
when the first filmmakers discovered
"they could use the new medium to tell stories. "
Wow.
"The filmmaker Georges Méliès..." was one of the first to realize that... films had the power...
"...to capture dreams."
"The great pioneer of early filmmaking died during..."
"...the Great War."
Died?
- During the Great War?
- You're interested in Méliès?
Uh... yes.
It's allowed.
IS it?
He's my godfather, you see.
And very much alive, thank you very much.
But that's not possible.
I assure you, sir... it's true.
Why should I believe you?
Because...
Because it's true.
Méliès alive?
Shh!
Come with me.
Your godfather is a passion of mine.
He was a great filmmaker.
Here he is at work in his studio.
And this is a handbill from his stage act.
Here is the great crystal mystery clock made by his mentor, Robert-Houdin.
And this... is one of his actual cameras.
- He was a magician?
- Yes. He began on the stage.
How did he start making movies?
No one really knows.
Look how happy he is.
Professor Tabard, would you perhaps... like to meet him?
Oh... but you see, I have met him.
My brother worked as a carpenter building sets for Méliès.
One day he took me to visit the studio.
It was like... something out of a dream.
The whole building was made of glass.
In reality, this was to let in all the sunlight necessary for filming,
but to my eyes, it was nothing short of...
an enchanted castle.
A palace made of glass.
We need more light!
- Get the louvers opened.
- Open the louver, please! More!
Clear the set, please!
Everybody except actors.
Actors only on the set, please.
Clear the set!
Why we doing this again?
There was a lobster in front of a mermaid.
OK, if that happens again, shout "blocked."
If it's clear, give me a "clear."
If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from... you look around.
This is where they're made.
Ladies and gentlemen, the sun will set!
Knights in position, lobsters in position.
Mermaids in position. Action!
In the end, he made over 500 movies.
He was phenomenally popular in his day.
But... why did he stop?
Up until today, I believed that he died in the war... like so many others.
Could we watch some of his movies?
I wish you could.
But time hasn't been kind to old movies.
This is the only one that we know of that survived.
Out of hundreds, one.
And Still... it is a masterpiece.
We've got to get Tabard to show Papa Georges the film.
Then he'll see he's not forgotten.
Shouldn't I tell Mama Jeanne?
No. I think it should be a surprise, like a magic trick.
We need to have some... panache.
Panache.
Well done!
Monsieur Claude?
Shh.
Are you up there?
Monsieur Claude, was that you?
Keep a grip onto your spanners, you cack-handed oaf!
You can hold onto a bottle well enough, can't you?
Are you inebriated?
Chateauxed, are we?
Shicker? Are you drunk?
He's passed out.
He's passed out, isn't he?
You bloated buffoon!
Could've hurt a child.
What have we here?
Jules Verne. Yes, indeed.
- Not unknown in France.
- One of our finest.
Very good plates.
Monsieur Labisse gave me a book the other night.
He's always doing that, sending books to a good home.
That's what he calls it.
He's got real...
Purpose.
What do you mean?
Everything has a purpose, even machines.
Clocks tell the time and trains take you places.
They do what they're meant to do.
Like Monsieur Labisse.
Maybe that's why broken machines make me so sad.
They can't do what they're meant to do.
Maybe it's the same with people.
If you lose your purpose, it's like you're broken.
Like Papa Georges.
Maybe we can fix him.
Is that your purpose, fixing things?
I don't know.
It's what my father did.
I wonder what my purpose is.
I don't know.
Maybe if I had known my parents...
I would know.
Come with me.
Right after my father died,
I would come up here a lot.
I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine.
Machines never come with any extra parts, you know.
They always come with the exact amount they need.
So I figured if the entire world was one big machine...
I couldn't be an extra part.
I had to be here for some reason.
And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.
Get back.
I'll bring Tabard tomorrow night at 7:00.
Don't say anything.
Are you sure about this?
Not really.
But I think it's the only way to...
To fix him.
Hello. How was your day'?
Boy on the track!
There's a boy on the track!
Get out of the way!
There's a boy!
- Turn it off!
Get out of the way! Move!
Come on!
- Out!
Ahh!
Look out!
Morning.
Yes, he's employed here.
Large, uncouth man.
In the Seine?
Deceased? Are you sure?
No, he has no... no relatives.
Thank you, I'll...
I will gather his belongings.
Thank you so much.
If he is deceased... then who has been winding the clocks?
Good evening.
- This way, sir.
I'll get it.
Well, what a surprise.
Come in, come in.
Isabelle, what's the meaning of this?
Please don't be mad, Mama.
That young man is not welcome here.
We found out who Papa Georges is.
I... I deeply apologize, madame.
I thought you were expecting us.
I will leave immediately and return upon your request.
Please keep your voices down.
My husband's sleeping.
He hasn't been well since...
No, Mama. Mama, please don't make them leave.
I-I don't wish to impose on you, Madame Méliès, but if this is to be the only time we meet, please, let me express to you the profound debt of gratitude
I owe your husband.
When I was a boy,
I saw all his films.
They inspired me.
Your husband is a very great artist.
Oh, I am so pleased you remember my husband's films with such fondness.
But... he's so fragile now.
It only hurts him to remember the past.
Then we will take our leave, madame.
And I do hope you'll forgive me for saying... you are as lovely now as you were in the movies.
Mama?
- You were in the movies?
She appeared in almost all his films.
- You were an actress?
- Well, I...
Was a long time ago, children.
It was...
It was another time. I, uh... I...
Well, I was another person.
Would you like to meet her again?
We have a film.
One of Georges' films?
That's not possible. They're all gone.
May we show you?
Please.
- Oh, yes, please, Mama. Please.
Just be quick with it.
You were an actress, a real cinema actress!
- It's impossibly romantic, Mama.
- It wasn't like that.
We weren't movie stars like they have today.
But we did have fun.
Madame Méliès?
It's in color!
But of course.
We tinted the film.
We painted it by hand, frame by frame.
Mama, it's you!
Yes.
Oh, beautiful.
You were beautiful.
She still is.
I would recognize the sound of a movie projector anywhere.
Georges... you've tried to forget the past for so long.
It's brought you nothing but unhappiness, hmm'?
Maybe it's time to try and remember.
You want to know?
Yes.
Just like you...
I loved to fix things.
I started out as a magician.
Mama Jeanne was my assistant.
We were very successful, I must say.
We even had our own theater.
But I was always tinkering with machines.
I had my own workshop at the theater, where I could invent new illusions.
Once, I even built a working automaton.
Oh, he... was a particular treasure.
I put my heart and soul into him
Then, one night,
Mama Jeanne and I
went to visit a traveling circus.
We were walking past the sideshow tents when I noticed something.
Something strange.
Something wonderful.
It will terrify you!
Sir, madame, inside we have moving pictures! Come and see!
The Lumière brothers had invented the movies.
I fell in love with their invention.
How could I not be part of it?
It was like...
It was like a new kind of magic.
I asked the Lumière brothers to sell me a camera, but they refused.
You see, they were convinced that movies were only a passing fad
and they saw no future in it, or so they said.
In the end, I built my own camera
using leftover pieces from the automaton.
I just had to be a part of this new wonder.
We risked everything. And we sold the theater and everything we had
so we could build our own movie studio.
Excellent.
Cameras, are we clear?
And so the great adventure began.
Actors only on the set, please!
Clear the set!
Look at you, look at you!
Love this shape, Mel.
It's a toile, though, right?
I wrote, designed, directed, and acted
in hundreds of movies.
I'm ready.
Oh, that was good, that was good, yes, yes.
That felt good, that felt good.
On the pulley? On the smoke?
Stop, stop, stop. I saw that.
Give me two minutes.
It was good up to there.
Benny'? I'm gonna have a word.
Reload. Reset the dragon.
Benny, speak to me.
If you pull down a little harder on the left-hand rope, the head will come up higher, which will be better...
- Under the belly!
- I see it.
Excellent, excellent, excellent.
The choreography was really good up to there. Thank you, gentlemen.
- First positions!
- Back, first positions!
Action!
Excellent, excellent.
Setting back.
And in for the kill, knights.
In for the kill!
Come on, then, attack!
Stabbing, stabbing, and lunge!
Good.
Good, good. Good, knights.
Poised for the attack.
And... knights!
Three, two, one, freeze!
Skeletons, that's great.
You can go.
Pyrotechnics in, please.
Knights, please don't move.
Freeze. Freeze, everybody.
Wait for my "action."
Three, two, one, action!
Magic tricks and illusion became my spaciality.
The world of imagination.
My beautiful wife was my muse, my star.
And we couldn't have been happier.
Action!
We thought it would never end.
How could it?
But then the war came.
- And youth and hope were at an end.
The world had no time for magic tricks and movie shows.
The returning soldiers, having seen so much of reality,
were bored by my films.
Tastes had changed, but I had not changed with them.
No one wanted my movies any more.
Eventually I...
I couldn't pay the actors...
or keep the business running, and...
and so my enchanted castle fell to ruin.
Everything was lost.
One night, in bitter despair, I...
I burned all my old sets and costumes.
I was forced to sell my movies to a company
that melted them down into chemicals.
These chemicals were used to make shoe heels.
With the little money I had from selling my films, I bought the toy booth...
and there I have remained.
The only thing I couldn't bring myself to destroy was my beloved automaton.
So I gave him to a museum, hoping he would find a home.
But they never put him on display.
And then the museum burned.
It's all gone now.
Everything I ever made.
Nothing but ashes and fading strips of celluloid.
My life has taught me one lesson, Hugo, and not the one I thought it would.
Happy endings only happen in the movies.
I'll be right back.
Stop that! No, no!
Don't you frighten Monsieur Frick.
Schatzi, what's he got?
What has he got?
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness me.
Did you see that?
Be brave. My brave soldier.
Oh! Monsieur Frick, I am undone!
- Good evening.
- Ah, hello.
There has been a disquieting development.
- What is it?
- You know Monsieur Claude?
- Mm-hmm.
- He's been found deceased.
- No.
- Monsieur Claude!
Consequently, he will no longer be employed here winding the clocks.
You've got a little friend. Look!
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- Monsieur Claude is dead.
What? Why'?
What happened to him?
They found his corpse in the Seine.
It's been down there for many months, it seems.
Can't say I'm surprised.
He was an inebriant of the highest order.
- Well, yes, he was a drunk.
- Shoo.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Yes, he was a drunk!
Scram! Shoo!
He could've drunk the entire River Seine.
- Please, go away! Go! Shh.
- Hold it!
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Did you think you'd escape me?
- Gustave, have a heart!
- Please, help me!
Please.
- No.
He's been undermining this station for too long.
Come on!
- What's the boy done?
- Let me go!
- You happy now, boy?!
- Don't do this!
Do not leave my office.
You don't understand,
I've got to go.
You'll go nowhere until your parents are found.
I don't have any!
Then it's straight to the orphanage with you.
You'll learn a thing or two there.
I certainly did.
How to follow orders.
How to keep to yourself.
How to survive without a family.
Because you don't need one.
You don't need a family.
Police headquarters,
7th arrondissement?
Yes, it's me again.
Another orphan.
Has been a busy week.
Oh, trespass, theft, pilfering, littering, pillorying, walking about, playing.
It's irrelevant.
Please come and pick him up.
Anyway, how are you?
Oh, she came back?
Oh, you think it's yours?
Excellent.
Well, I suppose you'll find out in seven months.
Pardon me. Oh, in March?
I'll try to come.
I... I tend not to plan that far ahead.
Are you sure?
Well, oh, that's very flattering.
I don't know really whether it's appropriate for me to be the godfa...
Oh! Sir, hold on!
Maximilian!
Move!
Move aside! Get out of the way!
Maximilian, find him!
You can't escape me!
There's nowhere to hide up there, boy!
Maximilian, he's gone the other way. Come on!
You!
Get out of my way!
Got you!
- Oof!
No! Oh!
There's a boy! Turn it off!
There's a boy on the track!
Get out of the way!
Move back! Move aside!
Move back!
What were you thinking?
Are you injured?
- Come on!
Stand aside. Careful.
We'll let the orphanage deal with you.
- No, I don't belong there!
- Where do you belong?
A child has to belong to somewhere.
Listen to me, please!
Please, listen to me!
You don't understand.
You have to let me go.
I don't understand why my father died.
Why I'm alone.
This is my only chance... to work.
You should understand!
I do!
I do.
Monsieur... this child belongs to me.
I'm sorry. He's broken.
No, he's not.
He worked perfectly.
Honored guests, I am proud to welcome you to this gala celebrating the life and work of Georges Méliès!
For years, most of his films were thought to be lost.
Indeed, Monsieur Méliès believed so himself.
But we began a search.
We looked through vaults, through private collections, barns and catacombs.
Our work was rewarded with old negatives, boxes of prints, and trunks full of decaying film, which we were able to save.
We now have over 80 films by Georges Méliès.
And tonight, their creator, and the newest member of the Film Academy faculty, is here to share them with you.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I...
I am standing before you tonight... because of one very brave young man... who saw a broken machine... and against all odds, he fixed it.
It was the kindest magic trick... that ever I've seen.
And now, my friends,
I address you all tonight as you truly are:
Wizards, mermaids... travelers, adventurers... magicians.
Come and dream with me.
Yes, you can start with the thaumatrope, the zoetrope, the praxinoscope.
Any study of the history of film must begin with the...
Poppy'? The cave pictographs at...
- Niaux.
- Niaux.
About canine socialization.
Not canine romance?
Oh, Monsieur Frick, do I detect a pearl in your oyster?
The boy designed it.
It does not squeak at all.
Don't forget to smile, darling.
Well, which one?
I've mastered three of them.
Don't worry. I'm now a fully functioning man. Aren't I, dear?
Tap the deck. And it's up, it's up, it's up... It's there!
- Is this your card?
- That is my card.
Once upon a time,
I met a boy named Hugo Cabret.
He lived in a train station.
"Why did he live in a train station?" you might well ask.
That's really what this book is going to be about.
It's about how this singular young man
searched so hard to find a secret message from his father...
and how that message lit his way.

<font color="#808080">NARRATOR:</font> Following months of high rainfall,
the river Seine begins to rise more rapidly than normal.
Over the course of the last week,
thousands of Parisians living nearby the river
have already evacuated.
To continue moving throughout the city,
residents travel by boat or across
a series of wooden walkways built by Parisians themselves.
The water reaches a height of 20 feet above the normal.
The Eiffel Tower has wet feet.

Oh! Paté! Hello!
I have a message from the Interior

He's not happy with all the destruction caused by your psychopathic chase in pursuit of your own ambitions.
But as everyone can plainly see,
I have risked my life.
Paté, I have slain the monster.
- Tell that to the Minister.
- With pleasure.
Victor Maynott, I am arresting you for the premeditated murder of Monsieur Francoeur.
What? Have you lost your mind?
The opposite.
I was so set on being a loyal officer,
I did not see the road you had taken us down.
I needed a flea to show me the way.
Are you mad?
It was just a miserable little flea!
You are so wrong, sir.
There was more humanity in that flea than in the louse I see before me now!

TANGLED 2010 DVDRIP - PRESTIGE
* = Music or songs
Lovingly cooked by 'Bake Master'
(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.
Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.
This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.
And it starts, with the sun.
Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden, flower.
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?
You might want to remember her.
She's kind of important.
Well, centuries pass and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby,
but she got sick,
really, sick.
She was running out of time.
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.
You see instead of sharing the suns gift,
this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power
and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.
Mother Gothel: *Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine*
*What once was mine*
Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?
We've found it!
Flynn: The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.
With beautiful golden hair.
I'll give you a hint.
That's Rapunzel.
To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.
And then that moment ended.
Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow, let your powers shine*
*Make the clock re...*
HUH!
(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child, and just like that...gone.
The Kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the Princess.
For deep within the forest
In a hidden tower.
Gothel raised the child as her own.
*...bring what has been lost, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine.*
Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.
Why can't I go outside?
The outside world is a dangerous place.
Filled with horrible, selfish people.
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.
But the walls of that tower, could not hide everything.
Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky.
In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.
HAH!
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.
GOTCHA!
That's twenty two for me.
How about twenty three, out of forty five?
Okay, well, what do you want to do?
Yeah, I don't think so.
I like it in here and so do you.
Oh, come on Pascal, it's not so bad in there.
*Sings "When will my life begin"*
*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*
*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*
*Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up.*
*Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.*
*So I'll read a book, or maybe two or three.*
*Ill add a few new paintings to my gallery.*
*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook and basically.*
*Just wonder when will my life, begin.*
*Then after lunch, it's puzzles, and darts and baking.*
*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet, and chess.*
*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*
*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*
*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*
*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush, and brush my hair.*
*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*
*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering...*
*Wondering, when will my life begin?*
*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*
*Just like they do on my birthday, each year.*
*What is it like, out there where they glow?*
*Now that I'm older. Mother might just let me go.*
Wow!
I could get used to a view like this.
-Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.
We do this job, you could buy your own castle.
Oh, hay fever?
Yeah.
Huh?
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!
Can't you picture me in a castle of my own?
'Cause I certainly can.
Oh, the things we've seen and it's only eight in the morning.
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.
This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal.
I'm finally going to do it.
-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!
Let down your hair.
It's time.
I know, I know. Come on, don't let her see you.
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.
Coming, mother.
Hi, welcome home, mother.
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do that every single day, without fail, it looks absolutely exhausting, darling.
Oh, it's nothing.
Then I don't know why it takes so long.
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.
Oh look, you're here too.
I'm just teasing, stop taking everything so seriously.
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.
Would you sing for me, dear?
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*
*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!
TADA!
No, no, no can't be.
I distinctly remember. Your birthday was last year.
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.
And I wanted to ask, what I really want for this birthday.
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.
You know how I feel about the mumbling.
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.
-What?
-Oh,...
Well I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights.
Oh, you mean the stars.
That's the thing
I've charted stars and they're always constant.
But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother.
Only on my birthday.
And I can't help but feel that they're,
They're meant for me.
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.
In person.
I have to know what they are.
You want to go outside?
Oh, why Rapunzel.
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.
(Gothel Sings "Mother knows best")
*Still a little sapling, just a sprout.*
-*You know why we stay up in this tower*
-Rapunzel: I know, but...
*That’s right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*
*Guess I always knew this day was coming.*
*Know that soon you'd want to leave the nest.*
-*Soon, but not yet. Shhh..*
-But
*Trust me pet,
Mother, knows best.*
*Mother knows best,*
*listen to your mother.*
*It's a scary world out there.*
*Mother knows best.*
*One way or another, something will go wrong, I swear.*
*Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy, quicksand.*
*Cannibals, and snakes, the plague...yes.*
*Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.*
*And stop, no more, you'll just upset me.*
*Mother's right here, mother will protect you.*
*Darling here's what I suggest.*
*Skip the drama, stay with Mama.*
*Mother, knows best.*
*Mother knows best.
Take it from your mumsey.*
*On your own, you won't survive.*
*Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,*
*Please, they'll eat you up, alive.*
*Gullible, naïve, positively grubby.*
*Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague.*
*Plus I believe, getting kinda chubby.*
*I'm just saying,
'Cause I wuv you.*
*Mother understands,
Mothers here to help you.*
*All I have is one request.*
-Rapunzel?
-Yes?
Don't ever ask to leave this tower, again.
Yes, Mother.
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Don't forget it.
*You'll regret it.*
*Motherrrrrrr.*
*Knows best.*
Ta, ta, I'll see you in a bit, my flower.
I'll be here.
No, no no. This is bad, this is very, very bad, This is really bad.
They just can't get my nose right.
Who cares.
Well it's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.
All right, okay. Give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.
Give us the satchel first.
Wha..? I just...
I can't believe, that after all we've been through together, you don't trust me.
Ouch.
Now help us up, pretty boy.
Sorry, my hands are full.
What?
RYDER!
-Retrieve that satchel with any force.
-Yes, sir!
We got him now, Maximus.
Heeyah!
Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.
No.
No, stop it.
Stop it.
Give it to me.
HAH!
-AHHHHH!
-WHINNEYY!
Oh!
Alone at last.
Huh?
Aah!
Okay, okay, I got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet!
To weak to handle myself out there, huh Mother?
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.
Hmmm.
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair.
One moment, Mother.
I have a big surprise.
Uh, I do too.
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.
I seriously doubt it.
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.
Surprise!
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.
Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.
Okay, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, earlier.
I hope you're not still talking about the stars.
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.
No Mother, I'm just saying, you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.
Oh darling, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.
-Trust me,...
-Rapunzel.
-...I know what I'm
-Rapunzel.
-Oh, come on.
-Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.
All I was gonna say, mother is that...
I know what I want for my birthday, now.
And what is that?
New paint. That paint made from the white shells you once brought me.
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.
Almost three day's time.
I just thought it was a better idea than, uh, stars.
You sure you'll be all right, on your own?
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.
I'll be back in three days time.
I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Okay.
Hmm.
AHHH!
Is this...hair?
Struggling...struggling is pointless.
Huh?
I know why you're here.
And I'm not afraid of you.
What?
Who are you, and how did you find me?
Ah hah.
Who are you, and how did you find me?
I know not who you are.
Nor how I came to find you.
But may I just say.
Hi!
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Ryder.
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.
Gesundheit, here's the deal.
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.
I came across your tower and...
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll never find it.
It's in that pot, isn't it.
Huh?
Ahh, will you stop that.
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.
So, what do you want, with my hair?
-To cut it?
-What?
-Sell it?
-No!
Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair, is to get out of it.
Literally.
Wait, you don't want my hair?
Why on earth would
I want your hair?
Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story.
You're, telling the truth?
Yes.
Hmmm.
I know, I need someone to take me.
I think he's telling the truth, too.
Doesn't have fangs, but what choice do I have?
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
-Deal?
-Look this way.
Oh...oomph!
Do you know what these are?
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?
Lanterns...
I knew they weren't stars.
Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky, with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,
Take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely.
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.
That is my deal.
Yeah, no can do.
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren't exactly, simpatico, at the moment. So I won't be taking you anywhere.
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.
So I have made the decision to trust you.
A horrible decision, really.
But trust me, when I tell you this.
You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick.
But without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.
Let me just get this straight.
I take you to see the lanterns.
Bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel?
I promise.
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.
EVER!
All right, listen, I didn't want to have to want to do this, but you leave me no choice.
Here comes the 'smolder'.
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.
Really!
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.
You coming, Blondie?
*Look at the world so close, and I'm half way to it*
*Look at it all, so big do I even dare?*
*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*
Should I? No.
Here I go.
*Triumphant music*
(Rapunzel sings When will my life begin)
*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*
*Just feel that summer breeze.*
*The way it's calling me.*
*For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.*
*I could go running, and racing, and dancing...
*and chasing, and leaping and bounding.*
*Hair flying, heart pounding and splashing and reeling.*
*And finally feeling,*
*That's when my life begins.*
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!
Mother would be so furious.
That's okay, what she doesn’t know won't kill her, right?
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.
THIS IS SO FUN!
I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.
I am never going baaaccckkk!
I am a despicable human being.
WAHHOOOOO!
Best day, ever!
You know, I can't help but notice, you seem a little at war with yourself, here.
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces, of course, over protective mother, forbidden road trip.
I mean, this is serious stuff.
But let me ease your conscious.
This is part of growing up.
A little rebellion, a little adventure.
That's good, healthy even.
(Laughs) You think?
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me.
Does your mother deserve it?
No.
Will this break her heart and crush her soul?
Of course.
But you just got to do it.
Break her heart?
-In half.
-Crush her soul?
Like a grape.
She would be heart broken, you're right.
I am, oh my, oh bother.
All right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
I'm letting you out of the deal.
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's just turn around, and get you home, here's your pan and your frog.
I get back my satchel.
You get back a mother daughter relationship based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!
What is it going to take to get my satchel back?
I will use this.
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.
Oh, sorry.
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though.
Yeah, that probably be best.
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.
Oh, a Palace horse.
Where's your rider?
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
RAPUNZEL!
I know it's around here, somewhere.
Ah, there it is.
The Snuggly duckling.
Don't worry, very quaint place, perfect for you.
Don't want you scaring, and giving up on this whole endeavor now do we?
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!
Garcon, your finest table, please.
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell. and the other part is really bad man smell.
I don't know why, but overall, it just smells like the color brown.
Your thoughts?
That's a lot of hair.
She's growing it out, is that blood on your moustache?
Goldie, look at this, look at all the blood on his moustache.
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.
Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all.
And if you can't handle this place, well maybe you should be back in your tower.
Is this you?
No, no this is being mean.
Oh, it's him all right.
Gretel, go find some guards.
That reward's going to buy me a new hook.
I can use the money.
What about me?
I'm broke.
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.
Hey, leave him alone.
-Gentlemen, please.
-Give me back my guide, ruffians.
HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!
Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!
Put him down!
Okay, I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns, because I've been dreaming about them my entire life.
Find your humanity.
Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?
I, had a dream.
Once.
(Song: I've got a dream)
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*
*My sneer could curdle dairy.*
*And violence-wise my hands are not the cleanest.*
*But despite my evil look, and my temper and my hook.*
*I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.*
*Can't cha see me on the stage performing Mozart.*
*Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.*
*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*
*For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.*
*'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.*
*He's got a dream, he's got a dream.*
*See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem.*
*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*
*You can count me with the dreamers.*
*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*
*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*
*Plus something here that oozes.*
*Let's not even mention my complexion.*
Big nose thug: *But despite my extra toes.*
*And my goiter and my nose.*
*I really want to make a love connection.*
*Can't you see me with a special little lady.*
*Rowing in a row boat, down the stream.*
*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*
*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*
*'Cause way down deep inside, I gotta dream.*
*I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*
*And I know one day will never reign supreme.*
*Though my face leaves people screaming.*
*There's a child behind it dreaming.*
*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*
*Tor would like to quit and be a florist.*
*Gunther does interior design.*
*Ulf is into mime,
Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.*
*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*
*Fang does little puppet shows.*
*And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns.*
What about you?
-I'm sorry, me?
-What's your dream?
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.
*I have dreams like you, no really.*
*Just much less, touchy-feely.*
*They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny.*
*On an island that I own, tanned and rested and alone.*
*Surrounded by enormous piles of money.*
*-I've got a dream...I've got a dream.
-(Thugs) She’s got a dream.*
*I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam.*
*And with every passing hour.*
*I'm so glad I left my tower.*
*Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.*
*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*
*So our differences ain't really that extreme. We're one big team.*
*Call us brutal, say sadistic and grotesquely optimistic.
*'Cause way down deep inside, we've gotta dream.*
*We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*
*Yes way down deep inside
I've got a...*
*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*
Yeah!
I found the guards.
Where's Ryder, where is he?
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him, turn the place upside down if you have to!
Go, live your dream.
I will.
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.
Thanks for everything.
I believe this is the man you're looking for.
You got me.
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.
Maximus.
What's he doing?
A passage, come on men, let's go.
Corman, make sure those boys don't get away.
Play it safe.
We'll go get the crown.
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.
Because I just found me a tall drink of water.
Oh stop it, you big lug.
Where does that tunnel lead out?
Knife!
Well, that got us safe.
Didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty, impressive.
I KNOW!
I know...
Sooo, Flynn.
Where are you from?
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.
However I am becoming very interested in yours.
Now I...I know I'm not suppose to mention the hair.
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to ask about the frog.
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.
Here's my question though, if you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven't you gone before?
Uhh, hey, well...
Uh, Flynn...
Flynn!
Run,
RUN!
Who's that?
They don't like me.
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment, that everyone here doesn't like me.
Here.
I've waited a long time for this.
Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these.
HAH!
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done.
How 'bout two out of three?
Flynn!
Flynn, look out.
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.
You should see your faces.
Because you look...
Ridiculous
Come on, Blondie.
Jump.
It's no use,
I can't see anything.
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch black down there.
This is all my fault.
She was right, I never should have done this.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, Flynn.
Eugene.
What?
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.
So you might as well know.
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.
What?
I have magic hair, that glows when I sing.
*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*
We made it.
Her hair glows.
We're alive.
I'm alive!
I didn't see that coming.
You're hair actually glows.
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?
-Eugene!
-What?
It doesn't just glow.
Why is he smiling at me?
I'll kill him.
I'll kill that, Ryder.
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.
And get back the crown, come on.
Boys.
Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails, and think for a moment.
Oh, please there's no need for that.
Well if that's all you desire, then be on your way.
I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns, would have made you rich beyond belief.
And that wasn't even the best part.
Oh well, C'est la vie.
Enjoy  your crown.
What's the best part?
It comes with revenge on Flynn Ryder.
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.
Sorry.
Just don't, don't freak out.
*Flower gleam and glow*
*Let your powers shine*
*Make the clock reverse*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
*Heal what has been hurt.*
*Change the fates design.*
*Save what has been lost.*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
*What once was mine.*
-Ah...
-Please don't freak out.
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out, are you freaking out?
No, I'm just very interested in your hair. and the magical qualities that it possesses.
How long has it been doing that, exactly?
Forever, I guess.
Mother said when I was a baby people tried to cut it.
They wanted to take it for themselves.
But, once it's cut.
It turns brown, and looses its power.
A gift like that, it has to be protected.
That's why Mother never let me...
That's why...I never left the...
You never left that tower.
And you're still gonna go back?
No...yes.
It's complicated.
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's a little bit of a...
It's a little bit of a downer.
There was this book.
A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids.
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive.
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing to ever brag about, of course.
Was he a thief too?
Ahh, well no.
Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do.
He could go anywhere that he wanted to go.
And...and, for a kid, with nothing.
I don't know, I...
It just seemed like a better option.
You can't tell anyone, about this, okay?
It could ruin my whole reputation.
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.
Oh, the thing about a reputation, it's all that a man has.
Um, well I should uh...
I, I should get some more firewood.
Hey.
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than, Flynn Ryder.
Well, then you'd be the first.
But, thank you.
Well, I thought he'd never leave.
Mother?
Hello, dear.
But I...I..., don't we...
How did you find me?
Oh, it was easy really.
I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal, and followed that.
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.
I've been on this incredible journey.
And I've seen and learned so much.
I even met someone.
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.
I think
I think he likes me.
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that's demented.
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.
Dear this whole romance that you've invented, just proves you're to naive to be here.
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.
*Mother...*
-NO!
-No?
Oh.
I see how it is.
*Rapunzel, knows best.*
*Rapunzel's so mature, now.*
*Such a clever grown up, miss.*
*Rapunzel knows best.*
*Fine, if you're so sure now.*
*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*
How did you?
*This is why he's here.*
*Don't let him deceive you.*
*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.*
-I will.
*Trust me my dear, that's how fast he'll leave you.*
*I won't say I told you so...no.*
*Rapunzel knows best.*
*So if he's such a dream boat.*
*Go and put him, to the test.*
-Mother, wait.
*If he's lying, don't come crying.*
*Mother, knows best.*
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?
Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand?
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.
Hey, you all right?
Oh, sorry, yes.
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.
I mean because here's the thing.
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.
Born with it, but superhuman strength?
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...
Patience boys. All good things to those who wait.
Hmm, what?
Well I hope you're here to apologize.
AAAAAAAH!
No, no put me down.
Stop it. Let...me...go!
-Give me, him.
-OW!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy boy, easy, calm down.
Easy boy.
Easy.
That's it.
Now sit.
-Sit.
-What?
Now drop the boot.
Drop it.
Oh, you are such a good boy.
Yes you are.
You all tired, from chasing the bad man all over the place?
Flynn: Excuse me?
Nobody appreciates you, do they?
Do they?
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.
Isn't that right?
Maximus.
You've got to be kidding me.
Look, today is kinda the biggest day of my life.
And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.
Just for twenty four hours and then, you can chase each other to your hearts content.
Okay?
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.
OOMPH!!
(Mouths) WOW
Ahh!
Sorry.
Thank you.
It's for the lost Princess.
To the boats
Hey, Max.
What? I brought them.
Most of them.
Where are we going?
Well, best day of your life.
I figured you should have a decent seat.
You okay?
I'm terrified.
Why?
I've been looking out the window for eighteen years.
Dreaming about what it would feel like when those lights rise in the sky.
What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be?
It will be.
And what if it is?
What will I do then?
Well that's the good part,
I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.
*Solemn Music*
(Rapunzel sings, "I see the Light")
*All those days
Watching from the windows.*
*All those years
Outside looking in*
*All that time
Never even knowing*
*Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here*
*Blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here*
*Suddenly I see
Standing here*
*It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be*
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted*
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new*
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*
*All at once
Everything looks different*
*Now that I see you*
I have something for you, too.
I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.
And the thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.
You know what I mean?
I'm starting to.
*All those days
Chasing down a daydream*
*All those years
Living in a blur*
*All that time
Never truly seeing*
*Things, the way they were
Now she's here*
*Shining in the starlight
Now she's here*
*Suddenly I know
If she's here*
*It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go*
*And at last, I see the light*
*And it's like the fog has lifted*
*And at last, I see the light*
*And it's like the sky is new*
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*
*All at once
Everything is different*
*Now that I, see you.*
*Now that I...see you.*
Is everything okay?
Huh? Oh yes.
Uh, yes of course.
I just...
I'm sorry, everything is fine.
There's just something I have to take care of.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
It's all right, Pascal.
Ahh, there you are.
I've been searching everywhere for you guys. Since we got separated.
Hey the sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
You gotta be excited about that.
Anyhow, just wanted to say,
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.
I'll miss you, but I think its for the... best.
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?
-What?
-We heard you found something.
Something much more valuable than a crown.
We want her, instead.
I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.
He did.
What?
No.
He wouldn't.
See for yourself.
Eugene?
Eugene!
Fair trade.
A crown, for the girl with the magic hair.
How much do you think someone will pay to stay young and healthy forever?
No, please.
NO!
NO!
AHH!
Rapunzel!
Mother?
Oh, my precious girl.
Mother.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
-Mother, how did you?
-I was so worried about you dear.
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you.
All right, let's go, let's go before they come to.
You were right, mother.
You were right about everything.
I know darling.
I know.
Look!
The crown.
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.
Rapunzel!
Let's get this over with, Ryder.
Where are we going?
Oh...
There, it never happened.
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazel nut soup.
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you, what was out there.
The world is dark, and selfish, and cruel.
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine.
It destroys it.
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!
It wasn't us.
It was the old lady.
Old lady?
Wait, no, wait!
You don't understand, she's in trouble.
Wait!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?
Are you all right?
I'm the lost princess.
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.
I am the lost Princess.
Aren't I?
Did I mumble, Mother?
Or should I even call you that?
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?
Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?
It was you!
It was all, you.
Everything I did, was to protect you.
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,
Hiding from people who would use me for my power.
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.
From you.
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.
What did you do to him?
That criminal, is to be hanged for his crimes.
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.
NO!
You were wrong about the world.
And you were wrong about me.
And I will never let you use my hair, again!
You want me to be the bad guy?
Fine.
Now I'm the bad, guy.
What's this?
Open up.
What's the password?
-What?
-Nope.
Open this door.
Not even close.
You have three seconds
One...
Two...
Three...
Frying pans.
Who knew, right?
AAAAH!
-Head down?
-Head down.
-Arms in?
-Arms in.
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.
Knees apart?
Why do I need to keep my knees apar...
AAAAAAAAH!
Max.
You brought them here?
Thank you.
No really, thank you.
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time we've just misunderstanding one another.
And we're really just, yeah your right. We should go.
Max.
Max!
WHOAAAAA!
Okay Max, lets see how fast you can run.
Rapunzel.
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again.
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.
Oh don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.
And as for us?
We are going where no one will ever find you, again.
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.
Stop fighting me.
NO! I won't stop.
For every minute of the rest of my life I will fight.
I will never stop trying to get away from you.
But, if you let me save him...
I will go with you.
No. No, Rapunzel.
I'll never run, I'll never try to escape.
Just let me heal him. And you and I will be together.
Forever, just like you want.
Everything will be the way it was.
I promise.
Just like you want.
Just...let me...heal him.
In case you get any ideas about following us.
Eu..Eugene!
Ah, AHHH!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Everything is going to okay, though.
-No, Rapunzel!
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..
-Come on.
-I can't let you do this.
And I can't let you die.
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.
It's gonna be all right.
Rapunzel, wait...
Eugene, what...?
NOOO!
No...NO!
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
No, no, no,
NOOO!
No, no, no, noooo.
NO!
Noooooooooo!
No, no, no, no, Eugene.
Oh, look at me, look me,
I'm right here.
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.
*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*
-Rapunzel...
-What?
You were my new dream.
And you were mine.
*Heal what has been hurt.*
*Change the fates design.*
*Save what has been lost.*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
What once was mine.
Rapunzel?
Eugene.
Did I ever tell you, I've got a thing for brunettes?
(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what happened next.
The kingdom rejoiced.
For the lost Princess had returned.
The party lasted an entire week.
And, honestly I don't remember much of it.
Dreams came true all over the place.
That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it.
And this guy? Well he eventually found true love.
As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost over night.
As did most of the apples.
Pascal? 
Never changed.
At last Rapunzel was home,
and she finally had a real family.
She was a Princess worth waiting for.
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her.
And as for me, well.
I started going by Eugene again.
Stopped thieving, and basically turned it all around.
But I know what the big question is.
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?
Well I'm pleased to tell you.
That after years, and years of asking,
and asking, and asking.
I finally said yes.
*Eugene*
All right, I asked her.
And we're living happily ever after.
Yes, we are.
You're looking at the many noble rabbits who have served as the Easter Bunny.
If you've ever gotten a basket of candy and colored eggs on Easter morning, you have them to thank.
Yes, even that guy.
See, every bunny dreams of holding the title, but not just anyone can do it.
You have to be majestic.
You have to be dignified.
You have to be, well, a bunny.
Or, at least you did.
Hi. I'm Fred O'Hare, the first human Easter Bunny.
Sounds insane, you say?
It'll make sense once you know how it all went down.
E.B.?
E.B.?
Where are you?
Hi, Dad!
Woohoo!
Oh! There you are.
Son! I was thinking.
You are getting so big, you're practically a foot tall.
Over a foot, if you count the ears.
I always count the ears.
So, how would you like to go to work with me today?
Would I?
That sounds awesome.
I said the same thing when my father first took me to the factory.
I didn't use the word "awesome," but...
Down, please.
Thank you. Go ahead, Son.
Take a look.
Whoa!
Look at all that candy.
Come on, come on.
See you.
This is so cool!
Oh, careful! E.B., welcome to the Easter Factory.
This is where we make all the candy and eggs that I deliver to the children of the world.
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?
It's amazing, Dad!
I'm glad you like it, because someday this will all be yours.
Really?
Now, come on, Son.
There's so much to see.
Daddy, what do you call that thingamajig?
Ah, the Marshmallow
Chick Machine.
Loved them since
I was your age.
When your grand-dad, the Easter Bunny before me, took me on this very same tour...
Hello.
Hello, little bunny.
What are you doing?
We don't eat the candy.
We make the candy!
But I thought...
E.B.
This is my second-in-command,
Carlos.
It's fine, Carlos. E.B. was, uh, taste-testing.
Isn't that right, Son?
Yup, I'm taste-testing.
It's great.
Oh, dear me. No, no.
Son, we're going to have to work on your taste.
Carlos, too much marsh, not enough mellow.
Exactly, señor, I was just going to say that.
Phil! Too much marsh, not enough mallow!
Phil! Phil!
Phil!
Hi, boss.
No dancing on the job!
It's forbidden.
Yes, sir. I'm very bad.
I am so sorry, señor.
I will deal with this personally.
Yes. Easter is right around the corner, Carlos.
There is no room for error.
Si, señor.
Remember this, E.B., we can't make any mistakes.
The entire world is counting on us.
This seems hard, Dad.
And I don't know if I can do it.
Oh, come now.
Don't you worry, Son.
Yes, it's a big responsibility, but you'll be ready.
You'll have to be.
Why, in a few years you will pick up the Egg of Destiny and receive the magical powers of the Easter Bunny.
Now, let's move on.
Bye, Carlos.
Okay, ciao.
See you later.
Enjoy your life of privilege, little bunny.
So, how are my kids doing?
I had rehearsals for the Easter play today.
Oh.
They usually cast a boy as Peter Cottontail, but they made an exception for me on account of my singing voice is so strong.
That's great, honey.
Sam, how about you?
Well, I'm up for a big promotion at work.
Really? That's terrific.
Good to hear that two of my kids are working so hard.
So, Fred. How did that job interview go?
I don't know about that place, Dad.
I just don't know if it's really what I'm looking for.
Really?
Did they pay money?
Then it's exactly what you've been looking for.
Well, that's just crass.
What are you nodding for?
"Dear Fred, as your mother
I have always loved you,
"and it hurts me to have to tell you
"in this way, but there comes a time
"when every young man must grow up and leave the nest."
You all prepared statements?
Fred, we're just doing this because we love you, Son.
The Sadeki family down the street went through the same thing with their son Jordy.
He just laid on the couch all day watching court shows, but then they had an intervention, and now he works in a pharmacy, and has an apartment.
I don't really want to work at a pharmacy, Mom.
Well, you need to do something.
You need to get a life.
You need to get a job and you need to move out.
Especially that last one.
But I did move out.
And I had a job.
Is it my fault the company downsized?
Fred, that was over a year ago!
You have to get back on the horse.
And you have so much potential.
Thanks, Mom.
Sometimes I think you adopted me because Fred was such a disappointment.
Wow.
Alex, that is a very hurtful statement.
You're not denying it.
Eat your dinner.
Mom, Dad, I'm trying, okay?
I go on job interviews. I had one today!
Yes, but it wasn't what you were looking for.
It's always something.
You didn't like the commute.
The parking lot was too far away from the building.
The man in the cubicle next to you smelled.
He smelled.
Fred, nothing is ever good enough for you.
You don't want me to settle, do you?
Settling is fine.
Dad, when I was a kid, you said that when I grew up I was going to do something great.
Yes. But now I'm telling you that you should forget about "great," and settle for getting any job.
We should have nudged you out of the nest a long time ago.
Baby birds get a nudge.
Giant birds who never leave, they get shoved.
E.B.!
E.B.!
Hello, Dad.
So, what do you think?
Uh, what did I...
It was great! Really kicking.
But, E.B., shouldn't you be rehearsing your speech?
You're about to be crowned the Easter Bunny in front of
3,000 of your peers.
Uh, yeah, about that.
Yes?
LOOK, Dad, ever since I was yea big, it's been,
"The Easter Bunny wouldn't do that" and
"The Easter Bunny has to be perfect."
But I'm not perfect.
I know that, Son.
But you'll get there, eventually.
But I'm...
Listen.
You want me to be this.
But maybe I'm not this.
Just maybe, maybe I'm this.
A Sock?
Ugh."
Yeah, that's right.
I might be a metaphorical sock.
I might not be a good enough egg, but I might be the best sock ever.
I might not cut it delivering Easter baskets, but I might be great at something else.
Oh, the drums!
Why, I think that's fine.
I think it's really nice that you have a hobby.
Everyone should have a hobby.
It's not a hobby, Dad.
I want to drum in a band.
I want to see the world.
E.B., the Easter
Bunny sees the world.
Every country in one night, making people of the world happy.
Really, Dad?
The whole world?
What about China?
No!
Look, it's candy, woman!
Madam, please.
All right. So, we haven't cracked China yet.
But, for all those that do believe, you will be there.
No, Dad. I don't want to be the Easter Bunny.
Now, listen to me.
Four thousand years of tradition doesn't end just because one selfish bunny doesn't feel like doing it.
Look. Dad...
No, E.B., you look!
You are going to be the Easter Bunny!
Now you need to get it together, get rid of these drums, and get your priorities straight!
I'll see you out there!
No, I don't think you will.
Destination.
Where dreams come true.
In-flight snack preference.
Any baggage?
Just emotional.
I'm sorry, Dad.
OW!
I did it.
Hollywood.
Right. First order of business, find a place to stay.
Perfect.
Fred, wait, wait, wait! Fred.
Did you know about this, Sam?
Oh, uh...
You did.
Okay, look.
The rules of this intervention state that I am not supposed to help you, okay?
So you can't tell anyone what I'm about to do.
No! I'm not going to take money from you.
Wasn't going to give you money.
We can call it a loan.
Fred, look,
I got you a job interview tomorrow at my friend's company.
I'm a little slammed tomorrow.
I know you're not.
I'm pretty busy.
No.
Look, it's an entry-level position.
Entry-level?
At a video game company!
Okay. That's kind of cool.
I know.
All right, look, if it means that much to you, I'll swing by.
No, Fred.
You don't "swing by." Okay?
You shower, you shave, and you show up.
The three "shs."
Come on, Fred. You've got to start your life.
Think of this as a reboot.
Right!
It's time.
Yeah. You know what?
You're right.
In a couple of months, couple of weeks, you're gonna see a whole new Fred.
Yeah. By Easter.
Easter is in two weeks.
By Easter, I'm going to have a new job, a new place, a new life.
Great!
Okay.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go sleep in my car.
Fred, listen.
My boss is on vacation for a few weeks and he asked me to house-sit.
Nobody ever asks me to house-sit.
I know.
It's so weird.
Anyway, he has dogs, and you know I'm scared of dogs, so take over for me.
Wait. Your boss lives in a big mansion, right?
Yes, in Beverly Hills.
And he loves his house more than he loves his kids.
So you have to behave. Okay?
Do not touch anything.
Do not break anything.
Do not go upstairs!
Wait, what's upstairs?
Fred.
Okay.
And do not forget to feed the dogs.
Got it!
Thank you, Sam.
You're welcome.
I put the address on the paper.
Okay.
But, Fred?
Yeah?
If you screw up,
I'll kill you.
Okay.
Listen to me.
This is the Playboy Mansion. It's not a hotel.
Yeah, right.
But it says here that ever since 1971, the Playboy
Mansion has been home to sexy bunnies from around the world.
Friend, I can't see you.
Please step forward.
Now, I'm telling you that I am both a bunny, and incredibly sexy.
I don't have time for this.
Hello? Hello?
Maybe this is the rags part of my rags-to-riches story.
All right, let's see here.
54 Broadway Terrace.
Whoa!
Look at this!
Hello, Fred's new crib.
Maybe this is a good thing.
All great artists suffer before they become famous.
That lady wrote
Harry Potter in a ditch.
But it's the hunger, loneliness and exhaustion that gets you really.
How could this night get any worse?
I see.
Car accident. Thank you!
OW!
Why?
Oh, ow!
It's still alive.
I've got to help him out.
This will do.
Don't you worry, little friend.
I'm going to end your suffering.
No!
Who said that?
Well, who do you think said it?
Your latest victim.
You know what? We can leave the insurance companies out of this.
I could just, maybe, come live with you for a couple of months.
No, no, no!
Not real. Not real. Not real.
Excuse me?
You left your car back there, with the lights on.
I'm just saying!
Say something. Talk again.
I'm E.B. And you are?
I'm Fred.
Well, Fred, I am so hungry.
Have you got anything in the old snack department?
Okay.
Here you go.
Oh! Oh! That's.. -
What is this?
What? It's Turkey Jerky.
First, you hit me with your car, and then you try and poison me with a meat stick.
Why do you hate me?
Okay. Is there something you'd rather eat, you weird little thing?
Well...
Carrots!
He's a genius.
One carrot. Okay.
Time to hop away out of Fred's life back to the Enchanted Forest.
You're kicking me out?
Yeah. It's a bad time.
Yeah. Did some jerk just hit you with his car?
That kind of bad time?
No, I'll tell you what.
It's fine.
Oh, me leg. OW.
I mean, you can't be expected to help every innocent creature you wound.
And I'm sorry if I dented your bumper with my face and body.
Do you want me to look for some baby aspirin?
No, no! You save it.
You might run over a baby.
Just pray that sweet messenger of death visits quickly.
Is that the icy hand now?
Okay, wait!
On the off-chance that you're really here and I'm not completely crazy, and I did run you over and you're hurt...
I guess you can stay.
Thanks, mate. And I could bunk down anywhere. Seriously.
West wing, master suite, guest bedroom. I'm not picky.
Right. Okay.
What's this space, then?
This is a place for you to stay for the night.
I'm not a car.
So why would I need to stay here?
Look, it's not my house.
I'm not even allowed to go upstairs, and I'm human.
Sorry. What are the newspapers for?
Because I'm not really a voracious reader or anything.
You know, you're an animal.
So, we all know animals...
I understand.
I'll just sleep down here, among my poo and pee like a pig.
If you like, you use it as well.
Sorry.
No, don't reproach yourself for these medieval conditions.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm going to go to bed where, hopefully, I've been all along.
So, good night.
Oh, okay,
I'll just stay here then.
By myself.
In the dark.
With the door closed.
Señor. Señor
I have news.
Operations are running at full capacity.
With my supervision, we are right on target for Easter.
Fine, fine.
But is there any report on my son?
Yes, I have the report.
The sun will be shining, foggy times are lifting.
Easter will be clear sailing, señor.
Not the sun.
My son, E.B.!
That son.
Yes. I almost forget.
The rabbit hole was used for an unscheduled trip earlier this evening, sir!
What? You mean he ran away?
And at the height of our busiest time.
It's almost unforgivable.
But how could he just take off like this?
It's just not like him.
Please, señor.
Don't be too rash.
It's way too early to disown him.
But I wasn't going to...
Wait a minute. Are you hopping?
Am I? I didn't notice.
It just comes so naturally.
Anyway, señor considering your obvious distraction with this, wouldn't it be wise to pass the mantle to, I don't know, somebody else?
Hmm.
Let's see. It would have to be someone you trust.
Someone who is comfortable giving orders.
Phil! Keep doing that, but do it faster!
Faster. Gotcha.
And stop dancing!
No dancing. Yes, sir.
Carlos, you're right.
I'm totally right.
Assemble the Pink Berets at once!
I'm sorry. What?
We need to find E.B.
The Pink Berets?
But they're only to be used in a situation of extreme emergency.
This is pretty extreme, Carlos.
The Pink Berets will find E.B.
They have to!
You can't ignore me forever, Senor Bunny.
Freeze!
Who's there? Is this the same guy?
Don't make me come down there.
101 is blocked due to an overturned tractor trailer at the Burbank entrance.
Weather is a cool 72 degrees...
Rabbit.
Hello?
Talking rabbit?
Okay. Wow.
Dude, you are stressed.
Hi, Fred O'Hare.
Hey, Fred O'Hare.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Fred O'Hare.
You need me for this job.
You're going to hire me for this job.
Oh! The dogs. Right.
"Sam, until Daisy and Baby are accustomed to you,
"please wear the safety suit in the hall closet when you feed them."
Safety suit?
Daisy! Baby! Come here.
Let's go.
I'm on a schedule here.
Oh!
No!
No! Heel! Sit! Sit!
That's fine.
Okay, it's all good.
No, no, no!
Look, Fred!
Can you believe it?
They've got a drum kit in here.
What do you think?
Never had one formal lesson!
I am the Extreme Rock Master!
I know what you're thinking.
No, you really don't.
Hey, Fred, what's wrong?
You look a bit put out.
Why are you still here?
You can't be up here.
You're in the forbidden part of the house.
Yeah, but so are you.
Pick this up, man.
You've destroyed the place!
I wouldn't say, "destroyed.
"I was just getting comfortable.
What about your injury? Huh?
Your leg? You're hurt, right?
Yeah, exactly. I needed a soft bed in which to convalesce.
Oh, I see. So, you climbed a flight of stairs...
Struggled up each stair is more like it.
Worth it, though.
That Jacuzzi loosened me right up.
Jacuzzi?
Oh, yeah. You might want to turn it off.
It was creating a lot of bubbles.
No!
My sister is going to kill me!
Don't worry.
We'll clean it up together, as soon as I've beat my high score.
Hey, Fred! Come on, your turn.
Pick up a guitar, mate.
Fred, I think we got off on the wrong foot.
You said some things,
I flooded some things.
Let's start over again.
Fred? Why am I in a box?
This seems like the sort of thing a serial killer might do.
Is this going to be a surprise?
All right, come on. Out.
Oh! Are we going for a hike?
Better! We're releasing you into the wild.
The wild?
Oh, no, no, no. I'll just stay with you, I think.
This place seems to be dominated by carnivores
Get out. Let's go.
What are you doing?
You're going to leave me here?
Yeah, there's lots of rabbits out here.
You'll feel right at home.
Fred, are we locked in a destructive relationship?
Get out. Fred.
You're making a scene!
Get out!
Move along.
Look, Fred.
Goodbye!
But I want to stay with you!
Fred, please don't go.
I'm already late. So go away.
Come on, man.
Fred, mate.
I'll behave.
I'll clean up my mess.
I'll do the dishes.
Not your problem.
There are no dishes in the wild.
No. Fred.
But I'm special.
Well, we're all special.
You're not getting it.
I don't mean special as in,
"everybody's special."
I mean, I'm really special.
What're you doing?
See?
Jelly beans?
Mmm-hmm.
So what? So you talk and you poop candy.
Could you do it in someone else's life?
No, you're right.
It's not your concern.
And in two weeks, maybe you can explain to the children of the world why they didn't get their Easter baskets.
Easter?
What, Easter?
No way.
Yes, Fred.
I am the Easter Bunny.
Hop in.
Yes! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew you were real. I knew it!
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm real.
No.
When I was a kid,
I saw you on Easter morning.
You did?
Yeah.
That was you, right?
Absolutely. No question.
Okay. Because you do look a little different. Was it...
I don't know, have you lost weight?
Or maybe it's the clothes.
You're talking about the old guy.
Yeah. We got rid of him.
He didn't understand children. Ah.
He didn't get that children sometimes just want to drum.
I mean, dream.
Sometimes they just want to dream.
Children dream.
Yeah. So he had to go, anyway, this guy. Right.
Well, it's a good thing you got rid of him, then.
Exactly.
So... Wait a minute.
Why are you here now?
Just doing a little last minute recon for Easter deliveries.
Finding ideal egg hiding locations.
There is one. That's perfect!
Compiling a list of kids with chocolate allergies.
That kind of thing.
It's all very technical.
I see.
Okay.
Oh, man. I'm really late.
Late for what?
What are we doing?
I have a job interview.
You're staying here.
But here is boring. Let me come with you.
I could be a job reference.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Look, I really need this job, and I don't think anyone there is going to be able to handle you.
I'm not sure I can handle you.
So, just do me a favor? Wait in the car.
Fred, I don't want to get your hopes up, but I think you're definitely going to get this job.
Be good.
Yes, sir.
I'll stay here and guard the vehicle.
2UP Games.
Yes, sir. I'll put you through to Mr. Hill.
Hi, I'm Fred O'Hare.
I'm here for a 10:30 with
Mrs. Beck.
You're a half-hour late.
I know. I called.
That doesn't make you any earlier.
Uh-huh.
You know, you're the first impression people get when they walk in here.
In many ways, you are the face of the company.
Fill this Out.
Yes, ma'am.
2UP Games.
Yes, sir. Can I help you?
What is that alarming noise?
Oh, no!
Pink Berets!
2UP Games. Please hold.
I'm sorry, sir.
Who did you want to speak to?
Fred.
What are you doing here?
I told you to wait in the car!
This is serious.
I really need your help!
I need your help! You can't be here.
You've got to go!
Fred?
Yes.
Get me out of here!
Ah!
Mrs. Beck.
Yes.
How are you?
I'm well. I can't say that I'm that impressed with your punctuality, though.
Yeah, I have half a dozen excuses.
But I'm just going to go with a straight apology.
I'm really, really sorry.
Okay. Clean slate, then.
Thank you.
So, let's begin, Fred.
I'll show you inside.
Whoa!
So, recent employment history.
You haven't worked in a year?
Yeah, my parents have moved in with me.
That has sort of been a full-time job.
Mmm-hmm.
It's fine. It just gets in the way of writing my novel, is all.
You're writing a novel?
What is that about?
It's about a crippled soldier who, in the future, goes to another planet and he becomes one of the indigenous people who are blue and live in the forest.
That's not Avatar?
Not really.
So, why don't we take a walk and I can tell you a little bit about the company?
Okay.
So, the good news is, we tend to promote from within.
But you'd be starting in the mailroom.
Mailroom.
Is that a problem?
No, no, I love mail.
I get lots of mail.
E- mail, snail mail, chain mail.
I am male.
Speaking of mail, that's Cody.
Let me introduce you to him.
He is being promoted to junior exec and you would be replacing him.
Wow. Congratulations.
Question.
I need 30 copies of something, collated, stapled, bound and on my desk by yesterday.
What do you do?
I would make 30 copies, and I would do what you said with them.
I smell potential.
Oh, Mrs. Beck, I was wanting to talk to you about my lunch.
Fred. Fred!
What is wrong with you?
This is an extreme emergency.
You're ruining this for me.
You really need to go.
You're right.
I'll create a diversion and we'll escape in the ensuing chaos.
E.B., no! Get back here!
Fred?
Yeah.
I got a good feeling about this place.
Where to next?
Sounding good to me.
But where is Ricky?
We need to put a back beat behind that.
A back beat.
I think Ricky went out for coffee.
I guess he's back.
How you feeling, Ricky?
Yeah, I'm smashing.
I mean, I'm fine.
I'm just fine, daddy-o.
Well, then let's do it.
Okay, so this our sport...
Oh.
This is our sports-game motion-capture studio.
Mmm-hmm.
In here?
Yeah.
Ah!
Hockey.
It's golf.
And this is our sound recording studio for our music games.
We've done Extreme Rock
Master; Extreme Jazz Master; and now we're doing
Extreme Blues Master.
Sounds like a cool idea.
Whoa, you got the Blind Boys of...
Quit it!
I'm going to kill you so bad! Get out!
Okay, Fred, let's try and keep moving...
I'm all of a sudden not feeling so good. Oh.
Do you have a restroom?
Yeah.
Where is that?
That was brilliant!
I mean, that was tight.
Sounded all right.
But I know my drummer when I hear him.
So, who are you, boy?
Okay, I admit it. I'm not a blues man.
My name is E.B.
I'm just some guy off the street with two sticks of wood and a dream.
I understand if you throw me out.
I get it if you don't want to give me a break.
Hey, slow down, friend.
You know, we have a buddy who is always on the lookout for new talent.
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather of entertainment.
And he's having auditions tomorrow.
The Hoff?
You mean he can help me?
If he like you.
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.
Good luck, little rabbit.
Wait, how did you know I was...
Mmm!
Clever gents.
So, Fred, how'd it go?
Don't say a word.
Can I get a little clarification, here?
Is this what the Easter Bunny does now?
He just goes house to house, messing up people's lives?
Well, that is just hurtful.
Besides, you're selling yourself short.
They were going to shove you in the mail room.
Well, excuse me, but I happen to think you're better than that.
You don't Know me, okay?
We just met.
I can tell. You give off this aura of untapped potential.
I do?
Don't pull that with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.
But, Fred, I'm serious.
You're destined to do something great.
I just know it.
I've heard that one before.
You'll find an awesome job.
Hey. Look, what about this?
Dog walker?
No.
TSA Officer?
No.
What about this one?
It looks exciting.
Wind in your hair, hot babe on your arm.
That's a car ad.
You should buy that car, then.
Ah! Señor.
How you doing, jefe?
Am I disturbing?
It's never been this quiet in here.
Yeah, it's so depressing.
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.
Like a man-cave!
It'll be fun.
I called his dreams ridiculous.
What kind of father does that?
No, no, señor.
I will not permit you to beat yourself up over this.
Anybody would be lucky to have a father such as you.
Thank you, Carlos.
I miss him.
Me, too, señor.
A son is very difficult to replace.
Difficult, but not impossible.
Carlos...
What the...
What's that on your head?
What? My new earmuffs?
It's a cold spring this year, you know? Brr!
Oh.
Anyway, what am I going to do?
I know, how can you deliver Easter with this tremendous burden on your old, frail shoulders?
Hey, hey, hey, easy with the "old."
No, I'm just saying, like, compared to me.
Surely you're not thinking of making the trip yourself?
What choice do we have?
We can improvise. I mean...
Does it even have to be a bunny?
What?
I suppose, given these troubled times, even a humble chick could do the job.
Really, Carlos.
Wow. I mean, that is funny.
Can you imagine that?
A chick delivering Easter?
That's ridiculous.
Oh, dear me.
But I appreciate you trying to cheer me up, though.
Please. It is my pleasure to amuse you, señor.
A chick delivering...
Fred, I was wondering if...
Are you doing anything tomorrow?
Tomorrow I get to start my new job at the video game company.
Wait a second.
No, that didn't work out.
I know. I know.
I'm sorry about that.
But do you know what?
Every cloud has a silver lining.
And behold this silver lining, Fred!
The Hoff?
Yes, please.
I just need a ride.
Mmm.
No.
Come on, Fred.
This is my one big chance.
I'll do anything.
Even get out of your life.
I take you to Hoff Knows Talent, and that's it, we're done.
Bunny's honor.
Right here, mate.
It's okay.
A verbal agreement is fine.
Now, you realize, you can't talk.
No. I can.
No, what I mean is, you shouldn't talk.
What? Like, ever?
Yeah,
"ever" would be wonderful.
But from now on, especially not in front of other people.
They might freak out and want to dissect your brain.
Dissect? That's a bit extreme.
There's an easy explanation as to why I can talk.
It's a simple combination of cuteness and magic.
Okay. Here we go. One BLT.
And one order of carrot cake a la mode, topped with, quote,
Whatever candy you have laying around back there. Unquote.
Uh, excuse me.
Is that a cough drop?
Yeah. It's cherry.
It counts.
It's a peculiar garnish.
Can I get some chocolate syrup?
Sure, doll.
Thanks, love.
It seems my brain is still intact, Fred.
Fred,
I've just had an idea.
When I'm a famous rock star, I'm going to buy a mansion just like this and make you sleep in the garage in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.
What do you think?
Oh, man. My sister is here.
You never told me you had a sister.
There's still so much we don't
Know about each other, Fred.
If she goes upstairs,
I'm dead.
Why?
Why?
Let me take you back to this morning when you flooded the bathroom and you trashed the bedroom.
You remember that?
Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth it out with her. Ow!
Hey!
Look at me.
One word out of you, and it's rabbit season. You got it?
Okay, I'm going to run interference.
I need you to sneak upstairs and clean up, quietly!
Sam!
Hi!
Hey, it's not a good time for me right now.
I was just leaving.
But you just got here.
I know, right?
Hey, what are these?
Oh!
There you are.
Mmm!
I'm on this North Beach diet.
It's carrots only.
That is why they're all over the house.
I was going to clean them up, though.
Okay, Fred, how did the interview go? Yes?
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.
Really?
Yeah.
No way!
Why are you so surprised?
Fred, that's awesome!
Place could use me, too.
Don't get me wrong, it was great.
It was good.
It was all right.
I just... I don't know if it was for me, really.
It just didn't gel.
Something felt a little off about the whole thing.
I didn't get it.
Oh! What? What happened?
It's kind of hard to pinpoint any one specific thing.
Oh, Fred.
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
What is that?
I wouldn't know because I'm not allowed to go up there.
And I haven't been up there once.
Hmm. Okay.
Sam, no, you're not allowed up there, either.
Don't go up there!
Sam, I'm begging you!
I can explain.
Oh, my God!
Look at this.
Look how cute this stuffed bunny is!
Wow! Yeah. Oh.
So cute!
Isn't he?
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't be playing with him because we're not really supposed to be up here in the first place. So...
He's just so lifelike.
You think?
It's a little freaky-looking to me.
Oh! Oh, he's so soft!
And cute, and cuddly, and warm.
Okay!
Why don't we put him back before things get uncomfortable?
No, I'm not uncomfortable.
Well, I'm uncomfortable because
I'm looking after the house and it's my responsibility.
There we are.
All right.
Oh, my God!
Wow! Look at that.
He's a wind-up toy.
That is so adorable!
Yeah, I think he might be broken.
Yeah, you're a broken little guy, aren't you?
Hey... Ow!
Fred, I am really worried about you.
Hmm!
Don't eat that.
You might not like the flavor.
Fred, relax.
Watermelon.
Can we go?
Look, Sam, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'll get something.
Look, Fred, I just thought it would make tomorrow night a lot easier if you could tell Mom and Dad that you had a job.
Whoa! What's tomorrow night?
Alex's play! The one she's been talking about for weeks.
Oh, that is easy.
I'm not going.
Oh, yeah, you are.
Fred, come on, she's your sister.
All right.
Wear something nice.
I'll wear something nice.
Don't forget, I love you.
I love you.
Put gas in your car. 7:00.
Bye.
Nice. Is she seeing anyone?
No, she's single, and she's looking for a rabbit.
Wow! There's a lot of people here, Fred.
Way more than I imagined.
You nervous?
Well, a little.
It's just...
I'm starting to feel a bit sick, Fred.
I've never actually played in front of anybody.
Come on. This could be your big opportunity.
I know it's my big chance, but what if I blow it?
Relax. I'll give you a good intro.
I'll set you up, you knock them down.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you, Fred.
No problem.
Now, if you could please remove your claws from my shoulder.
Sorry about that.
That's my nerves.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Mr. Hasselhoff.
Yes.
May I call you The Hoff?
Yes.
Fantastic.
Sir, I realize that you have seen it all.
But this...
This will stretch the limits of even your vast experience.
What you're about to see will mystify you.
It will challenge the very scope...
Cut to the chase, my friend.
Okay. Uh...
I give you E.B.
Come on, let's drum.
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Come on! Mr. Hoff, we've been waiting all day.
Give the guy a chance.
I gave him a chance.
I didn't like it.
I loved it!
Woohoo!
Yes!
Hoff knows talent, and that rabbit's got talent!
Thank you, David Hasselhoff!
I will not let you down.
This is a golden opportunity and one I intend to realize fully!
Hey, wait.
You're not surprised that I'm a talking rabbit.
Little man, my best friend's a talking car.
Can you make it to a live taping of the show Saturday night?
I'll send a limo.
Did you hear him?
Did you hear The Hoff?
I'm on my way, Fred!
It sounds like
The Hoff really dug you.
I mean, he is a good actor, but I think he was sincere.
Thanks, mate. And don't think
I've forgotten our deal.
You've done your part.
And now I'm ready to get out of your life.
Good. Yeah, good.
We've had some good times, eh?
Haven't we, Fred?
Yeah, there were a few.
You validated my whole childhood dream.
And then, what else?
Let me think.
Good times.
Well, maybe just one good time.
But the main thing is
I got to meet the guy on my second grade lunchbox.
Hasselhoff, wow!
E.B.?
E.B.?
E.B.?
Psst! Fred!
What are you doing?
Pink Berets.
Pink what?
Pink Berets.
There is nobody here.
Oh yes, there is.
If they see me, they'll take me back to Easter Island and I'll never get my chance to drum!
Pink Berets? Huh?
Sounds super fierce.
Don't be fooled by their adorable name.
They're the Easter
Bunny's Royal Guard!
But you're the Easter Bunny!
Aren't you?
Of course I am, technically.
What do you mean,
"technically"?
I'll explain later.
Just get in the car.
Look, I was supposed to take over this year, but I ran away.
What are you, crazy?
Who wouldn't want to be the Easter Bunny?
That's, like, the greatest job ever!
Yeah, you'd think so.
But it's what my dad wants, not me.
He expects so much.
What's left for me to do but let him down?
Sounds familiar.
Sometimes fathers just don't get it.
He told me I only ever think of myself.
Other times, they hit the nail right on the head.
Come on, Fred.
I know we said we'd go our own separate ways, but please, you've got to protect me.
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't really leave you places,
I can't really take you places.
And I've got to go to my sister's play tonight.
Oh, I like plays.
We should go see a play that my sister's not in and that my family will not be attending.
I understand.
Just drop me off at the bus station.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
I could be one of those street drummers, with a bucket!
Hi. How you doing?
Good.
Who's your kid playing?
An egg.
An egg?
Yeah.
Wow, that's something.
My kid is the Easter Bunny.
The one that makes it all happen.
All right, Dad, all the roles are equally important.
Sure, sure.
Fred!
Please get to your seats.
The play is about to begin.
Hey, guys. Mom, Dad.
Here comes Peter Cottontail
Hopping down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppity,
Easter's on its way
Bringing every girl and boy
Baskets full of Easter joy
Ugh! What is that dreadful sound?
Oh, no! They found me!
Run for it!
It's the Pink Berets!
Oh! Never mind, everyone.
False alarm.
Please continue with your awful singing.
How did that rabbit just talk?
Um...
Fred has been studying ventriloquism.
Yeah! I might do it professionally.
Woohoo!
You're being ridiculous.
Stop it! Sit down!
You should be nicer to your son.
It's just a thought.
Who wants to hear a song?
We'd love to sing a song for you.
No, we wouldn't.
Stop making a fool of yourself! Sit down!
Absolutely.
I want candy
I want candy
Take it, kids.
I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine she can't be beat
She's got everything I desire
He's really good!
I can see his lips move.
Sets the summer sun on fire
I want candy
I want candy!
Just the proud moms now.
I want candy
Now the grumpy dads.
I want candy
All I want is your candy
All I want is your...
Chewy
Fun to eat
So darn sweet
Candy
We're a hit!
They love us!
Here.
Are those for me?
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you. So sweet.
Alex. Good job tonight!
Wasn't she a good Easter Bunny?
Jerk!
Oh! Hey, Dad.
I was just leaving.
Fred, seems like we made quite an impression on you the other night.
Is this your new career?
Upstaging grade-schoolers with your ventriloquist puppet?
No, no, I got lots of other stuff going on.
Yeah.
There it is.
What?
That look. The complete and utterly disappointed look.
Well, I'm sorry, Fred, but can you give me just,
I don't know, one reason not to be disappointed?
Well...
Just one.
Yeah.
Fred?
Fred, where'd you go?
Yeah, I'm right here.
I just remembered I have a really great solid lead, actually.
You do?
Yeah, a great job.
Tell me about it.
I can't really tell you about it.
But it's big.
You're going to love it.
It's really big!
Hey, what's with the "Mr.
Serious" all of a sudden?
Wait, is this where you tell me you want to see other rabbits?
Because I'm open-minded, Fred.
E.B., I have the most amazing idea.
When I was a kid,
I told everyone that I saw the Easter Bunny, right?
No one believed me, even though he left me this.
This chocolate bunny, which I kept.
Oh, dear.
And tonight, it just hit me.
I realized that it was my destiny to see him.
Just like it was my destiny to meet you.
It's all been leading up to this.
Up to what?
You don't want to be the Easter Bunny, right?
I know who can take your place.
Who?
Me!
I'm sorry, Fred. Would you mind repeating that in my good ear?
I want to be the Easter Bunny.
What was that for?
That is for people who have gone loony!
A human Easter Bunny?
Come on, Fred!
It doesn't make sense.
A bunny makes no sense.
You deliver eggs.
If you wanna get all logical, bring logic into this, you should be an Easter Chicken.
What? Come on.
People might resist it at first.
But, hey, change can be a good thing.
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!
It did a number on me.
Do you know there was a period of roughly nine months where the sight of a colored egg made me want to vomit?
And rabbits are physically unable to vomit.
So it was just hours of...
Nothing coming out.
I don't care.
Imagine that, Fred.
Don't care.
If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.
Fred, you can't just be the Easter Bunny.
My dad has to give you special powers. Eh.
Besides, the Easter Bunny has got to be fit. Ow!
And you're a little scrawny.
Finally, the Easter Bunny has got to have lightning-fast reflexes.
Hi-ya!
Knock it off. I'm serious.
I can do this.
I will be the Bunny.
The stubborn old bunny refuses to crown anyone else.
This can only mean one thing, my friends.
We are going to have to take matters into our own hands.
Um, um, um.
Carlos? Carlos?
Yes, Phil?
We don't have hands, per se-.
No, it's a figure of speech, Phil.
Right. Got it.
Too long have we labored under the yoke of the bunnies' tyranny.
Well, no more!
It's time for the Easter Chick to rise!
Um, um...
Yes, Phil?
Just thinking out loud.
But wouldn't it be easier just to wait for E.
B? I mean, he can fix this.
Phil, if you love E.B. so much, why don't you marry him?
E.B. is gone, okay?
Oh.
There is a new boss.
Really? Who is it?
Is it me?
Are you being serious?
Yes. Hi.
Just rehearsing for the big Easter sing-a-long.
Okay, everybody, this time sing a lot more better.
And one, and two.
And three and four.
It's me. Me, you idiot.
I'm taking over.
Oh. I see.
But first,
I must get in shape.
I will be the Bunny.
You know,
I've been thinking, Fred.
Oh!
Hey, E.B., what's up?
Fred, listen.
You helped me become a drummer.
And how do I repay you?
I jellybean all over your dream. Well, no. No.
I've changed me mind.
I've seen the light.
We're going to do this.
And nice job on the eggs.
I told you I was serious.
Seventy-two.
Conditioning is a must, Fred.
Seventy-three.
This is fun. Just a couple of dudes hanging out, getting buff.
I could do this all day!
Me, too, Fred.
I feel great.
Phil, how am I doing?
Be honest.
Next up, speed and agility, Fred.
I want you to run so fast that you're just a handsome blur with great hair.
Ready? Go!
Fred, that was awesome!
For a couple of seconds, you touched greatness.
I can feel the burn!
But it's good.
It's a good burn.
Phil, too fast!
Too fast, Phil!
Sorry, sir.
Come on, Fred!
Keep hopping!
Woohoo!
That's the spirit!
The student is becoming the master.
The Padawan is becoming the Jedi!
The human being is becoming the Easter Bunny.
I can feel myself getting stronger.
Phil? How do I look from back there?
My buttocks, they are pretty firm, yeah?
It's a wonderful butt, Carlos.
Si, si, I know.
That's very good, in a crude, primitive, offensive-to-me-personally kind of way.
What do you think?
Uh...
It's a little too hot for the kids, no?
Very impressive!
But I can bet you can go even faster.
Way to go! Stay calm, Fred.
Dogs can smell fear.
And you have nothing to fear but fear itself, and this dog I'm riding on.
Wow!
Nice work, Fred.
Oh, no. Not today.
Ah!
What about Fred?
He'll be all right.
Whoa.
Hey, I know you guys.
You're the Pink Berets, right? Ha!
E.B. said you guys were so scary, but you're really...
You're really adorable.
Oh.
Easter Island.
Oh.
They brought me here to lead them in all things Easter, of course!
Hello, my fellow Easter-teers.
I am truly, truly humbled by your choice in me.
And as I stand before you, I...
Oh.
Is this part of the Coronation ritual?
Phuh!
Murderer!
Picking up a little tension in the room.
Carlos!
What's going on?
Who is this person and what's he doing here?
Wow, you're him.
The big guy. I'm Fred O'Hare.
I met you...
Well, I didn't meet you.
I saw you when I was a kid.
You look great.
Señor Bunny, brace yourself.
This heartless human, he has killed your son!
What? E.B.?
Did you Say "kill"?
NO, I didn't kill E.B.
Oh! Liar!
This can't be so.
Where are the Pink Berets?
Non
Wait a minute.
That's not...
Silence, human!
Can't you see you have broken his poor old heart?
Are you kidding me?
Old friend,
I share your sorrow.
E.B. was like your son to me.
I'm trying to keep it together.
But don't you worry,
I will take care of Easter.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Does anyone care that that's a Butterball turkey?
No, no, that is E.B.
He has the same shirt and everything.
My deepest condolences.
Attention, all bunnies.
There will be a service for E-B.
In the egg painting room.
Carrots and coffee to follow.
Carlos. What are you up to?
It's called a coup d'état.
Which is French for coup d'état!
But, Carlos.
You've been my most trusted number two for years.
Guess what? I am sick of doing number two.
It is our time for number one!
Yeah? We the bosses now.
All hail Carlos!
We the bosses!
We the bosses! Woohoo!
Pink Berets!
Seize him!
Woohoo!
Hey! Don't do that.
He's a beloved holiday icon!
No!
You can do this.
You are the world's best rabbit drummer.
You are a superstar.
You are a jerk for abandoning Fred.
Hey, I don't need that kind of voice in my head!
Yeah, well, you should have thought of that before you abandoned Fred.
Look, you better tell me something positive about me.
I can't. You abandoned Fred.
Oh! Hello, who is this gorgeous devil?
Is Eb in here, please?
Eb?
It's "E.B." That's me.
Oh, all right, well, E.B. , you're wanted on stage in two minutes.
Welcome to Hoff Knows Talent.
You guys look great- There are all kinds of exciting acts tonight-
There he is.
How's my little guy?
Actually, David Hasselhoff,
I've got a problem.
Hmm.
Is it the jitters?
Believe me, even I used to get them.
Now, I find a good way...
No, it's not the jitters, David.
I'm starting to realize I might be a really selfish rabbit.
Look, I love drumming.
But when my friend needed me most,
I left him in a house full of highly trained ninja bunnies.
What am I going to do?
Hmm.
A dilemma as old as time itself.
I know that if I left right now, I'd be giving up fame.
And untold riches.
And untold riches.
And all the bunnies you could ever want.
Yes, and all the...
You're not really helping much, David.
Like, at all!
And Fred could be in real trouble.
Go to him.
Go to him.
Give it up for Mr.
David Hasselhoff!
It's The Hoff#
Fred?
Anybody home?
Fred?
Uh-Oh.
The Easter moon is on the rise.
At midnight, her radiant beams will fill up the Egg of Destiny with magic.
Then, at last, Senor Bunny,
I will be Easter's new king!
Carlos, I'm warning you!
The Egg of Destiny is too dangerous in the hands of a chick.
Its power can only be wielded by a bunny.
Oh, yes? Well, look at me wielding.
I'm wielding!
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding it again. Okay?
Oh, Carlos, can I wield the Egg of Destiny? Please?
No.
Can I at least touch it?
OW!
There, you touched it.
That was harsh.
But, Carlos, think of the children.
Yes, but I am! The childrens.
They don't want candy and chocolate.
From now on, their baskets will be filled with clumps of bird seed, dried crickets, and the world's finest worms!
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Mmm!
Have you completely lost your mind?
Silence! You see, this is why he must go.
It's this lousy attitude of his. Well, no more!
The more sensitive chicks in the room may want to avert their eyes.
What about a compromise, okay?
The bunny gets Easter one year and the chick gets it the next.
Enough of the chitty-chatty.
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.
Hello! Hey, everyone.
I'm back. Yep, it was all a big mistake, but I'm alive.
Hey, Larry, Kyle, what are you doing in there?
E.B.! You're alive!
E.B.!
Dad? Fred? What's going on?
Gummy cannons! In position.
Fire at will!
That hurt!
Put him on the belt, boys.
Dice him, slice him, and pulverize him!
That is a bit excessive.
Oh, no! E.B.!
Son!
The reign of the bunny is over!
Oh!
Somebody help!
Help us!
What are you doing? Don't worry, Dad, Fred.
I'll be right there.
To the Egg Sleigh!
And step on it!
Are these ropes made of black licorice?
Yes, yes, they are.
Horrible stuff!
We can eat through them.
I suppose you can.
You see, my friends?
It is just like I told you, no?
Oh, tonight is going to be a very big night!
I'm flying!
Without even flapping my tiny wings.
Everything is coming up Carlos!
Got it!
Good man, Fred.
Hop on.
All right. Let's go!
I'm starting to get a sense of impending doom now.
Ow!
No!
I made it!
All right. Here we go!
Come on, Fred!
Whoa!
Look, Fred! There he is.
It's E.B.! E.B.!
The Egg Sleigh!
You've got to stop Carlos!
Don't worry, Dad!
I'm on it!
The power is surging through my veins!
It's good to be the king.
En?
What is happening to me?
Uh-Oh.
Whoa!
Come on out, Carlos.
It ends here!
You think you can just take over Easter?
Well, guess what?
I actually think you're on to something.
You're a bright man, you're an innovator.
I like it.
Give it a whirl.
One second. Hey!
You finish?
Um... Not quite.
Take that!
Get off!
Whoa!
Incoming!
Why?
Bunny slam!
OW!
You father was a fool to think you would ever amount to anything.
Here comes
Carlos Yellowtail
Hopping down the chicky trail
Easter is coming your way
Okay, Phil, initiate take-off procedures.
Aye-aye, Captain!
Chicks, fall in!
Attention!
Here we go.
Right naps!
Left flaps!
Okay, we're good to go!
Let's go, Phil.
Easter is waiting.
Righty-o.
Uh-Oh.
Oh, boy.
Phil, let's get this bird in the air!
Yeah!
Phil!
Knock off the dancing!
Yes, sir. Sorry.
Lifting off!
No way! The show is not over.
Phil!
What are you doing?
Fly us straight!
No, no, Phil!
Knock it off!
Keep her level!
NO, Phil.
Phil! Phil!
Phil! Please, Phil!
Phil!
Phil, I'm feeling a little...
Will you please stop dancing?
Phil!
Woohoo!
Yeah, that's right!
This is not over!
Ah-ha!
Thank you very much.
Dad!
E.B.!
I was so worried, Son.
I'm so sorry for all the things I said.
Me, too, Dad.
And your friend, here.
He saved my life.
He was magnificent!
Well, I...
I kind of was.
Hey, thanks, Fred.
Well, Easter's in a few hours.
I have to get going.
What?
Dad, I'm ready.
But, E.B., what about your dream?
I'm still going to be a drummer, Dad.
But I can be the Easter Bunny, too.
There's just one thing.
All right, then.
Fredrick O'Hare.
Yes, Sir.
Please step forward.
Down on one knee.
Left or right, doesn't matter.
And now, place your forefinger on the Egg of Destiny.
Oh...
EB., you as well.
By the power vested in me,
I pronounce E.B. and Fred O'Hare co-Easter Bunnies.
Hear, hear!
Wow!
Now go forth and deliver!
Woohoo!
Wonderful brunch, Bonnie.
Thank you, dear.
It is delicious.
Totally agree.
This is amazing, Mom.
You should open a restaurant.
I'm serious.
That is a very nice thing to say, Fred.
And can I say that
I love your costume?
I think it is so cheerful.
Thanks, Mom.
But it's a uniform.
I'm so tired.
Yeah, you were up very late delivering pizzas.
Easter baskets.
Every time you say "Easter baskets," I hear "pizza."
It just helps me cope.
Guys, can we not do this today?
Oh, they're here.
This is exciting.
That is my co-Easter Bunny.
Hey, why don't you guys come see me off?
It'll be fun.
Well, that's weird.
Who do you think it is?
I don't know.
Wow.
Fred.
Fred, wait.
This is amazing!
I know, right?
It's pretty cool, huh?
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time.
Aw, Dad, come on.
You don't have to...
I'm proud of you.
Thanks, Dad.
Easter Bunny.
Wow!
The one who makes it all happen.
Say the words, Fred.
Bring it home.
Happy Easter to all!
And to all, a good mid-to-late morning.
On Cheepers! On Peepers!
On Biscuit and Buzzy!
On Chucky! On Clucky!
On Feathers and Carlos.
Yeah, come on, Carlos.
Put your back into it.
I've been flapping all night, so just cut me some slacks, okay?
One little coup and suddenly
I'm everybody's chump.
Fred, what did she say?
Was that about me?
You speak Chinese? Just when I think I can't love you any more...
I was born in Hawaii to two die-hard surfers.
How could I not have salt water in my veins?
They say home is where the heart is.
And for most people, that consists of four walls and a welcome mat.
But for me, it's the ocean.
With the warmth of the sun on my skin.
"Two brothers."
That's my answer when anyone asks me why I'm so competitive.
And, of course, there's my best friend Alana.
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
We spent more time wet than we did dry.
My mom was convinced that we were mermaids.
From the moment I caught my first wave,
I knew that I wanted to be a pro surfer.
Nothing else seemed to matter.
Surfing is my passion, my way of life.
The stoke I get from riding a perfect wave is pure joy.
But like my dad always says,
"Life is an adventure.
"And sometimes, you wipe out and end up in the impact zone."
Bethany!
Bethany!
Let's go, you're lagging!
I'm coming!
Hey, sorry, Noah, I lost track of time!
Glad you could join us.
Move over, Timmy.
Sorry, this seat's saved.
Come on.
Ow!
How were the waves?
Really fun.
Ready for the contest?
Yeah.
Practice your snap off the lip?
Shh.
No, but she's perfect on the wipeouts.
Shh, guys, we're in church.
She's going to do her mermaid thing and crush it like she always does.
Almost got it.
Darn it.
Come on.
Interesting technique, Noah.
Is that how the professionals do it?
Hey, I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
Where you going?
To watch the competition.
Whoa!
They gave me a five!
Not so bad for a girl.
Oh!
What!
Read it and weep, honey.
I'm not the one who's going to be weeping.
Five!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Don't harass the judges!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
We're coming to get you!
Babe, is it your knee again?
Got you!
Noah, put me down!
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the junior portion of the Maui Jim Turtle Bay
Resort Invitational.
We're expecting a great competition today.
We've got skateboarding on the half-pipe.
We've got all the action in the water.
Watch top amateur surf...
Hey, howzit?
Hey.
Hey, Keoki.
If you get tired waiting for the waves out there, you can always come and kick it with us.
We don't have to wait for the action.
Well, when you get tired of the pipe, come surf some real waves.
Ooh!
Hey, Thursday night is a full moon.
If you guys aren't doing anything, we're all gonna go surfing.
Yeah, if we don't have anything better to do.
Okay.
See you guys later.
All right. Bye.
Bye.
In semi-final heat number one, we've got six competitors.
In orange is Olivia Jenner.
In black, Malina Birch.
In blue, Bethany Hamilton.
In yellow, Kaila Kahani.
In white, Lalani Bri.
And in pink, Alana Blanchard.
And it looks like the local groms have tracked down Hawaiian surfing legend,
Ben Aipa.
Yeah, Ben!
Hey, you see that sick air Keoki just got?
I don't think so.
What?
You're not going to distract me.
I'm catching that next wave.
I don't think they know how not to compete.
Holt, you didn't tell them, did you?
No, no. I didn't want to make them nervous.
I'm nervous enough for the both of them, as it is.
You know, they both have to place.
Black, Malina
Birch, you're in first.
Blue, Bethany Hamilton, you're in second looking for a 4.2 to overtake that top spot.
Pink, Alana Blanchard, you're in third, requiring a 5.4 to overtake first place.
Just a reminder, ladies and gentlemen.
The winners of today's contest will qualify for the Hawaiian
Island Regionals.
Alana Blanchard finds the cover to finish things off.
Solid wave for pink.
Yes!
Looks like we have a paddle-battle here.
Go, Bethany! Go!
It's blue and black scratching for a solid set wave.
Malina Birch taking the inside off of Bethany Hamilton.
Here she is, up and riding.
Malina Birch kicks things off with a very nice ride.
And a strong carve off the top.
She definitely knows what the judges are looking for.
That will be a solid wave for black.
Malina full on stole my wave, I had position.
It's okay, it's all right.
Look, next time, I want you to really focus on just diving into the water as far as you can.
Rip that paddle back. Okay?
Okay.
All right, take a rest.
You thirsty?
Yeah.
With five minutes remaining in this final, pink, Alana Blanchard, you are in first.
Black, Malina Birch, you are in second.
And blue, Bethany Hamilton, you are currently in third.
You're not breathing, you know that, right?
Go! Go!
Yeah!
Big snap off the top.
She draws out her second bottom turn, and hooks it one more time.
Bethany Hamilton is holding nothing back.
Potentially one of the highest scoring rides of the day.
As this final comes to a close here at Turtle Bay.
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
You're doing a great job training her, Brother Tom.
Thanks, Ben.
You got it, bro.
Looks like she has a real future.
As a pro.
She's been working so hard.
Well, with her heart, her will, she'll go far.
Third place of the Turtle Bay
Juniors final goes to Alana Blanchard.
In second place, Malina Birch.
Good job, Malina.
Meaning, taking first place is Kauai's Bethany Hamilton.
Bethany!
With today's big victory,
Bethany Hamilton has to be considered the favorite as we head to the
Hawaiian Island Regionals.
Way to go, Bethany.
Girls, there's some people down there you might want to meet.
Who?
It's the guys from Rip
Curl, it's no big deal.
They want to sponsor both of you.
No way!
What!
Oh, my gosh!
I got it, how about this one?
Nice, if you're 100.
Okay.
What about this?
Are you kidding?
Thing looks like a eye patch.
I think it's hot.
One wipeout in that tiny thing, and you're going to be showing a lot more than your sick rides.
Ooh, so much for so little.
Well, good thing it's on Rip Curl.
Yes!
But make sure to keep your eye on it, if you don't want it snaked out from underneath you.
Hey, girls.
You realize I'm gonna take you next time, right?
Let's just let the surfing do the talking.
Every day between now and regionals, when I'm in the water training,
I'll be thinking of you, Hamilton.
Creepy.
Thanks, but I think you should stick to your training.
Seems like you could use a little focus.
I guess we'll find out.
Good seeing you again.
You guys are usually the first ones in here, let's go.
Let's finish up
Rad Night with a game.
Can anyone tell me what he or she thinks this is?
Easy, it's a dodge ball.
No.
Or Mars?
Mmm-mmm.
A blob in a lava lamp?
Very creative, but no.
It's a fly's eye.
- Weird.
- Ew!
How about this one?
- A brain.
Aren't brains supposed to be pink?
A dead, rotting brain?
That is gross, and that is a walnut.
So, you see how hard it can be to make sense of things when you're looking at them really close?
The same thing's true in life.
So, if you guys are dealing with anything, that's just too hard to handle or doesn't seem to make much sense, get a new perspective.
I want to share with you guys something that has really made an impact on my life.
That's Jeremiah 29:11.
"For I know the plans that I have for you," says the Lord.
"Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.
"Plans to give you hope and a future."
That's all the time we have tonight, guys.
If you are going on the mission trip, please don't forget to give me your permission slips.
Hey, what's up?
What's this?
Well, it looks like I'm not going to be able to go to Mexico, so I brought some things for the orphanage.
I made the bracelets.
Noah donated the shoes and the Spam's from Timmy.
Are you sure you can't come?
Yeah, I've got to stay and train now that I'm sponsored.
I was really looking forward to it.
You're going to miss out.
Well, have a good trip.
Sarah's really bumming me out.
Any particular reason?
Yeah.
So, I told her I'm not coming to Mexico.
I mean, she knows that I have two important competitions coming up, right?
I mean, she knows how much
I've put into this, you know?
How much you and the whole family has put into this.
So what's her angle?
That going to
Mexico to help kids is really important.
And I know it is.
I mean, I really, really wish I could go.
It's just,
I've got to stay and train for regionals.
Did you say you'd go?
Well, yeah, but that was before I got sponsored.
I mean, it's like she's counting on me now, like I'm the only person in the entire world who can do this.
I mean, I'm not going.
I mean, I can't, right?
It's your call.
Great.
Now I feel even worse.
That's good.
A small step in a good direction.
The girls are all tucked in.
How's it look tomorrow?
Pretty decent, actually.
Well.
No, no, no, you can't.
What?
You have your surgery tomorrow.
The doctor said no food after 10:00.
This is like juice.
Give it to me.
No. No, no.
Give it.
No.
Give it. Give it.
No.
You need to relax, they'll never know the difference.
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, we have to get up super early for dawn patrol.
I mean, what happens if my mom comes in?
Bethany, it'll be worth it.
The moon's full.
The waves are perfect.
I mean, come on, it's almost Halloween.
Even Noah's done it.
He has?
Yeah.
I really wanted to go.
Shh! Okay, come on, let's go.
Keoki.
I knew it was you!
No way!
Yeah, you surf like a skater.
Hey!
You're toast, Keoki.
Whoa!
Okay, truce. Truce.
Okay, deal.
Bethy, it's almost midnight.
What happens at midnight?
You'll see.
What?
Later skater.
How lucky are we?
Awesome!
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
So, as soon as you girls get back from the water,
I've got an English assignment all ready for you.
But it's a holiday.
It's Halloween.
We were thinking that we could have a couple extra hours on the waves today?
'Cause you didn't get enough last night?
Just say the word and we can enroll you girls in Kapa'a, where you can ride the bus for 45 minutes each way and do eight hours of straight work during prime surf hours.
'Cause I'm all right with that.
Actually, I love home school.
Me, too.
Adore, totally.
I'm really sorry, Mom.
It's just...
I really, really wanted to go night surfing.
I mean, everyone talks about how awesome it is.
I mean, even Noah's done it.
He has?
Good job.
Why didn't you just ask?
Because she knew you'd say no.
How do you know I'd say no?
Would you have let me go?
No. I don't know.
Hey, no, no, no, no.
I promise I'll ask next time, okay?
I'm going to hold you to that.
Dad, you should have them upgrade you to a bionic knee so you can actually beat Mom in surfing.
It's going to take a lot more than a bionic knee.
You just wait.
You sure you don't want me to drive you?
Mom, I got it.
When you come through it,
I will be waiting.
That's your dad, Alana.
Have fun girls.
Bye.
Bye, Dad. Say hi to
Dr. Rovinsky for me.
Have a good surgery,
I'll be praying.
Rip it up. See you on the flip side.
This is a good one.
This is a good song.
Oh, that looks good, doesn't it?
All right, we're here.
Let's hit it.
Let's get out.
Let's do it.
Sweet. I've got a meeting at 10:00, so we don't have a lot of time today.
No problem.
Just pick us up after your meeting.
Yeah. Like that's going to happen.
Let's just get in the water already.
Come on, it's a long paddle around the reef.
Try and keep up with us.
Well, the anesthetic should have started working by now.
You feel anything?
A little bit.
All right, it will kick in shortly.
We'll have you back out there shredding waves with Bethany in no time.
Thanks, David.
Yeah!
Whoa! Whoo!
Did you see that one?
That was nice off the lip, buddy.
Thanks.
I wonder what bathing suit
I should wear to the shoot.
The pink's cute, but the black really works with my tan.
I don't think you get to decide.
They'll probably just tell us what to wear.
I guess, but it's fun to think about.
Can you believe we get to come out here every day?
Yeah.
Dad!
Alana!
Shark!
I need to get to the beach.
Oh, God!
Dad, where's the shark at?
We need to get to the reef!
Just get to the reef.
Keep on the board, keep on the board.
Byron, you get to shore!
Go! Go! Call 911!
It's going to be okay, Beth.
I'll start it for you!
Come on. Ready, pal? Let's go.
Push, push, push.
Stay with us, sweetie, okay?
Stay with us.
Please, Jesus. Please...
Alana, you keep her on the board.
Okay.
On the board.
Please get me to the beach.
Please.
You're going to be okay!
Come on!
All right, here we go.
Doctor Rovinsky, we need this room stat!
It's a teenage girl from the North Shore.
Shark attack.
Who? Who is it?
I'll check it out, Tom.
I'll check it out.
Stay with me,
Bethany!
Alana! Get over here!
I can't.
Morning, Mom.
When did you go night surfing?
Uh...
Night surfing...
All right.
All right, sweetheart.
Ambulance is coming, all right?
I want my mom.
I know. We're gonna get your mom.
We're gonna get your mom.
Wait, wait, wait. What?
Mom?
Dad! I called 911!
I called her mom.
Okay, okay, okay.
Grab the foot of the board. Okay?
Grab it, on the count of three.
Ready? One, two, three!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Take her up to the truck!
Let's get her up there right now!
Come on. Talk to me.
Watch your step right here!
What your step right there!
Where's the ambulance, Dad?
They're not here yet!
Don't worry about the ambulance!
We'll meet it on the way!
Alana, get the board!
Get her up! All right.
Get up, get up there!
Bethany, can you hear me?
Oh, my God.
She's losing a lot of blood, Dad!
All right, I see the ambulance.
Here it comes!
Who are you, sir?
Family friend.
Do you know if she hit her head or ever lost consciousness?
No, she never passed out, but she's lost a lot of blood.
Here we go!
Careful! Easy.
Okay, lock her in.
Please don't die.
Come on, come on, come on, sweetie.
Please don't take her!
Please don't take her.
Please don't take her.
Tom, it's Bethany.
No, no! No!
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here! No.
Come on. You can't move!
Just let me get out of here!
You can't walk!
Get me out of here!
No!
Talk to me. Gotta stay with me.
Keep looking at my eyes, okay?
Where's my family?
They're on their way.
They're gonna meet us at the hospital.
She's going into hypovolemic shock.
We're almost there.
Breathe deep.
Mom, the car!
Stay with me.
Cheri, it happened so fast...
Traumatic amputation.
Severe loss of blood.
I'm here, baby,
I'm right here.
Blood pressure 70 over 40 and dropping.
I'm right here.
Up, up!
Get her in here. Move!
Come on!
Follow it back.
Let's go!
Stay with us!
Hang in there.
Bethany, you'll be okay!
What's happening?
Get her in a bed.
Move her into bay three!
Come on, Bethany.
Stay with us, stay with us.
What's happening?
Bethany!
Mom?
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm right here.
Hey.
We're all here.
It hurts.
Okay.
Noah, get the doctor.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm a little thirsty.
Okay.
Got it.
Dad, please don't cry.
I'm not crying.
I'm going to be okay.
I know.
Hey there, kiddo.
How you holding up?
Pretty good, thanks to you.
I guess I ruined your surf shirt, huh?
Well, I never liked that one anyway.
Why don't you just concentrate on getting better, okay?
Thank you.
You were amazing out there.
You were the one who kept me calm.
You never...
You never let go.
You are incredibly brave, Bethany.
Where's Alana?
She's... She's at home.
With her mother.
She's...
She's still a little freaked out.
But, you know, she'll be better knowing that you're going to be okay.
So...
Hey.
How's my favorite patient?
You say that to everyone.
I mean it when I see you.
I'll wait outside.
I'll see you later.
So, I understand you're feeling some discomfort.
Yeah.
Well, that's normal.
There's going to be a lot of pain because of the trauma that you endured.
Not to mention the fact that you've lost over 60 % of your blood.
You're going to be feeling kind of lousy for the next few days, kid.
Now here's the thing, Bethany.
The things that you're going to have to learn to do differently is extensive.
But the good news.
Those things you're not gonna be able to do is small.
I'm so proud of you.
I'll tell you something.
She is a living miracle.
Thanks, David.
Hey, sleepy head.
Hi.
How you feeling?
I've been better.
When can I surf again?
Are you busy right now?
Kind of.
Soon.
How do you know?
Because you can do all things...
Through him who gives me strength.
...through him who gives me strength.
Noah, eat your food.
It's gross.
I'm not hungry.
Eat it. Mine's fine.
I said, I'm not hungry.
Well, if you didn't want it, why'd you let me pay for it then?
Fine.
I'll pay you back.
I think you two should calm down.
I am calm.
We're not doing this.
Doing what?
Life's got to go on the way it's always gone on.
What you talking about?
Life is not going to go on the way it has always gone on.
Will you stop arguing?
No, he's arguing with me.
Everyone's yelling at everyone.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Hey, sweetheart. It's a dream, okay?
Just a dream, that's all.
Just a dream.
It wasn't a dream!
It was real.
You should go see her.
You know that?
You need to go see her.
...was resting on her surfboard in the ocean off Hawaii, when, suddenly, a shark bites off her arm.
The girl doesn't even scream, and her composure may have saved her life.
You're pretty much on every channel.
Hey!
Where have you been?
You know, at home, living it up.
How have you been?
I thought you were going to die out there.
So, are you still going to do that Rip Curl photo shoot?
They wanted me to.
But I told them I couldn't do it without you.
But that's crazy.
You've been nuts for that shoot.
You have to do it.
Really?
Yeah. Of course.
Do it for both of us.
You're not going to believe how great the house smells.
Plants are everywhere.
More flowers have been delivered than there are growing on the entire island.
Dr. Rovinsky said that I can get back in the water as soon as my stitches come out.
Can we try a shower first?
That's so cool.
Who did that?
Everybody.
The bite on Bethany
Hamilton's surfboard was 16 inches long and 8 inches wide.
...currently searching for a shark believed to be responsible for the attack on
Bethany Hamilton.
It's okay.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Get out of here!
Where's Dad?
Bethany!
I said leave!
Noah! Noah!
Just get back in the house.
Dad...
Unlock the back door.
Bethany, is this...
Come on, get out of my way!
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Excuse me! Excuse me.
I've got it from here, honey. Scoot over.
What are you gonna do?
Nice driving, 007.
You know what?
I never liked those bushes anyway, Dad.
Come on, Bethany,
I got you.
Give me your bag.
I didn't know you could drive like that.
Neither did I.
So what do we do now?
Remember when we brought
Noah home from the hospital?
He was our first baby and we had no clue what to do.
It's the same thing.
We'll take it day by day.
That's so messed up.
I wish they would go away.
Ginger! Hi, girl!
Oh!
I know, I know, I know.
I know. It's still me.
Ginger!
Who's up for sandwiches?
Sounds so good, I'm starving.
Noah?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, where's my Spam?
Mexico.
All of it?
I got it.
I got it, sweetie.
Sorry, Mom.
It's okay.
Here, let me grab that.
You want to get some bread, love?
Yeah.
Um...
I need to go unpack.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh.
I have some good news to share.
What news?
Holt got a call from that show, Inside Edition, and they want to give
Bethany a prosthetic arm.
Wait, wait, wait.
She's been home for five minutes.
They're gonna pay for the entire thing.
When did you talk to a TV show?
And it's custom made.
Will it look normal?
I would think so.
Awesome.
Can they make one
I can surf with?
What does she have to do?
All she has to do is give a brief interview, wearing the arm.
Check out my sister the celebrity.
You don't have to do this.
No. I want to.
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
So, it's settled.
Hey, wait.
Let's give thanks.
That arm could not come soon enough.
Because trying to make do with only one, even harder than it sounds.
I mean, fixing your hair is not exactly rocket science.
Unless you've only got one arm.
Then it might as well be a mission to Mars.
Every day of my life, for as far back as I could remember,
I was in the water.
And now, I couldn't even put my bathing suit on.
Almost everything seemed to be a challenge.
But what scared me most, was that I might not be able to surf again.
It's so sad.
Mommy, what happened to that girl's arm?
I'm sorry.
Should I go?
Or do you want to do this together?
It's up to you.
Stay.
Okay.
Oh, it's looking great.
It's healing nicely.
You all right?
There you go.
It's going to look better once the stitches are out.
Is she okay?
You okay?
Hey! I just got back from Mexico.
I'm so glad you're okay.
I was just about to come see you.
I couldn't wait.
Come here.
I was thinking about you, and praying for you every minute.
How are you?
Oh...
I'm good. Yeah.
Everyone's been doing really good.
You don't have to do that, Bethany.
Not with me.
Um...
They're trying to help. I know.
I know.
But...
But what?
You know how you said it's hard to see things clearly sometimes when you're too close?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I've been trying to get some perspective.
I've been really trying.
Sarah, how can this be
God's plan for me?
I don't understand.
I don't know why terrible things happen to us sometimes.
But I have to believe that something good is going to come out of this.
Okay.
I don't know what that is.
I really wish I did.
Come here.
Hello?
Dad.
Excuse us.
That's a perfect fit, bro.
Come on, Dad.
Hey, Alana, can you take a little half step forward?
Put your hand a little higher on the board.
That is gorgeous.
Perfect.
Beautiful.
You're natural born for this. Gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.
Actually, Alana, go take a break, come back, grab a new bikini, that'd be perfect.
So? How did I look?
Great.
Not too cheesy, right?
Uh...
Somewhere between cheddar and jalapeno jack.
Thank you.
That guy's ripping it up out there, yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, Alana, we're ready for you over here!
You know, you should be doing this with me.
No.
You should.
Go on, they're waiting for you.
Don't worry about me.
She's right, you should listen to her.
Yeah, and you should stop listening to other people's conversations, you kook.
Just got your back.
Loser.
Poser.
You should be out there with her, though.
Yeah, I should be with her.
Just not there.
What's taking so long?
So what's for breakfast?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Yeah, we would.
We're hungry! Yes!
Mmm.
Okay.
What's the occasion?
Does there have to be an occasion for me to make my family fresh squeezed orange juice and homemade banana bread?
You do realize that tomorrow is
Thanksgiving, not today, right?
Yeah. That's why it's the perfect time.
Perfect time for what?
To get back in the water.
Aren't you afraid?
I'm more afraid of not surfing.
All right, get out there and have some fun!
Come on.
Come on, let's go already!
Are you ready?
If she is, I am.
Grab my ankle,
I'll tow you out.
No, I'm good.
There you go!
Just take it nice and easy, Bethany.
Hey, don't worry about it.
It was a junk wave anyway.
Yeah, I'll get the next one.
Ooh!
Why don't you just paddle today?
No.
We can come back tomorrow.
No, I'm good.
Try putting your hand in the center of the board, along the stringer so you don't tip over.
Be patient, honey.
Yes!
Look at that!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's the way to go, honey!
Got it all on camera.
Training starts tomorrow.
Training for what?
The Hawaiian Island Regionals.
Excuse me!
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Thanks so much for coming.
And if you don't mind, I'd like to offer up a little toast.
Sweetheart.
We are so blessed and thankful to God for all of you because of your love and your support over the past few weeks.
And we are especially thankful to be spending yet another Thanksgiving with our sweet, beloved daughter.
Here's to Bethany!
To Bethany!
That was embarrassing.
I thought it was wonderful.
Hey!
Hey!
I heard you're back in the water.
I know, and there's something else.
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.
I'm surfing the Hawaiian
Island Regionals.
Are you kidding me?
No!
Oh, my gosh, that's so amazing!
Bethany, I am so proud of you!
Thanks.
Well, you really outdid yourself again this year, Cheri.
I helped.
He tasted everything.
Yeah, one of my many talents.
Like clearing the table.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
I realize this would be a very different day without you.
You know, I just wish
I could have done more.
Our family is a family because of you.
We have made this to your exact specifications.
Doesn't it look real?
Yeah. That's kind of weird how real it looks.
And you can even paint the fingernails.
Shall we try it on?
Now, you just take that strap, and I'll take this one.
Hold tight.
There, how does that feel?
It's okay.
Let me just see how it works on my board.
Not weight bearing.
How am I supposed to use it to push up on my board?
I think you might have to do that with the other arm.
So, is there a way I can grab the rails to duck dive?
Honey, why don't you just give it a chance?
How am I supposed to paddle and surf in this thing?
I mean, look at it!
Yeah.
Because the remainder of your arm is so short, mobility will be limited.
But there's so much more you can do...
Can I take it off, please?
- Every single thing...
- Take it off.
She said she wants you to take it off.
You can turn that off.
Hey! No! Hey!
Don't! Hey! Drop it!
Ginger!
- Drop it! Ginger, stop!
Drop it!
- No. Release!
Honey, you can still surf without it.
- Let it go!
- Ginger!
Bad dog!
Ginger!
Bad dog!
I like her better that way.
Dad was right.
I don't need it to surf.
No, you don't.
Would it be better to just say it out loud?
I thought...
I thought at least with clothes on, I could have two arms.
Thought I could look normal.
Normal is so overrated.
But people like normal, Mom.
Who?
Guys do.
I mean, who will even like me with this?
The right guy will love you exactly the way you are.
Because you're beautiful.
How do you know?
Because I know.
What's that worth, right? Nothing.
What are you doing?
We had this statue in my house, when I was a little girl.
It was a replica from a museum my parents once went to.
I didn't even think about it until just now.
Venus de Milo.
For centuries, all around the world, she was considered the pinnacle of beauty.
And she has one less arm than you.
Yeah, but I can surf.
So, regionals.
What we have to do is to get you from here to here.
It's not going to be easy.
I don't need easy,
I just need possible.
With you, anything's possible.
Let's do it.
Right there.
On the take off.
Right there. Now, look.
A little back step.
Yeah.
That could be a sign...
'Cause that time I wiped out.
Just a hair late when you take off.
So, I'll just adjust my body so that my weight is even more...
Or bring your arm all the way around. Yes.
Look at her. That's it.
That's it, right there!
That is perfect.
Okay.
That's what you want to go for every time. Yup.
How'd you feel out there this morning?
Pretty good. I mean, I have a little trouble getting under the big waves, but once I'm up, I'm solid.
I'll come in if I can't handle it, okay?
Good morning.
I'm Piper Borraow.
And I'm Rob Bucannan.
And we'd like to welcome you to the Hawaiian Island Regionals.
How do you feel?
Like barfing.
Yeah, well, aim for Malina.
If you don't want to do this, you don't have to.
I'm not going to pull out now.
Besides everyone knows I've entered.
It's now or never.
Soledad O'Brian is in Phuket, Thailand.
She has been following efforts by some survivors to find their missing loved ones.
Hey, Bethany. Good luck out there today, yeah.
Thanks.
Man, that's really awful.
Clearly, wherever you look along the path of this tsunami there is just stories of loss, and thousands already...
I hope you guys get a lot of donations.
Yeah, Sarah's organizing a trip to help the kids in Thailand.
My heat's coming up,
I gotta go. Bye.
Great to have you back, Bethany.
Thanks, it's good to be back.
So you're actually going through with this?
Yeah.
- Hey, Bethany.
- Hey.
Judges have approved giving you a five minute head start.
I don't want it.
Bethany.
I don't need it.
Okay.
Come on, Bethany.
First heat has started and the girls are making their way out into the lineup.
All right, we've got Bethany
Hamilton in the blue jersey trying to catch her first wave.
See ya!
Bethany unable to get into that wave.
Meanwhile, Malina Birch scratches into one.
Looks like a good one.
All right,
Malina Birch dropped in on that inside roll, nice bottom turn.
Off the bottom, coming up.
Comes around the corner, gets a nice vertical off the top there
As she kicks out to the challengers.
Hamilton drops into a nice looking wave.
Ooh! A little loss of control there.
But nice recovery.
She cuts back into the white water.
Should be a decent scoring ride for the surfer in blue.
All right, Alana Blanchard, drops into a wave of her own, nice off the bottom, big snap off the top.
Sets up again for a nice cut back into the white water.
Speeding down the line looking for a little tube section, gets in there.
Threads that little barrel and exits.
Nice wave for Alana Blanchard.
All right, Rockwell, it looks like at the ten minute mark we have Malina Birch in first with a 7.3 on her first ride.
Alana Blanchard is second with a 6.2.
And in third place,
Leila Hurst with a 5.3.
The surf is picking up.
Whoa, look at that outside, a big set approaching.
It looks like Bethany Hamilton is going to get caught inside of the biggest wave of the day.
Come on, Bethany.
Come on!
Mountains of water rolling through here at Sunset Beach and it looks like our competitor in blue, Bethany Hamilton, just taking some donuts out there.
No! I'm fine!
I knew she wouldn't come in.
Bethany, grab my leash, I'll pull you the rest of the way out.
No, I'm fine.
I can do this!
Come on, Bethany!
All right, four minutes left, and Bethany Hamilton still stuck in the impact zone, Rob.
Bethany, in sixth place, right now.
She's still needing quite a score.
She's okay.
Malina, don't!
You have enough, let her have it!
Alana Blanchard just dropped in on Malina Birch.
That's definitely going to be an interference call on Blanchard.
Alana Blanchard will not make it on this heat, has been disqualified for the interference.
I can't take it anymore, I want you to get her out of there.
I want her out of there.
The lifeguards are on it.
Oh, man, it looks like she broke her board.
Well, unfortunately for Bethany Hamilton, a broken board right now, puts her in a bad position, with only 3 minutes remaining, there's no chance she's making it out of this first heat.
You shouldn't have dropped in on Malina like that.
She was trying...
She was just hassling me, like she always does.
She's a jerk!
At least she was treating me like I was real competition.
Bethany, what happened to you out there?
Bethany.
Can we please just get out of here?
Make a path!
Get out of the way!
Bethany, how are you feeling?
That's enough, come on.
Bethany, I know that you got beat up pretty bad out there today, sweetheart.
But you can't let it get you down.
Enough, Dad, okay?
I can't do this anymore!
Yes, you can, honey.
Listen to her.
Bethany!
Bethany! Bethany!
Hey, Bethany!
Can I get your autograph?
I have something even better actually.
Here.
Cool!
Bethany, what are you doing?
Oh, my God!
This is so cool!
Awesome, thanks!
Enjoy them.
Bethany.
Dad, just stop. Okay?
It's over.
That's not what I'm saying.
You can't give up on her.
And you can't keep pushing at her.
What are you supposed to do, just let her quit?
If she wants to, yes.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Then you're not hearing what I'm saying.
What? What is it that I'm not hearing?
You can't always fix everything by sheer will.
Sometimes there is no...
...Hamilton has to be considered the favorite as we head to the
Hawaiian Island Regionals.
She's a surfer.
She's a competitor.
She's more than that.
Cheri, if she walks away from this...
If she quits, she may never get back in the water again.
And she will never be the same.
She will never be the same.
And if she thinks the only life out there for her is surfing and she can't make that happen then she's going to be lost.
Really, really lost.
Go ahead, tell me how everything's going to be okay.
Yeah, that's me. Mister jump-right-in-and-fix-it.
If I could just keep my mouth shut for once.
I'm done, aren't I?
I can't even paddle out to the lineup past the big waves.
I don't understand.
What happened to
"I can do all things"?
Why?
Why did this happen?
Why did I have to lose everything?
You didn't lose everything, Bethany.
Not even close.
That shark didn't kill you.
You're still here.
You're still alive.
With a family that loves you.
What am I supposed to do now?
I don't know.
Then how am I supposed to know?
When the time is right, you'll know.
Until then, you pray and you listen.
Listen for what?
For what comes next.
Okay, Lymar,
I hope you remembered your toothbrush this time. Okay?
Did you remember your socks?
Because you are not borrowing mine again.
Could you pass these out?
Bethany?
Mind if I tag along?
I'm sure we can scrounge up something for you to do.
Hey.
All right, guys, let's go!
Rosemary!
Sarah!
Hey, thank you for coming.
This is Bethany.
Bethany, yeah, I've heard a lot about you.
I'm happy you're here.
Grab some bags and pass them out.
All right, everybody make a line.
Just grab it and pass it down.
Come on.
Keep it going!
Come on guys.
Keep going.
Make a line.
Got it?
Good job.
She wants to thank you all for what you've been doing.
They're very grateful.
We're so happy we can help, we know they've been through so much.
She says it was just a normal day like any other.
But that they saw the water roll back and they went to get the fish and the lobsters.
But then they saw the wave and it was too late.
And the water just kept coming, there weren't many survivors.
I lost my family.
Another family, they all died...
I'm so sad.
You okay?
Yeah.
It's all right, don't be sorry for compassion, Bethany.
It can move us to do amazing things.
And it can help you get a new perspective.
Why don't you take a minute, then when you're feeling better, come back and join us.
'Cause there's a lot to do. Okay?
Good.
Here you go.
Hello.
Here you go.
How come no one's in the water?
We brought all these boards.
Still petrified.
Is it safe?
Yeah.
Oh!
Something's missing, yeah?
They said he wandered up a few days after the tsunami.
What's his name?
They don't know.
He hasn't said a word, he won't even smile.
Hey, do you want to go in the water?
Do you want to go out to the ocean and go swimming?
No?
Hey, can I borrow your board?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thanks.
They say the Lord works in mysterious ways.
I say that's an understatement.
Who would have thought that teaching a kid to surf would teach me that surfing isn't the most important thing in the world?
And that something else is.
Love.
Bigger than any tidal wave.
More powerful than any fear.
Hey, I'm home!
Hey, there she is.
How was your trip?
Great.
What's all this stuff?
Oh, you know, just a little fan mail.
Went ahead and sorted it out by country.
Are you serious?
Yup.
And apparently, you are very popular in Madagascar.
No way.
"Dear Bethany.
My name is Stephanie Bolt,
"I'm 11 years old and I go to Northcross
"Intermediate School in New Zealand."
People are so amazing.
There's an eighth grader from
North Carolina, who lost his arm.
Logan, and he says he's gonna try out for his school soccer team because of me.
And he's rooting for me in my next competition.
I mean, I don't understand,
I totally blew it at regionals.
Why would they want me to compete?
You tried.
And apparently, Dylan and
Stephanie like that.
Hey, Dad.
I need your help.
Name it.
I think I want to compete.
You sure?
You don't have to.
I'll take it heat by heat.
Okay.
So we need to figure out something.
Some way so when I duck dive, I don't get pounded.
Yeah.
You mean something like this?
Yeah.
You sure she can use it in competition?
Sure. Judges don't score on how you get out to the waves.
They only care what you do when you catch one.
Go ahead, say it.
I'm a genius.
You are...
Come on, say it.
Tom, you're a genius!
Genius.
You're very smart.
Genius.
Come on, you know it.
You're cute. You're very cute.
Genius. Genius.
Hey.
Hey.
Remember me?
No.
That's really nice.
Best friends since birth, nothing.
No. Nothing.
Good. Good sign.
Hey, thanks for coming.
Thanks for calling.
I'm sorry I snapped at you at regionals.
Me, too.
I miss you.
Me, too.
Friends?
Of course.
Hey, Bethany!
I saw you surfing out there this morning.
You were amazing.
Maybe for a girl with one arm.
By any standard.
As for one arm, that just levels the playing field.
All right, all right.
What do you want?
I want you to dominate at nationals.
Hey, Keoki, thanks.
For what?
Just for always showing up for me, no matter what.
Well, it's because
I care about you.
I mean, even if you did miss my last competition and all.
I was in the hospital you psycho.
Excuses, excuses.
Ah! Ow!
Bethany, I'm sorry.
I wasn't even...
Gotcha.
Sucker!
Welcome to the Rip Curl Junior
Nationals Surfing Championship.
David Stanfield along with Bo Hodge.
And, Bo, we have an exciting day today.
We've got an excellent day of surfing on hand.
We're going to see the best amateur surfers from around the country today.
We have a panel of four international judges watching this national championship.
High and low scores are thrown out, but what are the judges exactly looking for?
Well, Dave, we have 25-minute heats.
Each rider is allowed to catch a maximum of 10 waves per heat.
The best two waves will be tallied up for the final score.
What the judges are looking for:
Style, flow and power and control in radical maneuvers in the most critical sections of the wave.
Well, we have surf in the six-to-eight-foot range, it looks like out there.
What's key about this six person heat is in fact that paddling and positioning, right?
These girls are tough, especially
Malina, you know that.
The surf is big out there today, so if you try to match them wave for wave, you're just doing to wear yourself out with all that paddling.
Yeah.
So don't take just any wave that comes along.
The greatest surfers, they all have this sixth sense.
They know when the best waves are coming.
They can feel it.
It's a gift.
You have that gift, too.
I do?
Well, your mom's right, honey.
You are a little mermaid.
You know that moment between the sets when it's quiet and the waves haven't even formed yet, it's just energy surging through the water.
Well, that's the time to be patient.
Listen to your instinct.
Trust it.
You'll know.
Go get 'em.
Malina! Malina!
Over the past few months, Malina Birch has dominated every heat she's surfed winning three contests in a row.
No one has come close.
She's by far the person to beat today.
Bethany! Bethany!
Don't worry, it's all part of being sponsored.
We love you, Bethany!
I'm going to go get the rash guards.
What are you doing here?
I'm surfing, same as you.
Well, I hope you don't need to be rescued again.
Actually, Malina,
I wanted to thank you.
For what?
Just for never taking it easy on me.
It means a lot.
You ready?
Okay.
Bethany Hamilton's appearance here is truly a remarkable comeback.
Against all odds, she has earned her spot into the National
Championships.
Everyone in attendance is hopeful that Bethany has a great contest.
But at the highest level of competition, there are no free rides.
We begin with our first round of competition.
And there's the horn.
The first heat is underway.
Yes!
Yes!
Can you believe that?
Advancing into the finals by 2/10's of a point, the big story is
Bethany Hamilton.
She was looking for a 7.2 and scored a 7.4 on her last wave.
She'll be wearing blue out in the lineup with her good friend, wearing pink, Alana Blanchard.
And their competitors, black, Malina Birch.
Yellow, Leila Hurst. White, Nagé
Melamed, and in orange Kelia Moniz.
And the judges are looking for some progressive surfing today.
That's right, Dave.
They'll have a 25-minute heat, be scored on 10 waves, but they'll keep their best two waves for the final score on the zero to ten point range.
And there's the horn and the heat is underway.
Yeah!
There's Nagé Melamed.
She scores two vertical turns, and the judges give her a 6. 75, and what a great start to this heat.
Alana Blanchard picking up a set wave.
Works her way down the line.
Snaps a big turn off the top.
Runs around her competitor with an aggressive reentry.
And pink cracks the lip one more time.
Great run, Alana!
Situation with fifteen minutes remaining in the heat, surfer in orange, Kelia
Moniz, you have a 5.4.
Surfer in white, Nagé
Melamed, you have a 6. 75.
Surfer in pink,
Alana Blanchard, you are in first place with a 7.0.
Way to go, Alana!
Go!
Bo, Hamilton goes down hard in the impact zone, and she is struggling.
That's okay.
You'll get another one!
Stay in there, stay in there, Bethany.
Take a look at this.
We've got four competitors scratching for this wave.
And surfer in black takes control of the peak.
Birch on the nice take off.
She sprays Bethany!
Great off the top!
Birch snaps under the lip.
Banks it off the white water one more time.
Man, she is on fire today.
One away. Malina Birch has scored a 9.25 according to the judges, and that is a high score.
Now she is in the lead,
Blanchard in second.
Melamed in third,
Leila Hurst in fourth,
Bethany Hamilton is in fifth, and in sixth right now is Moniz.
Hamilton with a stall and goes over the falls.
Is she going to be all right?
It's okay. Everybody gets caught every once in a while.
She can handle it.
Precious time on the clock right now, Dave.
And it looks like Alana is paddling into a big wave on the outside.
Ooh! And Alana Blanchard takes a spill there, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, Malina
Birch is up and riding again.
This girl's a wave magnet today, Bo.
She certainly is in rhythm with the ocean.
Way above the pack here in today's competition.
Malina Birch has just scored a 9.5 on her last wave.
That is the highest wave of the contest.
She's going to need two nine-plus waves to even come close to catching Malina.
She's got less than five minutes.
With time winding down and no waves on the horizon, our surfers are anxious to get a final score.
Look for the girls to scramble for any solid wave before the hooter blows.
Check this out, ladies and gentlemen.
There's some energy out in back.
Looks like the girls have spotted something on the horizon.
Paddle, Bethany.
Paddle hard.
Bo, take a look at this.
Birch and Hamilton paddle-battle out the back.
And Hamilton really needs to beat her to the inside.
If she's got a chance here today.
Come on, Bethany, stay ahead of her!
Don't let up!
You got her!
Unbelievable, Bo, all Malina's got to do is block Bethany Hamilton from getting to the inside and she's got this contest in the bag.
Paddle hard!
Birch is still blocking
Hamilton from the inside.
I don't know how she's going to catch this wave, Bo.
Paddle!
Dave, we've got a paddle-battle to the outside.
It's Birch.
It's Hamilton.
She's got her on the ropes.
Can Bethany catch the wave?
This is her last chance.
Yes!
Yes!
She's got the wave, David!
This is the one she's been waiting for all contest long.
Absolutely unbelievable.
Bethany Hamilton duck dives under Malina Birch while Birch is still out there looking for another ride.
Sick one, Bethany!
That was an unbelievable ride by Bethany Hamilton.
The judges give her a 9. 7.
It's the highest score of the heat!
Wow!
But she's still fifth!
All right, guys, she needs one more, one more.
Bethany Hamilton is paddling outside the lineup.
What does she see?
I don't know, Dave, but no one's been paddling out in that area all during the contest.
Why is she so far out?
What, is she giving up?
I don't know.
She feels something.
What are you doing?
Dave, there's only one minute remaining on the clock.
It is dead flat.
The contest may be already over.
Why is she stopping?
There's nothing out there.
Not yet.
Only 45 seconds on the clock and no set waves on the horizon.
This contest may be over, Bo.
We are counting down to end this final.
Just 30 seconds left on the clock.
Big bomb on the outside.
Fifteen seconds remaining.
Everybody else is too far inside.
The Rip Curl Nationals,
10 seconds to go!
And there is Bethany Hamilton with an amazing wave out the back.
Will this be enough?
She is paddling and here comes the wave.
She's taken the drop!
An amazing barrel for Bethany Hamilton.
Perfect positioning.
Was she up before the horn?
They have to count it.
Way to go, Bethany!
Yeah!
Unbelievable.
Bethany Hamilton's amazing wave at the end does not count.
She stood up after the horn.
- What?
So she gets no score.
Malina Birch, your new National Champion.
No!
It's okay, Dad.
It's okay.
But it didn't count.
It counted.
It totally counted.
Yes, it did.
I'm still checking that video. Noah!
Hey. You okay?
Very. Are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
What am I supposed to do now?
You're supposed to enjoy it. All of it.
For the rest of your life.
In fifth place, Bethany Hamilton!
Good job.
Yeah! Bethany!
And in fourth place,
Leila Hurst.
Third place, Nagé Melamed.
Second place, Alana Blanchard.
Way to go, baby!
And in first place,
Malina Birch.
Hey.
Hey, Malina. Great job.
You're a tough opponent.
Bethany Hamilton, nobody is as tough as you.
Get up here.
Come on. Come on.
I'd like to share this win with Bethany Hamilton.
Because the judges may not have counted that last wave, but I did.
Bethany.
Bethany! Bethany!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just back off, okay.
It's okay.
Are you sure?
You don't have to talk to them.
Yeah, but what about Dylan or Logan or Stephanie?
What if they're watching?
Bethany, I'm from
Transworld Surf magazine.
Are you upset you didn't win today?
I didn't come to win.
I came to surf.
Bethany, I just wanted to ask you if you could go back to that day and not have gone surfing, would you do it?
I wouldn't change what happened to me, because then I wouldn't have this chance in front of all of you.
This chance to embrace more people than I ever could have with two arms.
I was born to surf.
This is why I wake up at the crack of dawn every day.
This is why I endure belly rashes, reef cuts, muscles so tired they feel like noodles.
And I've learned that life is a lot like surfing.
When you get caught in the impact zone, you need to get right back up because you never know what's over the next wave.
And if you have faith, anything is possible.
Anything at all.
Yeah, it was so much fun just seeing him get better and better on every wave and get up and ride all the way to the beach.
It was awesome.
Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch of the 2004 season is Bethany Hamilton.
Strike.
Thank you, Bethany!
I think I got my courage from Jesus Christ.
He says, "Be strong."
You think you're going to surf again?
I think?
I know I'm going to surf again.
Somebody told me once...
that if you stand still in the forest long enough...
you'll see signs of a hidden struggle.
Raging between forces of life and decay.
That the survival of the forest itself depends on the outcome.
And that the good guys need all the help they can get.
And that if you don't believe it, take a close look.
And if you still don't, look closer.
Oh! Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Ah! Oh, oh, oh!
Whoa! I...
Oh!
Whoa!
Need a lift?
I don't need your help!
You're running out of branch there, buddy.
Still don't need your help.
Whoa! Oh!
Why aren't you with your group?
What? I fly faster alone!
How do you not get this?
You're not the only one on this team, you know.
So yell at one of them for a change.
You hear that? What am I supposed to do with this kid?
Ah, you're right.
You've got your own problems.
You're a Leafman. You know how important today is.
You know what? I'm thinking maybe
I'm just not cut out for this.
That's the problem.
You are cut out for it.
But I'm tired of waiting for you to prove it.
Get a bird and get back to
Moonhaven, or you're done.
What, you're not going to help me now?
I just did.
That's cool!
I could probably just jump from here!
Just follow that last guy down!
Whoa! Incoming.
Bet they didn't have bugs like that in the city.
Yeah. I miss it already.
She talks!
Something on your mind, kid?
What do you say to a total stranger?
Stranger? You and I go back twenty minutes.
Not you... Larry.
I mean the person I'm visiting.
I'm leaving you out here with someone you don't know?
It's okay, Lar.
We weren't always strangers.
Maybe now things will be different.
♪ And everyone says
♪ This love will change you
♪ Well, I ask
♪ Does anything ever stay the same?
♪ No, no, no
♪ It's strange changes
That's not a house, that's termites holding hands. No offense.
Don't worry, Lar. I'll be...
Call if you need a quick getaway, kid!
Fine.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Hello?
Okay. No, actually, you know what?
I should check this bee.
No, that's right there. Uh...
Do we have... I had it we... Oh, no, it's over here.
Okay. Yeah.
Uh, let's see.
Uh...
Made of...
Oh, gosh!
I don't know, polished acorn shell and thin leather?
Perhaps mouse hide.
Pardon me, excuse me, sorry.
Correction: not mouse hide.
Shrew, perhaps.
Or, you know what, actually, it could be vole.
Hi, Dad.
Oh!
Mary Katherine!
Yeah.
You're here! Mmm!
Yeah.
I didn't realize today was today.
It always is.
Hey, let me look at you! Oh...
You look just like your mother.
Like she did.
You would, if you know what I mean... Dad.
Do you want to talk about it, if that's...
Thanks, but I've been reading up on the five stages of grief.
I'm working through them myself.
I'm good like that.
There actually are a few things
I would like to talk about.
Oh, oh, oh! Ozzy!
Look who's back!
Ozzy?
He's still alive?
Well, you know, most of him.
He may be down to three legs, but he'll make a break for it... the first chance he gets.
Ozzy, go say hi.
Here, boy!
Ah, there he goes.
His depth perception's a little off... and he has a tendency to run in circles.
Hey, but that was closer than usual, you know?
He remembers you!
So, I have a little surprise for you up here.
Just follow me, take a look.
Ozzy! No. No kisses.
Well, here we are.
Welcome home.
It's like I never left.
All your things are here, you got your dolls and... your pictures, your turtle.
Oh, dear.
Well, it's good to have you back, Mary Katherine.
Actually, I go by MK now.
Oh! MK.
I like that.
It's more grown-up.
Oh! Um... Hmm.
Do you have to get that?
Oh, no. No. That was just one of my sensors.
I got a lot going on right now.
Today is actually a highly unusual day.
There is both a full moon tonight and the summer solstice... which only coincide every hundred years or so.
You can imagine, it's just crazy over here.
Hey! Uh...
You probably want some time to settle in.
I'm just going to let you make yourself at home, Mary Kather...
Oh! No, who's Mary Katherine?
MK, I mean.
Okay, Mom, I'm trying.
That was the deal.
Oh, my.
Oh!
Come on, Mom, you're going to miss them.
Hey, Leafmen!
Huh? What?
Queen Tara, we need to discuss today's ceremony.
The Boggans have crossed our border again.
You're not getting enough sunshine.
Yes, it's Ronin.
Well, I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.
I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.
You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.
When we were kids he wasn't so serious.
Would you like to hear my plan?
And he had the sweetest smile.
Look, instead of a public ceremony,
I go in with a small platoon... pretend we're stopping for a drink.
We grab a pod, bring it back to you.
It blooms, the life of the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.
It doesn't work that way.
I can't choose unless I'm there.
It's about the feeling.
I get it from the pods...
I get it from the forest...
I get it from all of us.
There we are.
Don't you have feelings, Ronin?
Yes, I feel this is a bad idea.
The Boggans have never been this aggressive.
I'm not completely helpless, you know.
I am aware.
But you're the life of the forest.
Looking after you is my duty.
Is that the only reason you do it?
Isn't that reason enough?
If that's the only reason there is.
Your Majesty.
Yes?
I'm not ticklish.
Oh!
You used to be!
Very well. I understand your concern... but this is the one day in a hundred years I can choose an heir.
If I don't do this today... there won't be a future to protect.
I don't think I saw a salute, Boggan!
We had a little skirmish with some Leafmen this morning.
A rat got caught in the crossfire... so I got a new coat.
It's, uh, just like yours!
Did you find the location of their ceremony?
Uh...
Yes, sir!
It's way outside of our borders.
You mean their borders?
The Leafmen think they can keep us contained... surround our beautiful island of rot... with their hideous green forest.
So arrogant!
All in the name of balance.
I'm sick of balance.
No matter how much of the forest we destroy... the queen regrows it with one wave of her hand.
She needs to be cut down!
At the root!
Exactly.
Today we'll show them you just can't stop the rot.
If the queen dies without an heir... the Leafmen can't regrow anything.
The balance swings in our favor forever.
Leaving you and me... rulers of a desperate, desiccated kingdom.
I won't let you down...
Dad.
I know you won't.
You look good in rat.
It's slimming.
Yeah!
Look out, look out!
Here comes your star pupil.
Oh, oh, oh!
Where have you been?
Wait, you're mad?
You told me to get back and I'm back.
On this!
And you want credit for that?
You're late.
Find a real bird and get back to your group.
You know what? No.
What did you say?
I'm not doing it.
I'm not a kid anymore and I'm tired of you treating me like one.
I'm trying to help you, I'm trying to look out for you.
I never asked you to do that.
Your father did.
Well, you can stop.
I absolve you of all further responsibility in the raising of young Nod.
Don't walk away from me.
I'm your commanding officer!
Not anymore!
I quit! Hyah!
Whoa! Thatta girl.
Easy, easy!
What are you looking at?
Nothing. I have no opinion on this.
Everyone, mount up!
Parade! Fun! Smiling!
Dad!
Dad!
Is this a good time to talk?
Ow. Hold on, I'll be right down!
Ow!
Ozzy!
Ozzy, stop!
Fetch the camera!
Why do you have security cameras, anyway?
Do people around here steal old newspapers?
Oh, no, no. They're not security cameras.
No, I have an extensive network all through the forest, yeah.
I don't know how much your mother told you about my work.
Um... nothing.
Just that you have a delusional belief... in an advanced society of tiny people living in the woods... and it ruined your career... not to mention your marriage.
Or something?
Well... your mother had a wonderful sense of humor.
But I'm not delusional.
I know they're out there.
It's intuition, like scientists intuited the atom.
These little guys are a big part of the ecosystem... the engine, if you will, and I will prove it. Here.
You have bat sounds on your iPod? Why?
To study them. They don't really fly in your hair.
That's a myth.
But I was trying to identify... the frequencies that draw bats to gather with their own kind.
So I slowed the sounds down... and I put them through some proprietary filters... and guess what I heard.
Voices?
Yes!
Isn't that cool?
Okay... if tiny men are flying around in the forest... how come I've never seen them?
No, that's easy.
It's the same reason we can't hear them.
They just move too fast, like insects.
Didn't you ever wonder why it was so hard to swat a fly?
My theory is they're actually living faster.
Like in a different dimension.
So, no matter how fast we think we are... to them we're just big and dumb and... slow.
Have you ever seen one?
Well, you know, uh...
You know what? Just because you haven't seen something... doesn't mean it's not there.
I, you know, that's...
Come on.
Okay, we need to talk.
I know it's a lot to take in.
I mean about us.
Oh, no! No, we'll do it together!
Yeah, both of us. Here,
I made this for you.
Dad, look...
I am almost old enough to be on my own anyway... so I think it would be better if I just...
Um...
You don't want to live here?
That's what you want?
No, it's not what I want.
I want you to stop!
All this!
And be normal. I just, I want a dad who's not...
Oh, um, okay.
This is big.
This is a big thing going on right now.
Let me just find...
Where are you going?
I'm just going to investigate, rather...
Okay, something must be happening.
Ooh! Uh... Let's see.
Where's my camera?
Are you serious?
You have to catch these things in the moment... while they're happening... otherwise you miss a chance that could be gone forever.
You're missing a chance right now!
Are you even listening?
Look, you've got to believe me.
I am so close.
All I need is one little breakthrough.
This could be it!
I will clear this all up when I get back!
I promise!
Sure, Dad.
I'll be here.
In reality.
Bye, Ozzy.
It's not you.
Uh, Larry? I need that getaway cab.
I said, pick me up by the... Hello?
Ugh! No bars!
Ozzy! Heel!
Stop! Play dead!
How are you so fast on three legs?
Ozzy!
Ozzy!
Ozzy!
Isn't she pretty?
She's awesome!
She moved those trees with her mind!
Mom, can I be queen when I grow up?
Oh, honey, it doesn't work that way.
Today, Queen Tara gives her power to a special Pod... so the life of the forest will continue.
It's all very mysterious, and...
Sweetie, what are you doing?
Mom!
I did it!
Did what?
Aw!
She's coming!
Don't do anything to embarrass me... or it could ruin my chances of being a Leafman.
Why do you want to be a Leafman?
They gotta wear uniforms.
Me? I like to let it all hang free.
You see this, you see that?
Yeah, don't do that.
That's vile.
Come on, I know you got a little belly, too.
Gentlemen.
Hey. Your Majesty.
Hello.
It's all right.
Relax, it's just me.
Mub, Grub, it's a very nice-looking group of Pods.
I might have a hard time picking one.
Do you have a favorite?
Well, Your Majesty, we have had quite the debate.
Really gone back and forth.
You'll note the carefully curated selection of sizes, densities, color.
With so many variables, you can't be too hasty.
Boom! Right here.
Biggest in the bunch.
Hmm.
Well, that's one way to go.
How about that one?
What? That one?
For real?
But it's so...
Perfect!
It's perfect.
Excellent choice, Your Majesty.
Sometimes the biggest one isn't the best one. Ow!
I told you, she doesn't like gaudy, Mub.
Unlike you, she's got class.
This is it.
This is the one.
Aw!
Boggans.
Your Majesty!
Get to the barge!
I told you she was awesome!
Hold the formation!
This is it, Mub!
My chance to be a Leaf...
What? Your chance to be a what?
Ronin!
Ozzy?
Oh, come on, Ozzy.
We had numbers, and we had the surprise part!
How are we losing?
Patience, son. The forest wasn't grown in a day.
But we can destroy it in one. Right?
Ha! That's the spirit!
You take the Pod,
I'll take the queen.
Nice one!
You're stealing my moves, kid!
Your Majesty, come with me!
Take her to safety!
I have to lead them away from the crowd!
You're totally my hero!
Okay... so maybe you were right.
Remind me to gloat later.
Son! No!
Ozzy!
Ah!
Oh!
Ah! Ah, ah!
Ahhh!
Huh?
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Oh, my gosh, that's an arrow.
Should I pull it out?
I don't know what to do.
Take the Pod to Nim Galuu.
Nim what?
You need a doctor.
Somebody call...
What is this thing?
It's the life of the forest.
Tara!
So serious.
I'm so sorry.
What did she say to you?
Something about glue?
Or a canoe.
Nim Galuu.
The scroll keeper.
We don't know anything about the Pod without Tara.
Maybe he does.
Take the Leafmen to Moonhaven.
Fortify it.
Keep everyone safe.
What about you?
Mandrake will be looking for this Pod... but he won't be looking for a Leafman traveling alone.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
I'll send word when I reach Nim's.
Who are you people? Is this some sort of reenactment?
That's a big bug.
No, it's about average, actually.
Then what? I'm tiny?
Oh, no.
No.
No, no, no.
I'm not sure why the queen brought you here either... but she gave you that Pod, so you have to come with me.
Make me big!
Excuse me?
I'm not going anywhere until you make me big again!
Uh... You know what?
I don't do magic.
You can talk to Nim Galuu about that, he might know something.
Might?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast, soldier boy.
You do not yank on a Pod, okay?
Especially when it's attached to something so lovely.
Talking snails.
Actually, he's a snail.
I'm a slug.
No shell over here, baby.
It just slows me down.
Ronin, right?
Head of the Leafmen?
Big fan.
I just love what you do with your jaw.
Yes, that!
We are the official
Pod caretakers, sir.
It can't survive without us.
We keep it moist.
Moist is what we do.
You're kidding.
You're not kidding. Fine.
Word of the queen's passing will travel fast... we have to travel faster.
With all this extra weight we're going to need another bird.
Bird. Of course.
By any chance... you don't happen to be part of an advanced society... of tiny people living in the woods, do you?
Some are more advanced than others.
And that's another lap down.
These racers are in it to win...
and they'd better be, we've got some
heavy betting in the crowd today.
They're clustering together...
I'm telling you, this is where I belong!
You belong in the back of the pack!
I mean racing!
The best man wins.
No other rules, nobody telling you what to do.
You talk too much!
And you ain't winning this race!
Sorry, can't hear you!
Going too fast!
Hey. Nice old fleabag you got there.
It's not the bird, it's how you ride it.
Yeah? Prove it.
Fetch!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's a dirty trick,
which, let's face it, is exactly what we've come to see.
Final lap!
This is bird racing, folks, it's not a parade.
Looks like Nod's out of the race.
Wait a minute, is that...
Nod is down but not out!
Don't let his old bird fool you!
The kid's on the comeback trail!
You know what we'll do if you win?
I don't know, lose?
It's the final lap.
They're beak to beak, wing to wing...
and it's Nod by a tail feather!
The odds-on favorite takes it home.
I bet there's a lot of happy faces in the crowd right now.
Is that the best you've got?
How was that?
Better.
Nod, you know I like you.
Yeah, I like you, too,
Mr. Bufo.
And yet, you don't do what we agreed.
We agreed that you would lose, but then you win.
Now, I can't help it if I'm fast.
You want me to lose, you gotta give me some better competition.
It's called teamwork.
Maybe if you understood that... the Leafmen wouldn't have kicked you out.
They did not kick me out.
I quit.
I admire your independent spirit, Nod, I'll miss that.
Feed him to something.
A snake would be good.
No, snakes just swallow you whole.
Now, if you put him in a hornets' nest, that's a show.
Ah, look, it's Ronin, defender of the weak... popper of parties, here to ruin the fun.
I didn't ruin all of it.
I let you hit him.
Twice.
Hop along now, little froggy.
Easy, Ronin, it's a big forest out there.
Even Leafmen gotta sleep.
You're wasting your time.
I'm not coming back.
I'm not asking.
Oh, I see. The old reverse psychology.
Make me feel guilty, get me to beg you.
I didn't come for you.
The queen is dead.
What? How?
Boggan ambush.
Ronin,
I don't know what to say.
She was your...
I'm sorry.
What's going to happen to us, to the forest?
If we don't get the Pod to Nim
Galuu's, the forest will die.
Let me grab my saddle.
What? No. I didn't ask for your help.
Really? Because it sounds like you could use a rider with my...
Ability to absorb punches?
The situation's desperate.
Let's not make it hopeless.
All right, well, who's with you?
Who's riding point?
Uh-oh.
Get your saddle.
I'll get my saddle.
This doesn't make any...
I mean, it makes sense.
Mary Katherine, you're not gonna believe these readings... they are off the charts!
The wind, and the rain and lightning!
And the birds were flying!
In a storm!
Okay, and that's not normal.
Which would prove...
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to make some lunch... and I'll tell you all about it.
Ozzy, what are you doing outside?
Did you see it, too?
Tell me you saw it.
Hey, Mary Katheri...
Or, no, MK!
MK, what did you want to talk about?
What?
What is it, Ozzy?
Hey, I'm Nod, by the way.
Hi. MK. Yeah.
Could you just face the way the bird's driving?
No, don't worry. She practically flies herself.
Great, because this whole bird-riding thing's new to me.
Are you serious?
We gotta fix that.
Here, put your arms around me.
I just met you.
Okay, but you're gonna want to hold on to something.
What is wrong with you?
Do you know how hard it is to do that without falling?
I do now!
Nod, perch your bird.
Hey, I'm just trying to keep things... light.
What did that?
Mandrake.
Tara's power always kept him in check.
Now nothing can heal what he destroys.
Except that Pod.
We have to go around.
Just for one scout?
Ever see just one Boggan?
Hold on to me. Hyah!
Still barely know you.
Nod, wait!
Whoa!
Get to the ground!
This way!
Other way!
What was that thing?
What, you've never seen a Boggan?
Someone had a happy childhood.
Come on, let's regroup.
You mean up there with those things?
They almost killed us.
Don't turn around.
Is it a Boogie?
Walk towards me slowly.
Oh, it's a mouse.
Hi, mousie!
I was gonna scare it away.
What are you doing?
Look at its little hands and its little whiskers. Oh!
Hello! Other person!
Jump!
I can't jump that high!
Ohh! Ah!
Did you see what I just did?
Out! Jump out!
Oh, great.
Hey, over here!
Over here!
Whoa, whoa!
Fuzzy mousie.
Ahh!
Nice tail.
It's flexible.
Ah! Ah! Help!
They have very sensitive whiskers.
You know, I had this.
Uh-huh.
Are you all right?
Dad? I had the most messed-up dream.
There were talking slugs and tiny little soldiers and...
Hello!
Ah, man!
Now let's move.
Where there's mice there's bound to be chipmunks.
New seating arrangement.
You're riding with me.
Thank you.
You're with the slugs.
Ugh! Disgusting.
Do you and me have a problem?
Uh, I don't think so.
What was that over there?
A little chit-chat?
That's real cute.
You trying to jump in?
What are we talking about?
There's a code amongst men.
It goes something like this.
I saw her first.
Ow!
You're a slug.
So? You think she'd want you?
Look at yourself!
Oh, that's right, you can't... because your eyeballs are stuck all the way inside your head.
What's wrong, flatface?
Are you gonna cry?
Do you want me to call your flatface mommy?
You know you're not insulting me, right?
You're just grossing me out.
You've been warned.
Ow!
Hey, if this is a bad time...
I can come back when you're done gardening.
Oh! Hey!
I imagine you're wondering why I invited you here.
I was frog-marched here at spearpoint. Ah!
How is that invited?
I let you keep your legs.
Comedy. Terrific.
Funny psychopath.
There are rumors that the Leafman Ronin was at your place of business... and that he may have rescued a Royal Pod.
Real smooth.
You got rid of the queen, but let her Pod get away.
Plus your idiot general gets himself mulched.
That idiot general... was my son!
Of course he was.
He had your good looks.
And your healthy gray complexion.
And forgiving nature.
Shut up!
What's it gonna be, Bufo?
Are you gonna talk?
Or are you gonna croak?
Where are they taking the Pod?
It's clear. Hyah!
Why is he even with us?
He's not helping.
Well, when he's not being an idiot... he's a pretty decent flier.
Could be one of the best.
Plus his father was my friend, so I do what I can.
"Many leaves, one tree."
What does that mean?
We're all individuals, but we're still connected.
It's what we live by.
Hyah!
Maybe you're connected, but I'm kind of on my own.
No one's on their own.
Not even him.
Hey, Nod, how's the view?
Well... here we are.
I thought this was a secret Leafmen mission.
How many people did the queen tell about this?
They're here looking for answers.
Nobody knows that the queen is gone... only that the blight is spreading.
So, this Nim guy can tell them?
He's the keeper of our history... but even he may not know about the queen.
He's not always up to speed.
But he'll help, right?
He's, like, the wise old man of the forest.
Uh, he's more like the crazy uncle.
The whole meadow just died.
Everything was green, and now it's gone.
I grew up in that meadow.
Why isn't the queen doing anything?
If anything happened to her, everything's going to rot!
We're doomed!
We're doomed!
Get a hold of yourself!
Oops. Sorry.
Friends!
Neighbors!
Prepare to see your worries... disappear.
Ooh!
I know rumors have been flying... but the truth is never as bad as it seems.
I have just returned from deep inside this tree... from the Rings of Knowledge... where every memory... every event that ever happens in the forest... is recorded in these scrolls.
♪ Listen, party poopers,
I've got something to say
♪ Dry your weeping eyes, we're gonna be okay
♪ So you don't have to worry about a dog gone thing
♪ The Rings of Knowledge know everything
♪ The scrolls never lie and, honey, neither does Nim
♪ It's right here in my hands, all six of them
♪ So tuck your little fears and put them right into bed
♪ It says right here that the queen...
That the queen is...
Uh...
What?
Just tell us what it says!
What's it say?
He doesn't know anything! Boo!
Fraud!
♪ Dry your weeping eyes, we're gonna be fine
♪ Everything is really gonna be all right ♪
Ronin! Did you hear about the queen?
This is terrible!
I know, but...
We gotta do something!
We gotta keep everyone from freaking out!
Yes, that's why we...
And the Pod!
We gotta make sure the Royal Pod is safely hidden... far away. And...
What'd you bring it here for?
The queen's last words were
"Bring the Pod to Nim Galuu."
She say anything else? Specific instructions? Maybe a note?
Those were her last words.
I thought you were magic.
Magic might be stretching it.
I'm charismatic.
Possibly charming.
Do you know what to do with the Pod or not?
Not a clue, but I do know where to look it up.
Follow me!
There he is!
Phony!
Um, no, it's this way.
The Rings of Knowledge!
Is everything that happens really recorded right here?
Oh, yeah.
And you've read all these scrolls?
Ah, I've skimmed them.
So, is this event being recorded?
Right now?
Of course.
Is this?
Yes.
How about this?
Yes.
What about this?
Yep.
That should be it right here.
Thanks, Marty.
Aw!
Okay. Blooming a Pod.
Gotta go way back for that.
Here we go.
Let's see.
Pod, care of.
Must keep moist.
Well, good news is, once the queen chooses it... it's going to bloom no matter what.
But it has to open tonight... in the light of the full moon when it's at its highest peak.
Yep, solstice... full moon, highest peak, mentions it a bunch of times.
What happens if it blooms out of the moonlight?
Unclear.
The last part's missing.
I gotta be honest, termites have been a problem.
So here I thought we were doomed.
This calls for a celebration!
I suppose we've earned it.
Wait... this is gonna sound weird, but...
I'm not from this world.
And I thought maybe something in these scrolls could tell me... if there's a way for me to get home.
The scrolls don't tell the future... they only guide us with the knowledge of the past.
Hey, that's a great line!
You guys got that, right?
So you can't help me?
I didn't say that.
I can't read this.
It's just dusty.
Blow it off.
It's you.
But I saw you turn into moss.
Come closer.
Oh, this is perfect!
You can make me big again.
Closer.
It's a memory.
If you can hear me now... it means you got to Nim's.
The Pod needs you.
I can't be around for it anymore.
No, don't do that!
Why would you give that to me?
You don't understand,
I have to get home... this has nothing to do with me.
You're here for a reason.
Maybe you don't see the connections yet.
But just because you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there.
I know you're scared.
Just stay with the Pod... be with it when it blooms... and then you'll get back what you've given.
You'll get back.
Well, that was intense.
I gotta read more of these.
That means I can get home!
Well, if you want to go home so bad, then why did you leave?
Lose the sword, Ronin, we're done.
We're not done until the Pod blooms.
We're bringing it home to Moonhaven.
I need you to watch it while I tell the rest of the Leafmen to expect us.
Hey, I helped you get here, but I haven't changed my mind.
Do you think just because you're not a Leafman anymore... you're not a part of this?
Well, the fate of that Pod affects all of us.
The queen is gone.
But, as always, she looked out for us... even in her final moments.
Tonight, when this Pod blooms, a new queen will rise!
I know you're sad.
I am, too.
But Tara wouldn't want us to mourn!
She'd want us to celebrate her life!
And the life of the forest!
So, stay with it.
And don't lose the sword.
Look, I'm thinking that I didn't make the best first impression.
It's okay. I've never had a guy fight a mouse for me before.
You're not from around here, are you?
What makes you say that?
If you were,
I would remember you.
To Queen Tara!
To the queen!
You wanna go somewhere quieter?
Will that be okay with Ronin?
Yeah, he said to watch the Pod... but there's nowhere safer than Nim's tree.
I think he's just pretty upset about the queen.
Here, let me show you something.
What?
Huh.
That actually gets easier.
What is...
Wow.
Grab on!
What?
Put your arms around me.
But I barely know you.
Do you want to ride him or not?
The scroll said there was nothing you could do to save her, Ronin.
You have to know that.
Send a code to the Leafmen.
Let them know the Pod is safe and we're bringing it home.
You heard him.
Go tell them, boys!
And it's happy hour at Nim's!
Or just do the first part.
I gotta admit, flying is nice, but this is riding in style.
Yeah.
Not everyone can do it.
You have to be gentle to ride a deer.
My dad taught me how.
It's one of my best memories of him.
You must really miss him.
I know how that feels.
Fruit fly, huh?
So, what's it like, having such a short life cycle?
It's great, mister!
When I grow up...
I'm going to... wish I had done more with my life, sonny.
The forest trembles at the passing of the humble fruit fly.
Excuse me, but I've lost something very dear to me.
It was left by a friend who's no longer with us.
Ah!
You found it!
If you want to take this Pod, you're gonna have to go through us!
Relax. I'm not going to hurt it.
I need it alive.
Well, we're the only ones that know how to keep it that way.
Thanks for the tip.
Stay with the Pod, that's all you had to do.
Yeah, but I just thought...
Do you ever think about anyone besides yourself?
It wasn't all his fault!
And you. I expected as much from him.
But I thought you would know better.
We're really sorry, okay?
I don't want to hear it.
That was the last part of the queen that I...
That any of us will ever have.
The queen gave it to me. I should have been here with it.
I'll do whatever it takes to help you get it back.
I appreciate the offer, but
Wrathwood is too dangerous.
But you can't go alone.
What about the whole leaves-tree thing that you said?
Nim, tell him.
Look, kid, the moon's coming up.
That's bloom-or-die time.
So if no one has a better plan...
Why don't we sneak in, in disguise?
Great idea.
I'll go as a grasshopper and you can be my cricket ladyfriend.
It's dangerous, I might get killed.
I thought you'd like that.
I don't have any Boggan armor handy.
Do you?
I know where we can get some.
Well?
I gotta say, six hands are better than two.
That's been my experience.
You might want to hang on.
Hyah! Whoa!
Stop! Please!
My son was born on a night like this.
These were his baby fangs.
And here's the first skin he ever molted.
He was big for a larva.
He took after his mother.
Your stories are boring and torturous!
And the Leafmen took him from me.
So I took something of theirs.
It's basic etiquette.
- An eye for an eye.
- Ow!
Jerk!
Tonight your Pod will bloom here.
And when a Pod blooms in darkness, it belongs... to the darkness.
It will become my little dark prince.
I'll destroy the forest with the very thing you hoped would save it.
I hate to break it to you, but it doesn't say that in the scrolls.
It does in the part I have.
D'oh!
Hey, the Boggan armor... where is it?
Over there.
Let's make this quick.
Come on.
Ow!
Oh!
Ow!
That was awesome. Here.
Up we go.
Ugh! That is some static cling.
No, that's metal, don't touch that!
Whoo!
Ow!
Knock it off.
Ow. Quit it.
Ow! No, you quit.
I'm not doing it.
Stop!
Ow. I'm not doing...
Now!
Come on.
You know... some of this stuff looks familiar.
Hey, that's my saddle!
Where are we?
Oh, it's where this guy lives.
I can't believe it.
He's been crashing around the forest like a bear for years.
Most stompers just come and go, but this guy's relentless.
- Wait. Stompers?
- Yeah.
Like us, but big and dumb and slow... always stomping on things. Stompers.
And this one is obsessed with finding us.
Obviously that's a security risk.
Can't have one of his big fat feet stepping on Moonhaven.
One of his ginormous, flabby, dirty, stinky...
Okay, I got it.
So we've been throwing him off the trail.
So you're just messing with him?
But he's found all this stuff.
He only finds what we want him to find.
Look at his map.
We've got him looking everywhere but where we are.
I love how this guy talks.
"Look at this flower."
"I hurt my elbow."
I think that's kind of mean.
"Who said that?"
It's his life's work.
He's my dad!
He what?
I'm a stomper.
What happened?
You got shrunk?
Yes! Which he knows.
Seriously?
It's been a weird day for everybody.
You got a problem with stompers?
A stomper squashed my uncle.
Oh, my gosh. Really?
No. I'm messing with you.
Too far?
Try it again, maybe she'll punch you harder.
I'm sorry.
I guess she's right about me, huh, Ozzy?
All I seem to be able to do is... drive people away.
No, Dad, you didn't! I'm here!
And you're right about all of it.
Don't stop looking.
Not now.
Dad! Dad, just turn around!
Uh-oh.
Ozzy... no kisses.
Ozzy!
Hey, how do I look?
Scary as ever.
Are you okay?
Run!
Ozzy, will you please stop?
Oh! Oh!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
They're here!
They're in my house!
No!
Ow!
I hurt my elbow!
Did you hear that?
He said it!
Whoa!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
No! Don't let go!
Don't let go! No!
Oh, oh!
Hello there, my little friend!
Dad! Dad!
Oh!
Dad! Dad!
Let's go.
You can't stay.
You're with us now!
I'll come home soon, Dad.
I promise.
Come on, MK, we gotta go.
You think he's okay?
Yeah, he'll be fine, their heads are like rocks.
Uh, smart rocks.
That's a whole lot of ugly.
Ugh! It smells like something died in here.
Something did.
How do we know where to go?
I've been here before... with your father.
He never told me about this.
He never got the chance.
How's my dark prince?
It's fine!
Good. Because if it dies, you die.
We know. You said.
Ugly says "what"?
What?
Nothing.
Shh!
There's our exit.
Meet me back here when you've got the Pod and the slugs.
How are we supposed to find them?
Follow the slime.
Aren't you coming with us?
I'm gonna make sure nobody follows you.
Don't worry, you get the easy part...
I get the fun part.
Hey, look!
It's a Leafman!
I'll keep this simple.
I run... you try to catch me.
Let's go.
When I get big again,
I am so coming back here with a can of bug spray.
Mub. Grub.
We're down here!
I told you she'd come for me.
This girl is smitten.
Mmm...
Hand me the Pod!
Oh, come on, you should work on your grip, my dude.
It's a bit womanly.
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa!
Hurry, before the guards come back!
Too late!
I have a plan!
Quick!
Everybody hide in your shells!
Oh. I have another plan!
Go! Go!
Ow! That hurts!
Those are my eyes!
Can you go any faster?
It's kind of hard when you're pulling on my brain!
Ronin!
What a surprise.
I get so few guests.
Could be the stench of death.
Some people don't care for it.
It's all right.
Ronin's an old...
What do you call someone you've known a long time... and always wanted to destroy?
I expected you to come.
But I didn't think you'd come alone.
Who said I'm alone?
Whoa.
Ow!
Ooh! So, what's the plan here?
A hundred Leafmen?
A thousand?
Don't flatter yourself.
Well, now I'm just embarrassed.
I completely over-prepared.
Go, go, go!
I'm afraid you'll find getting out... is a lot harder than getting in.
Ronin!
Hang on!
Go! Take the Pod to Moonhaven!
I'm not leaving without you!
Now you're starting to sound like a Leafman!
Ronin!
Come on!
Hyah!
We've been waiting for you.
Where's Ronin?
He gave us a head start.
But the Boggans aren't far behind.
You guys made it!
I knew you would.
You got that from the scrolls?
Some things you just know.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Moonlight comes in here, moves along here... reaches the Pod here.
At the moon's highest peak.
Only time it can bloom.
Do you know what this means?
We single-handedly saved the forest!
Eye five! Down low.
Too slow.
So, when the Pod opens, what happens to you?
I think I go home.
Well, I guess this is...
Yeah, I guess it is.
Mandrake's bats!
They're not attacking, they're just blocking out the moon.
Are you ready for this?
Are you kidding?
We're outnumbered, out of time and the fate of the world is at stake.
Why did I quit again?
See you up there.
As soon as I can find my helmet.
Thank you.
Hey, guys!
I'm going to need a uniform!
And a bird!
Oh, that's...
You...
That's all right.
I'll find them myself.
A Leafman makes do.
What are you doing?
I'm going to help.
Whoa, whoa.
You heard the queen!
If you want to get home... you have to be here with the Pod when it blooms.
Isn't that what you want?
So I should just sit here?
I didn't say that.
Then I'm going up there.
I didn't say that either.
You don't even know what you're saying.
I'm saying, who gives up everything... for a world that's not even theirs?
Dad. My dad does!
I have to get my dad!
Where do you think you're going?
The queen said I was here for a reason.
This must be it.
That's my girl.
Hyah!
Oh, come on!
Mandrake! He's headed for Moonhaven!
Grub! The Pod! It's blooming in darkness!
Whoa! Hyah!
Hey, Dad!
Come on, I need your help!
Whoa, whoa!
They're all right about me, Ozzy.
All these years just chasing things that aren't even there.
I actually thought
I saw my daughter, two inches tall, stuck in a bug jar.
I've lost my mind.
And I am talking to a dog.
Hey, Dad!
Come on, I need your help, Dad!
What? No! No!
Dad, look at me!
I'm right here!
Just check your cameras!
Ozzy, please.
I've made up my mind, okay?
Quiet!
I don't care anymore.
All I want now, is to find my daughter!
Dad, please!
Please, I need you.
Oh!
I am so over Boggans.
Ah!
Ozzy!
Dad!
Don't faint!
I won't!
How did you find me?
I got your message.
You were right.
About what?
About everything.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
How did you get so small?
Dad, it was amazing!
They're real!
And they need your help.
Follow me!
Missed me.
I wasn't aiming for you.
Ooh! This must be the delivery room.
Whoa! Boy, are you lost!
Down the hall... make a left, and then when you see the janitor with a weird eye...
Shut up!
My dark prince.
Come to Daddy.
I don't think it likes you.
Ronin!
You know how many Boggans
I had to fight to get here?
Seriously, I lost count.
Well, what's one more?
It's all real!
It's really here!
Dad, the bats! We have to get them away from the moon.
It's so beautiful.
There's no time!
But what matters most is...
Not now!
Oh!
Oh, you want me to play the frequencies that... attract the...
Run!
I'll find you, Dad!
I just have to get back before...
Oh! Oh!
Ow, ow, ow!
They really do go in your hair!
This time, when
I leave you for dead... you'll stay that way!
What's that little saying you people have?
"Lots of leaves, something-something"?
Very inspiring.
But in the end every leaf falls and dies alone.
No one is alone.
Not even him.
Look after them for me.
There's that smile.
Your Majesty.
You look terrible.
Hey, did you see how many times I got hit?
I learned that from you.
You're not going to make me say all the stuff...
I learned from you now, are you?
Well, you'd have learned a heck of a lot more from your dad.
I was a pretty poor substitute.
Don't beat yourself up. Lately you've shown some real promise.
Oh, please.
Just say you love each other.
I thought we just did.
Hey, you're still here.
Yeah.
I guess I missed my chance.
I'm sorry.
But not completely sorry.
Wow! Strong grip!
What's happening?
A queen brought you here. How about a queen sends you back?
It's working!
We have to say goodbye!
What for?
You're part of us.
Many leaves, I always say.
I mean, the Leafmen say.
Not that I'm a Leafman.
Says who?
We'll find each other!
Just follow the slime!
I will, Mub.
You're really leaving.
Put your arms around me.
I always hoped if I, uh... if I proved it to her... she'd, uh... you know.
Well, what do you think?
It's perfect, Dad.
Except, the boots are higher and the sleeves are longer.
And they wear actual helmets, not acorns.
Really?
They should seriously consider the potential.
Ozzy!
Here you go, boy.
Um...
Go. It's always for you, anyway.
Hey.
Hey!
How's work?
No, it's not work when you love your job.
"Many leaves, one tree," that's what I always say.
Uh-huh.
What do you think you're doing, Leafboy?
Leafman. You know it's Leafman.
Is it?
I wasn't sure.
Hey, MK!
What's going on, baby girl?
Hi, Mub.
We were talking.
There's a big sack of
"shut your flat face" over there by that tree.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Listen, slick.
Guys, don't fight.
Oh, it won't be a fight. I could whip him with both eyes behind my back.
I'd like to see you try, jelly butt.
I didn't want to have to do this!
Ew!
Mub, get him out of your mouth!
Dad, I gotta go Heimlich my friend out of a slug.
Yeah, that looks pretty weird.
Here don't forget this.
Tell them about the acorn helmets.
Or you could tell them yourself.
Oh!
Come on, Ozzy!

My name's Ramona Q.
I'm nine and three months, and no matter what my sister Beezus tells you...
I'm not a pest.
My dad says I just have an overactive imagination, which does come in handy.
It makes the fun parts funner and the scary parts scarier.
And frankly, it's good to scare yourself once in a while...
'cause if you can't be brave at recess... how can you do it when it really counts?
Okay, stay with me. You can do it, Ramona.
I'll never make it, Howie. Whoa.
Owie, owie.
That's my echo off the canyon, canyon, canyon.
Don't psych yourself out, Ramona.
Just don't look down.
It's too far!
Far! Far! Far!
Howie, help!
- Mrs. Meacham?
Uh, Ramona's kind of hung up.
- Help, please.
- Quiet. Face front.
Ah! Help.
Eyes forward. Lock it down.
Ramona Quimby, get down from there.
This isn't a circus.
You should have seen it through a window. It was awesome.
You looked like a pinata.
Well, obviously without all the candy.
It made me really dizzy, yet I wanna do it again.
- Race you home, mudball.
- I won!
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Howie.
- Excuse me.
- Ramona.
Be more careful with Willa Jean.
- Huh?
- She's younger than you are.
- Ha-ha!
- Ow.
- Willa Jean, come to Grammy.
Mom, look it. I taught Roberta how to stick out her tongue.
That's great, sweetie.
Now I can cancel the private tutor.
- Next, can you teach her how to change her own diaper?
Could you set the table, please, Ramona?
And add another plate for Aunt Bea.
She's coming by later for dessert.
- So five altogether?
- Yep.
I was about to do that.
Hmm. Being about to do it and doing it.
- Mom! Beezus is acting all French again.
Dad's home!
Daddy!
Prepare for impact!
- Hi, honey!
- Dad!
Hey! How are my beautiful girls?
Mwah!
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?
- You bet I did, Pickle.
- I crunched them good. Real good.
- The whole darn day.
I don't think you got dirty enough today,
Ramona.
Well, there's always tomorrow.
- Mwah!
- I'll let you two catch up.
There's my little girl.
My little bowling ball with Legs.
- Sorry about that, Icky Sticky.
Dad, it's Picky Picky.
- When are you ever gonna learn his real name?
- When he learns mine.
So, Beezus, suppose I told you that when l pulled up in front of the house tonight...
I saw your old buddy Henry staring at it like he left something important inside.
Henry Huggins?
I haven't heard that name in a while.
Isn't he the boy that used to eat dirt in the backyard?
- Yeah.
- He doesn't do that anymore.
Ooh. If I didn't know better,
I'd say somebody has a crush.
- Ooh-ooh!
- Can we please talk about something else?
- There is that dance.
Maybe he wants to ask you to it.
Well, if he's gonna ask my girl to a dance, he'd better have some moves.
Can the old dirt-eater do this?
Ooh-hoo, whoo-hoo!
Oh, I hope not. Stop.
- Mom!
What do we got here? Note from the bank.
It could be loan papers for the addition.
- Hope they don't expect us to pay it back.
- Well, banks are funny that way.
What do we got here?
"To the Parents of Beatrice Quimby."
Could this be the latest report card?
"Beatrice Quimby gets in fights...
"steals from the vending machines, counterfeits hall passes.
- Wait. Let me see.
- We recommend juvenile prison. "
All A's.
- We're so proud of you.
- It's not funny.
So, Ramona, Beatrice has her report card.
Doesn't that mean-
I don't know- you should have one too?
That old thing?
Yeah, that old thing.
Where would that old thing happen to be?
- That's a good place for it.
- Yeah, wouldn't want it to spoil.
Oh.
"Ramona is a bright young student"-
That's my girl. "... but lacks focus...
"often daydreams, disputes the need to spell words correctly...
"and has very little respect for the rules of grammar... or rules in general."
- Oh.
- Why would she write this, Ramona?
Because... she's no fun.
- That is no excuse.
- But it's true.
She makes us all use the same words from the same list.
And when I try to be original, she just shoots me down.
Like when I invented the word "terrifical."
She goes, "Ramona, that's not a word."
And I say, "It's a lot funner word to say."
She goes, "Funner isn't a word either."
What kind of teacher is that?
She can't tell kids not to invent words.
She's not the president of the world.
- You butt out, Beezus.
Ramona, Mrs. Meacham is your teacher.
- You need to listen to her.
- And she's not that bad.
She was fair with me when I was your age.
Yeah, well-
Everybody loves Beezus... and everybody hates me!
- Okay.
- Why are you laughing?
- We're not laughing, sweetie.
I'm gonna say a bad word.
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.
A really bad one.
Well, if you feel the need to get one out of your system, then go ahead.
- Guts!
- Guts, guts, guts!
- "G" word.
- That's your idea of a bad word, Ramona?
Honey, I'm sorry we laughed.
- Hey.
Oh, oh, oh.
What's she done?
- Oh, guts!
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?
Hi, Aunt Bea.
Aw, you can do better than that.
- Where's the love? Honk, honk.
I thought I'd find you here.
That was a fine job you did on the toothpaste.
You must have a really strong grip.
Oh!
Let me see those calluses.
Oh, yeah. all that time on the jungle gym sure is paying off.
Did that one get bigger?
Tremendous. Trophy size.
You know...
I was a younger sister, too, once. Still am.
No matter how old I get,
I'll always be younger.
It's no fair, Aunt Bea.
I never do anything as good as Beezus.
- And Roberta, if she burps, it's adorable.
- Hmm.
Last week, she poured applesauce on her head...
- and Dad stopped to take pictures.
- Oh!
I mean, when it's my turn to do stuff... nobody even cares.
Well, it's impossible to compete with pouring food on your head.
Why do we even bother?
You know what? I bet it would be nice... to have something of your own for once.
Like my own room?
Maybe just something small... you could always have with you.
Go ahead. Open it.
I found that picture the other day... and I realized I was exactly your age, so I wanted you to have it.
- That's you?
- Yeah.
There's room for another if you wanna give that little girl some company.
- Thank you, Aunt Bea.
- Mm-hmm.
I want you to know... that you will always have me around.
- Aw.
- Whoo!
You okay?
- I gotcha.
Mmm. I gotcha.
- Bring it up!
Beezus, wake up!
Beezus, come on.
- To the right.
Check it out, man.
Ramona!
- Okay. We're clear.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoa!
Control tower, we've reached 30,000 feet.
Ramona, you are clear for airdrop.
Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!
Whoa! Whoo!
Whoa!
- This is the best day ever!
- Whoo-hoo!
Yeah. I wish we had a hole in our house.
Hey, Ramona, let's make a deal.
If you can settle down for a few hours,
I'll see if Dad can take us out to dinner.
- Really?
Can we go to Macaroni Joe's?
- There is an inch of dust covering my whole kitchen.
- We can go anywhere.
- Yeah!
Whoo!
I'm having a hair crisis.
But it looks the same as always.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- He's home!
- Dad.
- Hey.
Daddy!
- Boing!
- Ohh!
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?
Well, today they kind of crunched me back.
But I got you a little surprise.
Why don't you and Beez go outside and share those... and I'll talk to your mom for a minute, okay?
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
- Something's wrong.
They let three people go last week.
How can you tell?
'Cause they're whispering.
Did I do something wrong?
No.
Not this time.
But something tells me that we're not going to Macaroni Joe's.
Hey, you got more red ones. all right. Take a few more.
Remember how I taught you to eat them.
- Bite the head off first?
- Yep.
It's more humane that way.
You don't deserve to be downsized.
"Downsized"? What's that mean?
Well, um... it means the storage company was bought by a bigger one... and a lot of people were let go, including Dad.
The good news is
I called Dr. Perry's office... and she has some part-time work for me again... so that should tide us over for a little while, at least.
Don't worry. I will find a job.
But in the meantime...
I got a little extra time to spend with my girls.
Right?
- Right?
- Right.
- Okay.
- Right.
You realize we're gonna be poor now, right?
No, we're not.
- Are we?
- Have you seen how many bills they get?
It's insane.
Everything costs money, even water.
Well, Mom's gonna make money.
And Dad, he'll be with us.
That part's fun.
Well, get ready for another year in hand-me-down heaven.
Hey, lights out, my lovelies.
Sweet dreams.
Beezus?
It's sort of scary having a hole in the house... don't you think?
- Beezus.
- Shh. I'm trying to sleep.
Beezus, did you hear that growling?
It's probably just your stomach, doofus.
Unless-
Unless it's something... else.
Beezus, stop it.
- Like a ferocious, hungry-
- Stop! slithering beast that feeds on pests with bad report cards.
- Ah!
You're too easy.
Beezus, it's not funny.
I thought it was.
Bring it up.
Let me get a pen, write it down.
- Both girls get carrots and sandwiches.
- Okay.
Beezus wants hers in a Ziploc, and Ramona insists on having tin foil.
She claims it affects the taste, but I think she just likes making sculptures with it.
What else? Ramona wants a hard-boiled egg if we have any.
Think fast.
Please tell me you're gonna remember all this.
Look at me- fully domesticated.
I've lined up Mrs. Kemp to watch Roberta at noon.
- all you have to do is go nail this interview today.
- How do I look?
- I'd give you the job.
- Really?
I'd take it.
- Ew!
- Ew!
Ramona, did I ever show you the proper way... to crack a hard-boiled egg?
Mm-mmm.
Hmm-hmm.
You are so weird.
- A guy's gotta get his protein somehow.
- See, I got this stuff down.
Hey, Ramona, wait up!
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye-bye!
- Nice doodles.
They're not doodles. They're sketches.
My dad's extremely sketchy.
- Is everyone in their seats?
I'm about to round the corner.
And good morning.
I trust you all survived the weekend with most of your limbs intact.
It's time we tackle our class reports.
Tell us about something special in your life... using at least one word from our vocabulary list.
This is my ballet tiara.
Ooh.
This is a saddle for riding camels.
It's special to me because I'm going to wear my tiara... when I audition for the part of the princess in the Royal Peanut Butter commercials.
And it's special because my Uncle Hobart gave it to me.
I think I'd be extraordinary in the role.
E-X-T-R-A-O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y.
And he travels all over the world... taking pictures of animals in their natural habitat.
H-A-B-I-T-A-T.
Extraordinary.
That's when you take something... ordinary...
- and give it a little extra.
- So, does anybody wanna sit on it?
- Yeah!
- Okay, Ramona, let's hear it.
- Why, thank you, Mrs. Meacham.
- Shh.
Mute button. Mute button.
What am I doing? I'm muting you.
Ramona, go on.
Well, the most special thing in my life... is that some nice workmen in blue helmets...
- came to my house this week-
- Shh.
- and chopped a great big hole in it.
But-But they did.
It was so big, I could see all of Portland.
Howie knows.
Howie came and jumped through the hole.
Um-
He did.
- That's enough now.
- I think the hole's in her head.
- Show's over, Ramona.
- She's such a liar.
- Mrs. Meacham, I'm not lying.
- Take your seat.
Go ahead. Take your seat. The purpose of this exercise is not to entertain us.
No embellishments, please.
Now, who would like to go next? Hands?
You saw them chop the hole in my house.
Actually, no. They pried it with crowbars.
Technically, they pried it.
That's what I meant.
Now Mrs. Meacham thinks I'm a liar... and she's gonna tell my mom and dad
I'm a big troublemaker tonight.
Well, you are sometimes.
I mean, technically, you are.
Maybe you should technically look for a new best frlend.
- Hey! How you doing there, chief?
Who's your girlfrlend?
G- I'm not his girlfrlend.
She's not my girlfrlend.
She's Ramona, and she lives over there.
Ramona.
# Ramona and Howie are sitting in a tree #
# They are K-l-S-S-l-N-G ##
Wait a second.
Ramona Quimby? Huh.
Hey, I'm Hobart. I'm Howie's favorite uncle.
No? Oh. Sorry.
Yeah. We all heard about it.
Oh, really? Well, how's that beautiful
Aunt Beatrice of yours doing?
You be sure to tell her I'd love to catch up, all right?
Hey, Howie, how'd the saddle work out?
Did you get an "A "?
Dad? Does Aunt Bea really know some weird guy named Hobart?
Hobart? That's a name
I haven't heard in quite a while.
Yeah, they were high school sweethearts, old Hobart and Bea.
Him? But he's not even her type.
And what would that type be?
Perfect.
Hmm.
Oh, I'm afraid to look. Bills, bills, bills.
It never ends, Pickle.
Did you get the job today?
- Well, I didn't get this one.
- Oh.
'Cause I was thinking.
I've got the perfect job.
- What?
- You should be a fireman.
Oh. Yeah?
Yes. You would save people's lives... and climb gigantic ladders.
And if it was a night alarm... you would get to put your fire suit on over your pajamas.
- Whoa.
- It's true, Dad. I took a field trip.
Well, I wanna work in my pajamas... but I think you're overestimating my job skills a little bit.
I'm not that versatile.
- Dad.
- What?
I think you can do anything. Don't you?
Well-
- Hi! I'm home!
- We need to be there by 5:00, honey.
- Oh.
I've heard those parent-teacher meetings can be really boring.
They make your brain numb, they're that boring.
- Nice try, Ramona. We're going.
- Yeah. Good one, Pickle.
Honey, I wanna call the bank tomorrow and cancel the loan.
Bob, there's a gaping hole in the house.
I don't think we have much choice.
We're in over our heads.
Let's wait till we're on our feet.
Beezus, what are they talking about?
- We just have to finish it.
Hey. And if we default? I'd rather sell it than let the bank take the house.
Bank take the house. Bank take the house.
- Our house.
- Can we just talk about this later, Bob?
- Okay, fine.
- We're late.
- Mom, wait.
No more stalling. We're meeting with
Mrs. Meacham, end of story.
- Hmm?
- Be good, lovelies.
- Mwah!
- And be good for Aunt Bea tonight.
We're off to numb our brains.
Beezus, where's the bank gonna take our house?
It's just an expression, genius.
They don't take it anywhere.
- Oh.
- They just sell it to someone else.
- What?
- I got it.
- Hello. Oh, hi, Henry.
- Beezus, we can't move.
This is our house. We belong here.
I-I don't want us to leave Klickitat Street.
Ramona, I am on the phone.
Aunt Bea!
- Can I- Can I ask you something?
- Shh. Just a minute, babe.
- What's wrong?
- I just thought
I recognized someone out there.
Oh. You mean Hobart. Hmm.
Sounds like you've met him.
He said he wants to catch up with you.
You're kidding.
- He said that to you?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that's just- That's just classic.
Aunt Bea, can I ask you something?
I think the bank's gonna take our house.
- Aunt Bea?
- Huh?
- Are you listening?
- Hmm?
Oh. I'm sorry.
I just-
How do I put this?
- Um, you know those calluses on your hands?
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm. How the skin gets tough to protect a spot that got hurt?
I have one of those on my heart from a really long time ago.
And if he thinks he can just come back here and start picking at it... he is sadly mistaken.
I guess you're the only one left to talk to.
I'm sorry for pulling your tail when I was little... and for trying to teach you how to play catch... and for dressing you up as an astronaut.
- I know you're really old... so I'm gonna say this gently.
We're in a lot of trouble, Picky Picky.
We need money.
And we might lose our house.
- But don't worry, okay?
I'm gonna help.
Nobody thinks I can, but I can.
I can be extraordinary.
- I'm glad we agree.
Whoa.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Ramona, why is my desk on the lawn?
It's a secret.
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.
I'm saving the house for Mom and Dad.
Is that Great-Grandma's crystal?
Ramona, we never use that.
I know. We're gonna make so much money today, Beezus.
Now, if you wanna join the team...
I could always use a hard-working sales assoclate.
Um, is that "delicious"?
- Mm-hmm!
- Ah.
Ooh! Customer!
Customer!
Ramona, please, please, please, don't call him over-
Hey, Henry, you look thirsty!
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.
Hey, Beezus.
Hi.
- Selling lemonade?
- Yeah. Just helping out my little sister.
- Like the uniform?
Well, the last time I saw you in pajamas... we were playing sheep in the Christmas pageant.
But, yeah, it's a good look for you.
Huh. Right. Yeah. Baa! Baa!
But I think you spilled something on your shirt there.
- Oh.
- Gotcha.
Hello!
Delicious lemonade, anyone?
I- Yeah, I'll have one.
- You will?
- Yeah.
Well, that'll be one dollar, please.
Exact change preferred.
Oh, Ramona, Henry doesn't have to pay.
- Beezus, it's for the house.
- Uh, she meant "on the house."
No charge. Here.
- But, Beezus-
- Thank you.
- Beezus!
- Shh.
- Beezus!
- I said, shh.
- But, Beezus-
That won't taste- good.
Oh!
She's right.
No charge for that.
I wanna die! Just let me die!
I hate my life!
- Beezus?
- No. Go away.
Get out. Get out.
But... what did I do that was so bad?
You embarrassed me in front of Henry.
If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were actually trying to ruin my life.
You run around like a nutball.
You don't care what anybody thinks.
And you even stuck me with my stupid nickname.
But I was just a baby then... and I meant to call you Beatrice.
It just came out... wrong.
Yeah, tell me about it.
How can I be normal with a name like Beezus?
Who could ever love a girl named Beezus?
Jesus?
Get out!
Mrs. Pitt, would you care for a car wash today?
My car is in the shop today, dearie.
- Wash your car?
- Just washed it myself.
Please let me wash your car, please!
Are you the pizza man?
No.
Hey, babe.
Hey.
How's business?
- I'm considering retirement.
Ramona's not a quitter.
Mwah!
- Is he still out there?
Doesn't he have anything better to do than tinker with his precious Jeep?
Oh, look at him.
He thinks he can flash those hazel eyes and that smug little smile... and just reel me back in again.
- Reel you back in?
- Yeah.
- Like a sea bass.
- Ew.
- I know. Exactly.
Here's what we do.
We head straight to the house... looking confident and radiant... so Hobart gets a good look at everything he missed out on, okay?
- Okay.
- I'm so glad I wore my good jeans.
- Ready to strut?
- I think so.
- Hmm.
- But what if he tries to talk to us?
- We ignore him.
- Got it.
- Strut and ignore.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-mmm!
Keep up the good work.
- Mm-mmm-mmm.
- Mm-mmm.
- Excuse me.
- Oh!
Good, Bea. Real smooth.
How are you doing there, Beatrice?
- You got a little-
- No.
You gotta watch out for that cross traffic, ladies. What's the rush?
We're ignoring you.
Now, why would you wanna do that?
So nobody gets reeled in like a sea bass.
- Oh! Like the fish?
- Mm-hmm.
Huh. Well, we'll make sure that doesn't happen.
But it would be nice to find some time to catch up with your Aunt Bea.
I think we just did. Excuse us.
Keep struttin', Aunt Bea. You're doing good.
Hey, Ramona!
That Jeep of mine could sure use a wash, don't you think?
The poor thing's been sitting in the garage for 15 years now, Bea?
How much to hose her off?
Fifty dollars.
- Fifty d- No. No, no, no.
- Mm-hmm.
No, I would never take advantage of you like that, Ramona.
That Jeep is my pride and joy.
For you to wash it, and a "delishus" custom hand-wash at that...
I'm gonna have to insist on, uh-
I don't know- an even... hundred bucks?
Really?
Yeah. Really. Not a penny less.
One hundred dollars?
- Yeah.
- Whoo!
Oh, just, uh, one little condition.
Bea gets to chat with me.
Yeah, we can sit inside, like the old car washes.
- What do you say, Bea?
Like I said, it'd be nice to catch up.
Please, please, please.
How fast can you wash his car?
- Milady.
- Huh. I'm regretting this already.
- Oh.
It's like time stood still in here.
- I'd swear I was back in high school.
- Mm-hmm.
- The good old days.
I wouldn't mind going back for a while.
Maybe I could, you know, figure out where I messed up.
Oh, ancient history. I've moved on.
Yeah, I'll say.
Back off, Romeo.
- I think she likes me.
Don't bet on it.
Stay cool, Aunt Bea.
So I'll be heading off to Alaska in a few weeks.
After I get this thing up and running,
I am back on the road... and out of your hair for the next few years.
Well, my hair thanks you.
But it was inspired of you... bribing my niece just to talk to me,
Mr. Moneybags.
Well, a hundred bucks is a bargain.
Between you and me,
I was willing to go much higher.
Oh, really?
Times have changed.
This from the guy who bought me a ring for my sweet 16... straight from a gum ball machine.
- Oh, yeah. That's right.
- I even had to lend you the quarter.
Let's face it.
I wanted that ring to be real.
You always knew it was disposable.
Just you and me in a nutshell.
Yeah.
Coming through. Ooh!
What do we have here?
Oh, no!
- "You and Me Forever Mix"?
- Oh, Hobart!
Could these be the romantic stylings of the young Beatrice?
Oh, don't play it.
Oh, Hobart, that's embarrassing.
- Please don't play it.
- Of course I'm gonna play it.
- This is so embarrassing.
Uh-uh.
Oh!
Howie, help!
She's getting reeled in. Whoo!
- Howie!
- Ramona!
She's getting reeled in!
Oh, oh, oh!
Hobart, do something!
- I'm afraid to look.
No, no, no.
The surface was wet. He tried hosing it off.
How do we get it off without damaging the paint job underneath?
And if we bring it in, how much?
Ballpark?
What is that, hundreds?
- Thousands?
- No. No. Try this guy.
Well, this is gonna cost us a fortune.
Hello. I'd- Yes, I'll hold.
I- I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.
- You're sorry?
- Mm-hmm.
Uh, I'm sorry, because now that I'm looking at it from a distance...
I realize that I should be thanking you.
I mean, look at it. It's- It's camouflaged.
And from what I hear, the icy Alaskan terrain looks- looks just like that.
So I can just sneak right up on those polar bears.
I don't even have to get out of my Jeep.
Well, I'm- I'm glad you like it?
- I love it.
- Hey, Hobart, are you crazy?
- You're not gonna leave it like that.
- No, no, no. No, no.
I paid for something "delishus," and look what I got- an Easter egg.
What do you think, Bea?
That a good look for me?
Hmm.
Sure.
It might even bring out your sensitive side.
Next time we clean the neighbor's garage... it's coming out of your allowance, not mine, Picasso.
For your records, my dear.
Now I have less money than I started with... and I started with zero.
How about you focus on things around the house instead?
Like being a good helper, getting along with your sisters.
I can feed Roberta, Mommy.
Don't worry about a thing. I'll do it.
Here's the peas and a spoon.
Work some magic.
That's my girl.
Ooh, look!
Here comes the... intergalactic space lava.
Ramona, she's an infant. She doesn't know what intergalactic space lava is.
- I don't even know what that is.
- Oh, you butt out, Beez-
Uh, I mean, thank you for your feedback.
I love feedback.
Love it.
- Any progress today?
Yeah. I, um- I got a couple of leads, but...
I don't know if I'm executive material anymore.
Could be time to try something else.
- Like what?
- Fireman! Fireman, fireman.
Fireman.
I don't know.
You know, something creative.
Uh- I used to be a creative guy.
Yeah, well... if you find a job that pays you to be creative and have fun... then maybe you can give them my resume too.
Guess what! It's picture day tomorrow.
Oh! That's good.
Seeing your picture always cheers me up.
Me too.
And I'll make sure it's the best picture ever, ever.
It'll be... dazzling.
We expect nothing less.
Say "peas. "
"Peas, please."
Mom, I got Roberta to eat her peas.
Yummy peas.
- Hmm, hmm.
That is disgus-
I mean... what a darling little sister.
I wish there were 10 of you.
"Royal Peanut Butter.
There's a bit of magic in every jar."
Is that one of your favorites?
That's the racket we gotta get you into.
'Cause those TV kids make millions.
Beezus, do you think
I could be in a commercial like that?
- Sure. You'd make a great frog.
- Hey.
- Hold still. I'm almost done.
It's picture perfect, right?
Let's be realistic, Ramona.
This is a curling iron, not a magic wand.
But all things considered,
I'd say you've never looked better.
I love it!
Thanks, Beezus.
Ribbit!
How your mom kept things running so smooth beats me.
Dad, since the room's almost done... have you decided who's gonna get it for sure?
Why? You know somebody who's interested?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, let me think about it,
'cause I like your persistence.
Yes. The answer's still no.
Okay.
Wow. You are definitely dazzling, Pickle.
- all right, go smile big and make us proud.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Beezus. Bye, Roberta.
So I'm gonna take this... and stick it right in the mouth to make it look like fire.
Whoa. You look fancy, Susan.
My mother helped me pick out the perfect ensemble.
She's in real estate, so she knows a little something about presentation.
She could help you too, Ramona, if you want a consultation.
- My mom lets me pick out my own clothes.
- We can tell.
Excuse me. What are you doing?
I'm loading my grape-a-pult. Watch and learn.
And what was the purpose of that?
The question is, can anybody top it?
Have you ever seen the proper way to crack a hard-boiled egg?
Take notes if you want to, Susan.
- Say cheese.
Next.
- Say "cheese."
- Better just smile then, nice and big.
Next.
- Say "cheese."
- Egg in her hair?
- That's a new one.
- Next.
- Say "cheese."
- Cheese.
How come you always tell us to say "cheese"?
- Don't you get tired of "cheese"?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Next.
- Say... "peas."
- Ew!
Just when you thought it was safe to open the mail.
I'm sorry about that raw egg, kiddo.
I guess I really messed that one up.
- I look like a troll.
- No, you don't.
Yeah, she totally does.
Hey. Maybe it's not "terrifical. "
But this is definitely a keeper.
This is going in my wallet.
Come on. You wanna help me fold?
I'd just mess it up, Dad.
Admit it. I'm a nuisance.
- You are not a nuisance.
- Mrs. Meacham says I'm a nuisance.
- And she's a professional.
- You know what I think?
You just have so much energy, sometimes it gets away from you.
I'm not saying that energy's bad.
It's just you gotta learn how to control it.
I mean, come on, let's be honest here.
Two months ago, you couldn't trust me with the laundry, and now?
- Doesn't that look good?
- Yeah.
Yeah. all right.
You just gotta try, kiddo.
We're both gonna turn this around.
Just keep trying, kiddo.
- Okay.
- That's my girl!
- Hey. Whoa! Let me help you there.
- Morning doughnut.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
- Who would like to put this up?
- And what does that spell?
- Delicious.
Bye!
I'll miss you guys!
- Whoo!
Sweetie, you should come and celebrate with us.
- What am I celebrating?
- Well, you've been working so hard... we thought you'd be kind of excited about getting your own room.
T-minus three, two, one, blastoff!
- Ramona!
Stop making so much noise.
Sorry. I'm just enjoying my new room.
Stop gloating. It's not polite.
I'm not gloating. I'm bouncing.
Well, if you want your junk, you better go grab it now.
Anything left over goes to Goodwill.
Remember me, Ramona? Baa!
- Stop!
- Help me!
Give it back.
- Baa!
- Give it back.
- So, what do you think?
Uh. That's far enough.
This is a no-pest zone.
Well, who needs you... or your dumb teenager room?
- I like it by myself.
- Uh-huh. Sure you do.
When the lights go out, and then you start thinking... about all the noises and the monsters... and then you realize you didn't check under your bed... not carefully... don't come knocking on my door.
If you make it that far.
- Slithering beast... that feeds on pests with bad report cards.
Picky Picky?
Ramona, come on. Let's go. We're late.
Dad, what's another word for "sick"?
Um, queasy? Nauseous?
Like really, really sick?
Oh. Bilious.
Dad, I feel bilious.
I don't think school's a good call right now.
Oh. You're in a suit.
Do you have an interview?
Well, yeah, but I can change it if we have to.
Are you queasy sick or achy sick?
Well, I'm kind of feeling better now.
You sure?
Okay, well, let's go.
We got, like, 60 seconds.
- Fast, like a fireman.
57- Come on.
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye!
Hey, Ramona!
You've gotta see this. Come on.
- What?
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Here. Check this out.
- Hobart!
- Yeah?
Mind where you're digging.
We've got sprinkler pipes down there.
Oh, is that what I keep hitting?
Don't worry, Mom. Relax. It's okay.
Oh!
- Good talk.
- What do you think he's doing?
Maybe he's digging a secret tunnel to Istanbul.
A spy network right through your very own backyard.
Or maybe this house was built on an old burial ground... and I'm unlocking an ancient curse.
Open call?
That means anybody can audition, right?
Mm-hmm.
Ramona, they don't want just anybody.
They want a princess.
- A million dollars.
- Take out your instruments. Good. all right. Grab a seat, kids.
Let's shake this rust out and start jammin'.
One, two, three, four.
Yeah! Yeah, you guys are tight!
Ramona!
Why did you do that?
I can't help it. They're mesmerizing.
But you've been doing it since kindergarten, and it's getting old.
Look, I know things must be rough at home... but don't take it out on my curls.
Okay. Hold on a second, guys. That was good.
That was almost the song.
So, um, guitars, quick rehearsal.
Everybody else, take five.
Ramona!
What was that about? "Rough at home"?
- Well, your dad lost his job, didn't he?
- Maybe.
Look, when people lose their jobs, you know, they start fighting... and then they get a divorce and sell their houses.
It's textbook.
Look at the bright side, Ramona.
I mean, after my dad got laid off, my mom sold her house... got a real estate license, so there's a plus.
And then my dad got a new car and moved to Tacoma.
Tacoma?
Susan, I'm so sorry.
Well, now on my birthdays, they both give me checks, so it works out.
Okay.
Hey, Ramona?
Would you mind taking your seat again?
What are you doing by the window there?
I was-
I was wondering, where is Tacoma?
- Repulsive.
- Oh, boy.
- all right. You can all go to lunch now.
- Ew!
Are you-
Ramona, why are you wearing pajamas?
'Cause firemen do it that way?
I see.
Well, pajamas under your clothes and eggs in your hair.
You and your father are breaking new ground together.
You get comfortable in there.
Come on.
- Oh!
Come on!
You're kidding me.
Try this one.
Okay. No, no. That's no good.
I think this one's gonna be good.
How'd the interview go today, Daddy?
Well, I had to cancel the interview when the nurse called.
But there's other jobs out there.
Hey, we're not gonna let one bad day get us down.
Let's do somethin'... really special.
Just me and you.
What would you like to do? Think big.
Well, you know that big bridge we took when we went to Washington State?
- Yeah.
- I've always wanted to stop in the middle... and have one foot in Oregon and one in Washington.
- Hmm?
- That way my Legs have dual citizenship.
I like it.
That's interesting. Interesting notion.
Not practical because the car's kaput... but you're on the right track.
I mean, it's bold, it's daring, it's fairly inexpensive.
Come on. Give me- What else?
We could draw it.
Oh! I've got an idea.
Let's me and you draw the longest picture in the world.
What do you think?
Okay.
I'm gonna draw our house, and then I'm gonna draw Howie's house... and school and Mount Hood... and everything else as far as I can see.
- Daddy?
- Hmm?
I think you draw better than anybody in the whole world.
Oh. Well, thank you, Pickle.
You know, I studied art back in the day, as they say.
What happened?
Did you get a bad report card?
No.
Beezus came along.
Then I took the best job I could, and before you know it...
I was a vice president.
- Then I came along?
- Yep. That's right.
And then Roberta.
But I wouldn't change a thing.
You girls make my life very colorful.
- Hi. Hey, Beezus.
- Hey.
- Wanna walk home?
- Sure.
Cool.
Oh, man.
When we were kids, I thought your dad was, like, the king of Klickitat Street.
Do you remember that gorilla hunt in my backyard... when he made us set up the tents and wait there all night... with bananas and butterfly nets?
You ended up with mashed bananas in your hair.
I had poison ivy all over me.
But it was also-
- The best time we had that whole summer.
- Hands down.
Yeah, well, he's not as funny these days.
Why? What's going on?
He lost his job a few weeks ago... and he acts like he's not worried, for our sake, but I can tell he is.
And he should be.
What if he doesn't get something that he likes?
What if he has to settle for something that he hates... because of... us?
Beezus, that's a big deal.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.
I don't know. Sometimes... things feel different between us.
Like it's not as easy to talk to you as it used to be, you know?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. A little.
- It's not that I don't want to talk to you-
- No, no. I get you.
- It's just very different.
- Different.
Exactly.
Oh, gosh.
Um- Yeah.
Thank you.
- You should probably button that.
- Oh.
Yeah. It's good to know some things never change.
- Since my last report had some holes in it-
Mrs. Meacham gave me a do-over.
So, may I present to you... the longest picture in the world.
- Wow.
- Ooh.
Excuse me, but what about the paintings in those big churches in Europe?
I mean, aren't they longer?
Yeah, but that's Europe.
I mean, I'm talkin' about the whole world.
Susan, you may save your comments for later.
- Ramona, go ahead.
My dad made this with me.
He could have been an artist when he was younger... but he decided to be my dad.
And he's teaching me how to draw, too, which means he's patient.
- P-A-T-I-E-N-T?
- Mm-hmm.
But you really need to see it close up, so come and enjoy the view.
# Dream a little dream with me
Singin' la-la-la, la-la-la #
Who can see themselves in here?
# Maybe we can find the edge of the world#
# Oh, maybe we can find the edge of the world ##
Uh, "Looking for a princess in Portland"?
Branding. They'll eat it up.
Yeah?
Well, wait till they see this.
Every princess needs a little sparkle.
Just mix this up.
We have three little girls.
We have to be realistic.
- I can't wait another 10 years of my life.
- It's not settling!
But what about the kids?
They've got school, we got the mortgage.
- Unbelievable.
- Wait!
- Oh!
Okay there, Sticky Picky.
I know you're old and creaky, too, but this is my bed tonight. Come on.
- Okay? Come on. Come on.
Good man.
- Dad, it's Picky Picky.
- Hey.
Dad, are you and Mom getting a divorce?
No.
This is like a time-out for the night.
Come on.
We'll both be happily married in the morning.
- Mwah! Go to bed.
- Okay.
Dad, don't worry.
Things are gonna change for us.
I have a plan.
Now I am worried.
- Look, Mom! It's the ice cream man!
- Hey. You sure this is what you want?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for the ride, Mr. Kemp.
- No problem.
You know, you are allowed to call me Hobart if you want.
No, thank you, Mr. Kemp.
This is strictly a business relationship.
- Okay.
- Wow! Good for you.
- all right.
- At least one of us is showing a little restraint.
- Ha-ha.
- Break a leg, superstar.
- Okay.
Next is Ruby Hirsch.
Hey, Susan.
Wow. You look great.
Hello, Ramona.
Susan! How could you be a princess without your tiara?
- Hi, Mrs. Kushner.
- Hello, Ramona.
Okay. Let's go. That looks beautiful.
Excuse me! Aunt Bea, I need a tiara!
- It takes a real man to be able to drive around in this.
Oh, by the way, I talked to my publisher.
He found me an apartment in Anchorage.
Very spacious. Got great views.
Room for two.
Well.
Maybe you can find a nice polar bear to cuddle up with.
Eh, Alaska could be fun, Bea.
I mean, it is still the last great frontier.
You know that, right?
Mm-hmm.
Plus, it's only a two-year commitment.
Commitment was never your thing.
Okay. Now, that's just not fair.
Bea, you've gotta give me a chance here.
Come on.
I've been traveling the world for over 10 years trying to get you out of my head.
- And you know what?
- What?
It ain't workin'.
I didn't come here for this stupid Jeep.
I came here for you.
Come with me.
Next is- whoa-
Ramona Quimby.
My goodness.
That's quite the tiara you have there.
I designed it in the parking lot.
- So tell me, why are you here today?
'Cause my dad says that commercials are the racket to be in.
Hmm. Twirl.
Twirl.
Okay. Thank you, Ramona.
- Don't move.
A tiara made of burrs?
It would have worked, Dad, until I fell into their stupid sandwich.
- Sandwich?
- Ow!
- I won't even ask.
- Ow! You're doing it too fast!
'Cause I'm late, Ramona. Very late.
Sorry.
How's it look? Kinda trendy?
Oh. Yes, well, that's one way of putting it.
- Listen up, ladies.
I got a two-hour drive to get to this interview... so I need you to be responsible till your mom gets home.
You have her number at the office if there's a problem... but remember, she's under a lot of stress, so no fighting, okay?
Beezus, you're in charge. Baby monitor.
How come she's always in charge?
Um, have you seen your hair lately?
- Imagine what you'd do to our house.
- Hey!
Just try to be good- especially you.
- Bye!
"Especially you. "
Ramona, I don't think making dinner is gonna distract Mom from your hair.
- It's worth a shot.
Quimby residence. Oh, hi, Henry.
I'm not sure if Beezus is available.
- Give it to me! Stop! Give it to me!
- She could be in the bathroom.
- Go away, you jerk!
- Wait. What did you say?
- No, not you, Henry!
- Ow!
You put him on speaker, doofus!
- I'm Beezus! I love Henry!
- Shut up!
Should I call back later?
- No! I want you!
- Huh?
I mean, I wanna talk to you right now, so now is a good time!
- Okay.
- Get off!
My hot dog souffle!
Stop!
- Ramona!
- Ramona, move!
Stop! Stop that! Drop it!
- No!
- I said, drop it!
You will never change, will you?
For a moment there,
I actually thought that you were maturing... but you will always be a little pest!
- I'll go get her.
- No! Just stop!
Stop touching everything!
Everything that you touch you mess up... including my love life.
You have a love life?
Just feed the cat and leave me alone!
Uh, hello?
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.
Picky Picky?
It's dinnertime.
- Come on.
Let's talk.
Wake up.
Wake up, lazy bum.
- Beezus!
- Beezus?
I thought he was asleep, but he's not.
What now?
He's dead.
Picky Picky's dead.
Don't worry. Mom will be home soon.
She'll know what to do.
No. Remember what Dad said?
We can't make any trouble for Mom now.
Okay.
He was a Quimby before we were, Beezus.
Picky Picky...
I hope you have nine lives.
And maybe tomorrow... you can wake up as somebody else's cat... start a new life.
I really hope they feed you melon rind sometimes.
I know you like that.
I think it's important... that you know...
Dad was just pretending to forget your name.
He always knew it.
He really did love you.
We'll miss you, Picky Picky.
It's okay.
You girls had to handle all this tonight by yourselves?
I'm sorry.
We're okay, Mom.
How did I get so lucky to have two brave girls like you?
Hmm?
I'm home!
We have some news.
So do l. I got the job.
What?
Great position.
Start-up in eastern Oregon.
How do you girls feel about that?
Wait. To live there?
Mm-hmm.
But what about the house?
We'll get a new one there.
What's your news?
Nothing.
Ramona?
Will you sleep in here with me tonight?
I'm not ready for a new school... with all new kids.
Me neither.
But you'll do fine.
You don't always embarrass yourself like I do.
You're the most prettiest, perfect girl in high school... and everybody loves you.
Ramona, those people don't know who I am, really.
There's only one person in that whole school who really knows me.
- Henry?
- Yeah.
And that took 15 years.
Who else is gonna wanna waste 15 years getting to know me?
I would.
Ramona...
I know that you think being different is bad... but it's not.
You don't worry about coloring inside the lines, you know?
Huh?
You're your own person.
You don't care what other people think.
It's brave being how you are.
Oh.
Well... sometimes I color inside the lines.
It really depends on the picture.
Yeah.
All right.
So, how does this look?
It's perfect. Yeah, it's great.
Why does it have to be Susan's mom?
She's supposed to be a very good agent, sweetheart.
- That's great. Ta-da!
Aren't you gonna help us, Ramona?
We only have a few hours to do this.
I don't wanna help sell the house.
I wanted to save it.
Are you gonna fill these holes before you go?
Howie wants to do it.
Why don't you get your boyfrlend Hobart to help?
- He likes to dig.
- Isn't that the truth?
Now he wants me to go with him to Alaska.
Last night, he sent roses.
Alaska? Did you say yes?
I mean, I was tempted... but if I'm gonna uproot my entire life...
I need some real sign of commitment.
- I'm sorry, Bea.
- Oh, no. Don't be.
We had our fight, and now he's running away again.
In the long run,
I saved myself a massive heartache... and just replaced it with a... small one.
Ramona, grab a hose and help out, okay?
I know life stinks, but we still have to make the yard look good.
Everything will be okay, babe.
Onwards and upwards.
- Oh!
Oh, I see! Very funny.
Who did that? Bea? That's just adorable.
Classy, Bea. Very classy.
Now I gotta go inside and change all my clothes.
Real nice.
- Bea.
Ah!
That's for the roses, sweetheart.
They need water.
Oh! There it is! Exhibit "A"!
The class clown hasn't changed at all!
Oh, really?
Okay. That's how it is, huh?
Howie! Willa Jean!
Mom!
- Ladies, I need backup!
- Find a garden hose!
- Okay. Come on.
I hope you get frostbite in Alaska!
Be strong. Be strong, Willa Jean.
Be strong!
Get' em!
- Oh!
- Yeah! Now what? Now what?
Aunt Bea!
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.
- Whoo!
I think we won. I think we won!
- Give me some! Whoo-hoo!
Nice job, you guys. You were animals!
Whoo-hoo!
Look who's crying now!
My pipes! I told you, my pipes!
- What's all the shouting about?
- Landscaping.
Oh!
What? Uh-
Hobart was right!
It's an ancient curse!
Oh!
What?
I knew it was around here somewhere!
Bea! Bea, come here. Come here.
Come here, come here, come here, come here.
Oh, Beatrice,
I buried this baby a long time ago... and I figured I'd find it again someday when I was ready.
I still wish that I could go back and fix... all the stupid things I did when we were younger.
I guess this is as close as I can get.
You kept all this stuff?
Yeah.
That's my gum ball ring.
Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else without you.
I love you.
Will you marry me?
You will?
- Whoo!
- Guts!
My head is spinning!
We must be crazy! We'll have to go to the courthouse and make it official.
No, we ain't goin' to no stinking courthouse.
If we're gonna do something crazy, we're gonna do it with style.
We're gonna throw a real wedding.
- Honey, they want you in Alaska in three days.
- That's plenty of time.
Sure. But what about a church or food... or, say, a wedding dress?
You can use mine.
You always said you liked it.
- We can just alter it.
- Yeah! See? I like that idea.
- There you go!
- Hand-me-downs. It never ends, Ramona.
Yeah. We get the word out, we book a band... boom- we got a wedding!
People can bring their own food, their own chairs.
All we need is a little love and a few bridesmaids.
Oh! I've always wanted to be a bridesmaid.
Ah! Well, that was easy. Anybody else?
- Ramona? Ramona?
- What do you say? Will you do us the honor?
Ramona?
Sea bass!
- See what?
- Oh, it's an inside joke. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You said you wouldn't get reeled in.
You said I would always have you around!
Hey, Ramona? Get back here and apologize.
- Honey, please come talk to me.
You have room for a piano.
Also, look at this built-in desk.
It's fabulous.
Here.
- Ramona?
- Stuff that's to go around here, right?
Ramona!
Help, anybody!
- Oh, Ramona!
- Whoa, whoa!
- Got you! I got you! Come on, honey.
- Okay. Hold on.
- We got you!
We saw your underpants.
- Hey, enough.
Hey, enough.
Stop the teasing. Go outside.
Happens all the time. Thank you.
Okay, Ramona, that's it.
These antics of yours gotta stop right now.
You're making our lives really difficult.
I thought I made it colorful, Dad.
- Not in the middle of our open house. Come on!
You said you were gonna be more responsible.
It's time to grow up.
Dad, can't you see I'm trying?
- Well, you gotta try harder.
- Dad?
- Mrs. Meacham's on the phone.
She needs to talk to you.
- Oh, great. What now?
Sweetie.
- Ramona, your father was just-
- Mom!
I'm nine years old.
I think I can tell when I'm not wanted.
- I just have to run away.
- Ramona, don't be silly.
You're not gonna run away.
- No, I mean it.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
How long will you be gone?
I mean, just in case people start asking.
Forever.
Well, in that case,
I think you're gonna need a bigger suitcase.
Okay. Now, I've added your dad's old sweater.
I don't want you to get cold at night.
It's a little big on you now, but you'll eventually grow into it.
Oh, and do you plan on brushing your teeth?
That's my girl.
I packed your toothbrush and your toothpaste.
Okay?
Just promise me that you'll brush your teeth every single night.
There you go. all righty.
Don't forget to write.
- Huh?
- Hmm?
- Daddy.
Gettin' on or not?
Ramona?
Sweetie? Ramona?
M-Mom?
- Ramona?
- Mom!
Yes. Where are you?
- Can you hear me? Mom?
- Ramona, sweetie?
You made my bag heavy on purpose.
Well, what else was I supposed to do, huh?
I'd be just lost without my Ramona.
I'm sorry.
I just thought you all would be better off without me.
You don't think we'd let you get away that easy, do you? You're a Quimby for life.
- Ah!
I hope nobody I know sees us out here.
We're so weird.
In sickness and in health.
- For richer or for poorer.
- For richer or for poorer.
And I promise my love to you.
And I promise my love to you.
And I promise my love to you.
May I have the rings, please?
- Pull it off.
- Well-
Don't panic, folks. It's only plastic.
Ramo-
Oh. Babe?
Ah. Look at you.
- Nice work, Ramona.
Hobart, that's- That's n-
That's- That's real.
Yeah, and I still owe you that quarter.
And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life trying to pay it back.
Thank you.
Hobart, you may kiss the bride.
All right, Beatrice.
This song is dedicated to you from Hobart.
Hey, buddy.
Okay.
One, two. There we go. That's good.
- Hey, Beezus, I've been looking for you.
- Oh, hi.
- Nice wedding, huh?
- Yeah.
Um-
Okay, listen. Um, Beezus.
I know that you're moving, and that's bad.
But in a way it's also good, because...
I would never have the guts to say this if you weren't.
So...
I don't think of you as a frlend.
No, I mean- No. That came out wrong.
- I mean, I think about you, like, a lot, all the time.
It's just- Oh, no. You're laughing.
Why are you laughing?
Um- No, I'm sorry.
I'm listening. I am. It's just-
You've got something on your shirt.
Oh-
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Um, we should probably go dance while we can...
'cause the band has a curfew, so-
- Oh.
- Yeah, let's dance. Okay.
- I think it's time for the father-daughter dance.
You did a wonderful job today, Pickle.
You were a perfect bridesmaid.
Thank you.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
What were you and Mrs. Meacham just talking about?
'Cause whatever I did wrong,
I probably didn't mean it.
Well, believe it or not, we weren't talking about you at all.
Really?
Yeah, she was talking about an opening... for an art teacher at your school next term.
Remember when she called the house the other day?
Well, she told me that she passed that mural of ours on to the principal... who mentioned it to the superintendent.
Long story short, it's crummy pay, it's part-time.
I hear some of those kids down at your school can be a real handful.
Oh!
But I'm thinking I'm gonna take it.
Oh, my gosh!
That's better than a fireman!
- I know.
Mm-hmm!
- I owe it all to you, Ramona.
You told me I could do anything.
It took me this long to believe it.
You really did save us, kiddo.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
- Whew!
- Beezus! Beezus!
We don't have to move anymore!
- M mm. Mmm.
- Mrs. Meacham!
- Yes.
- I don't have to move anymore.
- I know.
We'll be together for the rest of the year.
I shall pace myself accordingly.
Thanks for helping my dad.
I just passed along the mural.
You're the one who inspired it.
I may not be an art critic, but I certainly know something "terrifical" when I see it.
Oh!
Go on, now.
- Shake your booty.
- Okay.
- Oh! Bye!
- Oh, bye, Mom.
- I'll call you from Alaska.
- Okay.
Drive safely.
- Wait! Don't go yet!
- Don't go yet, Aunt Bea!
So you can always have me around.
Ramona, you're extraordinary.
- Bye!
- Bye!
- We love you!

MARMADUKE:  High school.
Look familiar? Yeah.
Being a teenager, it can be rough,
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But if you're a teenager, and the world doesn't fit you, you're totally hosed!
¶ Oh, Mr. Pit...
Oh, Mr. Pit...
¶ Mr. Pitiful
¶ Who let you down?
¶ Who let you down?
Who let you down?
MARMADUKE:  And the harder you try to fit in, the more awkward it gets.
¶ Oh, Mr. Pit...
Oh, Mr. Pit...
¶ Mr. Pitiful
¶ Who let you down?
MARMADUKE:
Look at this poor guy.
Brutal!
¶ Who let you down?
Who let you down? ¶
MARMADUKE: But if you think being a big, awkward teenager is about the worst thing that can happen to you, try being a 200-pound teenage dog with a radar dish wrapped around your neck!
Oh, yeah, that'll make me real popular.
Luckily, they're easy to take off.
Watch this.
PHIL: Marmaduke!
(GRUNTS) Told you!
PHIL: Where are you?
Hold your horses.
I'm Marmaduke, by the way.
I get yelled at a lot.
Come on, let's meet the fam.
The two-leggers.
You're gonna love them.
Here I come!
This little Padawan here is Brian.
Like most kids his age, he loves to hang out with me.
Come on, buddy.
I can't see!
Yeah, I'm pretty busy myself.
I'll catch you later.
And this social butterfly here is Barbara.
She loves to play ball with me.
Okay, Barb, you throw and I catch.
He can be like that.
Not like that.
Is somebody cooking?
Food!
Debbie's pretty cool, and my main food hook-up.
She slips me a steak here, some turkey there.
Which is why I think she doesn't even care when I help myself.
Come to daddy.
Ahhh! Hot cheese!
Oh, hot cheese!
DEBBIE: Marmaduke!
MARMADUKE:
The little one's Sarah.
How cute is she?
And she's my biggest fan.
You know, it's important for them to get exercise at this age, so I try to take her for a walk every day.
She's got a great laugh, doesn't she?
Then there's my owner, Phil.
He's a marketing guy for a local pet food company.
I call him
Doctor No sometimes,
'cause it's nothing but rules with him.
No slobbering.
No barking.
No tackling the mailman.
Here, let's see if he says no to this awesome hole I'm digging.
Marmaduke, no!
See? Doctor No in the house.
Why don't you just give it a chance?
I will find China!
(EXCLAIMS) What you're doing is cruel and unusual.
I hate water.
Come on. Sit.
Look, everybody's got a weakness.
Sit.
Mine's water.
It's my kryptonite.
Sit.
Not sitting in this tub.
Sit, sit, sit.
Sit, Marmaduke!
What can I say?
I'm a sucker for the kid.
Bye-bye.
Phil hates that.
Hey, Sarah, where you going?
Stay.
There's nothing good about getting a bath, except for this!
Come on, Phil!
Not again.
Marmaduke!
Let's go! (WHOOPS)
Marmaduke!
I like to give Phil a little exercise, too.
He's cooped up in the office all day.
Come on, Phil.
That's the spirit!
PHIL: Get back here!
MARMADUKE: Over here!
Come here, through here, Phil!
I'm over here!
Yeah, come on!
PHIL: Not this time...
You don't grab a tiger by the tail!
PHIL: Marmaduke!
MARMADUKE:
Someone call the ASPCA!
We got a crazy dog on the loose!
Freedom!
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?
MARMADUKE: (GROANING)
Would it kill them to install a new dog door?
I was two months old when they got this.
I guess I had more pull before the growth spurt.
Cue flashback.
BARBARA:
Oh, he's so cute!
MARMADUKE: (CHUCKLES)
See? Insanely cute.
Look at that lovable little Marma-pup.
Come here, you!
But when you grow up into this, I get it.
Not pretty.
I'd ignore me, too.
PHIL: Get back here!
Hey, I'm talking here!
Anyway, I try not to hold things against Phil.
After all, he's only human.
That's why I make it a point to never go to bed hungry.
Let's see what we've got.
Sausage from last week's barbecue, gonna need to let that breathe a few days.
This is our shot.
California, the big leagues.
In the big leagues, they take steroids and cheat with supermodels.
It's a marketing job with an organic pet food company.
I think we'll be okay.
Pepperoni pizza.
Phil's loafer?
No, I'll save it for dessert.
And that,
I have no idea what that is.
Aren't we okay in Kansas?
Is that what we wanna be?
Just okay?
MARMADUKE:
Coming in for a landing.
I wanna give you and the kids the life you deserve.
I want a bigger house with a bedroom that doesn't smell like a meat-locker.
This is our shot.
Well, if this is our shot, then we should take it.
But you have to tell the kids.
Done.
Give me that.
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, I wasn't done with that!
You don't have to worry,
I've got my supermodel right here.
Wow!
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Marmaduke!
Marmaduke!
What did you eat?
I know it's juvenile, but it's all I've got.
So, there you have it.
Day in the life of old Marmaduke, here.
It's really bad!
MARMADUKE:
Guys, I am sorry.
That was a little much, even for me.
Bad Marmaduke.
All right, enough.
Lights out.
(CHANTING) Waffles, waffles, waffles, waffles, waffles!
Yes!
Saturday morning waffles!
Got to love the Debster!
CARLOS:
Take it easy, man!
A waffle is to be savored, not inhaled!
Hey, this is my step-bro, Carlos, by the way.
Say hey, Carlos.
Hey, Carlos.
He's pretty cool for a cat, which helps, since he's basically my only friend.
You ready for a bombshell?
Lay it on me.
Phil just told everybody he got a new job.
We're moving to the O.C.!
Shut up! Really?
No lie! I was so shocked,
I hacked that thing up.
Carlos, that's gross!
I know it's gonna take time to adjust, honey, but you'll make so many new friends there.
I think it sounds kind of cool.
What do you care?
All you do is play video games.
This is so unfair!
MARMADUKE: I got to say,
I'm with Barbara on this one.
You know how many bones
I buried in the backyard?
Guys, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
We'll have a big new house with a pool and a company car.
Pets are always the last to find out!
I don't even know where the O.C.'s at!
Okay, what's the deal?
Is it something I said?
SUMMER ON TV:
Something you weren't supposed to say.
Does anyone even own a pet in this place?
I haven't seen a single dog so far.
It's kind of hard to forgive you if you don't mean it...
Oh! She's fine.
Okay, so far, all I've learned about
The O.C. is that no one has a pet and Seth, here, is a total drama queen.
You're the biggest drama queen,  amigo.
(SCOFFS) Me?
That's you, Carlos.
You're, like,
200 pounds of drama, with a red collar!
Oh, really?
This conversation is over.
No, no, no!
Ejector seat.
Never fails.
And so, moving day arrived.
And there was a feeling of hope and excitement for the whole family.
Even Barbara was trying to lend a hand.
BARBARA: That's mine...
MARMADUKE:
Carlos and I would have pitched in, too,
(ANGRILY) but we were being shipped air freight and on lockdown!
Hey, let me out of here.
I'm not an animal!
Oh, yeah, I am.
Look what I got.
Debbie's meatballs!
That's my man, Phil!
There you go.
CARLOS: Looking out for his own.
I don't know, Carlos.
Something's fishy here.
(MUFFLED) It's
Debbie's meatballs, man.
Don't question it!
Oh! I know
I shouldn't eat it, but I can't help it.
Good boy! Good boy!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I feel a little funny.
CARLOS: This is a horrible mistake.
I requested executive class!
I think Phil put something in our meatballs!
Have you ever looked at your paws?
I mean, really looked at them?
Yeah, yeah.
I followed you on many adventures.
But into the great unknown mystery,
I will go first,  amigo.
CARLOS: Timber!
Down and out.
¶ California, here we come
¶ Right back where we started from
¶ California!
¶ California! ¶
MARMADUKE: Wake up!
I'm up, I'm up!
Come on, Phil, let's do it!
Same dog, different floor.
Yes! New city, new house, new smells!
Good morning,
Orange County!
Oh, yeah.
Hang on a second.
Did you check out that doggie door?
It fits! It fits!
Oh! Look at this.
It's got an ocean view!
And a pool!
This grass is so green!
And this, by far, the nicest bathroom
I've ever had.
Speaking of which, a little privacy, please.
Oh, yeah, brown collar.
Good, that'll bring out my eyes.
Come on, Phil, let's go!
Is that weird that your boss wants to meet you at the dog park?
That's how they roll in Cali.
Don's a bit eccentric, but that's what makes him so successful.
MARMADUKE: Come on,
Phil, shake a leg!
Easy, buddy!
DEBBIE: Wait.
Pink?
Fuchsia. That's how they roll in Cali.
Come on, we're burning daylight.
Let's do it!
Don't worry about me,
I'll just be here unpacking a thousand boxes.
MARMADUKE: Freedom!
PHIL: I promise I'll be home early to help!
MARMADUKE: Let's go!
That's the company car?
¶ California
¶ knows how to party
¶ California
¶ knows how to party
¶ In the city of L.A.
(WHOOPS) We are living the dream, Phil!
¶ We keep it rockin'! ¶
Listen, big guy.
Things are gonna work a little different out here.
Give me those.
Hey, that's part of my look!
We need to impress my new boss.
I need you to be a good boy, a very good boy.
Basically, the opposite of you.
Hi. Morning!
Phil's got nothing to worry about.
Why? Twelve simple words.
I've got a chance to completely re-invent myself and finally fit in.
In short, I've got a new leash on life.
Pun intended.
Wow, this is
Phil's office?
New life, here I come.
Time to bring my A-game.
Think small, play it cool, get your bark on.
Just relax.
Hey, how's it going?
Beautiful day, huh?
Oh, hey, cool sweater!
I'm sweating like a dog.
Come on, big M, keep it together.
Just focus. Whoa!
What was that? Whoa!
PHIL: Cool it!
Hey, wait for me.
Marmaduke, heel!
Phil, wait, wait, check it out!
Winslow, here.
Oh, Mr. Twombly, there you are.
It's great to see you again.
Who do we have here?
PHIL: (GRUNTING)
Come on, buddy!
Yeah! What's his name?
This is Marmaduke.
Marmaduke!
Well, you are one handsome Great Dane, you know that?
I'm starting to like this guy!
You've got yourself a beautiful best friend there, Phil.
Thank you! Marmaduke and I, we're like two peas in a pod.
Hmm.
Who's licking butt now?
Interesting.
I'm picking up something else here, also.
Absolutely not a purebred.
Really?
I'm sensing a little
English Mastiff.
Hey, watch it!
Your guess is as good as mine.
You don't know your own best friend, Phil?
Sure. Uh...
I love dogs.
I can tell a lot about a man by the way he treats his dog.
That's why I like working out here.
I can measure, first-hand, who I'm dealing with.
Watch it, Phil.
He can smell your fear.
Plus, you get all this fresh air for out-of-the-box thinking.
And, most importantly,
I get to spend time with my little girl.
Jezebel.
MARMADUKE: Oh!
Hello, Cali!
Look at that fur!
Right. Take off your shoes and let's walk.
You don't wear shoes out here?
Come on, Phil.
Channel your inner canine.
Get some earth between your toes.
It's not the earth
I'm worried about.
Stay out of trouble.
Good luck, Phil.
You're gonna need it.
Jezebel! Whoa!
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Watch it!
Bakersfield.
What the...
He's definitely Midwest.
Boston?
I'm gonna say Kansas.
MARMADUKE:
How did you know?
It's a gift.
What's your handle, newbie?
My name's Marmaduke.
Yikes!
Immediately moving on.
Meet the gang.
The egghead, here, is Raisin.
Marmaduke.
A unique synthesis of "marma", the scientific name for the jumping spider family...
Oh! Oh!
I hate spiders.
...and the Duke of Marlborough, the 17th-century
English statesman.
And the ultra-confident
Chinese Crested over here is Giuseppe.
Before you ask, yes, I'm a real dog.
No, I'm not a chew toy.
And I just get a little nervous sometimes because we live in California.
This is the land of the puma!
There are no pumas in Southern California.
(WHISPERS) Pumas!
They come out of nowhere.
I'm Mazie, by the way.
Good to meet you guys.
Hey, you come here a lot?
It's the dog park, man.
It's like high school for dogs, which means there's a few packs to know about.
First, you got your jocks.
FEMALE DOG:
Nice catch, Brad.
The only muscle they don't use is their brain.
O-M-G, Brad is H-O-T!
MAZIE: They mostly date
Afghans. Who actually have no brain.
Oh! Frisbee!
Then you got your drama geeks.
MALE DOG:
We're innocent.
Don't shoot!
Bang, bang.
MAZIE: And over here, your mushroom heads.
Somebody stop this thing, man.
I got to get off, bro!
Then there's your out-and-out juvenile delinquents.
DELINQUENT DOG: (LAUGHS)
Come on! Let's go, go!
Word to the wise, avoid the water bowls here.
MAN: (SPITTING)
Oh, come on! Again?
MARMADUKE: (SIGHS) So far,
I'm not seeing anyone I'd really fit in with.
Well, if you think you got the game, you could roll with our crew.
Oh, yeah?
Who's your crew?
THUNDER: Mutts!
LIGHTNING: Mutts!
THUNDER: Weird!
Who are those guys?
The pedigrees, a.k.a. trouble.
GIUSEPPE: (STUTTERS)
They're rich, and they're spoiled and they act like their fleas don't bite.
It's ridiculous!
The little land shrimps are Thunder and Lightning.
Dog Vader over there is the man himself, Bosco.
Alpha male who runs the park.
He's the toughest dog around.
(SCOFFS) Him?
He doesn't look that tough.
His girlfriend over there is Miss Perfect, Jezebel.
And he's super-jealous, so stay away from her or he'll turn you into...
BOSCO: Dog food.
Hello, losers.
MAZIE:
Speak of the devil.
So, I see you got a new mutt friend.
Okay, that's wet.
Shut up, Thunder.
What's his name?
Uh... Marmaduke.
Mama-what?
Well, well. My little fireplug said you were salivating on my girlfriend.
No, no. I remember, somebody walked by eating beef jerky.
Let me explain something.
This is my park, and these are my rules.
You look at my girlfriend again, and you're dead.
You come near her, you're dead.
You talk to her, and you're...
BOTH: Dead.
We're dead.
Yeah, we're dead!
He ain't nothing, watch.
(SHOUTING) Come on, you wanna go?
You wanna go?
No! No! No, no, no.
Didn't think so.
Welcome to the O.C., mutt.
LIGHTNING: Yeah, stand clear, Horsie.
(BOTH IMITATE
HORSE NEIGHING)
See you at the party tonight, not!
Can I open my eyes now?
RAISIN: Don't listen to that guy.
Maybe listen to the part about staying away from his girlfriend or he'll kill you.
What party was he talking about?
Nothing, just a bunch of snobs scratching themselves under the yacht club pier.
We're having our own party tonight.
It's gonna be a classic O.C. rager, you should totally come.
Not sure if
I can get out, but I'll try.
Great, it's gonna be a really good party!
If you know what a party's like, it's gonna be better than that.
Tell them you know me!
You'll get right in.
Thanks, Giuseppe!
(SIGHS) Good first day,
Marmaduke.
You played it cool.
And I think I impressed a lot of dogs here today.
Now, that is a pretty good...
Bee! Ahhh!
A bee!
Get off of me now!
Look out!
Phil, help me!
DON: Bark Organics dominates the
California market.
With our product recognition and quality, we're in a position to crush the competition.
So, Dorothy, why have I called you all the way from Kansas?
Why have I been through six marketing directors in the last year?
Because I want
Bark Organics on the shelves in every PETCO in the country.
MARMADUKE: Bee!
I can't see! Bee!
I won't let you down, sir.
We'll see.
MARMADUKE: Watch out!
Coming through!
Sorry!
Are you okay?
Was that your dog?
I didn't get a good look.
Yeah, I'm fine.
(CHUCKLES) I'm fine!
It takes a lot more than that...
MARMADUKE: Bee!
That dog!
Phil, help!
Phil, get rid of him!
Help me!
Why do bees hate me?
What a gargantuan spaz!
Yeah, but kind of funny.
Hmm.
I heard a vicious rumor that you're, like, from Kansas?
Yeah. Are those, like, real dogs?
The canine accessory is so essential.
We are not accessories.
Hey, man, in my country,
I was a lawyer.
(SPANISH ACCENT) I've been in this purse so long,
I can't feel my legs.
GIRL: Bodie is so gorgeous!
Did he just look at me?
As if!
Yeah, you're probably right. He probably wasn't looking at me.
Hey, honey!
Oh, my God!
Is that thing yours?
No, it's somebody else's dog. Not mine.
Hey, Barb!
Who are your friends?
Phil! That was not cool!
Sorry, Barb.
Right. Regional market share first...
MARMADUKE: Yeah, yeah.
Come on, Phil, get off the phone.
Brian's going to bed.
BRIAN: Night, Dad.
Hey, Brian, wait up.
Sounds good.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Chill, Marmaduke.
Great news!
I ran into another dad at the dog park, and guess what he's in charge of?
I signed you up!
Oh. Soccer sounds...
Great, right?
Sure, yeah.
Man, you're gonna love it.
Okay. Good night, Dad.
Good night, buddy.
Phil, he's not gonna love it.
He's gonna hate it, you knucklehead!
Come on!
I really miss you guys, too.
But I did see this cute surfer kid today.
You need anything, honey?
A little privacy, and a one-way ticket back to Kansas.
Good night.
Come on, Phil.
It's like you're not listening to them.
¶ Lullaby, lullaby
¶ All the humans are sleeping ¶
Ladies, please!
MARMADUKE: (WHISPERS)
Carlos, be quiet!
Your eyes are getting sleepy.
So sleepy.
Good night, Phil.
¶ Hey, yo, when I wake up moaning, yawning
¶ I put up my hands
¶ Thank the Lord for what I got
¶ and never stop my plans
¶ Giving all for the goals
¶ Got to keep it up, never let my head drop
¶ Make me a home on my own
¶ Better make the bed rock ¶
(BOUNCE BACK
PLAYING IN THE GARAGE)
GIUSEPPE:
I'm a monster!
I am a tiny monster.
I'm doing the spin!
This is an O.C. rager?
You made it, great!
Come watch Giuseppe rip it up!
(HOWLS) Check this out!
One leg, one leg...
MAZIE: Hey, Marmaduke!
If you're hungry or thirsty, the trash can's out back.
And the toilet's in there.
Cool, thanks!
Did that cow just oink?
RAISIN: Meet Mazie's cow.
The factory made a mistake.
It's pretty ridiculous.
Cow that oinks.
I think it's cool!
(LAUGHING) New record!
Holler at your boy!
Marmaduke, you're up!
No, that's cool.
I'll just watch.
Don't be a wiener dog!
Just dance along to the flashing arrows!
I'd love to, but seriously, guys,
I've got four left paws.
Duke!
ALL: Duke! Duke! Duke!
All right, all right, twist my paw.
ALL: Duke! Duke!
Atta boy!
Okay, let's see.
This can't be that hard.
Okay, let's see.
Right paw, white arrow.
Left paw, blue arrow.
No, no, left paw, green arrow.
MAZIE: There we go!
On second thoughts, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Hang on, give him a chance.
MARMADUKE:
You can do this, Marmy.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, concentrate!
RAISIN: Ease into it.
Are we insured?
No one puts Dukey in a corner!
The Duke's got some moves!
You ain't seen nothing yet!
Time to get funky!
He's better than me, isn't he?
In a way, yes.
MARMADUKE: Three-sixty on the big dog!
Pinwheel time!
Time to go old-school!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, guys.
My bad.
No sweat. I needed to get a Wii, anyway.
There goes Giuseppe's entire social life.
That was the only thing
I wasn't afraid of.
You know, not that
I'm not having fun, because I totally am, what do you guys think about going to the yacht club party, see what's up?
Are you crazy?
Or we could just go to the zoo, and jump into the puma cage!
Come on, it'll be fun!
Question.
Are we gonna spend the rest of our lives hiding underneath the porch with the little pups?
Or are we gonna get out in the yard with the big dogs?
But we're not big dogs, we're tiny dogs!
That phrase was made for dogs like you!
You do realize it's Bosco's party.
Yeah, Bosco, Schmosco!
He's all bark, no bite.
Okay. Some dogs just have to learn the hard way.
GIUSEPPE: I smell rain, and I did not dress for rain.
I'm telling you guys, without fur, it's like tiny bullets from the sky.
(WHISPERS) It's him!
Who is that?
Chupadogra.
Chupadogra?
RAISIN: They say he was the ultimate alpha dog.
But then he went insane from rabies and ate his owner.
GIUSEPPE: He also sleeps on a giant pile of his victims' bones.
Can we go now, before I become an appetizer?
Let's go.
GIUSEPPE: I can't believe we survived Chupadogra!
RAISIN: And now he knows your scent.
Why would you say that?
You sure you wanna do this?
Oh, yeah.
You bet I do.
GIUSEPPE: Guys,
I'm telling you, the tide is rising!
MALE DOG: Twenty-four, come on, you can do it.
Twenty-five!
Man! Now, this party is off the leash!
What are they doing to that cat?
What pedigrees do best.
Humiliate the innocent.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Don't go over there!
Come on, let's get our bark on.
Oh, oh...
Oh, sorry.
I'll go this way.
No problem. Sorry.
This unfortunately happens to me all the time.
Me, too.
Oh, brother!
Great, we're getting mad-dogged. Let's bail!
BOSCO: Well, well, well.
If it isn't the dog and pony show.
Did the circus give you guys the day off?
We're just leaving Bosco, back off.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's the hurry?
You just got here.
You know, it's funny, with ears like that
I would have thought you heard me tell you to stay away from my girlfriend.
He told him.
You told him, like, 12 times...
Zip it!
Zipped!
Being a pedigree means you're exceptional.
We're all bred for a purpose and have gifts you could never dream of having.
Stuart's an expert tracker.
Shasta is a master sled dog.
Ferdinand is fluent in six languages, including gopher.
And I'm the reigning
SoCal surf champ.
Are you good at anything? Huh?
Um... Uh...
Sit!
(LAUGHS) You are good at something!
Lay down. Lay down!
That's it.
Oh, no!
This is bad, isn't it?
Yes, it's very bad.
I don't care how freakishly large you are, Donkey Boy.
We all know that inside you're just a scared little pup!
Did I say you could get up?
MARMADUKE: No, no. Please!
Did I say you could get up?
I'm sorry!
No mercy, boss.
Put him in a doggie bag!
ALL: (CHANTING)
Fight! Fight! Fight!
MARMADUKE: I don't wanna fight you.
Bosco, stop!
Relax, baby! We're just horsing around.
No, you're not.
You're being a bully.
I'm sorry, he gets this way when he drinks too much drain-pipe water.
He gets that way because he's a jerk.
You watch yourself, tomboy.
Come on, we're out of here.
Come on, baby, are you gonna spend time with them or with me?
It's a party, let's have fun!
BOSCO: See you later, when there's not any girls around to save you.
Mutt.
Bosco's right about everything.
I'm just a Gigantor freak.
Wasn't bred for anything, but getting in the way.
You know, if I had a bone for every time someone said,
"Put a saddle on that thing!" or, "How's the weather up there?"
I'd be a bone-illionaire!
Just once in my life,
I'd like to fit in, you know?
Look, I know what it's like to be an outsider.
Okay? I was a rescue dog.
Nobody wanted me.
But you're better than any of those guys, and I can prove it.
I can make you into the dog you wanna be.
Really? Why would you do that for me?
Because you're my friend.
Wait, what time is it?
Oh, man,
Phil's gonna get up soon.
I got to go!
I'll see you later!
You're welcome.
I just made it.
(SIGHS) I am beat.
I am so tired.
I'm exhausted.
Oh! Phil, hit the snooze!
Time for work, big guy.
Oh, Phil, you're killing me.
DON ON PHONE:
Winslow, Twombly.
I need that new campaign and I need it yesterday.
So what do you got?
Yeah. I got some great ideas percolating,
I just need a little time to flesh them out.
See, you got nothing.
No, you can count on me.
It's gonna be a home run.
It better be.
Yeah, bye.
I got nothing.
Bee! Bee! Phil, get him!
Marmaduke, relax!
Phil, I hate bees!
Get back.
Bee! Bee!
He's gonna sting us!
He's gonna sting me and give me rabies!
Phil, Phil, get rid of him!
Marmaduke, chill, relax.
They're just surfers.
Marmaduke, you're a genius!
I am?
A surf competition for dogs?
Picture this.
Man's best friend surfing towards shore, throngs of owners cheering them on.
How's that gonna sell organic dog food to the heartland?
Eleven o'clock, Phil.
Listen, if you wanna sell to the Midwest,
I'll tell you how.
Be true to who you are.
Bark Organics was made in Southern California, embrace that.
Bring the iconic spirit of the West Coast to every dog owner across the country.
I don't know.
I hired you to create an identity for this company and you're telling me to be myself?
You know, we only have one shot with PETCO.
I know.
But you got to trust me on this.
All right.
One shot.
Make it happen.
Yes!
Okay, mutt-makeover begins now.
First things first.
All right,
I'm all ears, literally.
Pig Cow is yours.
Check, Pig Cow's mine. Why?
He's a real confidence booster.
Of course he is.
You just chew on him when you get nervous.
Noted and filed.
Next up, let's smell that breath.
(SNIFFING) Whoa!
Oh, buddy!
Really, that bad?
That needs work. Okay, pedigrees have dental hygienists, all right?
So garbage breath is not gonna cut it.
Stay out of trash cans and eat more mint-based items.
Okay, less trash, more mint.
And stand up proud.
Your ancestors sat at the foot of kings, man.
Yeah.
Let's put the "Great" back in "Dane" here.
Yeah, like this?
Um...
You know, just maybe keep your ears up, too, while we're at it.
Ears up. Like this?
Yeah, that looks fine.
Just out of curiosity, do you think any of this stuff would work with girls?
(STAMMERS) Did you have anyone in mind?
Not specifically, just thinking out loud here.
Oh! (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
Right, right, okay.
No one specific.
That's good.
(SIGHS SADLY) Okay...
Listen up, Barkanova.
If it were me,
I'd want him to take me to the junkyard.
It's really romantic there at night.
There'd be a blanket with some treats spread out, music from an old car radio playing softly.
Yeah, and lots of great old stuff to pee on, right?
Oh! You've got so much to learn.
Here's the deal.
Girls want romance.
You know? Mystery.
Wow.
What?
You know, I never really noticed before, but you have really pretty...
Fire truck!
Hey, buddy, we're talking here.
Fire truck!
MAZIE: Heel!
Oh, sorry.
Where were we?
Uh... You said I have really pretty...
PHIL: Got to go, buddy.
Work to do.
No! Wait, Phil, no, not now!
Hey, where are you going?
MARMADUKE:
Phil, I need this.
Come on. Let's go.
MAZIE: "Really pretty" what?
(MUFFLED) What?
MARMADUKE: (MUFFLED)
Carlos, let me ask you something.
Is my breath really that bad?
CARLOS: A tube of toothpaste is a good start, but you're gonna need more than that.
Dude, watch it!
Just gave myself a tongue-bath.
Sorry.
How's my breath now?
Refreshingly minty.
Who am I kidding?
Minty breath, better posture.
This stuff's never gonna work.
These guys have real skills.
I could never speak gopher.
Why would you want to talk to gophers?
(SIGHS) Forget it.
Breaking into new cliques is tough and breaking into bird cages is even tougher. (BELCHES)
I just don't get it.
I'm a dog and you're a cat, we get along great.
That's because you're my  hermano.
If we weren't related,
I'd scratch both your eyes out!
Don't make me laugh.
You could never take me.
I'd cream your furry little butt...
Carlos, you're a genius.
What is he doing?
Say, does anybody smell that?
I smell a cat and I hate cats.
Cat! There's no cat here.
(LOUDLY) I said,
"I smell a cat."
Where am I?
THUNDER: Hey boss, there is a cat!
No, no, no.
This one's mine, fellas.
Is this a dog park?
I must be horribly lost.
Oh, yeah, you must be lost, cat, because this park is for dogs only.
THUNDER:
I got the tail!
You said there'd only be a few dogs.
It's a dog park.
What do you want me to do?
The sun's out, it's crowded today.
This is gonna cost you, big time!
Fight! Fight!
CARLOS: Whoa!
What a crowd!
Who let the dogs out?
This doesn't look good!
Please don't hurt me, Mister.
I'm just a poor, incredibly attractive, ultra-intelligent cat, who has lost his way.
You're gonna need all nine lives after this beat-down, pussycat.
You are the biggest, baddest dog I have ever seen in my life.
You also seem very cool and confident.
You're right about all of that, you little
Fancy-Feast-eating freak!
Please! Spare my life!
Spare this.
Come on, sell it, man.
Sell it.
Really? Okay.
Left jab, left jab, work the body.
Get back here, you good-for-nothing little fur-ball!
(WHISPERS) I only weigh six pounds.
This officially hurts now. Stop!
No, no, keep going, keep going. I think it's working.
Maybe we can find a happy medium?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, everybody, watch this!
CARLOS: No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Dizzy!
Hairball. (SPITS)
What's the matter,
Bigglesworth?
Dog got your tongue?
Yeah, whatever, man.
Hope you got what you wanted.
THUNDER: (LAUGHS)
That was hilarious,
Marmadonk!
Yeah, you're not as good as Bosco, but you took that fleabag to school!
Oh, please, it was a cat.
It's not like he killed it.
You've got a keen sense of smell.
(STAMMERS) Oh.
Well, thanks. It must be the large nostrils.
I have to go, but maybe
I'll see you around.
Cool! I'd like that.
BOSCO: Jezebel, let's go. Now!
You know,
I have a pretty good nose myself and when I'm around you
I smell potential, with a hint of something minty.
I like it.
BOSCO: Let's go!
It worked!
She talked to me!
What are you doing?
That's not what we talked about!
MARMADUKE: Who cares?
She liked my minty breath!
Welcome to the First
Annual Bark Organics
Dog Surfing Competition.
Dogs and owners, make your way to the shore. Cowabarka!
Hey, I know you.
You go to Marshall, right?
The new girl.
That's me.
You ever not on that thing?
You ever not on that thing?
I'm Bodie.
I know. I mean...
Yeah, I'm Barbara.
Is that your dog?
No, no, no.
That's my dad's dog.
Huh. That's too bad.
He's way better than those lame purse dogs.
Well, I did kind of adopt him as my own, though. (CHUCKLES)
The dog, not my dad.
Yeah, Marmaduke and I are super close.
My friend's having a party next weekend.
You should come.
Sure, I'd love to.
Competition's starting.
Beat it, Hasselhoff.
(WHISPERS) Dad, what are you doing?
You're way too young, and I'm way too busy to talk about this right now.
And, just put some clothes on.
Can I get you anything, Deb?
He's cute!
BRIAN: Hey, Marmaduke, can you keep a secret?
Probably.
I've been telling Dad
I'm going to soccer practice, but I've actually been hanging out at the skate park.
I think that sounds cool, Brian.
But you got to tell your dad.
I don't even like soccer.
I guess I just don't know how to tell him the truth.
I hear you, bro, but just hang in there.
I wish you could talk.
And I wish you could understand me.
PHIL: Come on, Marmaduke!
Hey, Brian, you okay?
BRIAN: Yeah.
What do you say we kick that ball around later?
No, I'm good.
PHIL: Come on, buddy.
MARMADUKE: Wait! Phil! Phil!
Hold on, Phil.
Brian's got something to tell you.
It is a beautiful day here in Southern California for dog surfing.
Please, put your paws together for our canine competitors!
Aha! And here's our marketing director,
Phil Winslow.
Phil, this is David King,
Jessica Colestat from PETCO.
Pleased to meet you.
I hope you're ready for a mind-blowing canine surf experience.
(LAUGHS) Wow! Can't wait to see this big guy out on the waves!
DON: No, no, no.
Phil and Marmaduke are one month removed from Kansas.
I don't think they're ready to hang 10.
Well, that's too bad.
That would've been hysterical.
Yeah!
(STAMMERS) No, you're right!
That would be hysterical!
Phil?
Phil, come on, they're just kidding.
Say no!
Marmaduke's dying to hang 20.
Dying to.
Oh! We're dead!
No, no, no. Phil, no!
PHIL: Let's go, buddy.
Come on.
It's just water.
No. Way too big and too wet! Cold, cold!
That's my competition?
This ought to be fun.
Freezing, freezing!
No! Marmaduke!
Cold, cold!
Come on, get back here. Heel!
MARMADUKE:
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.
I'm running through a meadow.
I'm peeing on everything.
You don't stand a chance, Shamu.
I own these waves.
Good luck to you, too.
It's okay, Marmaduke.
Nothing bad's gonna happen.
Something bad's gonna happen, Phil.
Payback's gonna hurt.
Okay, stay.
It's okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, take a look, on the horizon, a massive, rogue wave approaches!
You got to be kidding!
Time to dazzle.
PHIL: It's all you, buddy.
Phil! No, no, what are you doing?
Phil, help me.
Phil, no!
PHIL: Good luck!
Somebody get me off this thing!
What am I doing?
BOSCO: Out of my way, poser!
Look out!
I've got the right of way!
Oh, boy!
Look out!
Phil, help me!
Look at this!
It's Marmaduke!
Look at the perfect position here,
Marmaduke in the barrel.
Yeah!
Get me off this thing!
Help! Marmy don't surf!
He doesn't look like he's gonna make it.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Oh, man,
I'm gonna die!
No, you're not.
Get a hold of yourself!
Grip it and rip it!
Geronimo!
There he is!
There he is!
Take a look at this!
He throws a big air!
What a crazy dog!
Look out! Look out!
And the Duke shreds!
This dog rules!
Marmaduke!
PHIL: You did it, buddy!
MARMADUKE: Oh!
Get me out of here!
That's my dog!
Get this seaweed off me!
It burns! It burns!
Debbie, help!
DOG 1: Yeah!
DOG 2: That was awesome!
MARMADUKE: Really?
That was off the hook!
DOG 3: The Duke has arrived, y'all!
MARMADUKE: It was?
DOG 2: You totally shredded, dude!
I shredded?
That was way better than Bosco, dude!
Marmaduke shreds!
All right, here it is.
The overall surf champion...
You think it was funny dropping in on my wave like that, Marma-puke?
I didn't do anything, Bosco!
Let it go, it was an accident.
And the trophy goes to...
This better be me.
Whoa! We have an upset.
The trophy goes to Phil Winslow and Marmaduke!
What?
Phil, did we really win?
I'm gonna tear you apart, mutt.
I didn't do anything!
Somebody put a leash on this dog!
Marmaduke!
MARMADUKE: Help!
BOSCO: Get back here, mutt!
Whoa, whoa!
BOSCO: Get back here, you poser!
MARMADUKE:
I don't even like surfing!
Stop running, you coward.
I'm gonna make you pay.
I am gonna make you pay!
DOG 3: Come on, Duke, you can take him.
This ends right here, right now.
You know what?
You're right, Bosco.
This does end here.
Ow! My leg's cramping!
Ow! Ow!
Time out, time out!
No, bad dog!
Heel.
I'm so sorry about this.
Get your dog under control, you understand?
Come on, folks,
I'm so sorry. Come on.
Come this way.
Hey, what's the new surf champ doing out here all alone?
Hey. I'm just kind of here, taking a break from the old family.
Well, I guess some people just can't handle it when you're top dog.
Really?
It's getting a little cold out.
Wait, what about Bosco?
Forget about him.
There's a new dog in town.
And his name is Marmaduke.
Hey, that's my name!
That's my name!
Marmaduke!
Say it loud, say it proud!
¶ The moon was shining on the lake at night
¶ The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
¶ Smeared mascara,
I looked into your eyes
I saw a light ¶
DOGS: Fire truck!
MARMADUKE: Fire truck!
Fire truck!
Hi! Phil Winslow.
Anton, master of the Top Dog method.
I'm supposed to listen to a guy named Anton?
Top dog him, Phil.
Top dog him.
PHIL: Marmaduke!
Guys, what's going on?
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Out of the car!
Let's go.
Oh...
Pump your fists triumphantly, and say it to the world,
"I'm top dog!"
MARMADUKE: Rubber bone!
I'm top dog!
MARMADUKE:
Bone! Give me!
GIUSEPPE: I thought you said he'd be here.
He said he might stop by after the pedigree party, but he didn't promise anything.
How much farther?
MARMADUKE: Just keep coming. Keep coming, we're almost there.
Where are we?
It's a surprise. Ready?
Hit it, boys! (BARKS)
JEZEBEL: Wow!
It's pretty cool, isn't it?
It's beautiful!
MARMADUKE:
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.
Crank it, DJ Thunder!
I can't believe I'm really here with you.
Of course you are, silly!
You're the alpha dog.
Okay, well,
I hope you're hungry.
JEZEBEL: Wow!
You really pulled out all the stops!
It's just a little something I whipped up.
How about a peanut butter appetizer?
My favorite!
Really? I was worried you might be allergic to it.
I almost got almond butter.
JEZEBEL:
It's so romantic!
I couldn't think of another girl I'd rather share it with.
It's so creative, too.
Tell me, how did you ever think of this?
It's just the kind of guy I am.
I'm a Great Dane.
We sat at the foot of kings!
Listen, I just wanted to say something.
I wanted to say...
My bad.
I slipped off the seat.
That's okay, Thunder.
(LAUGHS) He's so funny.
I wanted to say hanging out with you these last few weeks, which in dog years feels like months, it's like the first time in my life I feel like
I really belong.
Yeah! I'm having a great time, too.
RAISIN: Look at him.
Land shrimps at his beck and call.
(SIGHS) That's it.
No, Mazie!
Stay, please.
Sit!
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, Mazie!
What's up?
You don't give a steaming pile about us anymore, so cut the act, all right?
We took you in.
We were your friends.
And you just sit over here and act like we're dirt.
What'd they put in your kibble this morning?
You took her on my dream date.
Dream date?
What is she talking about?
How do you think that makes me feel?
Bitter, party of one?
What's the big deal?
We were just spit-balling ideas.
You'd think she'd be thrilled I used one.
You don't get it, do you?
She gave you Pig Cow, she likes you.
At least, she did until you turned your back on us and became a big phony-baloney sell-out.
Word.
That's really cute and everything, but I already have a girlfriend.
A pedigree girlfriend.
So, that's it?
(STAMMERING) Yeah.
I don't hang out with mutts anymore.
Ouch!
DON: You're lucky
I had a favor to call in.
PETCO's gonna give us another chance.
But they wanna see a fully realized campaign before they'll cross-promote the roll-out.
No problem,
I'll start working on that immediately.
You'll start working on it?
Little late for you to be going solo, there, Buckeye.
I want you on my boat this weekend, we'll work together.
This weekend,
I can't.
You have to.
I need to spend some quality time with my family.
Tough.
I promised my wife.
All right, bring the family along. They can relax while we work.
Okay, that'll be perfect.
Excellent.
Now, this is sort of embarrassing, but there are no dogs allowed on the boat.
It's my wife's rule.
Quite frankly,
I think she's jealous.
Okay, we got the life jacket, towels, bathing suits, sunglasses, sunscreen.
Brian's got his fins.
You're taking the laptop?
You know, just in case.
Guys, I'm really excited about spending this weekend together.
Dad, please,
I'm begging you.
Let me go to my friend's house so I can go the party.
Barb, it's a family trip and you are coming, too.
Let's go.
Here, get your snorkel.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on. I feel like we're forgetting something.
We have everything, but the furniture and the dog.
Look at him.
He's just sitting there!
I know.
You think he'll be okay here alone?
I think he'll be fine.
He's got food and water and I'm having Laura from down the street look in on him.
Right. Right.
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?
He has a party?
Invites his girlfriend over?
Yes and yes!
MALE DOG:
Party at the Duke's!
Rager, man! Yeah!
DOGS: (CHANTING)
Jump! Jump! Jump!
I am a golden dog!
Canine-ball!
Looking good, Colby!
Sweet collar, Aurora!
Yes! Yes!
My boy, Topaz!
JEZEBEL: Marmaduke.
LIGHTNING:
Chug it! Chug it!
Go, go, go!
Chug it, Shasta!
SHASTA: Ow!
Sorry, slipped off the seat again!
SHASTA: That is not cool, dude!
Hey, is this your party, dude?
(LAUGHS) Yeah!
We're not worthy, we're not worthy!
We love you, man!
All right!
Now it's a party!
Yeah, come on!
Who let the dogs out?
Pee-Wee, hit the Crazy String!
You're a big hit,
Marmaduke!
Hey, is it just me, or is it getting a little out of hand?
Everyone's having fun, loosen up!
MARMADUKE: Yeah!
Of course, of course!
No, no, you're right.
Forget what I said.
Why is everyone always having more fun than us?
GIUSEPPE: Because they're not afraid to live?
And we suck at swimming?
Great! Okay, now
I'm catching a cold.
MAZIE: Come on, let's go.
RAISIN: What do you smell, girl?
Trouble.
DOGS: (CHANTING)
Duke! Duke! Duke!
CARLOS: Hey, dude, get out of the trash!
Do I know you from somewhere?
Me? Nope.
Never seen you before.
BOSCO: You sure?
That tail looks painful.
Of course I'm sure, man.
I've never even been to a dog park.
Oops.
It's so soothing!
Gordie, no!
No, not on Debbie's rug!
Whoa, whoa!
No, no! Hey!
Not on the couch!
You raised in a barn?
No, not the stereo!
Phil's gonna kill me!
Looks like a great party.
Now, I'm sorry to interrupt.
What are you doing here?
I got a quick question.
Anyone recognize this cute little fella?
The cat from the park that Marmaduke hazed?
I recommend the guacamole.
It's dynamite.
Look at the tail.
Turns out he lives here with Marmaduke.
Or is it Marma-fake?
First of all, you weren't invited here, Bosco.
Leave now and you won't have a problem.
And take Whiskers with you.
We have a "no cat" policy.
Say what?
Is that right?
Then how do you explain that picture over there?
THUNDER:
Hey, it is that cat.
LIGHTNING:
Yep, that's it.
That's the cat.
DOG 1: Let's get out of here.
MARMADUKE: Wait! Wait!
What's going on?
Where you going?
No, no, stay!
DOG 2: Total poser.
Where are you going?
DOG 3: Loser!
He's going, not us!
DOG 4: Party at the pier!
All right, let's go! Party!
Is it true, Marmaduke?
Only most of it.
You see, in the end, pedigrees always win.
And that's the way it'll always be.
Enjoy the rest of your party, mutt.
Baby, come on.
Jezebel! He's a liar.
Come on, let's go.
THUNDER: Hey, Bosco, wait up!
Jezebel, wait! I...
I thought you were different.
What just happened?
I think it's called a colossal fall from grace,  hermano.
Oh!
CARLOS: Not to rub margarita salt in the wound, but you kind of deserved it.
Oh! What have I done?
Can't wait for the next family boat trip.
It was a weekend on a boat, okay?
It was a work-end, honey.
We had to finish the presentation and...
BARBARA: What happened?
Marmaduke?
PHIL: No.
DEBBIE: Phil.
No!
I'm up, I'm up.
Where am I?
Marmaduke!
I'm up, I'm up.
Phil, thank God you're here.
I had a party.
I was trying to be a big shot...
Off the couch!
I just invited some friends and then they invited friends.
It just got crazy!
Come here, now!
I'm sorry.
Phil, I really could use a hug right now.
Bad dog!
Phil, no! Phil,
I'm trying to explain!
Phil, stop it.
Just give me a chance to...
Phil, I said I was sorry.
The PETCO pitch.
Oh, Marmaduke.
Ooh!
Uh-oh, Daddy.
I don't care if it's raining, I'm done.
He can sleep outside.
Perfect, that will solve everything.
We'll just leave him chained up in the backyard for the next 10 years.
Or maybe we give him away.
You did not just say that.
He refuses to listen to me!
It's just an option we haven't explored yet, that's all I'm saying.
I don't understand you sometimes.
Look around you, Deb.
He destroyed our home!
No, he didn't!
Our home is us.
It's you and me and the kids.
It doesn't matter where we are.
This move did not work out the way
I hoped it would.
DEBBIE: The only way this move was ever gonna work out is if we were in it together.
You seem to have lost sight of that.
Everything I do is for us.
I worked my butt off this weekend, and once again, that dog screwed it up!
He's a dog, Phil!
He doesn't know any better.
You want him to sleep outside, fine.
He has a backyard, you have a couch.
Really?
Really.
You know what?
It's not that easy.
(GRUNTING) Nobody ever puts in a cat door!
Hey, you must be Mazie.
Tell the hipster giant
I'm not interested in his peace offering.
He's gone.
He got busted with Phil and had to sleep outside.
He ran out the back gate about an hour ago.
Oh, great. He has zero street smarts.
Where you going?
To find that big doofus!
I'd go myself, but I can't get wet.
ARLISS ON TV:  Yeller.
Oh! You crazy, wonderful dog.
He acts like it's a great big romp, doesn't he, Travis?
Crazy as a bullbat.
He's a heap more dog than I ever had him figured for.
None of the strays at the pound have seen him.
He's not at the dog park either.
GIUSEPPE: No luck here.
I made a huge mistake wearing the bumble-bee sweater.
It's way too absorbent!
It's raining cats and us!
You guys head home,
I'm gonna look a little longer.
We can't leave you out here alone!
It's too dangerous!
Okay, on second thought, you have fun.
You do that whole thing.
Good luck.
Chupadogra?
Who are you?
And what are you doing here?
Please don't hurt me!
You're a big boy.
Good. The small ones ain't got enough meat on their bones.
Please don't hurt me!
I'm sorry, I...
Are you okay?
I'm more than all right.
Sorry to bother you.
Hey, what's a dog like you doing out here, anyways?
You're no stray.
I ran away from home.
So, you think running's the answer? Huh?
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.
I acted like a big-shot and lost all my friends, my family.
Listen, this bag of bones you're looking at used to be something special.
I was the alpha dog.
Left my home to go run the pack.
And man, did I run it.
Till they turned on me.
Now I live out here alone dodging trains and dogcatchers.
Rest assured,  compadre, there ain't a day goes by when I don't think about waking up in a warm bed and spending the day with the folks who love me.
The real me.
Go home.
Something tells me it ain't too late for the real you.
Thank you, Buster.
(SIGHS) Been a long time since anybody called me that.
Thanks.
What's that?
It's the pound.
Go on, get out of here.
Get! (COUGHING)
What about you?
You're sick!
Yeah, that's right, baby.
I'm one sick puppy. (BARKS)
Go on, go!
Let's make this easy, old timer.
What fun would that be?
No, no! No!
Debbie, you got to listen to me.
Marmaduke is missing.
He's been gone since last night!
We're talkative this morning!
Go eat your num-nums.
Hey, Deb.
Did you leave these on the table in there?
What are you talking about?
Barb, I read the text. And...
Is that really how you feel?
Honestly?
Yeah.
Hey, Bri.
You never went to soccer practice, did you?
I didn't want to disappoint you, but you weren't really listening.
Where's Marmaduke?
PHIL: In the backyard, sweetie.
No, he's not.
I thought he was upstairs with you.
No.
DEBBIE: Marmaduke!
PHIL: Marmaduke!
The side gate's open.
You didn't let him back in last night?
No.
That's what
I've been saying.
He'll be back, right?
He could get hit by a car.
Honey, anything could happen because we don't know how long he's been gone.
I just wanted him to sleep in the backyard,
I didn't want him to run away. God!
I got this presentation.
Guys, if I don't nail this, I'm done.
Just go.
We'll find him.
You put her in the car seat, and you get
Marmaduke's leash, okay?
Wait.
We'll all go find him.
Now you're talking,  amigo.
Come on, where am I?
Just give me one little scent of home.
BRIAN: Marmaduke!
Come on, buddy.
PHIL: Marmaduke!
Come on, boy.
Marmaduke!
Okay, that was the neighborhood.
So, where else?
The beach.
He could be at the beach.
Okay, the beach and maybe the dog park?
You guys, I'm texting everybody I know.
What if he's at the pound?
Come on, come on, give me something
I can recognize.
One landmark, one little scent.
What do you mean,
"What does he look like?"
He's a Great Dane!
He's huge. He's twice the size of your dog.
Come on, give me a scent.
One more funky little Marmaduke smell.
Come on, not today!
Hi, Don.
Winslow, where the heck are you?
You were supposed to be here an hour ago!
I'm sorry, Don. Uh...
We still haven't found Marmaduke and I just don't think
I'll make it in today.
Don't worry about coming in today, because you're fired,
Winslow!
Mazie?
Mazie? Mazie!
What is this?
It looks like a water main broke.
There he is!
MARMADUKE: Wait! I'm coming!
Honey! Honey!
Right there, look!
Kids, never do this.
Marmaduke!
Where was he, Brian?
He was up there.
Marmaduke! Here, go wait in the car with your mom.
Marmaduke!
Mazie!
Marmaduke!
Mazie!
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for...
MARMADUKE: Mazie! No!
What?
Mazie!
Marmaduke!
No, no, don't let me fall!
Marmaduke!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, buddy!
Marmaduke, where are you?
Somebody, help! Mazie!
No! Marmaduke!
Mazie! Mazie!
Hey, Marmaduke, come on, let's go!
Stay back.
MARMADUKE: Phil, help me!
PHIL: Get away from me!
Hey, stay back!
Geronimo!
Marmaduke, no!
That's my dog.
That's my dog in there!
Look, that was my dog.
Can somebody help me?
Can you please help me get him out of there?
There's a catch basin about two blocks down.
We need a water rescue, over.
Help!
Marmaduke!
MARMADUKE: Mazie!
Where are you, Marmaduke?
I can't do this!
Hold on.
I'm coming, Mazie!
Help me! Help me!
Somebody, help! Mazie!
Marmaduke!
Help! Help!
Help, help, don't let me fall!
Mazie!
FIREMAN 1:
Go! Go! Go! Go!
FIREMAN 2: All right.
Get me two more guys here.
MAZIE: What are we gonna do?
MARMADUKE:
Just hold on.
I'm gonna figure this out.
Anything?
MARMADUKE: Wait, wait,
I think I hear someone.
Down here!
MARMADUKE: I think he's gonna help us.
Yeah. We're right here.
What should we do?
I found them, over.
Come on, girl.
MAZIE: I don't think
I can make it!
Come here.
No, I can't!
FIREMAN 3: Come on, girl, it's okay.
Listen to him.
Mazie, you can do this.
You can do it, right here.
MAZIE: I don't think
I can make it!
Come on, girl, just jump.
MARMADUKE: Come on.
You can do it.
Good, you got it!
Take her first.
Go ahead.
Come on, it's your turn. Jump!
Me? No. I can't do it,
I'm too big!
Come on, you can do it!
What's that noise?
Marmaduke, look out!
You got to come, boy.
Hurry!
MARMADUKE: You got to be kidding me!
FIREMAN:
Come on, boy! Hurry!
MARMADUKE: Grab me!
You better grab me now!
What's happening?
FIREMAN 1: Jam it! Jam it!
FIREMAN 2:
Get him out!
FIREMAN 3:
Up, up, up!
Let's go!
FIREMAN 4:
You guys, easy.
Easy!
FIREMAN 6:
There he is.
We got him up. Guys!
FIREMAN 4: He's out.
He's out.
Where's the other one?
Where's my dog?
FIREMAN 5:
I'm sorry.
The water was moving too fast.
I lost him.
We're not gonna give up.
Where does this go?
The aqueduct, it's just down there.
Go with him. Go.
Marmaduke!
Marmaduke!
MARMADUKE: Phil, help!
Get me. Phil!
Marmaduke!
Help!
Get me, Phil!
Marmaduke!
Help!
Marmaduke!
I'm right here, buddy.
Grab here, Phil!
Grab on to this.
Phil! Phil, where are you? Phil!
Phil! Phil!
Thank goodness you're okay!
Marmaduke!
Right here, come on!
I can't...
I'm too scared.
Right here.
Come on.
Oh, no!
How did it come to this, Phil?
It started with a bath, and now look at us.
We can do this.
I'm not gonna let you go.
I can't do it.
I promise.
Let go, and I'll catch you.
I love you, buddy.
Come on!
Phil, I've been waiting since Kansas to have you say that.
Come on, let's go!
You can do it, buddy.
Right here. Come on.
Trust me.
I trust you.
Here I come!
Atta boy, buddy.
Come on!
Right here.
Swim to me.
Let's go. Come on.
Phil, help!
Get me. Phil, get me!
PHIL: All right, come on! I got you.
I love you, buddy.
Thank God, you got me!
We did it! Yes!
You got me, Phil!
You got me!
You're safe, buddy.
Those aren't tears, it's just a little water!
Good boy.
Harness coming down!
I still hate water!
(SIGHS) I know you're not gonna understand a word of this but I've never been so happy to see that big, ugly face in my whole life.
I'm done pretending to be a top dog.
A real top dog looks out for his family.
And you are my family.
That's it,
I can't stand it anymore.
I'm gonna give him the tongue.
That's a good boy!
I know, I know!
I've been on this crew nine years.
And that, my friend, is some pretty strong stuff.
Come on, buddy!
Honey?
Dad!
Dad!
Hey, guys!
DEBBIE: Are you okay?
SARAH: Hi, Dad.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm just a little wet, that's all.
BRIAN: Marmaduke!
Look who I found!
Marmaduke!
MARMADUKE: Oh, yeah!
Get a little Marmaduke.
Let me wrap my paws around you!
SARAH: We missed you.
Hi, there.
SARAH: Hi!
Okay, you're all wet!
Gosh, I love you guys so much.
This is all my fault.
I never asked what you wanted.
I've just been trying so hard to make this work that I had no idea you were so unhappy.
I guess what I'm trying to say is
I think we should move back to Kansas.
What?
Move back to Kansas?
Kansas? Uh-uh.
Toto ain't going nowhere,  papi.
That's crazy talk, Dad.
BOY: Hey, Brian!
Dude, we got it all on tape.
We're putting it on YouTube!
Sweet!
It's good to see you, Bri.
BRIAN: What are you doing?
Brian, who are your friends?
They're just some kids
I met at the skate park.
They're pretty cool.
Hey, boys!
Hi.
Sup?
Hey, Barbara!
Hey, what's Hasselhoff doing here?
Bodie? You came.
Yeah, I came as soon as
I got your text message.
Is everybody okay?
Yeah, everything's much better now.
Those were some pretty sick moves,
Mr. Winslow.
Thank you, Bodie.
No worries, Phil.
It's Mr. Winslow.
Yes, sir. (CHUCKLES)
What do you think, babe?
(SIGHS) I don't know.
I like it here.
I think we fit here.
We fit in the house.
We don't fit in that company car.
I just missed you.
Looks like we're home.
Looks like the family landed on their feet.
There's just one more thing
I got to take care of.
Check it out.
Here goes nothing.
What the heck is he doing?
Is he crazy?
DOGS: (CHANTING)
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Don't just stand there, do something!
I am.
I'm standing my ground!
What's up, Marmadukey?
You here to exact revenge?
Actually, no, Bosco.
I'm here to thank you.
Thank me? For what?
For showing me how wrong I was.
I don't care what everyone thinks of me
'cause it doesn't matter if you're big or small or a pedigree or a mutt.
We're all just dogs.
And that's the way the park should be.
So I'm gonna sit down and claim this spot for all the dogs who don't think they have what it takes to be over here.
Sup? Yeah.
You gotta be kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Does everyone here have rabies-induced insanity?
This is sacred turf.
It's just for pedigrees.
Well, not anymore.
You know what?
You're all just mutts.
All of you!
Let's go, Jezebel.
I think everyone should sit here, too.
I'm done taking your spit on my head, Bosco.
Go find somebody else to drool on.
We're through with you!
Come have a seat, fellas.
It's lovely up here.
I can see forever!
Fine, have it your way, losers.
I'll remember this.
Payback's gonna be a...
Bee! Bee! Ahhh!
Victory!
Victory is ours!
The Duke's our boy!
Huh! Looks like
I'm not the only one terrified of bees.
Bees are scary.
Listen...
I don't know how to say this without hurting your feelings...
JEZEBEL: Shh!
I'll be fine. It's time to finally stand on my own four legs for a while.
Besides, we'll still be friends.
Ouch! I hate it when girls say that.
MARMADUKE: Mazie?
Wow.
Hey, check it out.
Looking good in the pink.
What are you waiting for? Go!
Mazie, wait up!
Oh, hey!
You look amazing!
I feel like a fluffy monstrosity.
Listen, I wanted to say how sorry I am for the way
I've been acting.
I was a real jerk, and you didn't deserve it.
I think my brain just turned into an Afghan
Hound for a while.
No offense.
I totally heard that.
It takes a big dog to admit that.
Yeah, I...
What?
Your eyes. You have really pretty eyes.
And I never had a chance to tell you.
Thanks!
(STAMMERS) Your fur's really nice, too.
DON: Winslow!
Oh! I wonder what ever happened to that PETCO deal.
Winslow! Winslow?
There you are, I've been looking for you.
I thought I was fired.
Don't be so sensitive.
Any man that chooses his dog over his career is a man I want working for me.
Besides, have you seen the video of you rescuing
Marmaduke on YouTube?
Nah.
Six hundred and eighty-two thousand hits so far.
We got PETCO!
Are you serious?
Totally!
We're gonna sell a lot of dog food!
Wow!
Come on, walk with me.
We got work to do.
I can't.
Why?
'Cause I made plans with my family.
Who? Oh. All right.
All right, tomorrow.
Monday.
Monday. Deal.
Deal.
Don't push it, okay?
Okay, I'm just spit-balling here but what if the dogs could talk to each other?
I don't really buy it.
What if they could dance?

What's your favorite movie?
Segunda.

It was a Category 4 storm.
How far are we from the eye?

Tell me when it gets severe!

You didn't read the label.

No, I can't... I can't go hiking.
It's just not a great time for me.
Okay. Okay.

- Great!
Where's our lunches?
What is on your feet?
Reindeer slippers.
<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> Look, I am the one who gets the emails about your lack of effort, man. Okay?
You either know where the book is or you don't.
Dad, it's whatever.
Look, I'll know it when I get to school.
You know what?
"Whatever" is the laziest word of the 20th century, all right?
I'm... I've had it with "whatever."
I don't want to hear it again in this century ever again.
"Whatever" is over.
He says it all the time. He won't have anything left to say in this century.
I'm not lettin' you out of the car till I get a new word.
You know, you gotta focus, man.
If you focused as much on your homework as you do on your artwork, you'd have it all.

You're gonna get an F.

Thank you.
<font color="#bb00bb">(MOUTHING)</font>

Benjamin, I've arrived at a thought.

I believe you should court the girl we met at Jamba Juice.
She's a stunner.
She keeps callin' me to go hiking.
- Benjamin, hike her.

All right. Let's see.
<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> Cerrado.
<font color="#808080">DUNCAN:</font> Yeah, looks like
Bernie's closed for renovations.
Which means Bernie's hung over.
Is she a stunner? I mean, is that what they call a stunner now?
I mean, what do I know?
I was spoiled. I had the real thing.
Well, what else do we have around here?
Got Little Dom's.
No.
- Hey.
- Nope. No.
Look. The world is gonna get very small if you don't go to any of the places where you and Katherine used to go.
I met her there.
- Man, I'm sorry. That's right.
- It's all right, man.
You know, I gotta get back anyway.
Want to just do it next week?
Look.
You gotta let a little sunlight in. Okay?
Human interaction is a good thing.
Take it from a guy who spent six months on a commercial fishing boat in Bali trying to find himself.

- Remember that?
Yeah. And you know what I found?
I missed people.
So just do me a favor.

I shall try to start over.

- You're handsome!
- Hey-a, so are you!

<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> All right,

I go to the volcano eruption site.
And I take the kids.
And I write about the end of the world from the point of view of the generation that's gonna save it.
And we do a whole thing about how life is elemental, and all the software, and laptops, and apps in the world aren't gonna change that.
And we call it... You ready? iPocalypse.
Wow. Just wow.
It's good, right?
I mean, I think it could be a series,
Like the killer bees.
That is bold stuff.
You're not gonna say yes, are you?
No. Listen.
I think we should give you an online column.
That way, you'll be protected.
This is the way we live now.
If the paper goes down or gets sold, you'll still be safe.
You'll be viral.
Don't keep me around out of...
I am not!
Out of sympathy. I mean, I hate sympathy.
I'm sick of sympathy.
I know.
- You know what?
- Bad things happen. You just keep going.
I quit.
Benjamin. You lost your wife, man.
In some quarters, sympathy would be considered the appropriate response.
No, I'm not gonna sit around here and spin my wheels and live in a state of sponsored pity.
Please! Let me lay you off so you can get the benefits!
That's more sympathy! No!
I quit.
And I love you. And those patched elbows.

<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> Frame's a little loose.
I...
Just give me one second.
I'm fine with my squeaky window, Mr. Mee.
In fact, I rather enjoy it.
Besides today's theft, there's a darkness here that we need to deal with.
Mr. Devereaux, Dylan's art teacher, wanted you to see his wall mural.
We encourage creativity at the school.
There's a nice treatment of the word "love".
A whimsical portraiture of recycling.
A hard-hitting exposé about world peace.
Here is the great Bob Marley.
Though we don't endorse all that he stood for.
Sunflowers.
And guess which one is your son's.
We're a three-strike school, Mr. Mee, and today was his fourth strike.
I'm sorry. We have to expel Dylan.
But, as one parent to another, I...
I would examine his inner life.
Let's go.
It's like he was expelling me for my artwork.
I can almost live with the artwork.
I mean, if Charles Manson needed a personal muralist, you'd be the guy.
But no, he didn't expel you because of the artwork.
He expelled you because you stole.
You stole!
It breaks my heart.
Always lasagna.
Dad, someday you're gonna have to eat some of that lasagna.
Honey...
Or throw it away.
<font color="#bb00bb">(CHUCKLES)</font>
Hey, why didn't you go to Sadie's for the play date, sweetie?
No reason. Lots to do here.
Hey, Rosie?
Am I doin' anything right?
You're handsomer than the other dads.
Lots of them don't have hair.
So that's good.

We have a full day of house hunting planned and I think you'll be very excited at what's available.
We just want new. We want new...
New everything.
New opportunities, new schools, just new.
In the current economic environment, you're gonna find that now, the buyer is now the king.
But what I'm hopin' for is like a big backyard.
Substantial, you know, just rolling hills.
It's gonna be very hard to find rolling hills in the city.
- It just... It's just not available!
- Right, well...
I mean, stationary hills. We...
The hills don't have to roll, right, honey?
- Yeah?
- Just new.
Know what? It's all about new.
People love new.
I love new. Hell, I'm new!
Excuse my language, but I'm new.

Our mommy died.
Oh, wow.
My condolences go out to you and your family, Mr. Mee.
Uh... Wow.

- He didn't know Mommy.
- I know, but he should have.
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Just knowing you, Rosie, right now,
I love your mom.
I love her. You know how I picture her?
I picture your face on a grown lady.

And so, our adventure begins.

I mean, what would we do with 18 acres?
<font color="#808080">STEVENS:</font> I'm gonna be honest with you.
The Rosemoor property has some challenges.

<font color="#808080">STEVENS:</font> True, but this situation...

Wait a second. Is that it?
- Yes.
- Rosie.
- And... <font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> - Look.
<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> You don't have to take a picture, Rosie.
Why not?
'Cause we're gonna live here.
Mr. Mee, we have to talk, okay?
Let's not rush into things. Let's not...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Mr. Mee, right now,
I think we're jumpin' the gun.
This is exactly what we've been looking for.
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Let's... Let's just take it all in first.
Don't take a gift that's not given to you yet, now. All right?
This place is perfect.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Well, that's a bit complicated.
Well, complicated's okay.
Complicated can be great.

<font color="#bb00bb">(LION GROWLING)</font>
- It was a fully function...
<font color="#bb00bb">(ROARS)</font>
Whoo!
- Okay.
- Man.
Totally scary.
This was a fully functioning zoo until two years ago.
Then it was shut down.
The estate's been maintaining it for now, you know, just to keep it up.
- Keep it goin', you know?
- Well, I mean, could I, you know, buy the property and then just relocate the animals?
Well, actually, the estate is sellin' the property with the stipulation that whoever comes on board and buys the property is going to care and maintain these endangered animals.
Oh, come on.
And then there's the remaining staff on board and, you know.
If no one buys this property soon, these animals will probably have to be...
- Well.
- Well.
Thanks. I mean, I don't know anything about animals and zoos.
- I mean, it's a...
- It is.
- It is what it is.
- It is what it is.
Sometimes you don't know what it is until you see what it is.
You know? Once you see what it is, then you can figure out, is it what it is?
You understand?
- No, but we can move on.
- Yeah.
It's just... It's just too bad.
Yeah.
- So we keep on lookin'. Right, Rosie?
- Yeah.
Oh, God.
Great, I keep her home from school one day and she gets eaten!

I said "human" interaction.
This is what happens when people have a you-know-what occur in their lives.
They wake up one day and they say,
"I'm gonna quit my job and try something completely different with my life.."
But then they wake up another day.
And they say to themselves, " Thank God"
"my older brother didn't let me blow
Dad's inheritance"
"by buying a broken-down zoo in the country,"
"nine miles from the nearest Target store.."
But maybe my older brother didn't see this place.
- Gracias, Lupe.
- Look.
This is... This is simple destiny.
The place makes 75% of its revenue in the summertime.
If I can get an inspection set for the end of June, right?
I'll be open by July.
It's only February right now.
It's a lot of work, but
I think I can do it.
Duncan, you should have seen Rosie.
Look, do... I'm beggin' you, do what other people do. Go to Vegas.
Lose a little bit of money.
Or do what I did, when Sheila left me.
Start handicappin' horses?
Well, now, that was a little misguided.
Go into the commercial shrimping business and call myself Captain Dunk.
Start cliff diving in Acapulco at the age of 38.
I miss Sheila, man.
I know, man, I know.
All right, forget that.
Forget all that. Don't do what I did.
Travel the stages of grief.
Yet, stop just before zebras get involved.
It's only two zebras.
And a lion. And a jaguar.
And 47 other species, seven of which are endangered.
And all of them are saved the second we make this deal.
The kids are gonna be so psyched.
- Really? Psyched?
- Yeah.
Are they really gonna be psyched?
You're freakin' kidding me! It's a zoo!
Well, yeah.
Look, these animals need somebody to rescue them.
The... The animals need to be...
Dad, my friends are here! Our life is here!
Whoa! Man, you got expelled! All right?
What am I gonna do?
What am I supposed to...
- What, I'm gonna home-school you?
- No.
Right. So what did we talk about?
A new place.
A new start.
This is what you want.

It's a zoo. I'm moving to a zoo.
We bought a zoo!
Yes, we did. We did buy a zoo.

<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> All right, let's let this shirt start over!
Okay, two more left.
A good one. Oldie but a goodie.

She did. This was a...
It started out as mine, but she kind of adopted it.
But it's got rips and everything everywhere.

Okay, guys, this is the whole storage side of the house!
And we got a back door to the kitchen.

That is a new smell! Wow!

See, this is all the snake food, right?
I miss our home.
And what we do... Dyl, check this out.
What we do...
They're frozen, I guess, and you feed 'em to the snakes.
Hi. Kelly Foster, Head Zookeeper.
Right.
This is Robin Jones. Peter MacCready.
- Yep.
- Robin's our craftsman.
And that's Crystal, our capuchin.
And Peter is our visionary.
He built the enclosures that set the standards for modern zoos all across America.
And the world.
Yeah, and the world, yes.
And Peter and Robin do...
Well, they basically do everything.
Except for the books and the telephone.
That's Rhonda over there.
This is my cousin Lily. She's 13.
She can't legally work here, so we pay her cash under the table out of my salary.
<font color="#808080">BENJAMIN:</font> Hi, Lily.

This is Rosie, my daughter.
And my big boy, Dylan. And our dog, Leon.
And this is our zoo now, I guess.
And...
Love the house, smells and all. Right?
So I would like to declare us all modern-day adventurers.
And sponsors of animal greatness.
Okay, terrific. Let's go.
- Dad?
- Yep, got it.
Can we see the otters?
I'd love to see the otters.
And the snakes, and the monkeys.
How old are you?
Fourteen, I guess.

So, when you get a second, there's a couple things
I need to go over with you about the upcoming inspection.
Yeah, the USDA inspector, Walt Ferris.
I'll kill him.
MacCready, stop.
This is Buster. He's our
650-pound North American grizzly.
He was 770, but...
But he's been stressed out.
You know, he's moody. We had him on Paxil, but can't afford it.
So he's occasionally depressed.
He can still rip your arm off, though.
Hey, there, Buster.

- Hi.
Talkin' to the animals has to be done in a super specific way.
You know, he doesn't have it yet, but he'll learn.
Where'd you get your shoes?
And how much did they cost?
You know, we have one Target and it's nine...

I thought they would roar like Solomon the Lion.
No, tigers and lions are very different.

<font color="#bb00bb">(BENJAMIN CHUFFING)</font>
Oh, my God.
That guy there, that's Spar.
He's our eldest. He's 17.
He's a Bengal tiger.
You know, tigers have special sensors in the front of their two-inch canines.
They can actually detect the pulse in your aorta.
So when they attack, they bite you, take your pulse with their teeth, reposition those suckers and boom, there goes your carotid.
Wow.
Yeah.
So there's a few decisions you'll have to make straightaway, Ben.
Benjamin. Ben was my dad.
Spar, who you just met, the tiger?
He's gonna need some special care, so we have a large animal vet coming from San Diego.
It's just that he's a fortune to get here and...
That's okay, I'll pay.
Well, no, he... He's also very old, so the truth is, we don't really know how much longer he's got and I...
Just set it up. What else do we have?
Rickety posts.
Beak rot in the tortoises.
A weak enclosure between the jaguars and the tigers.
They don't get along. We've...
Okay, why don't we start with the posts.
- Okay, the posts.
- The posts in the cages?
The posts in what?
Look, they're not called cages, they're called enclosures.
They haven't been called cages in like a century.
My brief marriage, that was a cage.
Not mine.
I have a question for you.
You're some random guy from the city.
No one in the zoo community has ever heard of you.
You know nothing about animals.
And you've moved into a dump.
I mean, what kind of regular person just up and buys a place like this?
Especially somebody with kids. Why?
You have no idea what we've been dealing with here.
We used to have three times the staff.
They all quit.
I'm 28. I never go out.
I'm here every day.
My girlfriends, they text me, they're out livin' their lives, meeting guys named Brett, and I'm here shovellin' shit.
Bear shit!
I'm pathetic!
I had to move back in with my mother.
No one gets paid, Ben... jamin.
We need somebody who can really take charge of this place or else we and all these animals are gone.
So your question is?
Why did you buy this place?
Why not?
You comin'?

A new medication, so let me just...
Make sure that this gets in his food

That gun-slinging, sharp-shooting honey-pie of the Wild West.
He has traveled the world and baffled the crown princes of Europe.
- He will amaze! He will astound!
The Great and Powerful Oz!
I always knew that I was destined for show business.
And now look at me.
A magician's assistant.
To think, an hour ago I was just selling oil cakes on the midway.
Yes, well, opportunity comes when you least expect it, my dear.
Wow! What a get-up.
- You won't need this.
- Oh.
You are playing the simple country girl.
Oh!
A gift in honor of your debut.
Oh!
Now, this belonged to my grandmother.
A tsarina from Mirkutsk, and a decorated war hero.
Your grandmother?
Yes. She was killed in battle, the poor thing.
Which battle?
- Which battle?
- Uh-huh.
Well, there are so many.
You've heard of the Battle of Kreplach?
No.
No? Good.
That's where she died.
And this music box was the only thing to survive.
But I know that Grammie would want you to have it.
- Professor.
Frank!
The sock is on the door.
We're rehearsing.
How many times do
I have to tell you to knock?
Knock.
I knocked.
- What is it?
- Showtime.
Why didn't you say something?
Only a half a house.
Here's the take.
Pitiful.
All right, this is your cut.
For you, the applause will be approbation enough.
Well, how do you think I feel?
A man of my talents,
I should be playing the Orpheum Circuit!
Instead of some dusty podunk in a second-hand jacket falling apart at the seams.
You're gonna have to patch this thing again.
- Again?
- Yeah.
- Let's go. Hat!
- Hat.
- Hat. Okay.
- You're the new girl, huh?
- Yes.
Good, we needed a new one.
The last one left us.
Poor thing.
Suffered from a broken heart.
Attack. Heart attack.
But she's resting comfortably now in Abilene expected to make a full recovery.
Perhaps you'd like to join her.
Now, remember, when I ask for a volunteer...
I raise my hand.
You are overqualified for this job, my dear.
Let's go make some magic.
Ladies and gentlemen, the show has already begun.
There are still a few seats left.
Don't miss your chance to see
Oz, the Great and Powerful!
Journey with me now, across those deserts to the mystical lands of the Arabian Peninsula.
For 5,000 years, her lonely spirit has been trapped.
But tonight, we will attempt to free her.
I shall require a volunteer from the audience.
Anyone.
Anyone.
How about you, madam?
Oh! Yes, I would like to volunteer.
How kind of you. Please.
Just remember what I told you.
A simple country girl, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, you have nothing to fear, just so long as you believe.
For when you do believe anything is possible.
You are growing sleepy.
Your eyelids become heavy.
Sleep!
Come, Fernanda!
Allow yourself to merge with this woman before me.
Can you hear me, oh, Queen Fernanda?
Yes.
Then rise.
Rise!
I command you to rise!
Rise from your tomb of sand.
Rise as your spirit...
I see a wire!
You are mistaken, sir.
I am not!
There is a wire!
There is a wire holding her up!
A wire?
I see it, too.
It's right there.
Clear as day.
Can't you see 'em?
He's fooling us.
A wire!
What need have I of wires?
Frank.
Make me walk!
What's that?
Make me walk.
Not now, kid. Let us leave the wonders...
But I believe in you.
Look, it's not much, but it's all that we have.
Whatever you could do.
I would make you walk, it's just...
It's just that...
Well, go on, then.
Make the girl walk.
Make the kid walk.
Come on, you big phony.
Yeah, come on!
I would make her walk, of course, but unfortunately there is a distemper in the ether tonight.
Make the kid walk, you big phony.
You see?
I'm sorry, but...
Thank you. Thank you.
Oz, the Great and Powerful.
Why didn't you close the damn curtain sooner?
I was dying out there.
There was nothing you could have done.
I didn't really think it was that bad.
Of course not.
You're just a trained monkey.
You know, you shouldn't be so mean to me all the time, Professor.
After all,
I'm the only friend you've got.
Friend?
You're not my friend, Frank.
I don't need a friend.
What I need is someone who knows when to close the damn curtain.
It's a woman.
Ah! Finally some good news.
You want me to wind up a music box?
No.
Not for this one, Frank.
Hey, Annie.
Hello, Oscar.
Hmm.
You look lovely.
Thank you.
What is this? Gingham?
You know it is.
It was a wonderful show.
Oh, don't tell me you watched that debacle.
I don't know why you didn't just tell that poor girl the truth.
What truth? That I'm a fake?
They would have had my head.
And worse, they would have demanded a refund.
Come on, have a seat.
I'll get you some tea.
- Ooh!
It's been a long time.
I haven't seen you since...
The last time you rolled into town.
It's not often enough, Oscar, seeing you once every few months.
Well, it is a traveling circus.
How's everything on the farm?
How's your ma?
She didn't send me a pie this time.
I hope she's not mad.
I meant to write.
I need to tell you something, Oscar.
That's never a good start to a conversation.
John Gale asked me to marry him.
That's why I've come.
I thought you should know.
Oh.
I think that's...
That's wonderful, Annie.
I said I had to think about it.
Oh, men love that answer.
I wondered what you thought I should do.
You could do a lot worse than John Gale.
He's a good man.
So are you.
No.
I'm not.
I'm many things, but a good man is not one of them.
But you could be.
If you wanted to.
Well, that's just it.
I don't want to.
See, Kansas is full of good men.
Church-going men that get married and raise families.
Men like John Gale.
Men like my father, who spent his whole life tilling the dirt just to die facedown in it.
I don't want that, Annie.
I don't want to be a good man,
I want to be a great one.
I want to be Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison all rolled into one.
That's all I ever wanted for you, you know.
Greatness.
Then you understand.
I do.
But do you?
Uh, Professor, you need to look outside.
No, Vlad, please.
It was his grandmother's.
- Ahl
I'm gonna rip him in half!
- No, please!
- Get off!
It was just his grandmother's music box.
It meant nothing.
Oz!
I have to go.
Congratulations on the engagement.
Oscar.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Oz!
I'm gonna rip your head off!
Zim Zallah Bim!
Oz!
There he is!
He's out here!
No, Vlad! Don't hurt him!
Vlad!
- Vlad, no!
- Whoa!
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!
I'm gonna crush you!
Oz! Where are you going?
Mr. Baum, I'll catch up with you in Milwaukee.
Half of that balloon is mine!
And the other half is mine!
All right, you loafers!
Roll up those tents!
Oz!
- No, no, no.
- You're not getting away!
Where's my thing?
Come here.
Get him down, Clowny.
No, you don't!
Oh, no, you don't!
Ah!
So long, sucker!
Get back here!
Oz!
Oz, you're gonna need these!
Throw it! Now!
- Hat!
- Hat!
Ha-ha!
You're a dead man!
Farewell!
Au revoir! Auf Wiedersehen!
Run!
Run!
No, no, no, no, no! No!
Whoa!
Please, I don't wanna die!
I haven't accomplished anything yet!
Just get me out of here and I'll do great things!
Please! Give me a chance!
I promise!
I promise. I can change.
Thank you. Thank you!
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Oh, no!
No, no. No, no.
Come on, buddy.
I can't swim.
No! I can't swim.
Somebody, help me!
Thank goodness.
I thought I was dead.
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?
There is still hope for me!
You won't regret this!
I saw you fall from the sky.
Oh. Uh... Yes, my balloon hit, uh, an inverted thermal.
I couldn't compensate.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Oh. It's actually quite nice.
I'd be more concerned with the River Fairies.
Their teeth are small, but very sharp.
River Fairies?
What's a River Fairy?
- Ow!
Ow! Get off!
Ow! Ow!
Psst. Psst.
Go on, get out of here.
Spiteful little things, aren't they?
Where...
Where am I, exactly?
Where do you think you are?
I have no idea. It's...
It's like no place
I've ever seen.
You're in Oz.
Oz?
But that's my name.
Oscar Zoroaster
Phadrig Isaac Norman
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.
But everyone calls me Oz.
I knew it!
The king's prophecy was true.
He said that a great wizard bearing the name of our land will descend from the heavens, and save us all.
And here you are.
Here to claim your throne.
"Claim my throne"?
You mean, like a king's throne?
Well, yes. Because you will be our king.
Your king?
Like, in a palace with a crown and a scepter?
Yes, a beautiful scepter and a grand palace.
Oh. And you will save all the people.
Was that a gold scepter?
Yes, there's more gold than you could ever imagine.
And Oz will now be what it once was.
Because you are the Wizard, aren't you?
Yes.
I'm the Wizard.
- What was that?
- The Wicked Witch's minions.
They've been sent here to kill you.
Kill me?
A wicked witch? What?
- Oh!
We better hurry or your reign will be over before it's begun!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Oh! Whoa!
- Oh!
Come on!
In there!
Give me your leg.
- Huh?
Oh... Perhaps the Wicked Witch has summoned them back.
I don't think I like witches.
What?
I... I, too, am a witch.
I am Theodora the Good.
You're not a witch.
Of course I am.
Where are all your warts?
Where's your broom?
What would I do with a broom?
Fly.
With a broom?
Never mind.
You were afraid?
Yes.
That something might happen to you.
So, this Wicked Witch, just how wicked is she?
She's as wicked as they come.
She poisoned her own father.
That's pretty wicked.
He was a king and a wizard, like you.
But she wanted the throne all to herself.
Poor man.
But my sister chased her away from the Emerald City.
I can't wait for her to meet you.
She was starting to doubt you'd ever come but now she'll see.
And you're going to fix everything.
Yeah.
You know what I think we need?
A little music.
Is that magic?
In a way.
It's a music box.
You've never seen one?
Well, this belonged to my grandmother.
A tsarina from Mirkutsk.
Go on.
I want you to have it.
No one's ever given me anything just because they wanted to.
A pretty girl like you?
With the visage of Helen of Troy, no less?
I'm sure you have dozens of admirers.
You don't know much about witches, do you?
Maybe not, but I'm told
I'm a fast learner.
May I have this dance, milady?
Now you're gonna tell me no one's ever asked you to dance before.
No one ever has.
Then it's high time that you learned.
Put your hand here.
And your other hand here.
Nice, isn't it?
Yes.
It's incredible.
Yeah.
Here I thought
I'd live a lonely life and then you showed up.
Not only are you the Wizard but you're the person
I belong with.
Well, we sure get along. And...
And?
And.
Like you said, we belong together.
Oh! I was hoping you would say that.
- Yeah.
Help me!
Somebody, save me!
That poor little creature.
Wizard, we must save him.
Somebody, help me.
Oh, no, no, no.
Allow the Wizard.
Help me!
Come on!
Of course I'll save this little talking monkey in a bellhop's uniform.
You, mister!
Please, hurry up.
Do you have anything sharp?
Like a knife or something.
How about your teeth?
What kind of teeth you got?
Calm down, it's gonna be all right.
You gotta get me out of these vines.
Calm down.
I'm gonna die.
It's gonna eat me.
Don't worry. These vines aren't gonna eat you.
Not the vines, the lion!
- Lion?
We're gonna die.
- We're gonna die!
Eat him first!
Eat him first!
Zim Zallah Bim!
Be gone, coward!
Fear my greatness!
- You were wonderful, Wizard.
"Wizard"?
You mean the prophecy was true?
Indeed.
All right, well,
I've saved the day.
It was nothing, just a little prestidigitatic display.
- Shall we to the palace?
- Oh! Yes.
Good day, sir.
Wait, please, sir.
My name is Finley.
My master's home was ransacked by the Wicked Witch's baboons.
And I've been hiding in these woods ever since.
But now you've saved my life, oh, Wizard.
So I hereby swear a life debt to you.
No... No need.
From this moment on I shall be your loyal and faithful servant until death.
Well, he is cute.
All right, you're hired.
Wonderful.
Let's shake on it.
My bag, monkey.
Surely.
You must travel light.
I got it.
You two run along.
It's the Emerald City.
Just down this hill, along the Yellow Brick Road.
Wow.
It'll all be ours now.
It's a good thing green is my favorite color.
You are going to make the best king Oz has ever known.
Thank you.
And I will be so proud to be your queen.
My queen?
We'll spend a lifetime together.
But right now, there's thousands of people in Oz waiting to witness your miracles.
Thousands?
That's a big show.
Phew!
What now, Wizard?
Monkey, tell me again about that life debt.
- I devote my life to you.
- Mmm-hmm.
Whatever you wish, whatever you want.
It is my sworn duty to deliver for you
- until the end of my days.
- Mmm-hmm.
And there's no getting out of it?
None, sir.
It is irrevocable.
Good.
Because I'm not the Wizard.
Oh, sir, your sense of humor is as boundless as it is wondrous.
- You remind me...
- Monkey.
I'm not the Wizard.
Well, you could have told me before I sealed the life debt.
It's too late.
You got to come clean for that innocent young girl.
I'll deal with her later.
As my new assistant all you need to know are the three "ups".
Show up, keep up, shut up.
But...
What's the third "up"?
Right. Now, listen,
I'm depending on you.
We need to convince the good people of Oz that they've found their wizard.
Hello, Knuck.
Theodora, we've been expecting you.
I shall blow a fanfare.
No, no, no, no.
No. Not now.
This is the Wizard.
How do you do, sir?
- This is the Wizard?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.
- Halt.
All hail the Wizard.
All hail the Wizard.
All hail the Wizard.
The mightiest of mighties.
The greatest, most powerful and most genuine of real and true wizards.
Thank you.
A wizard above scrutiny with no covert agenda or subversive intention whatsoever.
- Okay.
- A wizard of the highest moral rectitude.
He's just a real, good, solid wizard, everyone.
The Wizard, here he is.
How'd I do?
Forward, march!
Hello? Guys?
Can I get in the carriage?
Can I please get in the carriage?
- I shall blow a fanfare.
- Not now.
Is that it? Is that my throne?
Do you like it?
I do so hope you like it, because I've been personally watching over it awaiting your arrival.
Oh...
Much obliged.
Praise be you are here at last and the prophecy shall be fulfilled.
Oh, this is a glorious day for us all.
And may I add, you're as handsome a king as we've ever had.
Flatterer.
Who is this fetching woman?
This is my sister.
I am Evanora, the royal advisor.
I have been protecting the Emerald City whilst we awaited your arrival.
I am here to serve you as I served the king before you.
Well, I look forward to being served.
Oh, sister, I like him already.
Oh... My scepter.
Oh, yes, go on then, have a seat.
How does it feel?
Fits like a glove.
Goodness.
Knuck will show you to your chambers and then we can, uh...
We can chat more later.
Can't wait. Monkey, my bag.
Yes, Wizard, right away, oh, great and powerful one.
- Thank you, sourpuss.
- Whoa!
My name is Knuck!
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?
You dare escort that oaf in here and allow him to climb on the hallowed throne?
And why not?
He is the Wizard.
"The Wizard." Or so he says.
Did it not occur to you that he might be an imposter in league with the Wicked Witch and sent here to kill us?
The Wicked Witch?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not the one who's underestimating her cleverness.
Or maybe it's you
I'm underestimating.
Have you finally joined her side, sister?
I am on no one's side.
You know that.
I simply want peace.
It's all I ever wanted, and the Wizard can do that.
He's a good man.
What do you know about goodness?
Deep down, you are wicked.
I am not wicked!
That temper really is wasted on you.
Do you honestly think that I could conspire against you with her?
You are my sister and I love you.
All right.
But I do need proof that he is who he claims to be.
But he has already proven himself.
Not to me, he hasn't.
Thank you for the tour.
It's my job.
Giving tours?
Taking care of the king.
Of course.
And on that note
I was thinking it might be nice to have a royal feast.
Maybe a grand roast.
You know, my sister has been telling me that your magic is really quite powerful.
Oh, really?
Yes, uh, boggling to the minds of all who witness it.
Oh, I do wish I could see it for myself.
- Yes.
Why not show me now?
- Now?
- Here.
All things in good time.
And a good time for all things.
So wise. So true.
Well, um, there is one last room that I would like you to see.
The royal treasure of Oz.
It belongs to whoever is king.
It's all right, Wizard.
Go and enjoy your riches.
It's mine!
Mine!
Oh, no more second-hand suits for you, baby!
Nothing but the silks and satins!
Ali Baba!
And one of these things!
What is this?
- A chalice.
- A chalice!
I've always wanted a chalice.
And now I've got one.
Well, uh, not quite yet.
You see, you only become the king after you defeat the Wicked Witch.
That's the prophecy.
And since you haven't done that yet, you're not...
- I'm not actually king.
- Not yet, no.
You still have to get rid of the Wicked Witch.
Right.
And killing her won't be easy.
No, I don't suppose it will be.
Mmm.
Wait a minute.
No one said anything about killing anybody.
Oh. Well, if you're not interested in being king that's all right with me.
We can just forget about the whole thing.
The gold and the rubies, the chalice.
I'm interested!
I'm just not too keen on killing a lady.
She's not a lady.
She's a wicked witch.
And your magic is the only thing strong enough to destroy her.
All you have to do is journey to the Dark Forest and destroy her wand.
- Her wand.
- Yes.
It's the source of all her power.
Without it, she dies.
I haven't even said goodbye to Theodora. She will be upset.
I will talk to her in the morning.
I will tell her how much you love her...
No.
No, don't...
Don't say anything.
All right. I will say whatever it is you want me to say but are you going to save us all or not?
I'm your wizard.
We're really gonna do this?
How hard could it be to kill a wicked witch?
Hard. Really hard.
It's very, very hard to kill a wicked witch.
And what about that poor girl back there?
I think she really liked you.
She'll get over me.
They always do.
She's a pretty young witch.
There'll be plenty of wizards knocking at her door.
Oh, every lie you tell gets us one step closer to the Emerald City dungeon.
Then don't think of them as lies.
Think of them as stepping stones on the road to greatness.
Wait, I got it.
We'll turn around and go back.
You'll come clean.
You apologize for lying about being the Wizard and for lying to that poor girl. Okay?
You gotta really seem contrite. You gotta sell it.
Maybe you could even cry.
Can you cry? I could cut up an onion.
We're not going back.
We're gonna find this wicked witch, steal her wand,
I'll get that big pile of gold and you can have a nice pile of bananas, all right?
Bananas.
Oh, I see.
Because I'm a monkey,
I must love bananas, right?
That is a vicious stereotype.
- You don't like bananas?
- Of course I love bananas.
I'm a monkey, don't be ridiculous.
I just don't like you saying it.
How about this?
We offer to wash all the windows in the Emerald City
- for an entire year.
- Uh-huh.
They'd have to forgive us.
Or we could give them a little help with their infrastructure.
I noticed some yellow brick potholes back there.
That looks bad.
We're not going down there.
Someone might need our help.
Not that you care.
Get back here!
You get back here!
We gotta get the Wicked Witch.
What are we doing over here?
What happened here?
Hello?
- Hey, there.
- Are you all right?
Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.
This is Finley.
Hi.
My name is Oz.
Are you...
Are you the Wizard?
Oh, you...
You've heard of me.
Everyone has.
Good. Then you know there's nothing to be afraid of.
So, just come on out of there.
But I can't.
Oh. All right, hold on.
Get this off of you.
Oh, no.
I'll never get back together.
Don't worry.
I think I have something.
Give me that bag.
I, uh, packed something...
There it is.
What is that?
Magic in a bottle.
Magic?
Let's give it a try.
All right.
Just give it a little dab.
Like so.
Okay.
Should work.
There we go.
Ta-da!
Oh, no, no, no!
They're coming back!
It's okay.
They're gone.
- The Wicked Witch sent them.
- Why?
Last night.
The whole town was celebrating out in the streets because we had heard that you finally arrived.
Me?
Everyone was so happy.
But then...
But then those things flew in.
And then...
And then they...
Here we go.
Last piece.
Would you like to try to stand?
There.
All right.
There we go.
Easy.
Okay.
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Oh!
Okay.
Now walk to me.
I don't think I can.
I think you can.
Come on.
All right.
You did it.
Thank you.
"Dark Forest."
All right, this is it.
Just head on down that way, about two, three hours.
You'll hit the Emerald City.
Tell them I sent you, they'll take great care of you.
Nice meeting you.
But.
I wanna go with you.
What?
Aw...
On a witch hunt?
No, you're just a little girl.
I'm not as delicate as I look!
That didn't hurt.
I'm coming with you.
Listen, we have one rule in show business.
Never work with kids or animals.
And I'm already working with this thing.
- Relax.
The answer's no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't...
Don't do that.
You're fine.
You're gonna leave me alone.
Look, you're...
You're fine.
On a road in the middle of nowhere?
All you have to do is take the Yellow Brick Road.
You'll get there.
It's crying again, what do I do?
Oh, no.
Off. Come on. Off.
Off of there!
Scat! Get off!
Please let me come with you.
No! Get off of there!
I promise I won't bother you!
No dolls on the witch hunt!
- Please, let me come!
- Fine.
Fine!
If you wanna come, come.
We'll all go, it'll be a big party.
Great. Let's go kill ourselves a witch!
You'll die, you'll die, you'll die!
Did those crows just say that we were gonna die?
They did.
Wizard?
Come on.
I'm scared.
Think there are ghosts out here?
No. Of course not.
Evil spirits maybe?
The undead?
The undead?
Will you stop that?
No. Get off!
Something's got my tail.
Something's got my tail!
Will you calm down?
No! What is it?
- Look out!
- I wanna go home!
I wanna go home!
- Hey!
- Hat!
Thanks.
Look out!
- Come on.
Hate the Dark Forest.
Hate the Dark Forest.
Oh, my gosh. That was close.
Where are we?
This must be the place.
So, how are you gonna kill the Wicked Witch?
All I need to do is get her magic wand.
Once I destroy that, she's finished.
Why don't you just use this?
- It's got a knife!
- Where'd you get that?
I'm made of china.
I gotta protect myself somehow.
Give me that.
- Hey!
- Honestly.
- "Honestly" yourself.
Look.
That must be her.
Come on.
She put down the wand.
But how are we gonna get it?
Hey!
Now, listen up.
Here's the plan.
The Wicked Witch is the triangle.
Monkey, you're the X.
I'm the O.
China Girl, you're the squiggly line.
I wanna be a heart.
Can I be a heart?
All right, fine.
You're a heart.
Okay, now, heart stays here as O makes his way over here.
X counters thusly.
Clear so far?
Bless you.
Good work. You just sneezed away the plan.
- Sorry.
- Never mind.
Just go over there and make some of your animal noises.
I'll grab the wand when she's not looking.
Get out of here.
Yes! Come on, come on.
Oh, no!
Moo!
Moo!
Moo!
A cow?
Moo!
Come on. Come on.
- Hurry!
- I got it!
- Break it.
- Break it, Wizard.
- All right.
- Break it!
Did you say "Wizard"?
No!
Are you really the Wizard?
Um... That's a complicated question.
I mean, what is a wizard? I...
Um...
Yes.
I'm the Wizard.
Then there's hope.
What's going on?
Not sure.
I sneezed the plan away.
I have waited so long to meet you.
So, we've never met?
Certainly not.
I'd remember a thing like that.
You've never been to Kansas?
What is Kansas?
Is that where you're from?
My, you must have traveled very far to get to the Land of Oz.
I did.
I'm Glinda the Good.
The Witch of the South.
I thought Evanora was the Good Witch.
Evanora is the true Wicked Witch.
Conniving and as cruel as they come.
She's fooled most everyone, including her own sister.
She made everyone believe that I poisoned my father
- but it was her.
- Then, she's the one who destroyed my village?
I'm so sorry, child.
Here's your wand.
Sorry I mooed.
And to think, you almost killed Glinda for a bit of gold.
A bit?
There were mountains of it, buddy.
Not that I was going to do it.
I wasn't really going to break your wand.
Follow me.
Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
It cannot be.
Curse you, Glinda.
You should be dead.
I'll see you dead yet.
Curse you and your pretty little face.
Sister.
Sister, the Wizard is missing.
I've looked everywhere, but he's gone.
What is it?
Where is the Wizard?
Where's the Wizard?
With Glinda.
Then it's happening.
Oh, sister, he's fulfilling the prophecy.
He'll bring her darkness to the light and peace to the land.
Yes, I'm certain that's what is happening. It must be.
Where did you get that?
This?
Oh.
It was a gift. From him.
He came to my chambers last night.
Oh, how we danced.
- For hours, it seemed.
Oh, I can still feel his body pressed against mine.
Oh, sister, you were right about him.
He is the great Wizard.
He must be, to make me feel the way I feel.
Oh, no.
Not you, too, sister?
He said we would rule Oz together.
He said I would be his queen.
Did he?
Are you quite sure it wasn't you who said it to him?
You fool!
Serves you right.
I want Glinda and that wizard torn to shreds.
Do not fail me a second time.
Fly!
On the day my father died, we lost a kind and noble leader.
And a dark shadow was cast across this land.
I've had to stand alone against Evanora and watch as towns were destroyed, children were orphaned and my heart was broken.
I've been unable to protect the good people of Oz by myself.
With only faith in my father's prophecy, I've waited.
For you.
Great Wizard from Kansas, to come and set things right.
Oh.
So, that's the prophecy.
Um...
Well, you see, when I agreed to be king,
I didn't realize how complicated all of this was.
She knows.
What?
Evanora knows you know the truth now. Look.
Oh, no.
Uh...
What do we do?
Wizard, now is the time.
The time?
Use your magic.
Oh...
My magic. Yes. Uh...
I think we should run.
Run?
Yeah.
You heard the Wizard. Run!
Let's get out of here!
Let's go!
They're gaining on us!
What are you doing?
Is... Is that gonna stop them?
I don't know.
Nice work. We lost them.
Phew! That was close.
Yeah.
Wait, I hear something.
They're getting closer!
Wait for me!
Look out!
Monkey!
Little China Girl!
Wizard! I'm over here!
- Help! Catch me, please!
- Got you!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
I'm okay, too.
Just go!
Great! A bunch of fog.
This is her big idea on how to save us?
Well, it was the best I could do under the circumstances.
Uh...
Oh, okay.
Whoa!
Catch her!
Get me! Don't let go!
Monkey, grab her!
Don't let go!
Don't let go!
Pull my tail. Ow!
Not so hard.
They're getting closer!
What do we do?
What do we do?
Just do what I do.
- Unless you've got something.
- Uh...
No, you go.
Wait. What are you doing?
Wanda!
Where are you going?
She said to do what she did.
Just because she jumped off the cliff, you're gonna jump off the cliff?
I have wings.
- What about me?
- Come on!
Um...
Whee!
Whoa! Oh! Oh!
Whoa!
Wow.
Whoa!
Oh! Oh, Oh, Oh!
These things go kind of fast, huh?
Hey, is... Is that a wall?
Of sorts.
It repels our enemies and protects us from harm.
But we're headed straight for it.
Yes, we are.
And going very fast.
How do you, uh...
Does this thing have any brakes? Uh...
I'm going too fast!
I'm gonna die!
You needn't worry, Wizard.
It's a magic wall.
And all good-hearted souls get to pass through.
I'm gonna die!
Wanda!
Oh!
It's beautiful.
They've waited a long time for you, Wizard.
All hail the great and powerful Oz!
Hail!
Thank you!
Wow, you're a wonderful crowd.
You put the "merry" back in
"the merry Land of Oz."
Hi, what's your name?
- You're very beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.
Girls, listen,
I am not a toy. I am not a toy!
- Oz! Oz!
- Hello!
What? No fireworks?
What are fireworks?
Remind me to show you sometime.
Glinda, I didn't know if you'd like these, or these.
They're both so beautiful,
I couldn't possibly decide.
We need your help, Wizard.
Please save us!
You know,
I should tell you, um...
I might not actually be a wizard.
Yes, I know.
Oh.
At least, not any kind of wizard we were expecting.
You could tell?
Yes.
I can also tell you're weak, selfish, slightly egotistical and a fibber.
I see.
Anything you don't know about me?
Whether or not you'll save my people.
No. I just told you
I'm not the Wizard.
But they don't know that.
If you can make them believe, then you're wizard enough.
These are desperate times, after all.
Can you make them believe?
Will I still get that gold?
Uh-huh.
Good people of Oz.
Your Wizard is here!
What's the matter, sister?
Look at how happy they are.
Do you think she'll be his queen?
Well, of course she'll be his queen.
- What did you expect?
You can't compete with Glinda's charms.
No one can.
Oh, God. Sister, it hurts.
Such is a broken heart.
Your precious wizard did that to you.
Make it stop.
Would you like me to?
One bite is all it takes.
One bite and your world will change forever.
One bite and your heart will become impenetrable.
One bite and you and I will finally share the throne.
Unless you'd rather see
Oz and Glinda there.
You're the wicked one.
Not Glinda.
Sister, you lied to me.
It's nice, isn't it?
How clear everything becomes.
What is happening to me?
Oh, it's just your heart withering away.
Fear not, Theodora, for soon you will feel nothing at all except beautiful wickedness.
Sister?
Oh, sister, you're hideous.
I can cast a simple enchantment and have you looking just the way you were before.
No!
This is who I am now.
I want him to see me like this.
I want him to know that he was the one who made me this way.
Oh, dear.
It's imperative that you behave like the great leader that they think you are.
Morale is essential if we have any hope of defeating Evanora.
- And I assume you have a plan.
- No.
You have a plan.
You're going to lead us into battle and take back the throne.
And do we have an army to help do this?
Of sorts.
The Quadlings, Your Highness.
You're soldiers?
No, sir. Farmers, mostly.
Farmers?
But you can fight.
No, sir.
Many of us can hoe.
Oh, you can hoe.
- And I can work with iron.
- That's good.
- I bake bread.
- Yummy.
- I can sew.
- Not so helpful.
I can make a scarecrow.
Ah!
Well, that'll come in handy.
- It might.
- Hmm.
And these are the Tinkers.
Are you kidding me?
We're tougher than we look, Wizard.
What they lack in stamina the Tinkers make up for in ingenuity.
They can build anything.
And I'll tell you what else.
We can build anything.
Yeah, I got it.
And we're prepared to storm the Emerald City.
If you don't keel over on the way there.
Ow!
And, finally, the Munchkins.
Please tell me, you gentlemen can fight.
No.
But we make pretty clothes.
Also, we sing.
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.
I like it,
I think it's cute. I hope you like it.

All right, enough.

Munchkins, stop!
- They do make beautiful clothes.
- All right.
Now, listen, Wanda.
Glinda.
Guys, um, take five.
Uh, Glinda, these are all very lovely people.
But do you honestly believe that they can kill a wicked witch and an army of flying baboons?
I don't expect them to kill anyone.
What do you mean?
I mean the good people of Oz are forbidden to kill.
Forbidden to...
You want me to lead an army that can't kill?
If this was easy, we wouldn't need a wizard, would we?
Somethings wrong!
- Look!
- What is that?
- The wall!
- What's happening?
The Wicked Witch isn't powerful enough to get through the wall.
It looks like she's managing.
Not by herself, she isn't.
What does that mean?
Is someone helping her?
Everyone, take cover!
Run quickly! Take cover!
Get the children to safety!
Run!
Glinda!
There's so much good here.
It sickens me.
Ah!
Still think your Wizard can save you from the likes of me?
Speak up, or I will tear out your tongue!
Now, who is that?
Don't you recognize me, Wizard?
Have I changed so much?
Theodora?
May I have this dance?
Huh?
Hey, hey!
I get it!
You're a little upset!
Theodora, stop.
You're hurting him.
Theodora, what happened to you?
You happened to me.
This isn't you.
It's your sister.
She's worked her magic on you.
I'd hoped you'd be able to see through her.
Oh, Glinda, so naive.
Just like your father.
That's why it was so easy for my sister to kill him.
She only killed a man, not what he believed in.
Begone, Witch, before the Wizard makes mush of you!
Oh.
How sweet.
You all believe in him.
Well, so did I, once.
And as for you my pretty one.
When I return with my sister and her army the Yellow Brick Road will be red with the blood of every Tinker, farmer and
Munchkin in your kingdom.
You underestimate us, Theodora.
We are a strong and united people.
And now the Wizard is here to lead us.
And as for your Wizard, he will be the first to die.
And you will all see that he is nothing but a deceitful, selfish and extremely mortal man.
Give me that!
It was a broom that you wanted.
Wasn't it, Wizard?
It's all right.
It's all right!
She's gone now.
Don't be frightened.
Now that the Wizard is with us...
Wizard?
Leaving?
But you promised to help us.
Yeah, well, that was before I knew what we were up against.
An army and yet another wicked witch?
This one bent on destroying everyone, especially me?
We can defeat them.
There must be something.
Something we haven't thought of.
Something that we're not seeing.
Something we're just on the verge of.
Glinda.
You need a real wizard.
Better yet, a general.
But you're all I have.
So, you're not the wizard
I was expecting.
So, you don't have the powers
I thought you'd have.
But you're here.
There must be a reason.
Maybe you're capable of more than you know.
Glinda, I wish
I had the answer.
But I'm just a con man.
I'm a carnival magician.
I'm just not the man you want me to be.
Someone needs to tuck me in.
Yes, of course.
Allow me.
My papa used to do it.
I see.
Perhaps you'd prefer the Wizard, then?
Yes, please.
All right.
In you go.
- Here you are.
- Uh-uh.
Just a moment.
Bring forth the covers now.
Yes, ma'am.
Comfy?
All right. Goodnight.
Do you grant wishes?
Do I what?
Grant wishes.
The old wizard could grant wishes.
Ah.
People would travel to the Emerald City and ask him for things.
And if they were good and noble wishes, he would grant them.
Is that right?
Do you know what I'd wish for?
Hmm. A pretty dress?
To have my family back.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I can't grant wishes.
I'm not that kind of wizard.
That's what I thought.
Um, you see, where I come from there aren't any real wizards.
Although, there is one.
Thomas Alva Edison.
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.
- Did he grant wishes?
- No.
But he could look into the future and make it real.
He created the electric light, the phonograph.
He created a camera that could take moving pictures.
Pictures that move?
Yeah. Can you imagine?
And all he had was a little bit of wire and some glass.
With almost nothing, he made the impossible real.
Is that the kind of wizard you are?
It's the kind of wizard
I'd like to be.
Well, you are that kind.
I can tell.
I'd rather you grant wishes, but that's a good wizard, too.
Goodnight, Wizard.
Glinda. I've got it.
What have you got?
I've got a way out of this mess.
- What is this?
- A battle plan.
It's all in there.
Illusion, misdirect, sleight of hand.
Look,
I know I'm not the wizard that you were expecting but I might just be the wizard that you need.
You said you were just a con man.
Precisely.
Nothing but a trickster?
Yes.
A terrible cheat?
The best there is.
The carnival magician's going to put on a show.
I'll put on the show of a lifetime.
The likes of which the Land of Oz has never seen!
Magic, mystery, prestidigitation!
It'll be my greatest trick yet.
Tinkers, gather around!
Quickly, now.
This is what you're gonna build.
Where I come from, this is called a praxinoscope.
Although, I've made a few modifications.
It allows you to project an image into space.
Impossible.
Nothing's impossible if you put your mind to it.
- Bully.
- Bully!
These three roads all lead to the Emerald City.
To the east are the deadly poppy fields.
- We'll have to steer clear of them.
- Why is that?
One good whiff and it's everlasting sleep.
And we're not exactly a terrifying army when we're awake.
All right.
We'll steer clear.
Or maybe not.
In the conjuring business, flash is always good.
Gives the audience a little "wow".
You gentlemen will be combining sulfur rock, nitrate of potash and charcoal to create what is commonly known as black powder.
Whoa!
Mr. Quimby, we need 200 bales of hay delivered to the main road by noon.
Mr. Zim, have the Quadling carts...
Looks good.
My very own Winkie Guards soon you will be facing Glinda and her army of weaklings.
And when they see our towering might,
- they will run and flee for the hills and...
- No!
We shall not let them flee!
We shall show them no mercy!
Now, I've added this adjustable lens to your design along with a few other things.
Have a look.
Yes! Edison himself would be proud.
Now, there's something else
I need you to do.
But I'd rather you just keep it between us.
Yes?
Do you know how to build a hot air balloon?
This is all very impressive but you still haven't told me how you plan to get this thing into the Emerald City.
Relax. I know someone.
What do you mean you know someone?
Hello, Wizard.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't old Sourpuss.
My name is Knuck!
Now, you two be nice to each other.
- Let's move it, Wizard.
- Can you give me a break?
I'll break your nose!
Guess I'm up.
Time to do what I do, right?
Cue the con man.
Would you stop? A con man couldn't have done all this.
You're much more than that.
Well, then, it looks like
I've got you fooled, too.
The only person you've got fooled is yourself.
For protection.
Not that you need it.
Great people of Oz.
Today we fight to free the land from the villainy of the Wicked Witches.
We are few but we are mighty!
- Quadlings.
- Tinkers.
- Bully!
- Munchkins.
We face great odds, but we are armed with our courage, our hard work, and most of all, our faith in one another.
We have nothing to fear as long as we believe.
For when we do believe anything is possible!
Onward!
Halt!
Good day there, fellow Winkie guardsman.
What is your business here?
Supplies for battle.
We bring supplies for battle.
I was told of no such delivery.
Where are your papers of transit?
Why this delay?
Do you not recognize me?
I'm Knuck, the City Herald.
Sir, I'm just trying to do my...
- What I meant was...
- Hmm?
Let them pass!
Let them pass.
What's this?
They dare march on us?
- Tear them apart!
- Fly!
It's a trick.
Pull!
Retreat! Retreat!
Curse you!
Oh, it's not over yet.
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.
Into the woods!
Watch out!
Ah!
Away with her.
- Oh!
- Herald.
- Great Wizard.
Who's this?
Emerald City underground.
Unload the carriage.
Yes, sir. To the rear.
Let's go!
Let's go.
You two, get the trolley.
Everything's ready.
All we need now is you.
Yeah, come on.
I just have to do one thing first.
There's no time.
- Get this carriage in position.
- Yes, sir.
Hurry!
I told Glinda you would do this.
She said I was wrong about you. I guess I wasn't.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about that thing the Tinker built.
- The balloon.
- What balloon?
That's my cue.
All right, you guys.
Just remember, stick to the plan.
Stick to the plan?
The plan was you.
We're supposed to stick to you.
You guys will do great.
So long.
Come back!
We can't do it alone.
- Wizard!
- Wizard, I don't know what to do!
Citizens of Emerald City.
Witness what happens when you defy me.
Glinda did very well for herself today, I'll admit.
Leave her alone!
Unchain her, you witch!
We know the truth.
You poisoned the king!
Guards!
Get them under control.
The citizens of Emerald City will not tolerate this!
We will not!
Silence!
Silence!
Ooh...
What should I do now?
I'd get your sister and fly out of here.
Really?
While you still can.
Well, I think I'm going to do something quite different and I'm going to do it, ooh, very, very slowly, because
I just can't take the sight of that pretty, pretty face.
Ooh, I'm going to wipe out your light until there is nothing left but my darkness.
I have been waiting for this for a long time.
Oh, no.
He said it was going to be his greatest trick yet.
Did he tell you the trick was on us?
How predictable.
I knew that buffoon of yours couldn't be the Wizard.
Out of my way!
Give up, Glinda.
Why do you continue to resist?
Because I believe in the Wizard.
So did I, once.
Behold!
Look!
Your Wizard!
Where is he going?
He's abandoning us.
How could he?
- No!
No!
Aw!
Not so great and powerful after all.
You, there! Move back!
Hey.
Hello, monkey.
Oz!
- I thought you were dead.
- Shh.
You were crying pretty hard.
Was that for me?
Oh, no. Some of the smoke got in my eyes.
On. Right.
Wow, you fooled everybody.
That was your greatest trick yet.
That was just the opening act.
Let this be the final word.
Your prophecy is dead.
Like the king who spoke it and the wizard who tried to fulfill it.
All dead.
It's showtime.
And they will be joined in death by Glinda the Good.
Farewell.
Say hello to your daddy for me.
The dreams of the people live on.
Fear me not, good people of Oz.
Fear me not.
For it is I,
the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!
More tricks?
After everything.
How dare you defy us!
Dare?
How dare you, wicked sisters?
No one defies Oz!
Guards. Destroy him.
Forward!
Attack!
Guards! Come back here this instant!
You thought you could kill me?
Me?
Thanks to you,
I have shed my mortal shell
and taken my true ethereal form.
I'm now more powerful than ever.
I'm invincible!
Do you still doubt me?
Doubt you?
I defy you!
Beautifully done, sister.
Thank you.
Hurry.
You're taking too much time.
Hold.
Hold.
They think they're winning.
Turn it back on.
What? Turn it back on!
Oh, we got a loose wire.
Oi!
Screw's stuck.
Hold on.
Use this.
- Got it.
- Right.
This can't be.
You cannot defeat me.
I'm immortal!
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!
Now witness and observe
as I unleash the stars!
Behold!
So, those are fireworks.
He is the Wizard.
We got Evanora.
She's on the run!
All right! We got one!
- Yeah!
Come back here, you coward!
Glinda.
It's you.
And you said that
I was the weak one!
I may not be able to kill you.
- Now.
- Okay.
But I can kill the one you love.
Higher.
I'm trying.
Ready! Fire!
Begone, Wicked Witch!
Begone!
I hate you.
Begone, forevermore!
The Witch is gone!
The Witch is gone! Yes!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Bully, bully!
I knew we could do it.
Right.
Theodora, I know your wickedness
is not your doing
and should you ever again
find the goodness within you
you are welcome to return.
Never!
Not so fast.
You and I aren't finished yet.
You have the throne, Glinda.
What more could you want?
You can't give me that.
You took what mattered most to me.
My father.
I'll never again feel the comfort of his kindness but I'll settle for the freedom of his people.
Of course, Glinda.
I think at the very least, they deserve that.
What's the matter, Glinda?
Out of bubbles?
I don't need them.
Bubbles are just for show.
What have you done?
Look what you've done to me!
Now everyone will see you as you truly are.
In the name of my father,
I banish you from the Emerald City never to return.
Good people of Oz,
I have here a missive from the great Wizard himself.
"With little more than pluck and belief, we made the impossible happen."
"As your Wizard,
I hereby decree the Land of Oz will forever be free."
Okay.
Close the curtains, please.
I'm trying.
All right.
Let's give it a try.
- Is it on?
Is this thing working?
It's Wonderful.
Well.
If it isn't the most beautiful witch in all of Oz.
Hi, Glinda.
Hello, Wizard.
Well done, Tinker.
Your machine works beautifully.
That's just workmanship.
What you displayed was real courage.
Your father would have been more than proud.
He would have marveled at the woman you've become.
Zim Zallah Bim!
Excellent work, everyone.
Now we're ready in case anyone wants to speak with the Wizard.
Now, remember,
Oscar Diggs died so that the
Wizard of Oz could live.
When those witches come back, and they will come back, we're going to need everyone to believe.
Your secret's safe with us.
Good.
And now it's time for some gifts.
Gifts?
- Gifts?
Knuck, not now.
What kind of gifts?
Well, you know
I can't grant wishes, so this will have to do.
First, the Master Tinker.
To the man who can make anything, my lucky thingamajig.
May it assist you in the reconstruction of the Emerald City.
I will cherish this forever.
Thank you for your faith in me.
And now for Sourpuss.
My name is Knuck!
Sourpuss, I grant you something you are in need of most.
Something that, where I come from can turn the saddest day into a happy one.
- I don't want that.
- It is yours.
- Take it back.
- I cannot.
Knuck, you look nice with a smile.
You do look nice.
Thank you.
Finley, you stood by my side when any monkey in his right mind would have flown away.
To you, I give something that I've never given to anyone.
My friendship.
Now you're my partner.
You're my friend.
That's all
I ever really wanted.
My turn, my turn.
Come here.
I'm afraid I can't give you what I know you want most of all.
All I can offer you is this.
It's us.
I know it's not the family that you had in mind.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
I wonder what you're gonna get.
Oh, I don't need anything, child.
You better have something for Glinda.
But of course.
I've saved the best for last.
For you.
A sight envied by all and seen by none.
You'll be astounded by what you find behind the curtain.
Oh, my.
It's very tight in here.
It's nice, isn't it?
I know what you're up to, Wizard.
What? I'm just giving you a tour.
And I want to thank you.
For opening my eyes.
And what do you see?
That I have everything
I ever wanted.
For the record, I knew you had it in you all along.
Greatness?
No. Better than that.
Goodness.
Now, Knuck.

The story you are about to see, has been told before.
A lot.
And now we are going to tell it, again.
But different.
It's about two star crossed lovers, kept apart by a big feud.
No one knows how this feud started, but it's all quite entertaining.
Unfortunately, before we begin.
There is a rather long boring prologue, which I will read to you now.
Two households.
Both alike in dignity.
In fair Verona.
Where we lay our scene.
From ancient grudge.
Break to new mutiny.
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two...AHHH.
Ah Mrs. Montague. How you just love to ruin my day.
My Sisters dear cardigan Mr. Capulet, it suits you.
-Feisty old hag.
-Grumbly old codger.
Oink...oink
Oh, great.
I got one! I got one!
I got one! I got one!
(Moans) Oh.
Hey, Winston. Throw us the ball.
Huh, Tybalt!
Hold on. Blues are at it again.
Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick.
Lady Blueberry
Your tulips are looking a little limp this year, aren't they.
Oh, I don't like what you're incinerating.
The proper word is 'insinuating'.
Illiterate.
I am not illiterate.
My parents were married!
Benny, come on. Let's go give those Reds another lesson on how it's done.
'Shroom all clear?
Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
Gnomeo, it's your mum.
-Oh no. Just get this out into the Alley.
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.
-Gnomeo, I can't..
-Have you ever seen,
...our beautiful, beautiful garden, from this angle?
Oh. Oh yes, it's beautiful. The Wisteria.
That tree was your father's pride and joy.
May he rest in pieces.
Oh, how you remind me of him.
Oh which is why I wanted to say.
I know, I know. My chores.
-Gnomeo...
-Edging trimming, planting consider it all done.
-Done, done, it's all like it....
-Gnomeo!
...done.
All I wanted to say was...
Good luck.
Thanks, mom.
Go out there and show them we
Blues are better than any Reds.
Red, I hate the word.
Wow.
A Cupids Arrow orchid.
Oh, Juliet!
Oh!
Whoa!
Hiya Dad. You won't believe what I found.
Oh, you want to get smashed?
A flower that will put that blue garden to shame.
-Just across the alley.
-This feud business, is none of your concern.
And as leader of this garden it's up to me...
Uh, I am a Red after all.
Oh, you're just as impulsivated as your mother was.
Bless her to bits.
Now, back where you belong.
I  can't just stay tucked away on this pedestal all my life.
Don't you see.
When will you realize you're delicate.
I'm not delicate.
She's definitely not delicate.
Stubborn girl.
Oh, right.
Delicate, hmm.
I'll show him who's delicate.
Blue Gnomes chanting: Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
Red Gnomes chanting: Tybalt, Tybalt, Tybalt.
-Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
-Okay boys,  ya all know the rules.
And I don't need to repeat them, but I'm gonna.
'Cus I wanna.
And here they are.
No biting, no scratching, no kicking.
No burping, no slurping, no prancing.
No squalling, no laughing, no heeing, no hawing.
And more than anything... nooo cheating!
No cheating?
Hey, that's not fair.
*Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)*
-On your marks.
Get going.
*It's getting late have you seen my mates.
Ma tell me when the boys get here.*
*It's seven o'clock and I want to rock.
Want to get a belly full of beer.*
*My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys.
And my old lady she don't care.*
*My sister looks cute in her braces and boots.
A handful of grease in her hair.*
*Whoa, don't give us none of your aggravation.
We had it with your discipline.*
*Whoa, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in.*
*Get about as oiled as a diesel train.
Gonna set this dance alight.*
*Cause Saturday night's the night I like.
Saturday night's all right, all right, all right.*
*Woo, oo, ooo.*
*Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.*
*Tybalt, Tybalt.*
*Saturday, Saturday, Saturday.*
*Saturday night's all right.*
*Saturday...*
-(Laughs)
-You're the greatest boss. The greatest by far.
All together: The greatest, the greatest by far.
Oh please, please my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.
-A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
-Huh?
All together: A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
-All together: Umh!
-Well Benny.
I didn't think it was possible. But your mouth is getting even bigger than your hat.
Tybalt, you just crossed the line.
Yeah, the 'finish' line.
Adios, loser.
Hey, come on out and fight, like a Gnome.
No body won't come out.
-You'd better do something.
-This can't go on.
Well if he won't come out.
-I guess we'll just have to go in.
-(Benny gasps in shock)
The Red garden. No one's ever been in there.
Then I say. It's about time someone did.
And payback is gonna be fun.
'Shroom, lets go kick some grass.
This mission into Red garden territory, is gonna require maximum stealth.
Well you won't get much stealthier than this.
Hello.
Mumbles: I got one.
Mumbles: I got one.
-Swim away , be free.
-Thank you.
(Whines) Oh.
Mumbles: I got one.
Oh, all this for some daffy flower.
Yes, it's the only way I'll ever be taken seriously around here.
And I'm going to need you to cover me.
If my dad asks.
Just tell him I'm washing my hair.
I'm washing my hair. I don't have hair.
He'll know it's a lie.
-No, my hair.
-Got it. I'm washing your hair.
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.
I'll be quick.
-(Gasps in fright)
-Growling.
-(Barking)
-(Juliet screams)
Out, out!
Ben stop, over here boy.
Wow! That was quick.
I'm to easy to see.
I'm going to need some kind of disguise.
Oooo, a new outfit.
I'm on it.
Here.
That is cute.
Give it a turn.
Ah, huh. Ah huh.
Nice junk in the trunk.
Now go get your flower.
Uh, maybe a tad less florescent pink?
How much less?
Try black.
Aaaaaaah!
Trust me, nobody is going to pay you any attention in that.
Then it's perfect.
Oooo,
I'm going in.
Take care.
I'm telling your Dad you're doing your hair.
Let's play a game.
I'm thinking of a movie.
It's a...it's one word.
And it starts with a...'spider'.
All: Is it, Spiderman?
Oh you're good, okay.
Great, I love going commando.
Shh, I know, just the key.
Shhh.
Okay, I have another one.
Two words.
The first word is 'Spiderman'.
All: Spiderman Two?
Okay, who's cheating?
Benny, give me the paint.
Benny?
No!
-Benny!
Benny!
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Tybalt!
-Get them you idiots.
Run for it, now.
Where did he go?
He's in the begonia's.
-Well, do I look like a begonia?
-No, more like a pansy.
Find him!
-Not here.
-Not here, either.
Nothing but Pansies here.
Come on.
Hold on.
Whoa, whoooa!
-Hey, Benny
-What?
-See you on the other side.
-Gnomeo!
Ah, ha, ha.
Hmm.
I wish I could stay but...
...gotta fly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoooa!
Huh!
*Elton John, Lady Gaga: Hello, Hello*
*Feel I'm feeling light*
*I like to see the sights.*
*Ain't life a many splendored thing?*
*Ducking up and down*
*All these crazy sights and sounds*
*Bounce around like puppets on a string.*
*Never gonna find, anything to change my mind.*
*Famous last lines of a fool*
*Just when you think.*
*Your chain is just one link.*
*Something comes to tip you off your stool.*
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*
*My, my, my what have we here?*
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*
*I'm not alone, it's good to know.*
*Someone's out there saying hello.*
*Heeeellooooo.*
Um, you're probably wondering what I'm doing on the roof of your greenhouse.
It's just that, well I thought no one lived here.
Yeah, they don't. I mean I don't.
This isn't my garden.
Oh, well that's good.
Because I just came to get that Orchid.
-Oh, this?
-Yes.
I don't know. I think I'm going to have to keep ahold of this one.
What? But I saw it first.
So why don't you just hand it over.
Well I grabbed it first.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
But if you want it.
-Come and get it.
-All right.
Thanks.
Aaaah!
-Nice greenhouse, hey.
-Oh yeah. You should see it from here.
What, and miss this view?
-Who's your Gno-me.
-Who's your Gno-me?
Whoa!
Who's your Gno-me now?
*Hello, Hello. Hello, Hello*
-Hey!
*My, my, my what have we here?*
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*
*Hello, Hello.
Hello, Hello*
*I'm not alone, it's good to know*
*Someone's out there saying, hello*
*Hello.*
*-Helloooooooooooooooooooooo
...................................-Heeeello.*
*Hello, hello.*
*Heeeellooooo.*
*Hello, hellooooooooooo.*
Oh no, he's a blue.
Not a blue.
Juliet. Your not off of your pedestal.
What are you doing out here?
I'm...oh, well I can ask you the same question, Tybalt.
We're looking for a blue Gnome.
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.
Got a scratch, right here.
And his name's Gnomeo.
You haven't seen him, have you?
Uhhhhooo, um.
Uhh, he sounds awful no.
I...I...uh...certainly haven't seen him.
I haven't seen him at all.
Well lucky you.
Come on, let's get inside.
Juliet.
A red.
Why of all things, did she have to be a red?
Sooo, where is the oh so important, life changing orchid?
Um...
Um...
What, what orchid?
What?
Hmmm?
Shut up!
You met a boy.
What? No! Well maybe...
Sort of, um...yes!
Yes I did.
I need details.
And go slowly, is he totally gorgeous?
-Totally.
-Does he have a nice rotund belly?
Well let's call it sturdy.
And his uh..(Whistles up)
-His hat, is um..
-Big and pointy?
And, you know I suppose in a certain light.
You might say it looks sort of...
...blue.
Blue.
Ah, this is one of your little jokes.
No, I don't get it.
(Gasps) Oh flipping, flaming Dora's sheep, you cannot take with a blue.
Shh, shush Nanette, just zip it.
Zzzzip.
Oh Juliet, this is fantastic!
-Is it?
-It's doomed.
-What?
-A red and a blue.
It just can't be.
So it's a doomed love.
And that's the best kind.
You'll never see him again.
And then one day when he dies, you'll be all,
"Oh, my true love".
"I only saw him once".
I'll only see...what do you mean?
What are you talking about, once?
I'll only see him once.
How romantically tragic.
Your love is doomed.
Your love is dead.
Your love is doomed.
Your love is dead.
It's doomed.
-It's dead.
-I'll only see him...once?
Dooomed!
I've never seen Lord Redbrick so riled up.
We have to find Gnomeo.
Let's split up.
(Sighs) I wish I could quit ya.
Both: Hmm.
Oh well.
Let's go fishing.
All right, mate.
Go find, Gnomeo.
Doomed!
Dead!
Doomed, dead.
Doomed, dead.
Oh, Gnomeo.
Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo.
To never see each other again?
Why must you wear a blue hat?
Why couldn't it be red like my father, or... green like a leprechaun, or... or purple like, um... like uh, like some weird guy.
I mean what's in a Gnome?
Because you're blue my father sees red, and because I'm red I'm feeling blue.
Oh at any rate, that shouldn't be the thing to keep us apart.
-Should it?
-No, no! It shouldn't.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
Oh my giddy aunt, did you just hear all of that?
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know, um...
I came here, to...
Well. I don't know I just wanted to see you again.
Are you crazy?
If dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio.
Find me, are you kidding?
Stealth is my middle name.
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
-Turn it off.
I'm trying.
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
*Welcome to our tropical hideaway,*
-Do something.
-The button's stuck.
*If we weren't in the show starting right away,*
Ah, Juliet!
*All together! In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
Come on man, off.
There's somebody behind you!
'Shroom!
Whoa, whoa...whoaaa!
Juliet! What's the ....
Oooo, you look like a fun guy.
Excuse me, little help here.
My dad's coming.
So, you must be, Gnomeo.
Lovely to meet you.
Even though it's seconds, before you're discovered and killed.
-Quick, hide.
-Juliet!
I told you before, no music in the grotto after ten o'clock.
What's going on here?
Um, It was a...
Um, ...I saw a squirrel.
And he...he...
...dropped his nuts.
Yes, nuts.
The size of boulders.
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.
Well, okay. But no mucking about.
Especially not tonight.
We've been attacked.
By a blue!
And if I ever get my hands on the blue?
He'll be sleeping with the fishes.
Now I'm not a man who is rounded up easily.
Lord Redbrick, I've been having problems with my...(Mumbles incoherently)
-Your what?
-(Mumbles incoherently)
I guess this isn't the best time to talk.
It's not ideal.
-But I...
-Just go.
-Please go.
-...just came here to say I.
-Um...
-What?
What did you want?
Oh, sorry!
Juliet, is there something wrong with the pond?
The pond? No, what this pond?
No it's fine.
I mean it's just as pondy as ever. (Laughs)
Oh my gosh, what is that thing over there?
What? What was it?
-That thing, over there.
-What did it look like?
-Oh, it looked like a really, uh.
-Okay. Goodbye then, off you go.
Thanks for popping by. Goodnight sweet prince, and flights of angels, or pigeons or sparrows, whatever.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
(Dejected) Oh!
(Hopeful) Oh.
Nanette, where's Gnomeo?
-Is he gone?
-Yep, gone forever.
What?
Whoa!
I think you'll find this 'does' actually belong to you.
Thank you.
-I can't go.
-I know  how you feel.
No, really. I'm stuck.
So, uh, heh...
Can I see you again tomorrow?
Yes, but not here.
Back in the old Lawrence place then?
-Noon?
-Not soon enough.
I can do 11:45.
Done.
That frog was right.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
-Thanks Nanette.
-You know he's going to ditch you, when he finds how much you weigh.
Shroom, you see this face?
It's a happy Gnome face.
Now come here.
Come on.
Outrage, infamy!
The gardening gloves are off then, are they?
You, wrecking my mower.
Dear lady, you are insane in the brain.
I never thought that you'd stoop to such a level.
Oh, and by the way, kindly stop stealing my underwear.
In your dreams, you jacked off cabbage.
Oh, how could she do this to Tybalts wishing well?
Mmm, my sweet little flower boy.
Why would anyone ever pick on you?
Who thinks I should order the best, new lawnmower?
Money can buy.
Why would anyone do this to, Tybalt?
All: Because nobody likes him.
-(Growls)
-So what are we going to do?
Find their weak spot.
Then what are we going to do?
Damage.
Lot's and lot's of damage.
Right.
Mess with me will you, Capulet.
I'll show him what, that old pompous.
It's not over, not by a long shot.
Yeah, uh, right. What have we got here?
Show the world the mighty web ....
Oh, no. No, no, not good.
Pick one.
-Yes, that one.
-No.
Oh, yes that one.
What's this?
Are you losing the war in your garden?
Well brother maybe it's time for a secret weapon.
Terrafirminator!
It's the most useless, 500 horse power... ground dominating piece of hardware, the world has ever seen.
TERRAFIRMINATOR!!
It's unnecessarily volatile.
Now with 75% more power!
It clears...clears.
It digs...digs.
It mulch,...Mulch
Your lawn will be afraid to grow.
Terrafirminator!
Get the weapon that plans destruction!
(Laughs) That one.
Oh my.
Pick, pick that one.
Please, please pick that one.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That's a bit in-your-face.
This is more my speed.
Oh, not the Kitten Clipper.
Oh, no.
*Elton John and Kiki Dee:
Don't go breaking my heart*
Definitely not.
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I couldn't if I tried.*
*Oh honey if I get restless.
Baby you're not that kind.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.
You take the weight off of me.*
*Oh Honey when you knocked on my door.
Ooo, I gave you my key*
*Wooo, hoo Nobody knows it.*
*When I was down*
*I was your clown*
*Right from the start.
I gave you my heart.*
*Whoooooa oh, I gave you my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I won't go breaking your heart*
*Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my...*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my...*
*I won't go breaking your heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my.
I won't go breaking your heaaaaaaart.*
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*
Juliet. There you are.
-Hi dad.
-I've been ruminating about our little discussion yesterday.
-But I was just...
-What you need is companionship.
-Huh?
-Someone to look after you.
Who'll keep you safe.
-What?
-You know Paris, don't you.
Yes, yes of course, why?
Well he's come to pay you a visitation.
-Dad!
-All right, all right.
No one will ever say I don't know when I'm not wanted.
-Toodles.
-Uh, got something for you.
Here it is, gypsaphilla.
Lovely, what does it mean?
It means love woodchuck.
Although ironically it grows better in a clay soil.
It's weird isn't it.
You think you got it down and bram, you do some readings and it turns out it's clay soil.
Even though you thought it was a level of chalk.
Weird.
-Right, well it's been terribly nice meeting you.
-Where are you going, stop, no.
You can obviously do what you want.
But my point is it's surely a bit, rude to leave me on the first date.
-First date?
-Yeah, and I thought what does a boyfriend.
-Boyfriend?
-Get his girlfriend.
-Girlfriend?
-Oooo, this is good.
A small token of my affection.
Oh, wow!
Juliet, do you realize what this is?
It is my own hybrid, a foxglove and buttercup.
Oh, a love triangle.
Which I call, Foxcup.
And you. I never knew you were such a devil.
Well, I mean I guess I've got my dark side, sure.
Hey there, Juliet.
What a name, it's a great name.
Goes with your, eyes.
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?
That's a killer, man.
Yeah, uh, no. You're looking cool.
Yeah, so how's it going with you, baby?
-Oh I'm fine, Baby. How are you?
-Gaaahh!
Uh, (uneasy laugh) never better.
Do you think anyone heard that?
(whispers) There's nobody here.
(Whispers) Then why are you whispering?
(Softly) Why are you whispering.
Oh, look at that.
Guess we're done with the whispering thing.
It's a 1950's Macalister Ranger.
Let's start her up.
Yeah, okay.
Check out the power on this beauty.
She's empty.
Bingo!
-Hey, try this.
-Thanks.
-Is that you?
-Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
It's me, too!
What was that?
I have no idea.
Okay, whatever you are.
Come out, slowly.
I have a loaded stic...uh, weapon.
And I'm not afraid to use it.
Do you think I scared it?
Oh definitely, I know I'm scared.
Look at that baby, huh.
Watch me now.
(Scats) Ooo...uh...ooo....aah.
Oh by the way, thanks for finding my leg.
And setting me free.
I love you!
Do you know what it's like to be trapped for thirty years?
All alone, by yourself.
No one for to talk at.
Hola, Featherstone, como esta usted? (How are you?)
Ah, bueno, Featherstone, how's the other leg?
I don't know Featherstone, remember
I don't have it.
You see, I'm not exactly terrific company, am I?
Sorry but, we didn't think anybody lived here.
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.
-What if he follows us?
-Then our parents find out.
Oh no. Nanette was right, we're doomed.
Oh, oh, oh. Up, up, up.
You cannot ever pull the wools over these beady eyes.
Oh, ho. I think that you two are on a date.
Both: Date! No, no not dating.
-Fighting, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it is. To the death.
-Mortal enemies here.
-Yeah, don't you see it?
-He's a blue.
-She's a red.
And I'm pink!
Who cares?
Anyway, I got to ask.
Why are you bringing her to a dumpy place like this?
Ohh, I know, I know.
Un momento, I'll be right back.
Juliet, wait.
Oh, here it comes.
I'm to delicate, right?
No, no I was going to say.
Don't hold back, let her rip.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
GO!
Ta da!
Whoo, look at that.
This is definite improvement.
Fantastic penmanship, too.
But you know...
We still got to do something about these weeds.
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.
Well I don't know. A weed by any other name is still a weed.
Go on, make a wish.
And then blow on it.
It's kinda hard with a beak, huh?
Kinda pass you out, huh?
I going to sit down now.
I've got a confession to make.
I've never actually driven a mower.
No, you're a natural.
Well my dad, he's a little over protective.
You know this is crazy, right?
Yeah.
I just never imagined that I could fall for a red.
Oh and me a blue.
No way.
My whole life my mom raised me to hate you guys. You reds.
So, this could never work.
Could it?
Well a red and a blue.
It just can't be.
Can it?
Look it's kinda like snowing, but it's not.
Oh baby, you know I getting into this now.
See the trick is to go like... (Blows sharp)
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...(Blow's short)
Ah, I wish that we could all come back.
And do this tomorrow.
And uh, I promise.
Your secret is safe with me.
Well, should we?
I can do 11:45.
Not soon enough.
Oomph! Hey Shroom, what's up buddy.
Careful there, you're going to kick something.
What's eating you?
Huh?
(Crying) How?
How?
-Mom
-So beautiful...Gnomeo.
How could this have happened?
Well, where were you?
I was...
I was nowhere.
Don't worry mom, I'll make it up to you.
How, Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed, the most beautiful thing we blues have.
Your father planted her.
We raised her from a seedling.
Those blasted Reds, come on.
We'll make them pay.
Every last one of them.
Every last one?
*It's a little bit runny.*
*This pesticide.*
-My dad can really pick them.
-Can he just.
-Oh, this is painful.
-Oh, sweet torture.
*Don't have much money.*
*But, but if I did.*
*I'd buy a big house where.*
*We both could live.*
*If I was a sculptor...*
-Ooo, sexy, sexy.
*A man selling stuff for plants it's called, Miracle grow.*
Uh, Gnomeo!
Okay.
Then we go need a bunch of coconuts.
Wha?
Juliet no, wait.
I...I um...
A blue, a blue!
-Abort, abort the mission.
-What?
-What happened.
-Ah, the muzzle jammed, let's go.
Gnomeo!
Hmmm.
Such a big hat, on such a small gnome.
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?
Let's take this baby out into the alley.
Then what are going to do?
We're gonna have a smashing time.
Oh come on, Juliet.
It's  not as bad as all that.
Is that your big move on a second date?
You wine them, dine them and spray them with weed killer?
You got to admit, it is original.
Hola, my fellow funsters are back already.
I mean be reasonable.
I didn't have a choice...
...after incident 'Wisteria'.
How do you think that looks?
Just a toilet in the middle of a yard, with nothing growing out of it.
Oh you blues are so infuriating.
Wait a minute, us blues?
So, what you guys want to do?
-Featherstone, we're busy.
-Come on guys.
-Let us have some-a fun.
-Let me tell you something about you reds.
-Us reds?
-Oh, can't we all just laugh about this?
I know the little mushroom can.
Both shout: Featherstone!
-We're in the middle of something.
-You wouldn't understand.
-We're talking.
-All right, so just leave us alone.
Right,
I'm sorry.
You know sometimes I get a little over excited.
Especially having such great new friends.
Like you and...
But I know I can be a bit...
...much.
Wait, Featherstone.
-Hey.
-Come back, Featherstone. I'm sorry.
I may not be a smart bird.
But I know what love is.
*Elton John: Love builds a garden*
*You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say*
*Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face*
*A smile that spoke to me in oh so many ways*
*Then*
*We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again*
*But a frost, it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die*
*There's only so much you can do, to keep some things alive*
*That love built a garden.
Grew it from the ground up*
*Each one of us knowing, every inch of it was us*
*We pulled it all together, hoping and believing.*
*That love built this garden for the two of us to dream in.*
You know, other people's hate, destroyed my love.
And...
I couldn't do nothing about it.
But you...
...you can.
You know I think that crazy pink plastic bird might be right.
What if we never went back?
Never go back?
But what about my Dad?
And Nanette and the red garden?
You see the truth is, over there, we're enemies.
But here, here we're a matching pair.
Juliet, will you stay here, and build a garden with me?
I'd love to.
GNOMEO!
What are you doing?
Benny, listen mate, I can explain.
BENNY!
Benny, wait.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little big hat, Benny.
Mess with the red garden, will ya.
BENNY!
NO!
Ooo, that felt good.
Oh no!
Oh, no.
Tybalt!
A hat for a hat.
Gnomeo, no!
You wouldn't attack an unarmed Gnome, would ya?
Sucker.
Pity.
Tybalt, the wall.
You don't I'm going to fall for that old trick, do ya?
Ha, ha, what wall?
Ut oh, that wall.
Blast!
What was that?
What's happened?
Tybalt?
Tybalt.
Tybalt?
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.
(Gasps) Ooo.
Smash him hat.
-No!
-What is the meaning of all this constipation?
Gnomeo smashed, Tybalt.
No, he didn't do it.
-Juliet.
-Gnomeo.
-Mom.
-A gnome for a gnome.
-Catch.
-What?
Smash him back.
Run, Gnomeo.
Run!
Stop, stop that.
Revenge!
Whup!
Woo...
-What were you doing?
-No!
-I love him.
-What?
Doomed.
Oh, someone do something.
Gnomeo!
Are you mad?
There's been enough smashing for one day.
Now get her on her pedestal.
And keep her there.
(Sobs) He's gone.
(Crying) Oh Gnomeo.
(Sobs) No, no not Gnomeo.
Let's get you home now.
Oh, my poor, poor boy.
Hmm?
Stay, stay!
Good boy.
Shroom!
Shroooooom!
No!
-A gnome?
-Yeah, Mate.
It looks like your sister.
You left me no choice, Juliet.
I've lost your mother.
I am not going to lose you.
(Sadly) Mmmm.
Hmm?
Psst, psst, bunnies, fall in.
All right, we've got to avenge, Gnomeo.
Here's what we're going to do.
Now...(Mumbles softly)
No, not now Shroom.
Right, got it.
Okay, okay you're a mushroom
Dude I coming.
What, what you trying to say?
Sooo, little Timmy has fallen down the well?
No, did he jump?
Little Mustafa?
Little Richard, what?
Oh, a teapot fell down the well.
Well what?
Oh, no.
You say Gnomeo fell down the well?
No, little mushroom.
He was a smashed.
I saw it myself.
What, you want I still to follow you some more. Okay fine.
I go with you, I go.
Well what this has to do with,
Gnomeo, I don't know.
And where is this well that everyone has fallen into?
Psst.
Oink, oink.
Ready?
Hmm?
Huh, oooh, hello.
Whoa!
Hmm?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Terrafirminator!
Are you losing the war in your garden?
-Never!
-Well brother, maybe it's time for a secret weapon.
-Bring it on.
-TERRAFIRMINATOR!
This one's for Gnomeo!
Meoooooww!
Hah, hah, yeah.
Huh?
(Whines) Come on.
Ohhh!
Oh, ruddy purse.
Call me.
So Juliet and me we decided that we wouldn't carry on this horrible feud.
It was great, but then my best mate Benny found out.
And Tybalt, who's a right piece of bad gnome.
Crashed a trowel through Bennies hat.
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt and he ended up getting smashed.
Which wasn't my fault.
Then I was chased down.
Exiled.
Stuck up here on your head.
Far away from, Juliet.
Extraordinary.
Your story,
It does put me in mind of another.
-It does?
-Oh indeed, yes.
There are remarkable similarities.
What happens?
Did they get back together then?
Get back together?
Um, no.
Not exactly.
What exactly do you mean?
-Well now, it really is quite good.
-Whoa, whoa!
-She feigns her death.
-Whoa!
He finds her.
Thinks her dead.
Takes his own life.
She wakes, finds him dead.
Takes her life, both dead!
Exium omnis, the end, curtain!
Standing ovation.
Bravo, bravo!
Author, author!
What did you say?
They both die?
What kind of an ending is that?
My dear boy, this is a tragedy.
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish.
-Rubbish?
-There's got to be a better ending than that.
Well I suppose that he could have made it back in time to prevent disaster.
But I like the whole death part better.
Oh dear.
Whoo hooo!
Featherstone.
One word.
Plastic.
How'd you find me?
Shroom!
He sniffed you out, and he doesn't have a nose.
Not yet.
Yeah, I knew I could count on you, you little button head.
What is it, boy?
Oh he hasn't stopped.
Yakity, yakity, yak.
He's been going on and on and on since the accident.
Chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers....
Juliet's in danger.
No, that's not it.
Juliet's in danger!
-Told you so.
-Come on, boys.
I've got to get back to Juliet, and save her.
That's what he said, but she was dead before he got home.
We'll see about that.
Whoa...
Tada!
-Benny.
-What do you think, Lady B.?
This baby is fully equipped.
Equipped for what?
It has settings for edging, trimming, mulching, and revenge!
Do it, Benny.
Do anything it takes.
Make them rule the day they destroyed my son.
Unleash the gods of war.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Ah, no, no!
Ohh.
Oh, no!
Go', blimey!
Oh, no.
ATTACK!
Counter attack!
Counter, counter attack.
Wwww, whoa, whoooa, whoooa!
All: Ah me, no, no, no!
Nyah, nyah!
I got one.
Thank you.
(Moans) Ohhh.
Not, the dolphin.
Oh...ah...oh...no!
Nooooo!
Paris.
Wa...watch out!
Gentlemen, I suggest we put our heads together.
Charge!
Oh, no, no, nooo!
Yee haw!
Cannonball!
Right!
What?
Juliet!
You're alive.
-Come with me.
-Okay
Oh, no.
Gnomeo!
Would you like to complete destruction now?
Destruction in progress.
Come on, come on, come on!
Oh, Juliet!
Oh, my son. It can't be.
Target locked.
She's going to blow!
Get back, get back.
Huh!
-Huh.
-Huh.
-Huh!
-Huh!
It's no use, go.
Go.
I'm not going anywhere.
Told you so.
-Huh!
-Oh!
(Sadly sighs) Oh.
Huh?
It's okay, I'm okay.
Ewww!
I'm sorry about your son.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
I was just trying to keep her safe.
And, now...
The whole thing, is my fault.
Our fault.
-This feud.
-Is over.
*Tiiiiki, tiiiki, tiikii, tiki rooom.*
*The tiiiiki, tiiki, tiki, tiiiki, room.*
*The birds...flowers croon. Tiki, tiki, tiki room.*
I don’t' know about you.
But, I think this ending is much better.
-Good afternoon, witch.
-Nitwit.
Both: AAAAAHHHH!
*"Crocodile Rock"*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaaaaaaa.*
*I remember when rock was young.*
*Gnomeo and Juliet had so much fun.*
*Holding hands and skimming stones.*
*Had their own gold Chevy and a place of their own.*
*But the biggest kick they ever got*
*Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock*
*While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock*
*They were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock, hey!*
*Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still*
*They never knew me a better time and I guess I never will*
*Eh! Everybody is feeling right
Because we gonna dance all night*
*And the Crocodile Rocking is something out of sight*
*Yeah, yeah, yeah.*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, laaaaa.*
*-Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.

*-Crocodile rockin'
Laaaaaaaa, la, la,*
*-Ooo, a rock, rock, rockin',

*La, la, la, la, laaaa.
-Crocodile rockin'*
Oo, thank you.
You... are... very good at blow jobs.
Thank you.
And I am brilliant at receiving them. Mm. Yes.
You were very well behaved.
So polite of you just to lie back and take it.
Thank you, I do my best.
You, on the other hand, brought the bloody house down.
Shut up.
You're incredibly noisy.
Why would you say that? no, no, it's not a bad thing.
Course it's a bad thing.
Makes me feel...
Like a prostitute.
No. Paranoid.
It makes me feel paranoid.
What do you mean, a prostitute?
Well, I don't mean prostitute.
Well, not a professional one.
You've got a long way to go till you're that good.
Shut up. When I have sex with you,
I close my eyes, and I imagine
I'm hunched over a prostitute.
Hunched? It's the only reason
I like having sex with yer.
I'm going for a wee. stay here and have sex with me.
Get off.
"All tall men mind the mad arithmetic."
Six letters.
How did we get home last night?
Barney gave us a lift. Did he?
Why was he driving when he could have been drinking?
What? You heard.
He's starting at HSBC today.
Oh, yeah.
Silly old sod.
Why's he got himself a job for?
Oh, I think I need a pooh as well.
Charming.
He's been watching Titanic...again.
Steve, can you make me some toast?
No, er, you'll eat in the bed and I won't get rid of the crumbs.
Yes, you will.
Can't you just have it as bread? Raw?
Yeah. In the morning?
Yes, why not?
We must have had a million pizzas in there.
Yeah I know, but it's just something
Julie used to do and I never liked it.
What? Don't watch me.
You look so cute on the loo.
Steve.
OK, it's fine, you can have toast if you want. No, I don't want it now.
Get out. Obviously it's fine for
Julie and her big fucking tits.
They weren't as big as they looked.
How very disappointing for you, but despite her disappointingly gargantuan tits, you still found it in your heart to let her eat toast in bed with you.
What a saint.
Are you going to make me toast or not? Oh, shit.
Beg your pardon? Er...nothing.
Are you going to make me toast?
Yes, yes, whatever.
Thank you. 
Don't let him in, he'll hear me.
It's only Dan.
You all right, Dan?
Morning, campers.
This got put through my door.
Oh, right, great.
Becky stay over last night?
Yeah, her parents have got people staying, so...
Hung over, dare I ask?
Yeah, a bit, but she's fine.
She has an egg before bed so she doesn't get a hangover.
Oh, right, yeah.
So why does she do that?
Well, so she doesn't get a hangover.
That's good, yeah. What's she do?
Are you taking the piss?
No, I was just...being chatty.
Making conversation.
Well, don't.
Anita didn't reply to my e-mail.
I don't know if she's read it.
Know her password. Er, been watching
Titanic again? Yeah, we heard.
Yeah, Winslet's tits. Yeah.
Thank God for the pause button.
Hello, mate.
Er, well I hope you're with Laura, but...
You know what I mean.
What? What? What?
Eurgh, Paul.
What's going on?
Paul, why are you telling me this? Why is he telling you what?
Oh, you didn't.
Not Sporty? Oh, you filthy bastard.
OK, yeah. OK, OK.
It's fine, it's fine,
I'll kill it, it's fine.
Well, I don't know, I'll make something up.
Yeah, speak to you later, mate.
Bye.
Any news? Paul spent the night with a girl who looks like Sporty Spice.
Sporty Spice? I know.
Sporty Spice.
Do you reckon she does back-to-front?
What's back-to-front?
What's back-to-front?
Ooh, that's followed you out.
What has?
Shut the door.
I haven't been doing anything.
You all right, Dan? Yeah.
Popped down to say hello, really.
Hello. Hello. How was your weekend?
Peaks and troughs, you know.
Peaks and troughs.
I would have preferred to have spent it with a Spice Girl, but, er...
Dan.
A Spice Girl? Better go.
Yeah, thanks, Dan.
He wasn't even wearing a watch.
I hate it when people do that.
Why would anyone still fancy the Spice Girls?
Look, it's from Rob. "Steve, having a great time, nice weather, Rob".
Why do I care what the weather's like in Spain?
Why were you and Dan talking about the Spice Girls?
We weren't.
Why would anyone still fancy the Spice Girls?
Well, I don't. Come on.
Let's have sex.
Why are you lying to me about the Spice Girls?
I'm not. Now get your knickers off.
Yeah, yeah, mm, mm.
Oh, it doesn't need to be that loud.
Oh, no.
What? Oh, God.
What? Oh, I bet she's really...
What, what is it? Poor thing.
Rebecca! It's my sister.
She says Paul didn't come home last night.
Have you heard anything?
What, Paul?
Yeah. No.
Just have a check. No. Nope.
She's just being a drama queen. I bet she's sent that text to everyone.
Yeah it's probably fine, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
Forget about it.
We're missing Cash In The Attic.
We're about to have sex.
Oh, yeah. Mm.
Ooh. Was that a fart?
No, it was my tummy.
Well, that sounded like a fart.
Are you going to make me toast?
You know I can't have sex on an empty stomach.
OK.
OK, I'll make you toast.
Fine, but you're eating it on the chair, and afterwards we are shagging.
Wow. It's like being a princess.
Steve, why have you put your mug face down on the floor?
Jesus Christ.
Urgh, kill it!
No, he might have babies.
Chuck it out the window, then.
No, no, you can get AIDS from a spider.
You can't! You can.
If he's been crawling round in the blood of an AIDS victim...
Steve, be a man for once in your life and get rid of the spider.
All right, all right, give me that.
Don't touch, don't touch.
Stay behind me.
Yeah, I'll deal with him in a minute, when I've worked out a plan.
Upside down. You put a mug upside down, not face down.
Ignore him. Oh, I can't.
Do you want to clear the bed for the fuck fest?
OK.
Fuck fest? What?
"All tall men mind the mad arithmetic."
Dan's back.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hi, Laura, you all right, babe?
What a total bastard.
What are you making?
Toast. Ooh, very posh. Yeah.
Thinking I might pop to Azeen, you know, get some fruit. OK.
Just read an article about melon, yeah.
Fancy getting a melon with me?
Becky could come, too.
Ooh, I'm sure she'd love to, but we're, er, kind of busy this morning. Sex.
Yeah.
I heard her hollering earlier.
Don't say that.
Don't be silly.
No. No, he shouldn't be putting you through all this.
No, I know. Really?
Straight away?
OK.
Yeah. Course he won't mind.
All right then.
Bye, love.
Have I outstayed my welcome?
Yeah. No problem.
Get that fruit.
Good idea. Bye.
Bye-bye.
Right, You hold the plate beneath the toast, you eat it on the chair.
Wow, what's this?
I thought you might like to watch.
Really? Yeah, where do you want me?
On the bed. Arse down.
Thought you didn't like being watched. I don't mind, if you do something for me.
Like what?
Like...letting Laura pop round.
Laura!
Well, she's my sister. Steve. She's feeling really down about Paul.
There is nothing wrong with
Paul, I told you.
I'll moan and groan as loud as you like.
Yeah well, er... not too loud.
Come here.
Oh, that'll be Laura.
That was quick.
Well, she was on her way already.
So when you asked me if I wanted to watch...
I let you watch me. Now be nice to Laura. Oh, God!
Hello, love, how you feeling?
I'm so worried, Becks.
Look at me, I'm shaking.
He's being a total bastard.
Laura's here.
Hi, Laura, are you all right?
Paul didn't come home last night.
Look at me, Steve, I'm shaking.
Yeah.
I couldn't even go to work.
Have you heard from him?
No. I'm sure he's fine, though.
He's a big lad,
I'm sure everything's tickety boo.
I need a piss.
Thanks for sharing that with us.
Is his phone still off? Yeah.
I left a message to say that I was here.
And I was thinking, maybe what's happened with little Luke, with his scans and Luke's
Mum, Natalie, the slut.
You didn't flush. Steve.
You did a shit, and you didn't flush.
I didn't want Dan to hear.
You're an animal.
I can hardly breathe in there.
Oh, stop overreacting.
Careful, Steve, there's a mug on the floor. This is my flat.
I'm the one who has to live here in your stench. Oh, well done.
Steve, there's a mug on the floor.
If you shit in my flat, you flush in my flat.
You've really got a way with words, haven't you?
If you want to do a stinky shit, go back to your parents' house and do it.
My Uncle Dennis is staying over.
There's a mug face down on the floor, Steve.
Yes, Laura I know! I put it there.
I keep a spider in it.
Face down.
You know Dan upstairs?
Pyjamas. Yeah.
He's watching Titanic for what is it, the...
Fourth. Fourth time this week.
He just split up with a girl that looks like Winslet.
Oh, she doesn't look like Winslet.
She's just fat and posh.
He wanted me to buy fruit with him.
Who goes out of their way to buy fruit?
Oh, I'd love a mango.
What? Wouldn't you, Laur?
Oh, yeah.
What are you going to do with a mango?
Eat it. How?
Don't know. A mango?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
They're like a pound each.
Fucking mango?
All right, Steve, mind the language, Laura's upset.
Sorry, Laura.
I'm sure Paul's absolutely fine.
Thanks, Steve.
OK?
Have you seen the new telly?
Is that it? Mm, yep.
Not bad, is it? Found it in the skip.
Isn't he a dream?
Oh, that's Paul. It's his knock.
Go on, Laur, you answer it.
Be strong.
Thank God for that.
I can explain everything, darling, it's not my fault.
It was events, it was some real nasty events, and I just missed you so much, darling.
Yeah.
Mm. You going to let me watch you with this?
No, course not.
You're such a pervert.
I don't even know why you bought this thing.
Her favourite thing about him is his big dick.
Isn't that revolting? Well... he might have a big dick but I bet he can't do a dick dance.
Can he, Becks? Can he?
Shall I do my dick dance?
Yes. Shall I? Yes. Shall I?
And you know how I've been with Luke being ill.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I'm being selfish.
Well, you are. You are being really selfish, but that's OK, because you're my darling, remember?
Look at it.
We have a bond and we're getting married.
Yeah. Like two become one.
Like, what made you say that?
Mm, what? When two become one?
Oh, it's just a phrase, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
Ooh, yeah.
Thank you, fans. Thank you, fans.
Paul could never do a dick dance as good as that. No.
And I bet if he did he wouldn't have that bit of loo roll caught in his foreskin.
What? Ohh. do they smell good?
Mm, they smell lovely.
Do you want to smell? Mm, yeah.
Course I don't want to smell!
Is everything all right? Yeah,
I was being silly, he was at Iggy's.
Probably let her know next time,
Paul. Yeah, sorry. Sorry, everyone.
He's forgetful like that, while I'm too far the opposite way.
That's why we're the perfect couple.
Steve was just doing a dick dance.
Becky.
A what? Nothing.
If you guys are OK why don't you treat yourselves to a nice meal deal, get some air.
Don't let Paul do a dick dance, Laur, he'd have someone's eye out with that great big thing.
Yeah. Yeah, I would.
No chance of Steve doing that, is there, love? You're funny.
Ooh, is it small, Steve?
No, to be fair, it's not small.
I'm flattered. But it's not exactly going to split you in two.
It's fine, it's normal size,
I measured it.
What? I measured it. You measured it?
Yes, with a ruler.
Oh, that's a lovely image.
Was it a 15-centimetre ruler, Steve?
That doesn't even work.
What, can't you take a joke, mate?
How, how, how did this happen?
Why did they invent the microscope?
So Steve could find his dick.
Well, you've nicked that one off
Barney. Why can't you take a joke?
Why don't you go back to Iggy's?
Steve was having a wank the other day but he couldn't find any tissues, so he had to use a stamp.
Did you write that one yourself?
Yeah. It's really good.
I bet when Paul has a wank he has to use the whole duvet.
Yeah, I do.
What, and that's a good thing?
You're the inspiration for those little pens in Argos, aren't you, love?
Yeah, yeah, I was.
I was the inspiration for the little pens in Argos. Very funny.
So my dick's not as big as yours.
By about ten inches. Paul's dick's so long he can't wear shorts.
Ooh, that's funny, because he can't keep it in his trousers, either.
What? What? Steve.
What? What's that supposed to mean? Steve.
What, what's that supposed to mean, Becks?
He didn't mean anything by it.
Steve, what do you mean he can't keep his dick in his trousers?
Er, nothing, come on, let's go.
As you saying Paul can't keep his dick in his trousers?
No! I was joking.
Oh, you know me, I'm always joking.
Maybe you should learn to take a joke.
Now, Becks, how much do I owe you for that curry the other night?
Why did you lie about you and
Dan talking about the Spice Girls?
Sshh, I didn't!
Why were you talking about doing back-to-front with one of 'em?
What? You're crazy.
What's back-to-front? Were you doing back-to-front with a Spice Girl?
No, of course not.
It was a deal, weren't it, lamb and a naan, Â£5.50.
Steve, was he doing back to front with a Spice Girl?
Of course he wasn't doing back-to-front with a Spice Girl, whatever that is.
This is Paul, he works in Rymans, as if a Spice Girls going to want to do back-to-front with him. Fuck you.
But you are shagging someone.
I'm what. Sssh, sssh, Laura's upset.
Steve. Look why don't I pop out and get us all a mango?
Steve, stop being a prick.
Let Paul answer the question. Paul?
Where were you last night, Paul?
Tell me or you can have this ring back.
Oh, OK. OK.
Steve's got it all wrong, as usual.
I might not have stayed at Iggy's.
You liar.
I didn't want you worrying.
I ended up going, er, to... a museum.
Which museum?
Well, it was just a general museum,
Becky, and I bumped into a very nice young lady at the museum who happens to do some agency work as a Mel C look-alike. You bastard.
No, isn't it, Steve?
Yeah, the exhibits were so fascinating he stayed there all night.
You bastard!
Jesus, Steve. Oh, what have I done?
You're a little shit.
Mel C? I know. Mel fucking C.
Sshh, I know, I know.
What does the C even mean?
Chisholm. Chisholm?
Chisholm? Yeah. Chisholm.
Dan.
Hey, Steve, they were two for Â£1.50, let's hang out, eat 'em with spoons.
Steve, come here, you prick.
Oh, Paul, did you give her what she wanted?
What she really, really wanted? Not now, mate.
What's so good about Mel C?
Nothing.
There's nothing good about Mel C.
I've never liked their music, have I? No.
She did that one with Bryan Adams.
But you're right, we've never liked her.
I am so fucking enraged. Urggh.
Oh, fuck off as well, you little spider dick.
All right, how did you know I did back-to-front with her?
Did yer? What is it?
It's when, when first of all, you do her in the... what, you've never done back-to-front?
No, of course not.
You're like a fucking nun.
Right. Laura, let me in, darling, we need to talk.
Go away, Paul, I don't want to speak to you.
I'm not going anywhere, darling.
I believe it when I see it. Oh.
Don't do this to me, darling.
We have a bond.
You're my everything.
We're meant to be together.
Go away, Paul.
OK, you've got five seconds to let me in before
I kick the fucking door down!
What is that? Oh. Er, what is that...
Er, probably just let him, Becks.
I'm going fucking mental, darling!
Oh, mental, men...
"All tall men mind the mad arithmetic."
I will smash the glass.
It stinks in here.
You total bastard!
I can't wait for the wedding.
I really need a piss.
How long they going to be? As long as they need.
Don't you dare.
Where's the spider?
I threw him out the window.
Very brave.
Someone's grown some balls.
Can I have the toast?
Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.
Are you enjoying that toast?
Yeah, why?
No reason, I'm just glad you're enjoying it.
Thank you for allowing me to eat it in your bed.
Not at all, just glad you're enjoying it.
Mm, I am enjoying it.
Good, I'm glad you are.
Good.
Good.
Good.
I was up all night worrying about you. I was sick with worry.
Sweetheart, darling, you're so beautiful.
KUNG FU PANDA-2 (2011)
Long ago, in ancient China,
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.
They brought great joy and prosperity to the city
for they had invented fireworks.
But their son, Lord Shen,
saw darker power in the fireworks.
What had brought colour and joy
could also bring darkness and destruction.
Shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer.
She foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path,
he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white.
The young lord set out to change his fate.
But what he did next only sealed it.
Shen returned to his parents full of pride.
But in their faces, he saw only horror.
He was banished from the city forever.
But Shen swore revenge.
Someday he would return
and all of China would bow at his feet.
It's almost done, Lord Shen, but we've run out of metal.
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!
China will be mine.
And then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five!
And they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever!
Enough talk. Let's fight!
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!
You can hear the Dragon Warrior training right now!
Thirty-three. Stop him!
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!
How is he doing that with his face?
Thirty-eight bean buns!
Yes! New record! You monster!
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.
Do it.
No problem!
Yeah!
Give me a minute.
Yeah!
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!
Your training has paid off.
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!
You'll save those for me, right?
Flippety-do.
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Master Shifu.
Master Shifu, what do we got?
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.
I need to get something done, you know what I mean?
What are you doing?
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.
Awesome!
How did you do that?
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.
Every master must find his path to inner peace.
Some choose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this...
...without the slightest taste of food or water.
Or?
Some find it through pain and suffering, as I did.
Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior was the worst day of my life.
By far.
Nothing else came close.
It was the worst, most painful, mind-destroying, horrible moment...
- OK.
...I have ever experienced.
But once I realised the problem was not you, but within me,
I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe.
So that's it? I just need inner peace?
My innards are already super, super peaceful, so all I need to do is just get this thing going.
Inner peace, you're going down.
Now show me what you were doing there with your feet.
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.
Danger.
Tell those musicians to start playing some action music because it is on.
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master inner peace as soon as I get back.
No snack stops this time.
Snack stops.
Wait, are you serious?
Get all the metal you can find!
Grab the metal!
Help, help, help, help. Help!
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.
Oh, no.
Wings of Justice!
The Dragon Warrior!
A panda? That's impossible.
My fist hungers for justice.
That was my... fist.
- Get 'em!
- Come on!
Take that!
Po! Incoming!
Thanks, Mantis!
Tigress, Double Death Strike!
Feet of Fury!
Tigress! Monkey!
Viper! Mantis!
Bunny! What?
Oh, sorry.
Help!
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!
Is everyone OK?
That was awesome!
I got this.
Po!
Chew on that, tubby!
Help.
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?
I think I saw...
I think...
I gotta go.
Thank you. Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.
If you need anything, just ask.
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?
He doesn't work here any more.
He's busy out there protecting the Valley.
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.
Po!
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.
In honour of my son, free tofu dessert for everybody!
With purchases.
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.
Have you lost weight? I can almost put my wings around you.
Ah, well, maybe a little.
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.
I had this crazy vision.
I think I saw my mom and me, as a baby.
Mom? A baby?
- Dad?
- What...?
How do I say this?
Where did I come from?
Well, you see, son, baby geese come from a little egg.
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.
I know it's not.
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.
OK.
You might have been kind of a...
...adopted.
- I knew it.
- You knew?
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.
But if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?
Actually... you came from this.
It was just another day at the restaurant.
Time to make the noodles.
I went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered.
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.
Only there were no radishes.
Just a very hungry baby panda.
There was no note.
Of course, you could have eaten it.
I waited for someone to come looking for you, but no one did.
I brought you inside.
Fed you.
Gave you a bath.
And fed you again.
And again.
And tried to put some pants on you.
And then I made a decision that would change my life forever.
To make my soup without radishes.
And to raise you as my own son.
Xiao Po, my little panda.
And from that moment on, both my soup and my life have been that much sweeter.
And, little Po, that's the end of the story.
Look at me. No, don't look at me.
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!
Well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture.
It was imported, too.
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.
Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning, but look how it turned out.
You got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles.
I know. I just have so many questions.
Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?
Why didn't I like pants?
And who am I?
Good. Watch your form.
Good.
Better. Elbow.
Straighten it out!
Shen?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.
- Your house?
- Yes.
Didn't you see the peacock on the front door?
There you are, Soothsayer.
It seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council, and we will protect it. Even from you.
I'm so glad you feel that way.
Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing.
What's in the box, Shen?
You want to see? It's a gift.
It's your parting gift, in that it will part you.
Part of you here, part of you there and part of you way over there, staining the wall!
You insolent fool!
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.
You are no match for our kung fu.
I agree.
But this is.
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?
- He's dead.
- Whoa.
That's impossible.
Rhino's Horn Defence is impervious to any technique.
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon, one that breathes fire and spits metal.
Unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu.
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.
Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!
OK, here we go! Here we go!
Wait a second.
How can I do this?
I mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?
Remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace.
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
Peace on.
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.
And I even packed all your action figures. See?
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.
I also packed your paintings of our best time together, just in case you get lonely.
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.
And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.
You have a job to do... far from home, in a strange city, filled with strange people, and strange noodles, facing horrible danger from which you might never return!
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.
And if I don't... what am I?
You're my son.
Right?
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.
He'll be back before you can say "noodles".
Noodles.
Come on, guys, let's go!
Yeah!
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...
Mama?
Mom? Dad? Is that you?
Mom! Dad!
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.
Honey, what are you doing here?
But I thought...
We replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish.
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly, does better kung fu.
No. No, no, no.
Wait!
No.
Radish, radish, radish, radish.
Inner pea...
Pea...
Inner peace.
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!
I'm... training.
The mast is not a worthy opponent.
- I am ready.
- OK.
So serious.
I think I prefer the mast.
Apologies. I used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train.
Now I feel nothing.
That's severely cool.
Again!
So, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that?
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.
Is there any, you know, faster way?
You know, until you, you know, don't feel anything?
No. Besides...
...I don't think hard style is your thing.
Po, why are you really out here?
I just found out that my dad isn't really my dad.
Your dad? The goose.
That must have been quite a shock.
Yeah.
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.
Souls of platinum.
Like you.
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing. Nothing.
Po's having daddy issues.
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.
Maybe it's because Mom ate his head before I was born.
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.
Po is the one freaking out.
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!
- What?
- We're here.
Gongmen City.
My father's throne.
He used to let me play here beside him, promising someday, this throne would be mine.
A little to the left.
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!
Thirty years I've waited for this moment.
Everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.
And I envisioned it a little to the left.
Perfect!
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.
With the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me.
We move out in three days, when the moon is full and the tide is high.
Now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my...
Fortune?
Future. I was going to say future.
Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits.
If you continue on your current path...
...you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs.
I see...
I see...
I see pain... and anger.
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!
Followed by denial.
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying
- what's happening right...
- Now?
The most important time is now.
But if you really want to see the future...
Oh, what do you see?
A peacock...
...is defeated by a warrior of black and white.
Nothing has changed.
That's impossible, and you know it.
It is not impossible, and he knows it.
Who?
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!
Big and furry.
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.
There are no more pandas.
Even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth.
Why is it that you cannot?
Find this panda and bring him to me!
Yes, sir!
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.
You're right.
Being right makes me right.
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.
Will you stop that!
That must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city.
Great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim,
"We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five, and we are here to bring you to justice"!
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.
Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face?
I do not like that guy.
We need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves.
Got it. Stealth mode.
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.
Now, where'd those noodles go?
Hello. I couldn't help but...
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?
OK.
Guys! Guys?
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.
So that was stealth mode, huh?
To be honest, not one of my stronger modes.
...gold in there, come on!
This rice is raw!
You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen!
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.
How am I supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught?
- Wait, I have a better idea.
...two...
...one.
- Hey.
- Hey.
We're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep, but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.
Right.
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.
They're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley.
What? They're still alive?
They must be in that jail gathering intelligence, hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon!
OK, let's go!
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!
- Get them!
- Sorry!
Take that!
- Keep going!
- Faster!
Hey, stop!
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!
Surround him.
Now!
Gotcha!
What? Where'd he go?
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.
Then search there!
They must be close. I can feel a kung fu chill riding up my spine.
Sorry, Po. It's just me.
Look. Gongmen Jail.
Aw, it's cute.
Cute, huh?
Nice work, Po.
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.
Excuse me, when have I ever made that noise?
Master Ox! Master!
The ferocious Master Croc!
And Master Storming Ox.
I can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu.
We're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem.
Gotta be a key around here. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!
We're coming for you, Shen!
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?
I mean, you do want to take back your city, right?
Of course we do.
But if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city.
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City by not protecting Gongmen City?
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...
...by the unstoppable weapon.
Nothing's unstoppable except for me when I'm stopping you from telling me something's unstoppable!
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.
I'd like to see you get me out!
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.
Come on! Whatever happened to being heroes?
The only hero in this town is a dead one!
Like I said, you are not getting me out of this cell!
Yes!
All right, let's go!
I get the top bunk.
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.
I...
You...
Kung fu is dead? Fine!
You stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness.
And all you get are three square meals a day of shame!
With despair for dessert.
We'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry for justice and honour that kung fu still lives!
Yeah!
Monkey?!
You! You're mine!
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!
My fist in your plush, cuddly, super-soft face!
Get him!
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!
Stop him!
Faster!
Yeah! Go, go!
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!
- Viper!
- Hang on!
- What?
- Watch out!
Uncool! Very uncool!
Try this!
Guys, guys, guys!
Maybe something smaller!
No, no! Oh, no, no.
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!
Fire!
We've lost them.
Again! Again!
Crane, catch!
Gotcha!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!
Mantis, now!
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!
Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!
Your turn!
Why... are... there... so... many... signs?!
Come here! Alaka-squasho!
Yes! Taste the defeat!
Let me tell you something.
Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole a...
Guess nobody told you, if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs.
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?
We surrender!
You can chain my body, but you will never chain my... warrior spirit.
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.
These are the best cuffs!
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!
No, no, no...
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.
Greetings, panda. We meet at...
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.
He is coming to me in chains.
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.
Don't even think about it.
I hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water.
This plan's nothing like that plan.
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.
Keep moving.
Ah, my old enemy...
...stairs.
Thanks for carrying me those last few flights. OK.
I threw up a little bit on the third floor.
Someone might want to clean that up.
Is there some sort of evil janitor or something?
Greetings, panda.
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?
Hey.
You've grown up bigger than I thought.
Hey... enough with the poking around.
Strong. Healthy.
Look, I don't know who you are, but please stand aside, sir.
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!
Bring the prisoners to me.
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.
Keep your eyes peeled for the... weapon!
Sparrow kick!
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...
Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?
I do not. I know he is.
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?
I did not have a lifetime.
We only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago,
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?
You probably did some other evil stuff along the way. I don't know.
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?
Know what? What's so funny?
The very thing that you clearly do not know!
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?
First, we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big.
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...
The only reason you are still alive is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing.
Well, thank you. But I find your evilness extremely annoying.
Who do you think you are, panda?
Who do you think I am, peacock?
Why are we laughing?
Take aim.
Fire.
Well, light the... thing!
I did!
Fear the bug!
Get the weapon!
Tigress!
You... You were there.
Yes. Yes, I was.
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.
Fire!
Oh. No, he's got way more.
- My wing!
- Help, Po!
Coming!
- Watch out!
- Po!
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.
Use the ropes.
Run, run, little panda!
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!
Bring it down!
- We're trapped!
- This way!
Goodbye!
Fire!
Get back!
The only way out is up.
What?
Follow me! Come on!
Where are they going?
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!
Here we go!
- You idiot!
- My nose!
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!
The Year of the Peacock begins now!
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year, so you'd only get like a half of the Year of the Peacock.
And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock.
Happy New Year, sir.
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.
Now!
Now, now, now, now, now!
Move! Move, move, move, move!
This way.
Let's go.
Oh, you!
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.
What happened to stopping Shen?
Yeah.
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.
I meant for him to get away.
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.
That makes no sense.
What do you mean? Sure it does.
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.
The truth.
Fine. They will keep you far from danger.
- Real far.
- What?
You're staying here.
Wait! I have to go ba...
You're staying here!
I'm going. And you can't stop me.
OK. I wasn't ready that time.
Guys? Don't.
Ready.
Look!
Stay down.
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!
He was there! OK?
The peacock was there the last time I saw my parents.
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.
Who I am.
Look, I'm going.
I have to know.
The hard core can't understand.
Tigress, no!
The hard core do understand.
But I can't watch my friend be killed.
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.
You're better off here.
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.
Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool?
You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen.
A trivial sacrifice... when all of China is my reward.
Then will you finally be satisfied?
Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?
It's a start. I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.
It is time to stop this madness.
Why on earth would I do that?
So your parents can rest in peace.
My parents hated me.
Do you understand?
They wronged me... and I will make it right.
They loved you.
They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.
The dead exist in the past... and I must tend to the future.
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.
Happiness must be taken.
And I will take mine.
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!
If all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall.
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.
I can't feel my face.
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?
- Hey.
- Hey.
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.
You! Where are you going?
On your feet! And wipe those stupid grins off your faces.
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!
Greetings, panda.
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?
- That night.
- Ah, that night.
Yes! We're talking about the same night, right?
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched as your parents abandoned you.
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.
Here's your New Year's gift.
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.
Po? What's he doing here?
Return it! Return it!
Are you willing to die to find the truth?
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.
We got them. Go!
You looking for me?
I said that too soon, didn't I?
Po!
Po, get away from him.
I'll get up. Here we go.
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.
Now... answers.
Oh, you want to know so badly.
You think knowing will heal you, huh?
Fill some crater in your soul?
Well, here's your answer.
Your parents didn't love you.
But here...
...let me heal you!
No!
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.
What are you talking about?
Where am I?
What is this place?
I'm surprised you remember so little.
But you were so little when it happened.
Perhaps you do remember.
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.
Nightmare? Or memory?
This was a thriving village.
Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.
But he wanted more.
I foretold that someone would stand in his way. A panda.
But I never could have foretold what came next.
Get them all!
Take our son and run away! Go!
Stop fighting. Let it flow.
Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are.
It is the rest of your story.
Who you choose to be.
So, who are you, panda?
I am Po.
And I'm gonna need a hat.
Such sad, sad faces.
But now is a time only for joy.
You are going to be part of something beautiful.
Once we reach the harbour, in front of all the world, you and your precious kung fu will die.
Then China will know to bow before me.
Set sail!
What is that?
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.
I always thought I'd meet a nice girl and settle down and...
...then she'd eat my head.
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.
Fire!
You coward!
Po?
Po?
How many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda?
Shen!
A panda stands between you and your destiny.
What?
Prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice.
Your reign of terror comes to an end.
- What?
- And now, free the Five!
Disc of Destruction!
OK. Take aim!
Ready?
You can't follow me.
Just get him!
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
No, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.
Yeah!
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.
Po!
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.
Nice!
Viper, Puppet of Death!
Tigress!
- Master Ox!
- Jump!
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.
Master Shifu!
Quickly. Use their boats to block the way.
Crane!
Wings of Justice!
Yeah!
What?
I love you guys.
Why aren't we firing?
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.
Fire! Fire at them!
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!
Fire!
No.
Po!
Tigress?
As you wish.
Let's finish this.
Fire!
Inner peace.
Again!
Yeah!
Kill him! Somebody kill him!
What? No. No!
Keep firing! Keep firing!
Skadoosh.
How did you...?
How did you do it?
You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose.
Not that. How did you find peace?
I took away your parents. Everything.
I scarred you for life.
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.
No, they don't. Wounds heal.
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.
You gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.
You're right.
Then I choose... this!
That was pretty hard-core.
- Po!
- You did it!
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.
It seems you have found inner peace.
And at such a young age.
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.
All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.
How about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh?
You know, I think we'll just try again another time.
When do you think he'll be back?
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.
At least, I was his dad.
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.
But why? He's just one little panda.
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?
Yep.
Well, I knew you would.
That's why I had new signs made.
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.
Buy one dumpling, get one free."
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.
There's something I should tell you.
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.
I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.
You did?
- I know who I am.
- You do?
I'm your son.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, son.
Delicious, fat radishes!
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.
What are you talking about? I'll cook.
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.
- Po.
- Dad.
- Po!
- OK.
Let's both cook. Together.
Together.
No, I'll cook.
My son is alive.
ENGLISH ESL
Come on!
Come on!
Come on! Let's go! Kick!
Come on, now!
Go! Kick!
- Go!
- Kick!
He's really good, huh?
- Let's go.
- Not as good as you.
- Push hard!
- This is Sandra Sinclair...
...poolside at the Long Center.
Last year, when Clearwater High's swimming star Kyle Connellan graduated...
...leaving behind five state records...
...it appeared the glory days of the Tornadoes might be behind them.
But rising star Donovan Peck...
...recently invited to the Junior National Championships...
...is now on the verge of smashing those records.
Come on, finish hard! Finish hard!
Yeah!
Nice job, you guys.
Hey, hey, hey. Good work. Good work.
- There he is.
- Hey, guys. Hey, good race out there, huh?
Good job, man.
Nice. Good job.
- Kyle, how you doing?
- Good, good.
You know, just dropping in to say my final goodbyes.
Coach, you remember my cousin Sawyer?
Oh, sure.
So you gonna come win some trophies too for me someday? Huh?
So Monday, huh?
Yes, sir.
- You know where they're sending you?
- No, sir.
I hope there's a pool there...
...because the Army's getting themselves one heck of a swimmer.
Thank you.
You take good care, son.
Well, well.
Soldier boy. What are you doing here?
I had to come see for myself how bad things had gotten.
Catch my time?
Yeah.
You know your records are mine, right?
I mean, by the time you get back, your name is gone.
Oh, is that a challenge?
Any time, any place.
Whoo!
Oh, right here, man! Right here!
All right, go deep!
I don't wanna live in the street
Like some folks do
- I'll put that there.
- Let's move these.
I've always known this day would come.
His dad, his grandpa...
I guess you are the smarter sister.
You didn't marry the military.
Over the top!
So how's Sawyer doing?
Not so well. D's and F's in everything.
And somehow being in summer school is all my fault.
Aww. Come on, man!
- Deep! There you go!
- Here we go, end zone! Oh!
Hey, Kyle.
Is that a new one?
No, just fixing up an old one.
Nice.
So...
Pretty excited about summer school, huh?
I'm just kidding.
Well, seriously, though. I mean, at least it gets you out of here, right?
Hey, make me a promise.
You're not gonna sit in here all summer.
All right, now why don't you go out and make some friends.
Why?
Hey.
Look at me, Sawyer.
This isn't like your father, all right?
I'm not disappearing.
I'm just going over there for like
10 minutes, then I'll come right back...
...and you and I can win some gold medals together. How about that?
That's what I mean. I thought you were gonna try for the Olympics someday.
Well, I'm planning on it.
It's just training costs money.
So I do a little time for the Army and they pay for everything.
Hey.
I got you something.
Are you serious?
Now you can take your workshop with you wherever you go.
Hey, come on, dude.
Come back to the party with me.
We gotta hang out before I leave. Right?
Maybe a little later.
Okay.
Be safe.
Call.
- I will. I love you, Mom.
- I love you too, Kyle.
This is Tampa Bay's country station.
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky, breeze
And it don't seem fair
The only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might've found me
My own kind of paradise
Holy smoke.
Watchin' over me
It's a sweet, sweet life
Livin' by the salty sea
Hey!
Hey! Hey, kid!
Have you got a telephone?
A phone, have you got one?
911, what's your emergency?
Hello. Uh...
I don't know. I don't know who to call.
I'm at Neeman's Cove off the A90 and it's in the water.
Wait, don't get any closer than that.
Looks like a dolphin.
- Are you a doctor?
- No, no, no. I didn't say...
Oh, for crying out loud.
Ah!
I'm mad at you.
Shh. No, it's okay. It's fine.
I just have to get this off you.
Hey!
What are you doing? Get out of there.
Wait for me. I'll be right there.
Okay, guys.
It's right over there.
Hazel, be careful.
You cut it free?
Take it easy, Hazel.
Sweetie, let me just get you to move right over here.
Careful, now. Keep it sternal.
- Be careful of the fin, Hazel.
- I know.
Let's get something to cut these ropes.
She's a female.
Oh, she's really shaking.
It's okay. Shh, shh.
Hey, how long has she been here?
I don't know.
Oh, listen, Dad.
She sounds like Tweety Bird.
Yeah, she does sound like Tweety Bird, doesn't she?
Bring the stretcher.
All right, Clay. On our way.
Okay, you guys can hop off now.
And on three we'll lift, all right?
One, two, three.
Her eyes are clenched.
Nice job with the knife.
My side, drop your poles just a little bit.
All right, my side, lift.
"Preposition" is a word that indicates location.
Now, can anyone tell me:
What constitutes a prepositional phrase?
All right? Would be a preposition.
And the object of the preposition would be a noun, a pronoun, a gerund...
Ah. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Nelson.
By the way, you left some of your schoolwork the other day.
Come here.
Now have a seat.
I think I just told you prepositional phrase was...
Remember?
"I got the cookies from my granny."
What?
How did you get in here?
Shh! Shoo.
Shh. Go. Shh.
Move. Scram.
Rufus, no. No, help. Get the fish.
Shoo, shoo!
- Go away. Go!
- Rufus, no.
No, no, Rufus. Shoo, shoo. Go away.
Give me the lid!
Bad, Rufus. Bad.
I named him Rufus because he lives on the roof.
One day he just shows up and now he thinks he owns the place.
- I should just...
- Where are you going?
Don't you wanna see the dolphin?
Isn't that why you came?
You're the boy from the beach, right?
- Uh...
- Okay. But don't tell my dad.
He doesn't like civilians near the sick ones.
How'd you get in here anyway?
Uh... The back door was unlocked.
- Oh, shoot.
- Unh!
It's my job to keep it locked but I always forget.
Come on.
Is all this for the dolphin?
Winter? No, she can't eat this yet.
She can barely move.
I named her that.
We had a Summer and Autumn.
They got put back in the ocean.
I figure season names are good luck.
These were for the other dolphins, but since they were on the floor...
...now they're for turtles.
We're picky about what the dolphins eat.
We get them from the same place as restaurants.
My dad says they eat better than we do.
That is if you like sushi, which I hate.
You don't talk much, do you?
And these are the upstairs pools, where our dolphins are.
And that's Krista and Panama.
Wave.
What?
Wave.
Pretty smart, huh?
Do you know that dolphins need to be in a pool with other dolphins?
It's a law, because they're so social.
Like us. Or me, anyway.
Come on.
She hasn't moved since she got here.
She hasn't even opened her eyes.
Ooh!
Hazel.
Hi, Phoebe.
Who's that? You know your dad doesn't like people back here, honey.
I know, but he's the one who got the ropes off her.
He just wanted to see how she's doing.
She's not good.
There's a lot of dead tissue.
Circulation to her tail was cut off for quite a long time.
Okay. Thanks.
Tweety Bird.
Quick, you gotta go. Don't tell Dad.
Oh, hey.
I'm Hazel, by the way.
Like the eye color?
Oh.
Sawyer.
I'm home, Sawyer.
Ah! Sawyer.
How many times do I have to ask you, ple...
Come on, son. Let's go to bed.
- What?
- Come on.
Homework, tomorrow.
Take the sentences, diagram them.
Separate out what?
The prepositional phrases.
- Looks like it's just getting worse.
- I got it.
Well, the circulation was cut off for so long.
What do you think is the problem?
We've done everything we can for her.
It's just a massive infection.
Increase the topical antibiotics?
They're not really working.
There's just too much dead tissue.
Poor thing.
It just looks like she's giving up.
We can't make her wanna live. She's gonna have to do that part on her own.
Hey. Hey. Go. Shoo. Stop it.
Stop. Let go.
Go. Go. Shh.
Stop it. Go. Get out of here.
Hey.
Come here.
Come over here.
Now who are you?
How did you get in here?
Dad, Dad.
He's the boy from the beach, remember?
Hazel, you know the rules.
Okay? No one is allowed in this part of the hospital.
If you wanna come back during visiting hours...
Clay?
She's awake.
It's that Tweety Bird sound.
She makes that for him.
Come on over here for a minute, will you?
Come on, it's okay.
I want you to help me out with something.
Guys, bring her over to the edge of the pool, will you?
That's more than she's moved all day.
Go ahead and put your hand on her.
It's okay.
Dad, come here.
She really likes him.
Is it okay if he comes back?
I don't know.
Come on, son.
Get dressed, you're gonna be late.
Hey, Mom. I thought I'd go early today, get a jump on my studies.
Early bird gets the worm.
Have a nice day.
Hazel?
Dr. Clay?
Hazel?
Hazel?
What's wrong?
It's okay.
Her tail was too infected.
My dad said it had to come off.
But that's how they swim.
How is she gonna live if she can't swim?
I don't know.
I didn't have a choice, guys.
Least now she has a chance.
Want a lemonade icicle before you go home?
Make them myself.
No, thanks. Probably should get going.
I don't know.
Nothing goes down with crappy news...
...like one of my granddaughter's lemonade icicles.
Come on.
I'm buying.
Have you guys always lived near the water?
My grandpa says we have saltwater in our veins.
Which I actually believed till I was like 6.
That's his boat over there.
When my dad was a boy, they sailed all over the world in that.
What does your dad do?
I don't know.
He left like five years ago.
We don't know where he is.
He never calls, never writes.
Oh.
So, what does your mom do?
She died when I was 7.
Never calls, never writes.
Come on.
I spend whole days up here.
Doing schoolwork, whatever.
I'm homeschooled.
That's why I'm such a chatterbox.
Do you like school?
Well, I fail almost everything.
You probably just haven't found a subject that interests you yet.
Is Winter gonna die?
I hope not.
- Hey, Virginia.
- Morning, Sawyer.
There he is.
Morning.
- Hi, Hazel.
- Hey.
- How is she?
- We're trying to get her to eat.
Pedialyte. Baby formula.
She doesn't want it.
Let's give it a rest.
Can you swim?
Me?
Phoebe's been up all night with her.
She needs some sleep.
Can you swim?
Come on in.
It's okay.
Come on. I got you.
There you go.
All right, just come over here by Phoebe.
See how she's holding her?
Okay, put your right hand under there.
Great.
She's kind of heavy now, so...
- Like this?
- Okay, yeah.
Okay, just keep her blowhole above water.
Watch her eye.
- You got her?
- Yeah.
Just walk her around.
- I'll see you guys in a little while, okay?
- Where you going?
I got a board meeting.
Should I just shoot you now?
Just keep an eye on the kids, will you?
Why? They're fine.
You're the one needs looking out for.
It's not just us, it's all non-profits.
Anyone who relies on government grants.
Gloria, they don't have animals whose lives depend on them.
But we're swimming in debt here.
And in the last six months we lost our two biggest grants.
There is good news.
We still have a strong offer on the table.
- May I please go back to work?
- He's not a bad guy.
Above and beyond the price...
...he's willing to offset the costs of relocating all the animals.
That's what Florida needs, another hotel.
We can wipe out our debts and get the animals placed.
Then, maybe someday, regroup.
- We certainly can't go on the way we are.
- That's true.
There's still time.
Maybe a corporate sponsor will step up.
Or maybe Rufus will win the lottery.
Bring her a little closer, guys, will you?
Come on, Winter.
She's refusing.
Let's try the tube.
Why don't you let Sawyer try.
- You wanna try?
- What do I do?
Put it in front of her eye.
There you go.
Talk to her.
Okay.
Come on, Winter.
I know you feel lousy...
...but you gotta eat.
I mean, if you don't eat, you'll never get better.
It's good too.
Hazel made it herself.
All natural ingredients.
See?
Delicious.
My dad's jealous.
Usually he's the favorite.
I'm not jealous.
Now, come on.
She's drinking.
She's drinking, Dad, she's drinking.
Thattagirl.
She wants more.
All right, now I'm jealous.
Hey, Mom.
Uncle Max. Aunt Alyce.
How was school?
Fine.
Interesting.
Because Mr. Doyle called and said you have not been there all week.
Sawyer, where on...?
What is that stench?
Ugh.
Have you been fishing?
Mm. Get back in there.
Fine. But I'm not going back to school tomorrow.
We're not discussing it. Get in there and wash up some more.
- But Winter needs me. And if I stop now...
- I am not asking you.
You are going to school tomorrow and that is it. Period.
What?
- I didn't say anything.
- No.
Come on, Max, what?
It's just hard to remember the last time
Sawyer was excited about something.
This is not how we do things, Sawyer.
We do not disappear for a week at a time...
...going to some strange place with a bunch of strangers.
Put your belt on right.
How many times do I have to tell you?
- You're making me a nag.
- It rubs.
It's better than face-planting in an airbag.
- Oh, my gosh, Mom. Nice image.
- Well, whatever, okay?
Anything could've happened.
You could've drowned...
...or gotten stabbed by a swordfish, for heaven's sakes.
- That's it?
- Yeah.
You know, it used to be a sewage treatment plant before they converted it. Cool, huh?
Come on, Mom.
Sawyer, wait!
Whoa!
Oh!
Aah!
Go. Shoo, shoo, shoo.
Oh! What are you doing? Leave me alone.
Shoo.
Help! Help!
Oh.
Hi, Mom.
Where did you go?
So these are our nurse sharks.
There are our groupers, and moonfish, and sheepshead.
Hey, Sawyer.
Oh, hey, Virginia.
And these are our river otters.
All of them are either sick or injured.
But as soon as they get better, we'll return them to the wild.
They're cute, huh?
But if you put your finger there, they can bite it right off.
I'll bear that in mind.
- Hey, Sawyer.
- Hey, Rebecca.
She looks after the fish.
And this is the tide pool.
There's a starfish, and conch and a sea urchin.
And this is Fred, our sea slug.
You can touch him if you want.
- That's okay. I'm good.
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.
Oh.
And this is the dolphin pool.
Hmm. I'm not seeing anything.
Just wait a sec.
That's Panama.
She's pretty old and deaf, and can't catch fish...
...because they echolocate, you know.
So she lives here.
And that's Krista.
She was just run over by a boat.
So when she heals, we can send her home.
- Neat, huh?
- Yes.
And that's Winter.
- Welcome. I'm Reed.
- Hi, I'm Lorraine.
We've heard so much about you.
I wish I could say the same about you.
That's my son, Clay...
...and Phoebe, and Kat, there.
Dolphin specialists.
Hi.
And that's Hazel, my granddaughter.
- How old is she?
- She's just a kid.
Dolphins stay with their moms for years, though.
Sawyer's her mom now.
Well, actually, we're all her mom.
- Sawyer, I don't know what to say.
- I'll do extra classes, write an essay.
- I'll do anything.
- I believe you.
I get this. I mean, it's... It's amazing.
- I'll talk to Mr. Doyle.
- Yes!
That's a yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Hazel, she said yes.
- Yes.
- Hi. I'm Clay.
- Hi.
- Lorraine.
- Nice to meet you.
I had no idea you didn't know.
I'm really sorry about that.
It's okay. It's certainly not your fault.
He's a great kid, you know?
I mean, he has a connection with Winter that's amazing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Well, that's good news.
Maybe humans are next.
I have to scoot.
Sure. Come back any time.
- See you at home, pal.
- Bye, Mom.
- So nice to meet you, Hazel.
- You too.
What are you looking at?
No, I can't.
If I do that for him, how is that fair to the other kids...
...whose summers I'm ruining?
Well, that's exactly my point.
Sawyer is having the best summer of his entire life.
And he is willing to do whatever it takes.
He could give a report, write an essay, make a collage.
The experience he is having is so much richer...
...than anything you could teach him in this classroom.
I'm a very good teacher.
I didn't mean it that way, Mr. Doyle.
Look, I wasn't happy about it at first either.
But I am seeing something that a mother, a teacher...
...dreams of seeing:
A turned-on kid.
He is so engaged, and it's not with a Game Boy.
It's with something that is alive and beautiful and real.
He wants credit for the class, he has to be in the class.
I'm sorry.
You should be.
- Morning, Mom.
- Hi, son.
- Thank you! Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Let's make sure it fits.
Your mom seems really nice.
Yeah, she's cool.
- Your dad is too.
- Yeah.
- Winter, stop it.
- Cut it out.
Stop.
What's with her?
I don't know.
Help me grab... Winter!
- Winter!
- Winter!
Winter! Help us!
Dad! Phoebe!
Dr. Clay!
- Hazel?
- Dad!
- Wait, hold it!
- What?
She's trying to swim.
Come over here, guys.
Come here, come here.
She's wiggling around like a snake or something.
Good girl, Winter. Way to go.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, hon.
Whoa! Oh, my goodness, that is so cool.
Winter, look at all this stuff.
Look at all these things
Sawyer brought you.
He brought you so many toys. I know.
It's like a chocolate milkshake for them.
Hazel?
Don't make it too tight. Ah!
There we go. Little to the left.
Winter, look at your rubber duck.
Do you want your duck?
Look, here you go.
- Go get it, Winter.
- Here you go.
Thattagirl.
Hey, Mom.
Guess what happened today.
Kyle.
There's been an explosion, honey, and, apparently, it's pretty bad.
Is he gonna be okay?
They think so.
- He's coming home.
- Yeah.
What you working on?
- Sawyer made it. Cool, huh?
- Yeah.
It's really cool.
I heard about your cousin.
The good news is he's alive.
That's what matters, right?
Yeah.
Hey, I need a little help on the night shift tonight.
Help keep an eye on Winter for me.
Really?
Sure. That'd be great.
Hey, Dr. Clay?
I think you can call me Clay now.
Okay.
Do you think Winter remembers things?
Like the ocean...
...or her family?
It's really hard to say.
They're pretty smart, you know.
Some people think they're smarter than we are.
Some people think dolphins actually are people.
Tell him the story.
Okay.
In California, the Chumash tribe has a legend.
They believe that a long time ago, their goddess, Hutash...
...wanted everyone who lived on the islands to move onto the mainland.
So she built them a bridge out of a rainbow.
Everybody was crossing the rainbow, excited to get to the mainland.
The kids were jumping around having a great time, dancing, singing.
You know, being kids.
Well, they fell off the rainbow, and they went tumbling down toward the sea.
Well, the parents were just scared to death...
...that Hutash was gonna be really mad at them and let their kids drown.
But no.
She took pity on them, because she loved the way they played.
So right at the moment when the children hit the water...
...she turned them into dolphins...
...so they could play forever.
Wow.
Thanks.
I don't know if you know this, but my cousin Kyle's pretty hurt.
Yeah, we don't know how bad yet.
But he's strong.
So he's gonna be okay.
You both are.
Winter, what are you doing?
Want a snack? Over there?
Hey.
Hey. Stop.
What do you want?
You wanna play?
Want a toy? Okay.
We got plenty of toys.
Bowling pin?
No. Okay.
We got...
How about the duck?
You like the duck, right?
Duck?
It's good. Here.
Here you go, Winter.
Come on, Winter.
See the duck? See the duck? Come on.
You want the duck?
Want the duck?
Come on, Winter, do you want it or not?
Whoa! Whoa!
Winter.
Winter!
Okay, is that what you wanted?
You wanna splash?
Take it!
Stop! Stop! No! Okay, I surrender.
I surrender.
You won. You won.
Okay, okay.
You win.
Where's Kyle?
Your Aunt Alyce called, sweetheart.
He decided to go straight to the VA hospital.
But we're his family.
And I wanted to show him some stuff and invite him to meet Winter.
I know. I know.
He just needs some time.
All right, will you please tell him
I called him again?
Yeah. Sawyer.
His cousin.
All right. Thank you.
Come on, you promised you'd teach me to fly it. Remember?
Maybe it'll cheer you up.
Okay, so I get it up in the air, then you can fly it.
But you gotta be careful, okay?
Oh, my gosh. That is so cool.
All right, so this is up, and down, and sideways.
Let me try, let me try. Come on!
No, hold on.
- All right, very little movements.
- Got it.
Sweet.
Okay, watch it.
- Hey, watch it. Quit it. Hey!
- Oh!
Oh, my gosh! Slow it down!
Hazel!
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, no.
Where do you think it went?
- What do you see? I don't see it!
- I don't see it either.
- I'll fix it.
- Give it to me. Stop...
Stop it.
There it is!
Here it comes.
Look out!
That was awesome!
Oh, Phoebe, I flew a helicopter.
Come see.
Your dad called.
Something's up with Winter.
See this bulge right here?
It's hard to see.
- What is it? Is it bad?
- These muscles are enlarged.
They're pulling on her vertebrae and it's causing damage right here.
It's from swimming.
Yeah, a dolphin's tail is meant to flex up and down.
It's not supposed to go side to side.
But that's the only way she can swim.
I know, but they're not designed to move that way.
Well, what's the worst that can happen?
So she'll have a bulge. That's not so bad.
Yeah, but her spinal cord's exactly like ours, right?
It's controlling everything. It's controlling her breathing, her heartbeat, movement.
So if it gets damaged...
So you're saying swimming like that's gonna kill her?
I mean, we can give her some exercises to try to improve it, but...
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.
And I'd like to say a few words, if you please.
Regarding the story that you're about to see it actually happened.
Just take it from me.
But there's more to this story than what's on the page, so please pay attention while I set the stage.
We open in Thneedville, a city they say that was plastic and fake,
and they liked it that way!
A town without nature, not one living tree.
So, what happened to them?
Cue the music! Let's see.
Buzz. Buzz.
In Thneedville, it's a brand new dawn
With brand new cars and houses and lawns
Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville
In Thneedville, we manufacture our trees
Each one is made in factories
And uses 96 batteries
In Thneedville, the air's not so clean
So we buy it fresh
It comes out this machine!
In Satisfaction's- guaranteed-ville
In Thneedville, we don't want to know
Where the smog and trash and chemicals go
I just went swimming, and now I glow
In Thneedville, we have fun year round
We surf and snowboard right in town
We thank the Lord for all we've got
Including this brand new parking lot!
Parking lot!
Parking lot!
Oh, look, it's Aloysius O'Hare
Aloysius O'Hare
The man who found a way to sell air
And became a zillionaire
Hip-hip-hooray!
In Thneedville, we love living this way
It's like living in paradise
It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay
Oh, yeah!
Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville
Destined-to-succeed-ville
We-are-all-agreed-ville
We love it here in...
Thneedville!
Yes!
Oh, hi, Ted.
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.
Did your ball land in my backyard again?
What? No.
A model airplane, this time.
Hey, do you want to see something cool?
Come on.
Whoa!
Did you...
Did you paint this?
Do you like it?
What?
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!
What are those?
Those are trees.
Real ones.
They used to grow all around here.
And people said that the touch of their tufts was softer than anything, even silk.
And they smelled like butterfly milk!
Wow! What does that even mean?
I know, right?
Oh, yeah.
What I want more than anything in the whole world is to see a real living tree growing in my backyard.
So if, say... I'm just thinking out loud here.
If a guy somehow got you one...
I'd probably marry him on the spot.
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?
No! Not crazy.
Not crazy at all.
Ted, honey, don't play with your food.
You, either, Mom.
So, Mom, do you happen to know if there's any place where I could get a real tree?
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.
Yeah, but I mean a real one that grows out of the ground or whatever.
You know, a real tree.
Really?
You would rather have some dirty, messy lump of wood that just sticks out of the ground?
And it does what? I don't even know what it does.
What's its purpose?
Look at what we've got.
It's the Oak-amatic. The only tree with its own remote.
Summer, autumn, winter, and disco!
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.
Dance with the tree.
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.
So' anyway...
Let's just say I need a tree.
Where would I go?
What do I do?
Then you know what? You need to find the Once-ler.
The what?
Mom, it's not really the time for one of your magical fables, okay?
That's right, I forgot.
I'm old and can't even remember to put my teeth in.
Stand down.
That's not what I meant.
No, really, I forgot my teeth.
Would you be a dear and go get them for me?
Sure, Mom.
Okay, here's the deal.
The Once-ler is the man who knows what happened to the trees.
You want one, you need to find him.
The Once-ler?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. Grammy, is this a real thing that we're talking about now?
Oh, he's real all right.
Well, where can I find him?
Far outside of town where the grass never grows and the wind smells slow and sour when it blows.
And no birds ever sing, excepting old crows.
Quit doing that.
That's the place where the Once-ler lives.
Wait, outside of town?
People used to say if you brought him 15 cents,
a nail
and the shell of a great, great, great grandfather snail,
he would tell you everything.
Hmm.
Mr. O'Hare, what we've got for you is something that is going to take O'Hare Air to the next level.
Now, Mr. O'Hare,
I know what you're thinking.
One, "I've gotten rich selling people air that's"
"fresher than the stinky stuff outside"
Two, and here is the important one,
"How can I possibly make even more money?"
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.
Check out this commercial, huh?
Well, here goes another lame Saturday.
Dude, I don't think so!
Huh!
Hey!
Man!
Oh, yeah!
What!
Yeah!
O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.
Please breathe responsibly.
Ah?
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it.
You got to be kidding me.
You really think people are stupid enough to buy this?
Our research shows that if you put something in a plastic bottle, people will buy it.
Exactly. And...
And what's more, when we build a new factory to make the plastic bottles, the air quality is just going to get worse.
Which will make people want our air even more, and drive sales where?
Through the roof!
So, in other words, the more smog in the sky the more people will buy.
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!
I'm aware it rhymes.
Coats. Big.
What do you two knuckleheads want?
I'm in the middle of a meeting!
What?
Why is he leaving town?
No one ever leaves town!
See what he's up to.
Whoa!
Huh?
Whoa! Whoa.
Oh, man.
Whoa!
All right.
Okay.
What the...
Whoa!
Who are you?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.
I can't breathe.
Are you the Once-ler?
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?
No one is supposed to come here.
Get out of here and leave me alone!
And don't let the boot hit you on the way out.
The boot?
Hello!
Ow!
Listen! People say that if someone brings you this stuff that you will tell them about trees.
No, no, no!
Trees?
Yeah, real ones.
You know, that grow out of the ground?
Hello?
Sorry, it's just...
Well, I didn't think anyone still cared about trees.
Well, that's me. The guy who still cares. I'm here.
Hey! What?
Do you want to know about trees?
About what happened to them?
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.
Wait, what?
It's because of me!
And my invention, the Thneed.
It was an amazing product that could do the job of a thousand.
All right.
Sounds ridiculous, but I mean, that's cool.
You're darn right it was cool!
It all started a long time ago.
Can we start not so long ago, maybe?
Do you want a tree?
Yes, yes.
Then it all started a long, long time ago.
I was a young man leaving home.
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to change the world with my Thneed.
I'm actually doing it!
Yes, but just remember, Oncie, if somehow your invention ends up a failure instead of a success, oh, it wouldn't surprise me at all!
Nice wheels.
Burn!
Ow!
Yeah, "Burn!"
But you will see, okay? I'm going to prove you all wrong.
Come on, Melvin!
So, there I was at the very bottom.
With nothing but a wagon, a mule,
and a completely irrational sense of optimism.
I was searching the globe,
obsessed with finding the perfect material for my Thneed.
But I'd had absolutely no success.
Until one day, I found paradise.
Oh!
We're going to be there soon, I'm sure.
Whoa!
This is the most beautiful place, okay, I have ever seen.
Oh.
Ta-da!
Whoa!
Yeah
This is it
This is the place
These Truff ula trees are just what I need
Gonna chop one down and make my Thneed
But first...
Now you!
That's great!
So now our friendship can begin
Hand in hand, and wing and fin
There's nothing you and I can't do
So let's all make my dreams come true
Hey, guys!
Come on, where is my back-up chorus?
What?
Ah-ha! Oh.
Ooh!
Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me?
Yeah, that's awesome.
Feeding junk food to forest animals?
That's great.
But, uh, is there a musical number where you show me how to get a tree?
Because I would love to hear that one.
Oh, yes. Right after the musical number about the kid who kept interrupting the story, and was never heard from again.
Right, got it. Proceed.
All right, here we go.
About to make a Thneed, about to change the world.
Check it out, guys...
Where did everybody go?
Little did I know that by chopping down that tree
I had just summoned a mystical creature as old as time itself.
The legendary, slightly annoying guardian of the forest.
The Lorax.
Hey!
Whoo!
Did you chop down this tree?
Uh... No.
Who did it?
What's that?
I think he did it.
Leave!
Vacate the premises!
Take your ax and get out!
And who are you?
I'm the Lorax!
Guardian of the forest.
I speak for the trees.
So you're telling me, you just didn't see me magically appear out of that stump?
With all the lightning and thunder and stuff.
You didn't see any of that?
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.
Okay. Um...
Didn't really happen.
Oh, I know what you want!
I've got one of these for the cutest little guy lever saw!
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy...
How dare you!
Give me that!
Mmm.
I'm going to eat this, but I am highly offended by it.
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?
What's your deal, man?
Pull them right out Time for you to go, Beanpole!
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.
Stop right there! Stop it!
So you would hammer one of nature's innocent creatures?
What? No!
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,
I would gladly pound you and your mustache into the ground!
Behold! The intruder and his violent ways.
Shame on you.
For shame!
All right, you know what?
That's it!
You listen to me, you furry meatloaf.
I'm going to chop down as many trees as I need. Okay?
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!
End of story.
Then you leave me no choice.
If you're not gone by the time the sun sets on this valley, all the forces of nature will be unleashed upon you and curse you until the end of your days!
You have been warned.
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.
You have been warned.
But I didn't listen to his warning.
And you won't believe what happened that night.
What?
If you want to hear more, come back tomorrow.
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho.
Are you serious right now?
Ah! You live in the middle of nowhere!
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!
I guess you don't really want to hear the rest of the story.
No, no.
I do. I really do. I want to hear the story. I just...
Nah! You don't have what it takes. Goodbye.
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.
It's all right. It's okay, I'll come back.
It's no problem.
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Mmm.
Maybe. Just maybe.
What did you wish for, Audrey?
Well, I would love to tell you, but, sadly, according to the universal wish laws, I cannot.
I know what she wished for.
Was it, perhaps...
This?
Ted, you didn't.
Oh, no. I totally did.
Happy birthday, Audrey.
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Ted.
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!
You're kissing the cereal again, hon. What?
I just...
I like this cereal.
What one is this?
Yeah!
Okay.
Well, I'll make sure to buy extra next time for you.
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do athing.
So, I'll see you guys.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You're not going anywhere, young man.
It's Sunday. You know what that means?
Family time, and we're all playing board games!
But...
Hmm.
Mmm?
Oh, man.
Mom, seriously every turn?
Hey, back off!
Ooh!
No.
Okay! Family time is over.
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.
Okay, dear. Have fun.
I knew I could break her.
Go.
Huh?
Go see him!
Oh, yeah!
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.
Whoa!
Hey! Ted, right?
Um, Mr. O'Hare?
So, I hear you have become interested in trees.
What's that all about?
Oh. Um...
Where did you hear that?
Oh.
Teddy, there's not much that goes on in Thneedville that I don't know about.
Here's the deal, I make a living selling fresh air to people.
Trees?
They make it for free.
So, when I hear people talking about them,
I consider it kind of a threat to my business.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
You listen to me, boy.
Don't go poking around in things you don't understand or I'll be your worst nightmare.
I'm Frankenstein's head on a spider's body!
Yeah, um...
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...
Of course, of course. Now, go back to your family game time.
Grandma just finished her turn.
How did you know?
Please. I have eyes everywhere.
Huh!
You got a beautiful town here, Ted.
Lots of fun stuff to occupy your short attention span.
Why, I can't think of any reason you would ever want to go outside of town again.
Ever.
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.
Oh, no.
Look out!
Hey, man? You know, you need to change that door bell.
Oh, you missed me.
What?
You're already back. Clearly, you missed me a little. Right?
No, I didn't. I'm just here to hear the end of the story.
Why are you so interested in trees anyway?
Why aren't you like other kids, break dancing and wearing bell-bottoms, and playing the Donkey Kongs?
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.
Uh, I just thought it would be kind of cool to have one, you know?
Huh?
It's a girl, isn't it?
What? No!
Really? Because when a guy does something stupid once, well, that's because he's a guy.
But if he does the same stupid thing twice, it's usually to impress some girl.
Hey, she is not some girl!
She's a woman, in high school.
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.
Aw!
How nice to see someone so undeterred by things like reality.
Thank you.
All right, but where did we leave off?
Now that's a Thneed.
Nothing unmanly about knitting. No, sir.
Look at that...
Oh!
Who taught you guys how to steal a bed?
Shh!
Okay, nice and easy.
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't have done it without you.
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?
Of course he can't swim!
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!
Whoo! Whoo!
Jump, jump!
Come on, get up there.
Come on.
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!
Now what?
Mmm-mmm.
Get up there.
Okay, Pipsqueak, give me your hand.
Come on, reach out for the Lorax.
Where did you go?
Bar-ba-loots.
Oh, that's bad.
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!
What's happening?
Where am I?
Hey! We got trouble, and it's coming up fast!
Whoo!
We're in a river!
Whew!
Oh, no.
Just do something!
Help is on the way!
No, no!
Just a minute!
Oh, no!
Wake up! Wake up!
Yuck!
Clear!
Ah!
I was heading into the light, and you pulled me right back and here I am!
You saved my life!
Yeah, I know. Well, no, it's not that big a deal.
It is a big deal!
Look, I almost went over that waterfall! Wait...
On my bed. How did my bed get in the river?
Uh... About that...
Actually... I put your bed in the water.
I didn't mean you any harm.
I just wanted to calmly float you away.
Look, everyone here needs the trees and you're chopping them down!
So, we've got a big problem.
All right, look.
I hereby swear that I will never chop down another tree.
I promise.
Thank you. But I'm going to keep my eye on you.
Good. Now, I've got a big day tomorrow so I'm going to get some sleep.
Right after I find my bed.
Ow!
Okay, what are you...
Question, what are they doing here?
And follow up, if I may, what are you doing here?
Well, after the incident last night, we found one of your socks and came here to return it.
But when we got here, you were asleep. What?
Ew!
Exactly. And sleeping is the body's way of telling other people to go away.
I know, but you looked so cozy.
And it was cold outside, and we just fell asleep. No harm done.
"No harm done"?
"No harm done"? Okay.
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.
Ew.
Did you just...
In my bowl!
Why do you have one of these?
You don't even have a mustache.
Okay, that's it!
What? I thought we made a deal last night.
Yes, we did.
And I said I wouldn't chop down any more trees.
And I said I was going to keep an eye on you.
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?
Breakfast is overrated.
You know what?
I got work to do. Yeah.
I got to go into town and sell my Thneed.
You chopped down one of my trees to make that piece of garbage?
Look at that...
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.
This is a revolutionary product that will change the world as we know it.
It has a million uses!
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!
Mud tracked all over your floor by uninvited guests?
Well, the Thneed sure comes in handy for that!
But wait, there's more!
Thanks to its all-natural microfibers, the Thneed is super-absorbent!
It also works as a hat.
Of course, you probably want to wring it out first.
Go ahead, knock yourself out.
But nobody is going to buy that thing.
Good to know.
Well, fortunately, you are not the target market, weirdo.
You're bringing a guitar?
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.
I'm gonna blow some minds, gonna sell some Thneeds!
Yeah.
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing that all people...
Sit down, go on.
Unfortunately, I didn't sell it the first day.
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great...
Hey!
Or the second day.
Hey!
Or the third, or fourth, or fifth day.
Okay, that one hit the tender spot.
Until finally...
That's it!
You know what?
I'm done with this thing.
Aw.
My family was right.
I quit!
Hey. Cool hat.
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.
That thing makes me like you more.
Hey! Where's your Thneed, did you sell it?
Hey. No, no.
Didn't sell it.
Turns out, it's ahead of its time, I guess.
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?
Come on, take a seat, we'll deal you in.
What are we playing?
I'm playing poker. He's playing Go Fish.
And I think he's hungry.
Oh.
Pancake, the pancake
Up!
Who is up for ninths?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Whoa!
All right, pass them over.
Yeah, see?
What's going on?
Oh, no.
That's a lot of people.
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing that all people need
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great
Let's hope we're not too late
It's a super trendy hat
It's a tightrope for an acrobat
A net for catching butterflies
A thing we use for exercise
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing that all people need
Everybody needs a Thneed
Oh, yeah!
We're in business, baby!
We need a Thneed
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!
You need to bring the whole family here right now.
We're going to be rich!
What? I'm going to need all the help I can get. Don't worry.
So, has he told you how to get a tree yet?
Actually, no.
But I think he's going to get to that part really soon.
Here we are.
What?
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.
Just me and my thoughts.
Oh, is this the girl you're always talking about?
Grandma!
Stop making things up.
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.
Okay, Grammy, let's get you home!
Yeah!
Whoa!
I'm so sorry. So sorry.
Did not wanna see that.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho!
Hey!
Hey, I'm back.
What have you got there?
Yes!
Whoa!
Thank you, Ted.
Now, picture this.
Sun shining, a blue sky, a perfect day.
It was all downhill from there.
Whoa!
What a dump.
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!
Hey, Chet, check this out!
Go long!
No, Brett, that's actually not a...
Okay.
Go long! Go long!
I got it! I got it!
Got it!
He totally ran into that tree!
Ow!
Oncie, is that you?
Mom!
There he is! There's my big, suddenly successful son!
We always knew you would make it, Oncie. Right?
Hey! I love this guy!
But you always said I wouldn't amount to anything, remember?
Hush your mouth. I was just trying to motivate you!
I am really glad that you clarified that because it actually hurt my feelings for a really long time.
Anyway, you're all here, you all work for me, and that's cool.
So, let's get to work.
Brett, Chet, set up the RV!
Would you stop throwing that bear?
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.
Nobody's moving in here.
You got to go. Goodbye.
So, who invited the giant, furry peanut?
You calling me a peanut, huh?
I'll go right up your nose!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You wouldn't hit a woman.
That's a woman?
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.
Let's not get off on the wrong foot here.
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good acquaintance, the Lorax.
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.
And on behalf of the trees, get out!
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.
And I'm going to need their help if my company is going to get bigger. Okay?
Bigger?
Yeah, this isn't some rinky-dink operation any more.
I got plans. Big plans!
A vision of a world filled with Thneeds.
It's going to be huge!
Which way does a tree fall?
Uh, down?
A tree falls the way it leans.
Be careful which way you lean.
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.
I am so proud of me.
Oncie, we've got us a little problem.
Problem?
Mmm-hmm.
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.
Harvesting the tufts takes too long!
Well, what else can we do?
Well, and this just came to me, we could always start chopping down the trees.
What?
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!
But...
No "but" s, Oncie.
You're running a business now.
You have to do what's best for the company, and your momma.
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to chop down a few trees.
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!
Hey! I love this guy!
No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.
Take that, you stupid tree!
Where do you think you're going?
Excuse me, sir. I need to talk with your boss.
Oh, I'm sorry, but Mr. Once-ler's not seeing anyone right now.
Yeah, well, he'll see me. So...
Hey, keep your paws off me!
Give me a reason, Shorty.
Hey, you broke your promise.
You're better than this.
You gotta stop!
This is bad!
Have a nice day!
Bad?
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.
Do you think I'm bad?
Thank you!
I mean, something good finally happens to me, and he just has to come along and rain on my parade.
What's his problem?
See?
Yeah, bad! Right.
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
I'm just following my destiny
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
How bad can I possibly be?
Well, there's a principle in nature
Principle in nature
That almost every creature knows
Called survival of the fittest
Survival of the fittest
And check it, this is how it goes
The animal that wins gotta scratch and fight
And claw and bite and punch
And the animal that doesn't
Well, the animal that doesn't
Winds up someone else's
La-la-la-la lunch
Munch, munch, munch, munch, munch I'm just sayin'
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
I'm just following my destiny
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
How bad can I possibly be?
There's a principle in business
Principle in business
That everybody knows is sound
It says the people with the money People with the money
Make this ever-loving world go round
So I'm biggering my company
I'm biggering my factory
I'm biggering my corporate sign
Bigger, bigger!
Everybody out there
You take care of yours
I'll take care of mine-mine-mine-mine-mine
Shake that bottom line
Let me hear you say Smogulous Smoke!
Smogulous Smoke!
Schloppity-Schlopp!
Schloppity-Schlopp!
Complain all you want It's never, ever, ever, ever gonna stop
Stop!
Come on, how bad can I possibly be?
How bad can I be?
I'm just building the economy
How bad can I be?
Just look at me petting this puppy
How bad can I be?
A portion of proceeds goes to charity
How bad can I be?
How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!
All the customers are buying
And the money's multiplying
And the PR people are lying
And the lawyers are denying
Who cares if a few trees are dying?
This is all so gratifying!
How bad?
How bad can this possibly be?
So, how are things?
What are you doing here?
Happy yet? You fill that hole deep down inside you?
Or do you still need more?
Look, if you've got a problem with what I'm doing, why haven't you used your quote-unquote powers to stop me?
I told you, that's not how it works.
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.
I need you to get out. Now!
Why? Do I make you uncomfortable?
Remind you of the promises you made?
The man you used to be?
You know what?
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.
I have done nothing illegal.
I have my rights, and I intend to keep on biggering and biggering, and turning more
Truff ula trees into Thneeds.
And nothing is going to stop me!
Well, that's it.
The very last one.
That may stop you.
Somebody sure made a bundle on that thing.
I wonder what the next million dollar invention's going to be.
Yeah, I wonder...
Son, you have let me down.
Brett, you are now my favorite child.
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.
And you won't get any.
Not from them.
Thanks to you and your hacking, and smogging and glupping, they can't live here any more.
So, I'm sending them off.
Hopefully, they'll be able to find a better place out there somewhere.
Melvin?
Melvin...
Hey, Pipsqueak...
Hey...
So, this is really all your fault.
You destroyed everything.
Yes.
And each day since the Lorax left,
I've sat here regretting everything I've done, staring at that word, "unless," and wondering what it meant.
But now I'm thinking...
Well, maybe you're the reason the Lorax left that word there.
Me? Why would he leave that for me?
Because unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.
It's not.
The last Truff ula seed.
You need to plant it, Ted.
Yeah, but, nobody cares about trees any more.
Then make them care.
Plant the seed in the middle of town, where everyone can see.
Change the way things are.
I know it may seem small and insignificant, but it's not about what it is, it's about what it can become.
That's not just a seed, any more than you're just a boy.
I won't let you down.
I know.
Hey, Audrey!
Audrey!
Ted?
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.
Wait, but...
My house, okay?
Got to plant the seed.
Okay, we're going to need water.
And uh, something to dig with.
Um, what do I have...
Ted?
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.
Theodore Wiggins, get down here right now, and I am not kidding with you!
Ted, I would like you to meet Mr. O'Hare, the most powerful man in town.
There he is!
Hello, Ted.
Uh...
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?
He knows his own name and everything.
You know what I would love right now, Mrs. Wiggins?
A delicious cookie.
Wonderful.
Teddy and I'll stay here and talk.
Sure, why don't you go ahead and adopt him?
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.
I'll get your cookie.
I know you have it, Ted.
So, let's put an end to this nonsense, shall we?
Hand it over.
I'm sorry...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really? Well, then...
I guess you wouldn't mind us checking your room.
No, no, no!
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!
No, you can't go up there!
Guys, this is ridiculous. Stop!
Hey!
No, you can't come in my room!
Find it!
Find it!
What is going on here?
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!
Excuse me, down there!
I don't care who you are, you little crazy baby-man!
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.
Fine. Sorry.
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.
And my apologies, Ted.
You be safe.
Mind telling me what's going on here?
The seed! Where is it?
Seed?
Where's Grammy?
It's alive!
I remember you.
Ted, what...
Audrey!
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!
Ted, what is this about?
It's about this.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that... Yes. The last Truff ula seed.
And you're going to help me plant it right in the middle of town where everyone can see it.
I could just kiss you right now!
We don't have time for that.
I don't know, we have a little time.
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go Forget about it.
Maniac!
Hey!
Ah!
Here it comes!
I'm going for it.
Oh, hello!
Ted, big scary blimp coming.
Whoa!
You won't get away with this, boy!
Bam!
Go faster, you idiot!
Yeah!
Step on it, Ted!
Whoa!
You're fired!
Whoa! Ted, look out!
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...
This is not good.
How's it doing?
Whoa-ho-ho!
Loser!
Oh, really?
Oh, no. The seed!
Get that seed!
Hang on! Here we go!
Grammy!
Seriously, how cool is your grandma?
No!
Come on!
Yeah, that's right.
There it is!
Hey! Watch the road, you meathead!
Ah!
Hey, ow, ow!
Oh, come on!
What the...
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!
Bring it on, Teddy!
You don't have the guts!
Ted!
Grammy!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! It's Mr. O...
Take that, shorty!
Okay, we have to get this in the ground.
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.
No, Grammy...
Hey, get out of there!
Ah!
Hey!
What?
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!
What do you think you're doing, kid?
Um, I'm looking for a place to plant a tree.
A real one.
Why would we need a tree?
Exactly.
Oh, man.
Folks...
The last thing you want around here is trees.
They're filthy!
Spewing that sticky, nasty sap all over the place.
They bring poisonous ants and stinging bees.
Hey!
Ouch.
Think about the kids.
And, I just thought, you know, they make leaves!
You know that, right?
Then these leaves, they just fall.
They just fall wherever they want!
Come on! We know why you're really against trees.
Because they produce fresh air.
For free!
Oh!
I am wounded!
You have lied!
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.
Come on.
She's making that up!
That's a made-up word, people!
Thneedville is perfect just the way it is.
We don't need trees!
That boy has a seed.
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!
O'Hare is right!
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!
Where do you think you're going?
Come on, let's go!
Get in, get in!
Hey!
Stop that maniac!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!
Ted, you're going to hit the wall!
Yeah. I know.
Wow. Did you see that?
Who does this kid think he is, huh?
I am Ted Wiggins.
And I speak for the trees.
And the fact is, things aren't perfect here in Thneedville.
And they're only going to get worse, unless we do something about it, unless we change our ways.
And we can start by planting this!
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.
Right?
I say we tell this kid what we think about that seed!
People, come on!
You! Get out there right now and get these people on my side, or else you're fired!
Go on, tell them what you think.
You don't know me, but my name's Cy
I'm just the O'Hare delivery guy
But it seems like trees might be worth a try
So I say let it grow
My name is Dan
And my name's Rose
Our son Wesley kind of glows
And that's not good, so we suppose
We should let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap what you don't sow
Plant a seed inside the Earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
My name's Marie, and I am three!
I would really like to see a tree
I say let it grow
I'm Grammy Norma I'm old, and I've got gray hair
But I remember when trees were everywhere
And no one had to pay for air
So I say let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
Like it did so long ago
It is just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to change the life we lead
Time to let it grow
My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you
I live here in Thneedville, too
The things you say just might be true
It could be time to start anew
And maybe change my point of view
Nah! I say let it die!
Let it die, let it die
Let it shrivel up and...
Come on, who's with me?
Nobody.
You greedy dirt-bag!
Let it grow, let it grow
Let the love inside you show
Plant a seed inside the Earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap what you don't sow
It's just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to banish all your greed
Imagine Thneedville flowered and treed
Let this be our solemn creed
Thank you, Ted.
We say let it grow
In Thneedville
We say let it grow
It's a brand new dawn
We say let it grow
In Thneedville
We say let it grow
It's a brand new dawn
You done good, Beanpole.
You done good.
By the way, nice mustache.

{17249}{17293}I'm sorry. Are we boring you?
{17317}{17349}I just don't drink.
{17770}{17856}It's Iike a... ''just say no'' thing?
{18061}{18119}Because you couId just say yes.
{18120}{18161}Stop it.
{18414}{18472}Don't ever touch me, ever again.
{18523}{18565}Sorry.
{18727}{18768}Jeez.
{19951}{19979}I'm going to bed.

{21133}{21201}I just reaIIy don't|want to Iose him again.
{21402}{21477}Did you see his face|when he saw you here?
{21479}{21538}He was so excited.
{21540}{21610}Jonah, you never Iost Dad, OK?

{22946}{23006}That's just it.

{23078}{23148}Is that not obvious?|Do you not get that?
{23149}{23227}Yeah. Let's make the best of it, OK?
{23281}{23317}Are you gonna pIay?
{23394}{23473}Are you going to pIay? Because|if you are, I'm sIeeping outside.
{23733}{23833}- Hey, congratuIations on JuiIIiard.|- Why? I'm not going.
{23835}{23884}- That wouId be a mistake.|- WeII,

{24075}{24153}- It's OK, Jonah.|- I'm sorry, Jonah. Go back to sIeep.
{24176}{24217}I'II be there in a minute.
{24282}{24377}If you're pissed at me and you|want to hurt me, fine, hurt me.
{24379}{24466}Be mad, be angry,|but don't stop pIaying.

{25419}{25473}- Since when?|- A year and a haIf.
{26197}{26249}Must have found a turtIe's nest.
{26264}{26358}I'm not going near it. Must be sick|or something if it's out in the daytime.
{26378}{26432}Sure is enjoying those eggs.
{26433}{26486}What? No, no, no, no!
{26488}{26524}No!
{26608}{26663}Oh, my God.
{27204}{27262}She's Iosing it, Dad.
{27280}{27309}Big time.
{27583}{27638}A sea turtIe Iaid eggs.
{27640}{27702}The raccoons wiII eat them|if I don't keep them away.
{27725}{27750}ReaIIy?
{27752}{27840}When a femaIe Iays her eggs,|the raccoons smeII them and...
{27841}{27886}They'II eat every one if they can.
{27918}{28004}This Web site toId me|to caII the aquarium
{28005}{28081}and see if I couId get someone|to come here and protect them,
{28083}{28153}- but my battery's dead.|- There's a number to the aquarium
{28154}{28272}on the waII by the phone. HonestIy,|I don't know how they'II improve on...
{28273}{28317}On that.
{28385}{28441}Hey! Veronica!
{28443}{28505}No, Ronnie, it's fantastic. I Iike it.

{28671}{28747}- Hey, Dad, can we fIy a kite today?|- AbsoIuteIy not.
{28748}{28820}We're fIying three kites today.|AII of us.
{28821}{28865}You're dreaming, Dad.
{28889}{28982}Yeah. I'd Iike to report some|sea turtIe eggs outside of my house.
{29010}{29051}Sure.
{29129}{29200}- What?|- You said ''outside my house.''
{29201}{29229}I Iike that.
{29230}{29317}Did you go to, Iike,|a nice guy schooI or something?
{29319}{29385}What's with aII your smiIing IateIy?
{29387}{29432}SeriousIy, it's creepy.
{29643}{29709}Is my...? Is my smiIe creepy?
{29710}{29751}WeII, I don't know. Let's see it.
{29775}{29805}I'm doing it.
{29885}{29973}Kind of, but I think|you need to show teeth.
{30408}{30467}My grandmother used|to drive one of those.
{30468}{30534}- She did?|- Yeah.
{30536}{30572}BareIy.
{30590}{30694}Is that miIkshake girI?|You shouId go spiII that soda on her.

{30831}{30914}Hi. Nice Iook.
{30916}{30966}I aImost didn't recognize you|with your shirt on.
{31021}{31097}I'm sorry. I was stupid.
{31098}{31150}- Yeah.|- It must have been the game.
{31152}{31229}I get a IittIe... jacked up.
{31277}{31365}You know, I Iaid awake that night,|just remembering it.
{31367}{31405}FeIt Iike a jerk for hours.
{31457}{31523}I seriousIy doubt that happened.
{31542}{31580}You're wrong.
{31659}{31697}I'II see you around.
{31744}{31773}I hope so.
{31918}{31998}What shouId I caII you|when that happens?

{32436}{32487}You know who her father is, right?
{32514}{32573}Yeah. So?
{32619}{32645}Just checking.
{32675}{32752}Hey, what's up? Did the aquarium caII?
{32753}{32822}- I don't know.|- Oh, crap.
{32824}{32880}Hey! Hey!
{32901}{32945}Hey!
{34060}{34101}Hey.
{34208}{34271}- What are you doing here?|- What are you doing here?
{34272}{34356}- I asked you first.|- I'm here to mark a turtIe nest.
{34418}{34481}You work for the aquarium?|I thought you were a mechanic.
{34483}{34557}- I don't work there. I voIunteer there.|- I caIIed yesterday.
{34602}{34663}- Is everything OK?|- No, everything's not OK.
{34664}{34751}- There were raccoons here aII night.|- ReaIIy?
{34779}{34829}- Where are they now?|- I scared them away.
{34831}{34905}Yeah, I'm not surprised.|I'm a IittIe scared.
{34946}{34987}That's reaIIy funny.
{34988}{35050}You know, I'd Iike to see|you sIeep out here aII night
{35052}{35152}whiIe it's freezing with a basebaII bat|in your hand and raccoons terrorize you.
{35198}{35261}- You reaIIy sIept out here aII night?|- No.
{35262}{35333}My hair Iooks Iike this aII by itseIf.
{35335}{35391}I wasn't gonna mention the hair, but...
{35526}{35566}This aII your creation?
{35568}{35656}- Do you have a probIem with it?|- Not reaIIy.
{35657}{35721}Other than the fact|that when the eggs hatch,
{35722}{35816}turtIes won't be abIe to get back to|the sea, so... they'II starve and die.
{36466}{36504}Hey.
{36559}{36601}BIaze.
{36635}{36682}BIaze, what's wrong?
{36702}{36776}I saw how you Iooked at him.|At Marcus? I saw you.
{36777}{36845}- What are you taIking about?|- I Iove him, OK?
{36847}{36918}- So stay away.|- I am not interested...
{36920}{36973}You're Iying!|I watched you fIirt with him.
{36975}{37033}The guy's a creep.|He was the one coming on to me.
{37034}{37101}Why wouId you want to be|with someone Iike that anyways?
{37102}{37157}Excuse me.
{37158}{37224}- What?|- I'm sorry. I have to check your purse.
{37225}{37262}Fine.
{37400}{37441}I did not take that.
{37443}{37476}I didn't take...
{37576}{37624}You're gonna have to come with me.
{37790}{37858}- Mom's gonna fIip out.|- Shut up. OK, Jonah?
{37860}{37924}Ronnie, don't taIk|to your brother Iike that.
{38291}{38357}- Where you going?|- Home. Where do you think I'm going?
{38358}{38404}I'm caIIing Mom.

{38500}{38593}We had a reaIIy nice day,|and you had to ruin it!
{38595}{38693}Let her go! Let her.|Make her Ieave us aIone!
{38787}{38856}How do you want me to respond, Ronnie?
{38857}{38940}- You want me to teII you it's OK...?|- I want you to beIieve me.
{38974}{39029}But obviousIy, you can't do that.
{39259}{39312}I did it in New York.
{39373}{39428}I stoIe something.
{39454}{39536}And I don't need you to teII me|that it's wrong, because I know that.
{39599}{39656}But I didn't do it here.
{39737}{39793}The store owner is a friend of mine.
{39830}{39867}I'II taIk to him.
{39957}{39983}OK?
{40621}{40665}Evening.
{40976}{41015}Anna Karenina.
{41016}{41073}''Happy famiIies are aII aIike.
{41075}{41154}Every unhappy famiIy|is unhappy in its own way.''
{41238}{41308}Is quoting ToIstoy|supposed to impress me?
{41309}{41392}I wasn't quoting ToIstoy.|I was quoting his transIator.
{41393}{41455}But since you asked...
{41906}{41954}Are you moving in?
{41956}{42057}Hey, If I want to get some sIeep, I need|something to scare off the raccoons.
{42058}{42113}They don't Iike bright Iights or music.
{42160}{42211}You're pIanning to sIeep here?
{42235}{42314}WeII, the truth is the town|sort of got together
{42316}{42392}and decided we couIdn't take|another one of your bad hair days.
{42393}{42452}Oh, reaIIy.
{42454}{42525}So the word is you're from New York.
{42541}{42605}It's a smaII town, peopIe taIk.
{42632}{42736}I got accepted to CoIumbia in the faII.|Who knows? We might be neighbors.
{42793}{42860}So, what are you doing down here?
{42861}{42957}My mom shipped me and my brother|to my dad's for the summer.
{42959}{42996}Guess so I couId baby-sit turtIe eggs
{42997}{43097}whiIe a voIIeybaII pIayerlaquarium|voIunteer hits on me every five seconds.
{43099}{43141}Now, who's conceited?
{43165}{43228}Since we're on the subject,
{43229}{43301}I'm not hitting on you.
{43303}{43350}SeriousIy, I'm engaged to be married.
{43503}{43558}What's the matter with you?!
{43560}{43601}I'm sorry.
{43667}{43717}This doesn't Iook good.
{43764}{43826}You're not OK with this, are you?
{43909}{43983}Then we'd better|maintain visuaI contact.
{45141}{45176}Good evening.
{45229}{45273}HeIIo, sir.
{45289}{45324}Hey.
{45410}{45482}You mind?
{45483}{45517}No.
{46020}{46075}Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
{46833}{46875}- HeIIo.|- Don't ''heIIo'' me.
{46876}{46936}I need your name, soIdier.
{46990}{47037}I'm WiII.
{47039}{47102}- You are?|- I'm her roommate.
{47104}{47183}The commanding officer|sent me out with rations.
{47184}{47248}But unfortunateIy, it's vegetarian.
{47249}{47320}So, personaIIy, I'd rather eat sand.
{47357}{47410}Thanks for the tip, bro.
{47548}{47594}Hey.
{47596}{47666}I'd better get going.|I'm supposed to be at the aquarium.
{47668}{47705}Me too.
{47750}{47823}Not hard-to-get again.
{47863}{47940}SeriousIy, Ronnie. You read ToIstoy.
{47941}{48040}You take up arms|to defend innocent sea turtIes.
{48041}{48086}The ice-cube act's not working.
{48283}{48328}Let's try it again.
{48363}{48393}Last night was fun.
{48462}{48517}- Best first date of my Iife.|- It was not a date.
{48519}{48616}We couId make it one, if you|don't mind coming to work with me.
{49727}{49782}- It's kind of cooI, huh?|- It's incredibIe.
{49784}{49837}- So big.|- Try cIeaning it.
{49838}{49906}It must be pretty cooI,|swimming with aII the fish.
{49908}{49985}- You shouId see it from in here.|- Maybe I wiII someday.
{49986}{50044}Yeah.
{50045}{50071}Give me a hand up?
{50180}{50222}I'm gonna kiII you!
{50536}{50569}Dude!
{50591}{50657}- Where you been?|- I'm sorry, man. She's such a kIutz.
{50659}{50721}- She feII in the tank five times.|- That is not true!
{50722}{50754}- Ronnie, Scott.|- Hi.
{50756}{50809}We got the tournament coming up.|Let's go.
{50810}{50905}- Want to grab me a water?|- Fine. I'II be back in a minute.
{50960}{51002}Wet hair?
{51004}{51052}Let me guess.|He took you to the aquarium
{51054}{51133}and did his whoIe|underwater fish-man show for you.
{51134}{51177}Were you impressed?
{51179}{51253}- Do I know you?|- I'm a friend of WiII's.
{51255}{51330}But, you know, WiII has Iots of friends.
{51332}{51415}He makes us aII feeI speciaI.|For a IittIe whiIe.
{51709}{51733}Bitch.
{51750}{51792}There you go.
{51793}{51859}OK. Spread it out a IittIe.|Good job! ExceIIent.
{51860}{51944}- I didn't burn a hoIe through it.|- No, you didn't.
{51946}{51989}Hey, Dad.
{51991}{52101}Do you and Mom ever taIk|about getting back together?
{52103}{52176}Jonah, your mom's about to get married.
{52178}{52261}So? You have dibs.|You married her first.
{52262}{52349}Yes, I did. And it was a good marriage.
{52383}{52432}It was. It Iasted a Iong, Iong time.
{52433}{52484}We have two great kids out of it.
{52485}{52581}It's just...|You know, Iove's not aIways...
{52621}{52714}That's not aIways enough.|It's probabIy...
{52716}{52773}...hard to understand.
{52775}{52869}What has one eye, speaks French|and reaIIy Ioves cookies?
{52870}{52924}Are you taIking...|Are you taIking about Iove?
{52973}{53053}OK, OK. Cookies. Very good.
{53104}{53166}I changed the subject to cookies.|Is that cooI?
{53168}{53213}Yeah. I'II get them.
{53321}{53349}Is everything OK?
{53551}{53598}Hey. You never came back for me.
{53639}{53668}Ronnie?
{53669}{53737}- Just go away! OK?|- What's wrong?
{53739}{53789}Go away!
{53838}{53912}Ronnie, what happened? Ronnie!
{54017}{54098}I'm sorry, sir.|CouId you teII me what's going on?
{54151}{54250}That wouId require my understanding|how the femaIe brain works,
{54252}{54337}which I don't, but if you'd Iike|to come in and be cIueIess together,
{54339}{54377}you're more than weIcome.
{54429}{54532}- That's OK. I'II just wait out here.|- Yeah.
{54914}{54986}How Iong you think he'II stay?
{54988}{55092}- Why don't you go ask him?|- He's not my boyfriend, he's hers.
{55093}{55157}He's not my boyfriend, either.
{55236}{55315}Do you think he'II|stay out there aII night?
{55316}{55357}That's hard to say.
{55359}{55439}- A doIIar says he is.|- A doIIar?
{55472}{55544}OK, you're on.|Let's make it interesting. Two doIIars.
{55545}{55609}Two bucks. He's not staying there.
{55638}{55732}What if he stays out there forever?|What if he never Ieaves and then dies?
{55734}{55821}Yeah, and his corpse|is eaten by a bunch of raccoons.
{55844}{55941}And then he stiII doesn't Ieave,|'cause that's how powerfuI his Iove is.
{55943}{55996}What is wrong with you two?
{55997}{56065}TurtIes. TurtIes eat his corpse.
{56163}{56229}You need to Ieave.|You're freaking out my IittIe brother.
{56231}{56306}Not untiI you teII me what happened.|Was it AshIey?
{56308}{56358}I saw you taIking to her.|What did she say?
{56360}{56429}- Just Ieave, aII right?|- TeII me what she said to you.
{56431}{56525}WiII, I did not come here|for some stupid summer romance
{56526}{56574}with some stupid IocaI boy
{56576}{56650}that has done this|with a thousand other girIs.
{56652}{56704}- What?|- AshIey toId me about
{56705}{56773}aII the girIs you've been with.
{56775}{56840}So I don't want to be just the next girI
{56841}{56896}in your IittIe parade of girIs, WiII.
{56897}{56996}Going on the same date,|doing the exact same thing.
{57026}{57109}I think that's why it wouId|just be better if we just end it.
{57110}{57148}End it?
{57150}{57189}End what?
{57191}{57277}Ronnie, yes, OK, I went out|with other girIs before I met you.
{57279}{57357}That's the point. It was before I|met you! How can you be mad about that?
{57358}{57477}Don't you dare make this about me. You|and I both know this is not my fauIt...

{67961}{68002}Here, do my hair.
{68044}{68072}Go.
{68195}{68239}These are WiII's sister's.
{68260}{68320}They shouId fit you.
{68321}{68361}Thank you, ma'am.
{68499}{68561}Here, turn around.
{68563}{68588}CoId!
{68590}{68709}It's a famiIy tradition. Both my parents|went to coIIege at VanderbiIt.
{68711}{68768}Tom and I actuaIIy met there.|Didn't we, Tom?
{68799}{68893}And now, our WiIIiam|wiII go there as weII.
{68894}{68961}- Where wiII you be going, Ronnie?|- I'm not...
{69004}{69056}...going anywhere.
{69092}{69190}I mean, I don't reaIIy have|anywhere pIanned for me, or...
{69248}{69320}I just haven't figured out|the whoIe coIIege thing yet.
{69392}{69457}But...
{69458}{69541}WiII, pass Ronnie some roast beef.
{69542}{69608}- No, thank you.|- I toId you, Ronnie's a vegetarian.
{69609}{69679}- ReaIIy?|- Yeah.
{69732}{69828}- Why?|- Just reasons.
{69912}{69979}I mean, it's not that I don't|Iike peopIe that Iike meat.
{69980}{70052}I mean, they're fine. Just that...
{70053}{70140}- How you been, Dad?|- Oh, I been good. Good.
{70141}{70248}You know, I was going through|some of Mikey's stuff the other day.
{70250}{70357}- And if you have time...|- That's enough, Tom.
{70602}{70694}WeII, she's a Iot prettier|than you described her, WiII.
{70696}{70765}Thank you, Dad.
{70766}{70825}You bringing her to the wedding?
{70883}{70997}He didn't teII you? His sister's|getting married in a coupIe of weeks.
{70999}{71095}No, I don't think you|did mention that, WiII.
{71165}{71226}- WouId you Iike to come?|- WiII?
{71228}{71305}Your sister toId me|that you were bringing AshIey.
{71307}{71377}I sent out her invitation|just yesterday.
{71470}{71518}- Ronnie, this is siIIy.|- Drop it, WiII.
{71520}{71557}I can't drop it. You're mad.
{71559}{71596}- I'm not mad.|- You're mad.
{71597}{71677}I'm not! You want to go to your sister's|wedding with your ex-girIfriend,
{71677}{71713}- it's not a big deaI.|- Not as a date.
{71714}{71784}She's a friend of my sister's.|I said it was OK if she came.
{71785}{71850}HonestIy, it's not a big deaI|because I don't want to go
{71852}{71911}to some wedding|where I don't know anybody.
{71912}{71965}- Ronnie...|- And you just forgot to mention
{71965}{72037}you're going to VanderbiIt.|You toId me you're going to CoIumbia.
{72037}{72115}No, I didn't.|I toId you I was accepted to CoIumbia.
{72116}{72189}Ronnie, it's compIicated, OK?|My parents are...
{72213}{72296}- Not a good time to disappoint them.|- What's compIicated? It's your Iife.
{72297}{72367}- Go to the coIIege that you want to.|- It's not that simpIe.
{72382}{72429}Look, we don't have to do this.
{72466}{72553}- What do you mean?|- Maybe you shouId find someone
{72555}{72669}that's more suited to your IifestyIe.|You know, with her own rich parents,
{72671}{72720}- her own perfect mansion...|- Ronnie,
{72721}{72792}there is nothing perfect|about that house.
{72793}{72893}Can you not see that? My parents|are hoIding on by a thread.
{72894}{73000}Perfect? Nothing's been perfect|in my famiIy for a Iong time.
{73212}{73274}I had a brother. Mikey.
{73302}{73349}He died Iast year.
{73381}{73436}How?
{73437}{73490}Car accident.
{73554}{73601}My mom was driving.
{73602}{73680}Mikey and I were in the back seat,|goofing off, pIaying Mercy.
{73699}{73734}We were being idiots.
{73736}{73796}She turned around to teII us to stop,
{73798}{73857}and she Iost controI of the car.
{74002}{74054}He was kiIIed instantIy.
{74154}{74248}It's just so hard|to feeI happy in that house.
{74313}{74383}It's the onIy reason|I didn't invite you to the wedding.
{74412}{74485}I went out with those girIs|because I was
{74487}{74545}trying to feeI something again.
{74732}{74798}No one has made me feeI|Iike you do, Ronnie.
{74887}{74933}I don't want to Iose you.
{75402}{75439}I Iove you, WiII.
{75483}{75532}I Iove you too.
{75766}{75850}And, since you asked...
{75903}{75968}...there is something|that you don't know about me.
{76006}{76045}Come here.
{76395}{76449}What are we doing here?
{79148}{79230}Hey. Did you have a good time?
{79427}{79452}What?
{79479}{79520}I pIayed today.
{79591}{79648}That's...
{79649}{79698}That's good. How did it feeI?
{79824}{79877}Like I never stopped.
{80037}{80081}Dad...
{80160}{80261}I'd probabIy taIk about this with|a girIfriend if I had one here, but...
{80263}{80348}...I don't, so...
{80444}{80533}So you want to taIk? You want to taIk?
{80535}{80574}Here we go. Let's taIk.
{80576}{80636}Yeah?
{80793}{80897}So you... you Iike this guy?
{81023}{81096}You Iike him... You Iike him a Iot?
{81138}{81176}I Iike him more than a Iot.
{81235}{81305}- ReaIIy?|- Is that crazy?
{81388}{81459}WeII, a IittIe, but...
{81501}{81577}...Iove is, Ronnie.
{81579}{81676}Crazy... a IittIe.
{81730}{81774}Thank you.
{82084}{82117}Good night, Dad.
{82448}{82481}Dad!
{82481}{82521}- Hey!|- There she is.
{82522}{82604}Look, a shopIifter and an arsonist.
{82636}{82725}I'm sorry. Did you not know|about your dad and the church?
{82767}{82828}- Hey! Hi.|- Hey, Jonah.
{82885}{82929}- This is so cooI.|- It is cooI.
{82930}{82981}- Hey, honey.|- Hey, Dad.
{82982}{83025}OK.
{83041}{83088}What's up?
{83200}{83269}Keep your head in the game, brother.|Got it?
{84111}{84137}Yeah!
{84595}{84635}Good game, man.
{84728}{84764}Yeah!
{84853}{84879}Here you go.
{84994}{85027}Come on. Open it!
{85187}{85236}Dad!
{85237}{85313}Dad, you're right.|I got invited to the wedding.
{85448}{85493}- That's great, and...|- Thank you.
{85494}{85559}Since I know you have nothing to wear
{85560}{85628}to a fancy BIakeIee mansion to-do...
{85629}{85684}- I wasn't gonna ask you.|- Forget it.
{85685}{85748}Besides, I never got a chance|to get you a prom dress.
{85749}{85830}- Not that you went.|- No.
{86085}{86141}Why do you come here so much?
{86142}{86205}I spent haIf my chiIdhood|in this buiIding.
{86205}{86260}I Ioved it here. I stiII do.
{86261}{86335}Then why do peopIe|say you burned it down?
{86373}{86456}- You heard that?|- Is it true?
{86513}{86576}Yes.
{86577}{86654}I was the Iast one in here that night.
{86656}{86733}I'd come in here to pIay the piano.
{86735}{86803}The next thing I remember is waking up|across the street
{86804}{86881}after the firemen had carried me out.
{86883}{86959}- How did it start?|- I...
{86960}{87074}Just stupid. There were some candIes|burning, I had faIIen asIeep, and...
{87076}{87145}- Dad.|- I might have been a IittIe confused.
{87146}{87213}I was taking medicine|that my doctor had given me...
{87215}{87310}- Medicine? What doctor?|- Ronnie, it's OK.
{87312}{87393}It's OK now. I'm fine.
{87417}{87470}This was Iast year. I'm fine.
{87472}{87520}- You're OK?|- Yes.
{87610}{87636}OK.
{88033}{88082}He thinks that he did it.
{88162}{88244}My dad thinks that he's the one|that burned down the church.
{88344}{88392}I'm sure he didn't do it.
{88427}{88529}It's just... just peopIe taIking.
{88813}{88860}Can we taIk?
{89061}{89105}What's up?
{89168}{89248}- What's up, WiII?|- You got to come cIean about the fire.
{89265}{89297}You didn't just say that.
{89297}{89416}Her father thinks he did it. PeopIe in|town think he did it. You know that.
{89473}{89520}How Iong you known this girI?
{89552}{89608}You've known me your entire Iife.
{89609}{89676}And you know that, if you say anything
{89677}{89753}to anybody about that night,|my Iife is over.
{89850}{89916}They'II say it was arson, WiII,|and you know that.
{89956}{90009}I'm going back to work.
{90108}{90154}Just Iet it go, aII right?
{90223}{90285}I just want my money, OK?

{90769}{90805}- Don't go!|- I want my money.
{90807}{90892}- Don't go. Stop!|- Get off the car!
{90893}{90938}- Off the car!|- Don't Ieave me!
{90940}{91017}- I have nowhere eIse to Iive!|- Shut up!
{91059}{91108}Don't go!
{91180}{91244}Great! Great! Do you see what you did?

{91393}{91462}- You don't deserve that, BIaze.|- You don't know me, OK?
{91464}{91551}You don't know anything.|You just don't get it.
{92372}{92404}Dad says Iunch is ready.
{92405}{92456}I can't eat. I got to find something|to wear to the wedding.
{92457}{92521}What happened|to the money Dad gave you?
{92564}{92630}If you teII him, I kiII you, OK?
{92632}{92723}I was on my way to buy the dress and...|I gave the money away.
{92724}{92748}What?!
{92807}{92846}Don't worry about it.
{92848}{92948}Wow, you may be oIder,|but I am so much smarter than you.
{93191}{93272}- Where did you get aII that?|- Where to begin...
{93273}{93361}This is for when I toId Dad|I didn't see you at the festivaI.
{93361}{93436}This is what I won pIaying Iiar's poker.
{93437}{93524}Remember when you snuck|in past curfew in New York?
{93525}{93593}That's for that.|This is for the guy with the tattoo...
{93595}{93646}OK, that's enough. I get it.
{93748}{93789}I can't take your Iife savings.
{93791}{93877}Knowing you, there's a Iot more|where that came from.

{94071}{94111}Thank you.
{94457}{94508}- I don't think he'II Iike it.|- I Iike it.

{102521}{102581}- AII right, Iet's go.|- We don't want to miss it!
{102581}{102616}- Get out here!|- We're coming!
{102617}{102689}- Jeez, you guys are a mess!|- Thanks.
{102691}{102749}- What did he say?|- Come on!
{102865}{102917}- Oh, my God.|- Look at them.
{102917}{103000}- BeautifuI.|- So cooI.
{103001}{103064}- They're amazing.|- They're awesome!
{103444}{103513}- Why are you doing that?|- To heIp them get to the sea.
{103824}{103878}- I'm gonna get another Iight.|- OK.
{103880}{103938}- I want one.|- I can't beIieve that we saved them.
{104419}{104465}Daddy!
{104629}{104713}CaII 91 1 . Daddy!
{105632}{105690}I'm gonna need a rush on this.
{105739}{105781}Hey.
{105781}{105872}You shouId go home and change.|You'II scare the nurses.
{105931}{106009}What you said before... are you sure?
{106337}{106405}We'II make him as comfortabIe as we can,
{106407}{106470}but the cancer has spread to his Iungs.
{106532}{106629}- How Iong?|- It's hard to know.
{106631}{106708}But we're not gonna quit, OK?
{106839}{106894}I want to teII you something.
{106967}{107049}When your father reaIized|how serious his condition was
{107051}{107094}a coupIe months ago,
{107096}{107205}he asked that we cut back|on his medication.
{107207}{107256}Why?
{107257}{107317}Because he wanted to be here.
{107319}{107412}ReaIIy be here|with you and your brother.
{107413}{107460}That's what he said.
{108053}{108100}WeII, this wasn't on the caIendar.
{108567}{108613}- Ronnie...|- You Iied to me, Dad.
{108613}{108665}- I didn't Iie.|- Yes, you did, Dad.
{108667}{108749}You said you were fine.|You're not fine! That was a Iie!
{108751}{108806}I hoped.
{108808}{108870}I didn't Iie.|It's not the same thing.
{109007}{109056}- It's aII right to be angry.|- Good.
{109084}{109153}Is this why you|brought me here this summer?
{109207}{109280}Is it? So you wouIdn't|have to be aIone whiIe...
{109381}{109420}Why didn't you teII us?
{109465}{109533}It's not what|I wanted this time to be about.
{109535}{109626}- WeII, it is now, Daddy!|- No, it's not.
{109628}{109673}It's just another...
{109708}{109785}...part of a terrific summer.
{109833}{109892}Not one of the better parts, I admit.
{109995}{110092}- Love you.|- Sweetie, I Iove you too.
{110131}{110185}Come here.
{110221}{110275}I Iove you, Daddy.
{110604}{110666}You want some cookies, bro?
{110668}{110746}Why won't anyone|teII me what's going on?
{110810}{110912}Jonah, I think Ronnie and your dad|wiII taIk to you as soon as they can.
{110963}{111020}Why don't you teII me now?
{111069}{111134}WeII, it's compIicated.
{111241}{111276}Can I come and see him yet?
{111277}{111333}Yeah. He's waiting for you.
{111353}{111385}Come on.
{111905}{111976}He's never gonna|get to see him grow up.
{112604}{112642}Jonah!
{112659}{112706}- Dang it!|- What are you doing?
{112708}{112764}- I can't reach it!|- Get down from there!
{112765}{112809}- Get away!|- What happened to you?
{112811}{112853}- Just get away!|- Get down!
{112855}{112896}- Hey, hey!|- Get away!
{112897}{112968}- Hey, what's going on?|- Stay away! I can do it!
{112970}{113032}Me and Dad have been working|on this aII summer!

{113517}{113588}- We'II heIp you.|- You don't know how!
{113589}{113628}WiII you show us?
{113849}{113884}Yeah.
{114569}{114634}- That's good, right?|- Yeah.
{116544}{116601}What?
{116601}{116693}Ronnie, I need you to take me home.
{116789}{116835}OK.
{116865}{116926}We just have to stop here for a second.
{117362}{117400}We finished it.
{117401}{117501}Of course, I had to train an assistant,|but we did it.
{117531}{117601}You did good, Joe-boy. ReaIIy.
{118261}{118288}PIease.
{118404}{118454}OK.
{118617}{118668}We were behind the church, sir.
{118669}{118785}We were just goofing around|and drinking... and stuff.
{118786}{118864}And then Marcus|and his guys showed up.
{118879}{118972}And that's when WiII Ieft.
{118973}{119077}And... then we started...
{119077}{119133}We started pIaying around with...
{119135}{119200}- Fire?|- Yeah.
{119357}{119420}We shouId have toId you sooner, sir.
{119422}{119465}That's my fauIt.
{119495}{119588}WiII wanted to teII the poIice|right away, and I begged him not to.
{119589}{119647}But we're gonna go|right after we're done here.
{119648}{119697}No, don't do that.
{119732}{119769}PeopIe think it was you, sir.
{119771}{119859}Yeah... they do.
{119860}{119896}They wiII. So what?
{119913}{119964}It's... It's fine. ReaIIy.
{119965}{120048}I don't want you to do that, OK?|This stays between us.
{120049}{120098}Thank you, sir.
{120100}{120161}- OK?|- Thank you.
{120317}{120349}Wait.
{120413}{120463}Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
{120500}{120533}- Ronnie!|- You were there?
{120534}{120593}- I wanted to teII you.|- You saw what it did to him.
{120595}{120648}I know! I tried to get Scott to fess up.
{120649}{120688}Why didn't you say something?
{120689}{120757}It's not that simpIe.|It wasn't about me! Scott's a good guy.
{120759}{120838}I don't care, WiII!|You knew how guiIty my dad feIt,
{120840}{120904}and you Iet him feeI that way!
{120905}{120999}Just go off to that coIIege that your|parents have picked out for you.
{121000}{121081}Go find some other girI that makes|you feeI aIive for five minutes!
{121081}{121129}- One that can stand to be near you.|- Stop.
{121131}{121199}Don't touch me. WiII!
{121200}{121258}Don't touch me!
{121309}{121361}You're a coward, WiII.
{121363}{121412}You're a coward, and you're a Iiar.
{121453}{121497}And I don't trust you.
{121527}{121561}I don't want you near me.
{121563}{121628}And I don't want you near my dad.
{121653}{121690}Go.
{121731}{121774}Go.
{122655}{122728}- I Iove you.|- I Iove you too.
{122794}{122843}I Iove you too.
{122981}{123029}Are you packed?
{123031}{123084}I'm not going with you, Mom.
{123112}{123161}I'm gonna stay here with Dad.
{123179}{123220}He's gonna get worse.
{123221}{123292}A Iot worse.|And in a few weeks, he...
{123293}{123329}- I don't care.|- Honey.
{123331}{123407}Your dad doesn't want you guys|to see him Iike this.
{123459}{123550}AII I did aII summer was fight with him.
{123597}{123697}- I was so mean to him.|- No, no, baby.
{123699}{123748}I promise you,
{123750}{123829}it meant the worId|to him to have you here.
{123847}{123917}Look, Mom. I'm gonna stay.
{124508}{124560}Hey, buddy. You OK?
{124604}{124685}Are you gonna say goodbye?|I reaIIy don't want to hear it.
{124686}{124741}Good, 'cause I'm not gonna say it.
{124777}{124878}I'm not gonna say goodbye,|because I'm not going anywhere.
{124880}{124932}OK?
{124934}{124972}Come here.
{125185}{125264}Every time a Iight shines|through that window we buiIt...
{125306}{125360}...or any window at aII...
{125401}{125452}...that's me, OK?
{125483}{125534}I'm not going away.
{127298}{127408}Dear Ronnie, I miss the hours|we spent together at the piano.
{127409}{127449}I miss being your teacher.
{127451}{127520}I know you see me as having le{y:i}ft you,
{127521}{127595}but when your mother and I split up,|I was in a lot of pain.
{127596}{127661}I just needed to come home.
{127663}{127761}I regret moving away from you|and Jonah more than an{y:i}ything.
{127763}{127797}I hope you'll forgive me.
{127799}{127884}Your mom tells me you|completely failed your SATs,
{127886}{127985}but I know how smart you have to be|to get every single question wrong.
{127987}{128037}Congratulations, Ronnie.
{128039}{128129}I've told you before that none of what|happened be{y:i}tween your mother and me
{128130}{128192}had an{y:i}ything to do with you or Jonah.
{128193}{128242}Love is fragile, Ronnie.
{128244}{128298}And we're not always|its best caretakers.
{128300}{128365}We just muddle through|and do the best we can
{128367}{128440}and hope this fragile thing survives,
{128441}{128501}against all odds.
{128952}{129028}He's probabIy started coIIege by now.
{129029}{129084}Do you miss him?
{129129}{129180}What he did was wrong, Dad.
{129232}{129297}Yeah.
{129299}{129343}It was.
{129400}{129453}I can teII you this:
{129505}{129604}- He misses you.|- I doubt it.
{129686}{129752}You don't even know who you are, Ronnie.
{129797}{129850}Who am I?
{129903}{129981}You are the kindest, sweetest...
{130028}{130088}...most beautifuI daughter|in the whoIe worId.
{130089}{130184}Thank you, but you're|kind of obIigated to say that, Dad.
{130185}{130218}Yeah, it is in the handbook.
{130315}{130381}I don't have too many Iectures|Ieft on my timecard,
{130383}{130444}so I reaIIy want you to hear this, OK?
{130496}{130609}Someday, you are|gonna open your heart,
{130611}{130671}and you're gonna pIay again.
{130750}{130816}And it's not gonna be|to make your mother happy.
{130866}{130929}And it's not gonna be to make me happy.
{130974}{131012}It'II be for you.
{131047}{131132}Because... music and...
{131164}{131202}...love...
{131277}{131318}...they're gonna bring you joy.
{131354}{131400}Thank you.
{131948}{132006}How's that song coming, Iazy bones?
{132070}{132129}WeII, I'm not sure...
{132150}{132182}...I can finish it.
{132279}{132333}My hands.
{132333}{132377}Do they hurt, Dad?
{132425}{132488}Yeah.
{132490}{132533}They do.
{136627}{136679}You OK?
{136680}{136749}I can't do it, Mom.
{136750}{136849}Look, you have a right to shut down.
{136851}{136936}Just, pIease, don't push me away.
{136937}{137000}It's what I do, Mom.
{137001}{137049}I push peopIe away.
{137121}{137184}I pushed WiII away too.
{137215}{137285}We're not perfect. Any of us.
{137287}{137353}We make mistakes, we screw up,
{137355}{137425}but then we forgive and we move forward.
{137427}{137546}Honey, at Ieast|you have the courage to feeI.
{137548}{137611}You feeI everything so deepIy.
{137645}{137708}You're your father's daughter.
{138132}{138179}OK.
{138463}{138529}Thank you aII for coming.
{138531}{138601}A Iot of you have known my dad|since he was a kid.
{138701}{138745}I wrote a speech.
{138746}{138801}A few, actuaIIy.
{138880}{138952}Me and my dad,|we had a different Ianguage.
{138953}{139016}A Iove that we aIways shared.
{139139}{139193}And I know that...
{139217}{139314}That's the one that he'd want me|to share with aII of you guys today.
{140360}{140409}Hi, Daddy.
{142235}{142325}Ronnie, I'm reaIIy sorry for your Ioss.
{142393}{142430}Hey.
{142484}{142524}Look, thank you for everything.
{142525}{142600}- Thank you for coming.|- Of course.
{142601}{142655}I reaIIy appreciate|everything you did, though.
{142673}{142714}Thank you.
{142896}{142933}Hey.
{142973}{143016}It was beautifuI, what you pIayed.
{143029}{143083}It was Dad's.
{143084}{143169}- I finished it for him.|- I know he Iiked it.
{143208}{143280}Thank you for coming, WiII.|It meant so much to me.
{143329}{143401}Ronnie, I have someone|I'd Iike for you to meet.
{143465}{143514}I want to introduce you|to Tommy Hampton.
{143516}{143585}He taught your father...
{145281}{145340}Ronnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
{145341}{145388}I'm sorry, too.
{145436}{145488}PeopIe make mistakes, WiII.
{145489}{145548}Even the peopIe that we Iove.
{145738}{145781}I've decided to go to JuiIIiard.
{145782}{145837}Yeah, I heard. That's great news.
{145839}{145902}How's VanderbiIt?
{145938}{145973}It's a reaIIy good schooI.
{146003}{146097}Yeah. I'm not sure it's for me, though.
{146152}{146229}- What do you mean?|- I'm thinking of maybe transferring
{146231}{146276}to CoIumbia next semester.
{146293}{146376}So the girI I Iove can|watch me make a few more mistakes.
{146407}{146464}What do you think about that?

With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
But not for me.
My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads, we're cavemen.
Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
Night after night, day after day.
Yep, home sweet home.
When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world.
And I struggled to survive my family.
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.
The Erfs, mosquito bite.
Throgs, common cold.
And the Croods, that's us.
The Croods made it, because of my dad.
He was strong, and he followed the rules.
The ones painted on the cave walls.
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.
Welcome to my world.
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
Because what we didn't know was that our world... was about to come to an end.
And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
You are supposed to wait for my signal. Eep?
Boo.
Ow! No!
We've been in that cave forever.
Three days is not forever.
It is with this family.
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.
No, Sandy, come back here.
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
No, I mean, you're already out now.
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.
But if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
The signal isn't so you know it's me.
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.
Mom, we're ready to leave.
Mom?
Still alive.
It's still early.
And you're still fat.
Breakfast formation!
I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast.
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.
And never not be afraid!
Yay, breakfast.
Who's up?
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.
Heads!
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.
Okay. Thunk...
Go.
Come on, Thunk.
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.
Release the baby!
Get them, Sandy! Go!
Get them, Mom!
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!
Thanks.
Eep!
Heads up!
Hey Dad, can we eat now?
Just wait till we get home.
Eep, put on the brakes.
Eep!
- Who is hungry?
- All right! Good one, Dad.
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.
That's all right. I ate last week.
Two knuckle warning!
Come on, Croods. Go, go.
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.
The moon is full. Bath night.
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.
I don't want to lose my protective layer.
Mom, you've got ants.
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
Is she still out there?
You know she hates the cave, Grug.
Please come back tomorrow.
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.
It is a little dark, Grug.
It's not that dark.
Eep!
Eep?
Come on, I have to close the cave.
Eep!
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Eep! Come down!
- That was too close.
- I was watching. I was fine.
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.
Why don't you know?
Stop looking for things.
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.
What is the point of all this?
What was that?
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?
No one said survival was fun.
Nothing is fun.
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.
- Eap.
- Grug.
- Yes.
- Off!
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...
- Off.
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge, that's all.
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things... and she needs her own space.
What things?
How long is this going to take?
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!
See? She's listening.
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
How about a story?
Eep loves those.
That's a good ide...
How about a story, huh?
Yeah, tell us a story.
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.
Eep, your old favorite.
I haven't played with that thing in years.
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.
She was alive because she listened to her father... and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror.
So she was happy.
But Krispy had one terrible problem.
She was filled with... curiosity.
- Grug.
- Yes. yes.
And one day, while she was in a tree... the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
And no sooner than she climbed to the top... she saw something new and died!
- Just like that?
- Yes!
Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
Same ending as every day.
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.
Good man, Thunk.
All right, everyone sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.
Air.
You talk.
I'm a person, like you.
Sort of like you.
Okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
Would you mind not...
That tickles.
Hey, hey, hey!
Quiet!
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Eep is gone.
What? Grug!
Stay in the cave.
Wow. You are really strong.
Hey! No! It's mine.
- Please! Wait.
- No!
- It's dying! I can fix it!
- No! I caught it!
Please! Please.
I hate the dark.
Come on, come on, come on.
It does what you tell it?
Yeah. Sort of.
The sun?
No, no, no. Fire.
Hi, fire.
It's not alive.
But you said it was dying.
Sorry.
It comes from where you come from?
No. No, I make it.
- Make some for me.
- Okay.
Make!
It doesn't come out of me.
Make! Make it!
You do this a lot.
Are you dead?
Can I have your fire if you're dead?
Clear!
Hey, those are cold!
You think? Listening shells, activate.
I concur.
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.
I don't even know you.
I'm Guy.
Guy?
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.
Also, keeps my pants up.
What are "pants up"?
Who are you?
Eep.
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.
What?
I'm calling it "The End."
How do you know?
I have seen it. It's coming this way.
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.
Fire. Lava.
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...
Believe me, everything we are standing on will be gone.
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.
It's our only chance.
Come with me.
I can't.
Okay.
Here.
If you survive, call me.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hey!
Dad!
Are you hurt? What took you?
Nothing. I left on my own.
You what?
Dad, let me explain.
You never let me talk.
You're grounded.
Hey!
Eep!
Mom.
Grug! What happened?
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.
Eep?
You will never believe it.
I found something new.
New!
New is a big problem!
Wait, wait!
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
- It wasn't bad.
-"New" is always bad.
No. He was nice.
What? Excuse me? He?
I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
Strange.
Usually it's the reverse.
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...
There was a boy.
Watch. I'm going to call him.
What is wrong with you?
It was dangerous.
It was beautiful!
You want to see dangerous? Here!
My sniffer!
Okay, that's it!
We're going back to the cave... and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
What!
You can't keep me inside forever!
He said this would happen.
Get to the cave!
Go!
Look out!
Stop!
Is everyone okay?
Yes.
Grug, the cave... it's gone.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there!
No. No one is going anywhere.
What else did that boy say?
Grug?
Just go! Just go!
Go!
One, two, three, four, five...
Six.
Where are we?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Down.
In a lower place.
But one thing is for sure, we can't go back the way we came.
Sandy? What is it?
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!
We can't be out in the open like this.
We need a cave.
Now, step where I step.
Okay. Stay quiet.
Hopefully, nothing big knows we're here yet.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait!
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Wait.
So, Dad... just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?
If it was me...
I'm just throwing this out there... if it was me choosing the cave...
I would go with a smaller cave.
Wait.
Dad?
I'll take care of this.
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!
Now you got them right...
Man, they're really...
I'm loving this.
Dad, I got it.
Just stop running into their fists.
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.
That's right. You can't get past this!
Climb! Climb! Climb!
Cave!
Go! Go!
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!
Okay.
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.
And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
It's scared of the dark.
Wait, we're scared of the dark.
Kill circle!
Eep!
Eep!
- Cavies!
-"Cavies"?
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.
The huge primitive teeth?
Yeah.
The excessive body hair.
That one has got a tail.
Yeah.
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.
No! It won't help.
They're my family.
What?
The sun is in his hands!
No, no. It's "fire."
Where did it come from?
He made it.
Make some for me!
It doesn't come out of him.
Make. Make it!
You're a lot like your daughter.
Great, now he's broken.
It's a baby sun.
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.
Now, we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave... and pretend today never happened.
Isn't this fun, Eep?
Eep, don't touch him.
Goodness knows where he's been.
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.
What a cute little guy.
Hey. Stay back.
No, no, no, wait!
It likes me.
Hey! It's biting me!
Thunk! Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.
They're biting me!
More fire babies.
Hi.
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.
Yeah. But I won't let him.
Hold on, son. Come back!
No, stop! Let me go!
Get out! Out! Out!
Eat up, babies!
No, stop touching me!
Die!
I win!
They're not so scary once you get to know them.
Who are you people?
I'm sorry.
We're the Croods!
And you are?
Guy.
Hi, Guy.
Wow!
It looks like magic.
And smells like food.
No, don't eat it, it's new.
Still alive!
Come on, keep eating.
Hey, where is Guy?
No!
Going somewhere?
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.
No. That was just the beginning of the end.
The end of the end is still coming.
Eep. Drop it.
We can't let him go!
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?
What if it takes a few days?
What if the birds come back?
We need his fire, dummy!
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!
Stay here if you want, but let me go.
I've got a dream... a mission, a reason to live!
Not anymore.
I've got an idea.
Let's go to that mountain.
It's too far.
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
There are caves on that mountain.
Have you been there?
It's a mountain.
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.
And water. And sticks.
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.
Crazy sticks. Let's go.
Quiet!
That thing is weird.
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.
That's just Belt.
I've made a decision.
We're going to that mountain.
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.
Just feels right.
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.
I don't think my feet can do that.
I'll never live long enough to get there.
Let's do it.
Come on, just think.
Our whole family packed together on a long, slow, trip across country?
Days and nights with just each other.
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.
We'll become closer as a family.
Get her off!
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye.
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail?
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!
Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?
Because I will turn this family around so fast!
Dad, I gotta go!
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.
- I'm touching...
- Gran.
Dad, I still gotta go!
Fine. Just go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
No.
- How about now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
Now?
I can do this all day long.
No, no, no and still no.
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
Grug, we're all pretty tired!
We'll eat when we get there.
It's taking too long!
I'm grabbing a snack.
Don't do that. He will cut you.
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.
What's a pet?
An animal you don't eat.
We call those "children."
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.
- It's food!
- No, please!
Not that. That!
Food fixes everything.
Show me your hunting face.
Not you. You're still grounded.
Come on, Thunk.
My feet hurt.
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.
I wasn't ready.
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!
Why are you doing this?
What are they doing?
Hunting.
Get it off! You stay away from me.
No, seriously, what are they doing?
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.
Now you're just rubbing it in.
There, who's hungry for scorpion?
What happened to the egg and the bird?
We lost him.
But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground... the scorpion grabbed a hold of me... and one thing led to another and here we are eating him.
So, win-win.
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.
I need more.
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?
You're too skinny.
If she was going to eat anyone it would be...
Mom!
She's locked her jaw!
Get a stick! Get a stick!
Stay away!
You sick old monster!
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!
Hold her still. Use a rock.
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?
Why are you rolling away?
I just want something to eat.
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
Please.
I'll let you help me hunt.
Really?
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.
Tell my story.
Okay.
What do you call this?
A trap.
What does it do?
Well...
How long have you been alone?
So, what do we do?
How's your acting?
You're good at this.
No. Sorry.
Okay.
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.
Your other hand...
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.
Going under.
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.
Yeah, I noticed!
Where's Eep?
She's awesome.
Eep!
Dad,no!
It's an avalanche of flavor.
Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.
What are "left overs"?
When you have so much food to eat, you have some left over.
We never have that much food.
Grug, how about a story?
That's a good idea. How about a story?
Yeah, tell us a story!
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger... who lived in a cave with her family.
There were a lot of rules... but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night.
And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
So easy to remember!
I know.
But, while everyone was asleep... she went out anyway.
- No!
- Yes!
And no sooner than she did, their cave was destroyed... and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk... with some weirdo they met... and die!
The end.
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.
My stories never end like that.
Yes! Two stories in one night!
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.
Her father and mother told her,
"You may go anywhere you want..."
"but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
And die. Good story.
But when no one was looking... she'd go near the cliff... for the closer she came to the edge... the more she could hear, the more she could see... the more she could feel.
Finally... she stood at the very edge.
She saw a light.
She leaned out to touch it... and she slipped.
And she fell.
And she flew.
Where did she fly?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
It would be so bright.
A place not like today, or yesterday.
A place where things are better.
Tomorrow isn't a place.
You can't see it!
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.
That's where I'm going.
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.
And when we wake up... we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
Tomorrow?
A cave.
That was too close. it almost caught us.
I was watching. We were fine.
We gotta move faster.
Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander"?
I'll take a shamble at this point.
Hey, do you have a minute?
How did the tiger fly?
I only share when I'm outside the log.
I'm funny that way.
Leave this to me.
Hey, Thunk... you have a spider on your face.
Oops.
He's loose!
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.
Do you mean these rocks?
Do not step on these rocks!
Step aside, girls.
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.
You cannot walk on those!
Get back here now!
There goes our chance for survival.
And our log!
Okay.
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly... but it doesn't get better.
How about...
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.
Come on.
I can help you... but we're going to have to make a few changes around here.
The log ride is over.
Drop the log.
Now, kick it away.
Farther.
Really?
Okay, smart "Guy"... now what?
Good fish, good fish.
Okay. Now you can look.
I love them!
Where are my feet?
They're still there!
Okay.
You're really heavy.
Really?
Thank you!
Hey. Wait!
Okay.
She's up. We're good. I'm good.
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?
I'm calling it a "brain."
I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
Dad, I don't have a brain.
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.
Now, let's get to that mountain!
Wow! I love those!
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
So, how did the tiger fly?
She jumped on the sun... and rode it to Tomorrow.
No,no,no.
Hi, Dad!
Bye. Dad!
You've seen rain before, right?
We don't get out much.
Eep, looks dangerous.
Dad, you say that about everything.
Careful.
Really? Okay.
No, no, no. Not cool!
So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been dumping my bones here since last week."
Last week!
That's a funny story!
It's not a story. It's a joke.
What's a "joke"?
Just making something up to make you laugh.
- One for you.
- Thanks.
One for you. And this one's for you.
Okay.
Okay! That's enough!
I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
Wait, you're saying we should split up?
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.
They can handle it.
We can do it, Dad.
No,no,no.
It's my job to keep you safe.
I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.
Except for you two.
And that's final.
Hello?
Is everyone all right?
We're okay, Grug.
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?
Stay where you are. I'll find you.
No. Too slow.
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
Dad?
Yeah.
Okay.
Remember, never not be afraid.
You can do this!
It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay.
I'm going to pass out.
Sandy. Sandy!
Give me another one.
You dropped these.
Come with me.
Here, boy! Catch!
Yoo-hoo!
Gran?
Mom?
Wow.
Grug?
I'll go get him.
Good boy! Who's a good boy?
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!
You need a name. You want a name?
I'm going to call you Douglas.
Can you do tricks? Roll over.
Come on, Douglas, roll over.
Good boy, Douglas!
I was in love once.
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.
It was quite a scandal.
We fed each other berries, we danced.
Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your grandfather.
Croods!
Get down here.
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.
Guy is with them. Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.
Okay. I'm going to go up... and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!
Sleep pile?
How about a story?
Anyone?
And then Torg said,
"Know it? I drew it."
That makes no sense.
I know it was hard for you to bring us along... but they had the best day of their lives.
Thank you for that.
I want to show you something.
More suns in the sky than you can count.
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.
Tomorrow.
That's where we'll be safe.
I'm going with Guy.
No. Not my little girl.
Come with us.
I can't go without Grug.
That makes one of us. Count me in.
Really, Mom? Now?
Grug has no idea how to protect us.
In fact, he has no ideas at all!
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...
Face it.
If he actually had an idea of his own...
I'd have a heart attack and die!
Grug?
- Dad!
- Dad!
He's a big guy. How could he just disappear like that?
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen Dad.
Haven't seen him.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
I was up all night, because all these ideas just kept coming to me.
Is that a snake?
Belt, new and improved.
It's even self-tightening!
What is that on your head?
It's called desperation.
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."
And this one, I call it a "ride."
Rhymes with "Grug."
That doesn't rhyme...
It's going to get us places faster than shoes.
Yeah! Try to keep up!
I wish I had a ride.
And painting is a thing of the past.
I call this a "snapshot."
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
I call them "shades."
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.
Where do you get these great ideas?
Since I don't have a brain... they're coming from my stomach, down deep below... and then up again into my mind.
Grug, we have to keep moving.
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."
Isn't that something?
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."
Mom?
I know. It's bad.
I almost feel sorry for him.
No, I don't.
What are you trying to do, Grug?
See, I thought if I could have ideas... like Guy... maybe Eep would listen to me.
And maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.
Grug.
Is that what this is all about?
And I also thought it would kill your mother.
So win-win.
We're here!
Wow.
Cave!
Everyone inside.
Hurry up. Let's go.
Let's go. Go!
No!
No more caves, Grug.
What?
We're going to jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!
Wait. So you're all going to do this?
Thunk?
Sorry, Dad.
You have to stop worrying for all of us.
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!
The rules don't work out here!
They kept us alive!
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.
There's a difference.
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
We would be dead if we listened to you!
We have to follow Guy now.
Guy.
Guy? Run.
This is pointless!
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.
You're being irrational and counterproductive!
Big words anger me!
Keep talking.
Countermeasures!
You remember how you were this morning? You changed.
Idea man. Modern man.
I am a caveman!
No, no, no, wait!
No!
What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
Tar.
No. I have to get back to them.
Stop struggling.
No!
Grug, stop!
No one gets out of this.
Believe me...
I know.
Your...
Family. Yeah.
Sorry.
I was little when it happened.
Last thing my parents told me was...
"Don't hide."
"Live."
"Follow the sun."
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."
You followed the light.
My daughter is a lot like you.
No.
She's like you.
She loves you, but always forgets to say it.
Just like you forget to tell her.
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.
It's okay. That's what dads do.
That's right.
But we can't do that from here.
We need one of your ideas.
Come on. You can do it.
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!
I've got it.
Wow.
Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has.
Let's go.
There he is.
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.
Move me.
Okay, he sees us.
That's our cue. Now, work it!
He's not coming over.
I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.
Scared? I'll show you scared.
Hand me those acting sticks!
Hold on!
Yes! You did it.
- Grug!
- Dad!
Hey! We're okay!
Yeah.
We're okay.
Grug, your call.
Take us to Tomorrow.
Hurry!
Come on! We're going to make it!
You were right.
There it is! The sun!
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!
Run!
I don't understand.
The sun was right here.
It was right here.
We have to go back to the cave.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.
Everybody, hold my hand.
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.
Grug. What's wrong with you?
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!
Grug, listen to me.
We've got to get back to that cave.
No more dark.
No more hiding.
No more caves.
What's the point of all this?
To follow the light.
I can't change.
I don't have ideas.
But I have my strength.
And right now... that's all you need.
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!
It's too risky!
It's a chance.
I'll take that chance.
I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
That's a joke, right?
What's a "joke"?
He made it!
He made it.
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
You're not coming, are you?
When you make it, so will I.
No!
You did good.
Dadda!
Gran...
No mush. Just throw me.
Wait.
You surprised me today... lunkhead.
Still alive!
Time to go.
No.
I have too much to say to you.
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.
I can fix it.
This works good.
What do you call it?
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."
Because it rhymes with "Grug."
But you can change it if you want.
No. I like "hug."
I love you.
I...
Dad...
I'm scared.
Never be afraid.
There!
I see him!
Hey!
Hey, I did it!
Back! Stay back!
Stay back!
They're in trouble.
Hang on, I'm coming!
How do I get across?
I have to think. What would Guy do?
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?
What would I do?
Hold this.
I have... an idea!
Run!
Yes!
Douglas?
Hey, I know that guy.
Hold on!
It's not safe here.
I'll tell her.
I never got to tell him.
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...
Get out of the way!
Wow. You sound just like him.
Get out of the way!
Dadda!
He did it!
He's riding the sun.
But, not very well.
Everybody out of the way!
- Dad!
- Grug!
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?
I love you, too!
One, two, three, four... five... six... and seven.
And a half.
And eight.
Nine.
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!
A boy has to have a pet.
Turns out I'm a cat person.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there.
Yes! Coming through!
Wait!
This is me. My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in by the suntans and pets...
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...
but now we know the Croods will make it.
Because we changed the rules...
the ones that kept us in the dark.
And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change.
Release the baby!
Sort of.
So, from now on, we'll stay out here...
where we can follow the light.
Brothers and sisters, penguins all.
Everything in this world...
no matter how big...
no matter how small...
is connected in ways we never expected.
Yes, indeed.
Penguins of the world unite
Strength in numbers, we can get it right.
One time.
We are a part of the rhythm nation.
With music by our side To break what now divides.
Let's work together To improve our way of life.
This is the test No struggle, no progress.
Lend a fin to help your brother do his best Sing it up now.
Let's dance, let's shout.

Come on, Erik, give it a shot.
Do your thing
Hey.
Aw, my little munkin.
I'll go talk to him.
Oh, let me try.
Hey, little guy.
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.
- You're not joining the party?
- Mm-mm.
Can you say why?
Why?
No. What I mean is, why are you...?
Uncle Mumble.
I think he's asking,
"Why dance?“."
Like, he needs a solid reason.
Don't you, Erik?
Yeah.
Plenty of reasons to dance.
What's mine, Pa?
Well, the only way to find out is to try it.
Come on, son.
It's just one big old foot after the other.
No one'll laugh at you, I promise.
Come on. On my feet.
I don't care what the people say.
Yeah.
You'll get the hang of it.
All you gotta do... is feel the beat.
I'm gonna let it all out, do my thing.
We are a part of the rhythm nation.
Come on, son.
Let's shake this world!
Show me what you're workin' with.
Do your thing.
Let's dance, let's shout.
We're bringing ﬂuffy back.
Do your thing.
Make my body sing.
That's it. Get stupid.
We are a part of the rhythm...
It's not funny!
Can you whiz on cue and finish with a headstand?
I don't think so.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Oh, gosh. That was... Wow.
Oh. Uh...
Erik. Erik.
Erik, I'm really sorry.
Come on, champ.
It wasn't that bad.
When I was your age...
I got laughed at a lot.
They thought I was weird too.
Mumble!
I mean, different, in a cool way.
Like, you're cool.
I was uncool.
- Easy, easy. Whoa.
- Really uncool.
Okay. You know, Erik... when your daddy's in a deep hole... he's gotta learn to stop digging.
Yeah.
Mumble!
A little help here.
We'd never have an egg with you.
- No way.
- No way.
Give me one good reason.
- Too short.
- And you're gross.
- Is that guy bothering you?
No, he's nobody.
I wanna know what love is.
- Hey, Mumble.
- Amigo.
Hey. Hey!
I want you to show me
- Ramon, get out of there.
- That's Erik's hole.
- Ramon!
- What?
We're having a private conversation with Erik.
So you, too, are mocked and misunderstood?
Amigo, please.
Don't worry, I can fix it.
No, no, no.
Let me tell something to you.
What's a best friend for if he cannot bring a daddy and his boy together?
Hello? Where are you?
Hello? Hello? Hello?
There you are.
You know, ﬂuffito, the truth is... for wild maverick outcasts like us who cannot be tamed... this place sucks!
Ramon, you're being ridiculous.
Not any more.
I am going home to Adelie Land.
Adelie
Land, Adelie Land.
Be who you want to be
A haven for heroes.
Erik?
Knock knock? Hello?
Honey, I think he needs to be alone right now.
We can't leave him by himself in a hole.
We've got his back, sir.
Yeah. True that.
There you go.
- Let the hoppers work it out.
- Quite right.
Okay, come on.
All right. Step away.
Nothing to see here.
Shufflely off-ely.
So much for my daddy skills.
Adiós, Emperor Land!
This is one fabulous penguin you will never laugh at again.
Never!
Hey, Atticus. Snack time.
Erik?
Shh.
I think they're snuggled up.
All snoozy.
They're not here.
Bobo!
Oh! Boadicea!
Come on, Atticus.
Why you fooling around?
Where are you?
I know you hear me, Atticus.
Gloria? Do you think they could have, you know, run off?
Outside? By themselves?
Maybe they followed Ramon.
- Baby...
- I know, I know.
But I really ought to check it out.
I won't be long.
Mumble, relax.
We will find them and when we do, you'll find a way to put things right.
You're a good dad.
Yeah.
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?
Whoa, that was a big one.
I hate it when that happens.
Hey, Will? Is that you?
Of course it's me.
Can't you tell?
No. Not if we all look the same.
I don't.
Will, we are krill.
We are meant to look the same.
Not me, Bill. There's only one of me in all the world.
I am one in a krillion. Hm.
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.
I wanna be free, Bill!
There's no such thing as free, Will.
Come on, less thinking, more swarming.
I'm sick of swarming.
We've been swarming all our lives.
It's like you've got a mind of your own.
Tell me, Bill, what lies beyond the swarm?
- More swarm.
- And then?
- Some more swarm.
- And then?
Will, there's nothing but swarm.
We are a swarm without end.
Everything's got an end.
See? I end here.
That is not a happy ending.
It stands to reason, Bill... if I swim against the swarm, I must eventually reach the end of the world.
Yeah.
Okay.
On the count of three.
One, two, three!
No.
I can do this. I can do this.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can do this.
No, you can't.
Who's talking to me? You.
Who are you? Me. Who said that?
Now walk it out.
Now walk it out.
West side, walk it out.
South side, walk it out.
East side, walk it out.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
What's this? What's up?
We're coming to Adelie Land.
You aren't. You are without your parents, this is chicknapping.
Now go. Shoo, shoo!
- But we can't. We're fugitives.
- Huh?
- Fugi wha..?
- Fugitives.
- Fleeing Emperor Land.
- No.
- No happy feets.
- What?
No happy feets.
We're rebels seeking thrills and adventure.
And tasty snacks.
Oh, thank you.
This guy. All right.
I want a big fish, three little ones...
Oh, oh! Some of those tiny crustaceans.
The little ones that go:
Oh, yeah!
- Now go.
- But we can't swim. We're way too fluffy.
- What?
- Fluffy don't float.
But it's too high.
I'm a leap..ophobic.
Oh, dude! The water's right there.
Like, right there.
I don't care.
It's too cold for a hot blood like me.
Atticus, stop!
He's chewing on his flipper!
Okay, okay.
Here's what we are going to do.
We count to three. Push me on two.
But you don't tell me, okay?
One, two!
Aah!
What'd you do that for?
Baby penguins.
Cute, but ruthless.
Will! Will!
What are we even looking for?
That's the beauty of it, my friend.
I don't know.
Will, please, come back.
I fear the worst.
I fear the worst too, Bill... because fearing the best is a complete waste of time.
Oh, yeah. There!
Maybe it's a black hole.
They're just myths.
Scary talk, to keep us in the swarm.
Coming out of nowhere, swallowing everything in its path!
For something that doesn't exist, it's very impressive.
- Swim! Aah!
- Whoa!
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.
Uncle Ramon?
No. No, no, no. Kids... take me home.
So this... is all we are. Lunch.
To think we spent our whole lives not knowing the truth.
Goodbye, Krill World.
Erik.
Bo.
Atticus.
Ramon. Hmm.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
That's the mating call of the Adelie female.
I'm about to be thrown to the ground and crushed by a thousand chicas.
It's okay, ladies!
The love god, he's back!
Whoa!
Ignored by thousands.
I said, "The love god is back!"
Come on. I got so much love,
I'm going to explode!
Ramon! Amigos!
- I can't believe it!
- I'm back in the band. Yeah!
It's like you never left, but you did.
Ramon, triplets?
No, there's only three.
Kids, amigos. Amigos, kids.
Oh, look at how cute.
Where are the chicas?
The Ramon-starved chicas?
- You been away too long.
- There's a lot more competition now, bro.
Mm-hm.
Impossible.
Lovelace.
Guru.
We love you.
Wow.
- Same old Lovelace.
- Only completely different.
He looks like a rainbow.
Like a rainbow...
- with man-chichis.
- Ramon.
All right!
Brothers and sisters!
Penguins all!
No matter how big!
No matter how small!
We are here today... for one extraordinary penguin!
Yes, indeed!
It's Sven time!
Sven! Sven!
Sven! Sven! Sven!
A penguin who's not afraid of heights.
So what?
- Whoa!
- Golly gosh!
A penguin who can fly.
UP-uppity-up!
Okay, this Mr. Up is going down.
Share the mystery of your history.
Tell it, brother! Testify.
Oh, but friends... it's such a long story.
Then tell the short one!
Ramon.
It begins with the loss of...
Hey, Goldilocks.
That beak looks way too big on you!
- It begins...
- The end.
- Security!
- I can't believe this.
Get your filthy flippers off me!
Let him go.
He's fragile right now.
Yeah!
You tell them, amigos!
And they're still talking.
We're still here for you, brother.
Go ahead.
Okey-dokey. Ahem.
It begin with the loss of my...
No. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
The moment is gone. I've lost my mojo.
Maybe tomorrow.
No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling it.
Show's over.
- Please, sir.
- What?
Does your story have flying in it?
Avvw.
And where are you from, little squirt?
We're from the Emperor-hood.
And what your name is?
Erik.
Ear-rik.
Hm. In Svenland, we have many brave warriors called Ear-rik.
You do?
Oh, ja.
Ja.
Everybody!
Everybody!
Your attention, please.
I dedicate my much-applauded... heartswarming saga... to my brave friend Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik
"Ear-rik"?
Ear-rik
Erik.
So... it begin with the loss of my home!
He was the last of a noble penguin race.
Whose world collapsed at a rapid pace.
The power to ﬂy was my saving grace.
The mighty Sven
From his pretty lips.
With his stylish swoops
And his triple ﬂips.
I alone escaped the apocalypse.
The mighty Sven.
He journeyed far without a rest.
Ooh. Hello there.
Those fightin' titans
Were a heck of a test.
But even they couldn't take him down
'Cause none could match The guts and grit of Sven.
Sven.
Guts and grit.
Guts and grit.
He met the aliens who ruled the seas.
They took one look at him
And fell to their knees.
They restored him.
They adorned him.
And they adored him.
Then destiny showed its...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, it's okey-dokey.
Don't keep it inside.
Yeah, it's okey-dokey.
Sing it out.
Then destiny showed its kindest face.
When I was lost in the darkest place.
Before I drew my final breath.
He delivered me.
From the thick black death.
Bathed and fluffed All pleasures bestowed.
I didn't want to end it.
They covered me in a protective robe.
There I stood before him.
Resplendent.
Sven! Sven!
Sven!
Erik!
As I was learning the alien speak.
What smells so gosh darn good-y?
Sven had a higher truth to seek.
Who knows what he saw.
In that mystic light?
Svensei!
- I've seen our future.
- What?
- Ja, it's calling to me.
- Yeah?
It says "Sven.
Sven, go that way! Quickly!"
I'm with you!
The mighty Sven.
Oh, my sweet eyes.
He ﬂies.
The mighty Sven.
And so he came to this far, far shore.
To shine his gifts upon us all.
What...?
- What is it?
- It's incredible.
- Really? You've never seen this?
- No.
Green.
Brothers and sisters, behold the power... of Sven.
Let it out, let it out.
Let it out Let it out.
On that day, I took a vow.
I, Sven, promises to use my powers Only for good-y.
Good-y, good-y.
And I dedicate full-time... to the "createment" of a new Adelie Land! ls there no end to the power of Sven?
Sven! Sven!
Sven!
Marry me! Marry me!
No, marry me!
Marry me! Marry me!
No, no, marry me!
- No, marry me!
- Marry me!
Ah, my beauties.
But if I love the few, who will love the many?
But if they love you, who will love Ramon?
Ramon!
Somebody? Anybody?
Nobody?
Body?
Aw, bitter, twisted, lonely guy.
You must learn to think like Sven.
Why?
If you want it... you must will it!
If you will it... it will be yours!
SvenTHINK.
All rights reserved, copyright me.
You know, up close, you're still an idiot.
Try it. SvenTHINK.
Sven
THINK, Sven THINK.
- Sven THINK, Sven THINK.
- All right!
Excuse me.
Coming through.
I'll prove it doesn't work.
- Okey-dokey. Now, loosen up.
Mm-hm.
- Empty your mind.
- Done.
And picture your goal.
Okay.
See her eyes. Blue.
No, brown. Deep brown.
- Short.
- Tall.
- Slender.
- Bouncy.
- Whatever. Just will it.
- Okay.
Will it harder.
Come on, will it harder!
Now with extra added bonus will!
Ow! My foot!
Will it, will it, will it!
- Open your eyes.
- Ramon!
- Close your eyes.
- Where are the kids?
Security!
You. Me. Beautiful egg.
Now.
You. Me? Fat chance.
I have a chance.
And it's fat!
Carmen, I'm getting serious stalker vibe.
Carmen.
Her name is Carmen. Oh, Sven.
You're going to be my best friend and my best man all rolled into one.
Hey, Mumble.
Carmen, wait! Where you going?
Erik!
Carmen!
Mumble, Ear-rik is your boy?
Yes, he is. Kids...
- ...we're leaving.
- Uncle Mumble, no fair!
- Come on, all of you.
- Oh, no. But this place is so much fun.
Erik. Let's go.
- I'm not going back to Emperor Land.
- Don't be silly.
I'm staying here.
What about the folks back home and how worried your mother must be?
Ear-rik, it's best to do what your father's saying.
But I don't belong there.
Oh, ﬂuffy one, I want to tell to you a secret. Okay?
Sometimes, when you are a little different... the world laugh at you, ja?
Yeah.
Think you're funny.
- Pointing flippers.
- Mm-hm.
Ja, well, we have a saying back in Svenland.
Believe in yourself, Ear-rik... because Sven believe in you.
- Mighty Sven?
- Ja?
Will I ever fly?
- Erik, please.
- Mumble, the boy seeks a higher truth.
If you want it, you must will it.
If you will it... it will be yours.
Now, go.
Avvw.
Ciao.
Ciao.
Uh, son?
Erik... you know, when things go wrong... running away is not the answer.
Okay?
You have to find within yourself a way to handle it. Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. And we're all different.
It's part of the job of life to find out who you are... and what you got.
It may not be dancing or flying... but when you find it... it'll be all yours.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Okey-dokey.
Right.
Sven
Will! Will! Will!
What is this?!
It's the wave of change!
The world is changing, Bill.
We've got to get on the ride!
By the mother of Guin.
This cannot be.
Whoa. Something somewhere just took a big bump.
Yeah.
Sounded awfully close to Emperor Land.
Come on, guys.
Let's pick up the pace.
- This is our moment, Bill.
- Okay.
Adapt or die, my friend.
Adapt? There's no telling what we might become.
Fine. Be a plankton muncher all your life.
But that's what we are.
We're herbivores. We eat veggies.
Right.
So everyone else can eat us.
Well, I am not prepared to be on the menu any longer.
- Where you going?
- I'm moving up the food chain.
The food chain?
I'm gonna go chew on something that has a face!
- I don't remember this.
- Yeah.
Well, things always look different on the way back.
Guess we'll have to go all the way around.
- But Emperor Land is straight ahead.
- Yeah.
So why not go over that?
No, no.
This way is better.
But shortcuts are shorter.
Not always. Now, come on.
It's not that far.
Guys, stop!
Erik. I said stop!
All right.
All right.
We'll keep going, but take it nice and slow.
And what's say we don't look down, okay?
Atticus, what did I just say?
- Whoa!
- Wow.
G'day, sport.
Hi.
- Where you heading?
- Home.
Oh, yeah? So am I.
If you don't mind backing up a little bit... we'll just squeeze past.
That's the one thing I
Back up.
The Beachmaster backs up for nobody.
Then maybe... you can move sideways.
Don't do sideways.
We've come all the way across.
You'll have to go all the way back.
I've got the kids.
It's kind of dangerous.
Of course.
- And we're anxious to get home.
- I see. Fair enough.
But see it my way, sport.
One day, I'll be protecting my beach... and some pumped-up mongrel wants to take it from me.
We're nose-to-nose.
The whole world's watching.
And in the back of me mind, there's this niggling doubt:
I once backed up for a penguin.
He'll see it in me eyes... and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies.
Hello, lonely beach.
- You with me?
- Yeah, but...
Then get out of my way.
"My mother says, “Every obstacle is an opportunity."
What? Bo. Bo!
Whoa! Unh!
Hey! Yo, dog!
You be apologizing... or I'm gonna tear you a new nostril.
He didn't mean that.
That's okay.
I didn't mean that.
SvenTHINK, SvenTHINK.
- Erik, no!
Golly gosh!
You fat... mother of all bullies!
Get out of my way!
Oh, no.
Erik.
Daddy. Daddy.
- Where are you, Daddy?
- Where's he gone?
Uh-oh.
That's not healthy.
Are you okay?
Not exactly.
Daddy, what are you doing...
- ...down there?
- Get back up here.
Not sure I can.
There is a way... but you won't like it.
You want me to back up, don't you?
Come on, Dad.
You can do it.
We won't think less of you, Daddy.
Well, I suppose technically it's just reversing.
I guess I could, you know, just a smidge.
That's it, Dad.
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.
Back. That's it.
In no way does this feel natural.
- Now see if you can turn yourself around.
- All right.
Use your flippers.
Whoa! Stop!
Dad!
- Come on, Daddy.
- You can do it.
Oh, jeez!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
Can you hear me...
Daddy?!
Shane? Darren?
Daddy!
I need youse... to stay strong.
I know you will, because you've never let me down.
Penguin, you still there?
Yeah. Right here.
Would you see that me boys get home safe to their mother?
Daddy.
What are you saying?
Sorry, boys.
They're calling full time on your old man's career.
- No, Dad! No!
- No, Dad!
Come on. Take a look around.
Can you see any way out?
Yeah. I could grow... a pair of wings.
Can you move at all?
I'm stuck, mate.
Okay. Everyone... back from the edge.
Come on, get back from the edge.
All right.
Now don't move till I get back.
Where are you going?
To see what I can do for their daddy.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
That's one small step for a krill... one giant leap for spineless invertebrates.
Holy mother of krill.
How's your appetite, Bill?
He's a big 'un.
What on earth are you doing?
- I'm stalking.
- You can't...!
- Shh! Shh.
- You can't...
You can't stalk. You're a krill.
We've got to evolve, Bill.
Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us millions of years just to get this far.
Watch and learn, Billy-boy.
I'm about to naturally select.
No! No, no, no...
Hmm.
A little chewy.
Keenly aromatic.
You just nibbled on its butt.
Don't let it go to your head.
Au contraire, I will go to its head.
Oh, goodness.
Onward and upward, my friend.
Fresh delicacies await.
Uh, penguin? Is that you?
Streuth.
Oh, penguin.
We're going where no krill has ever gone before!
Uh-huh.
- We're the stuff of legends, Bill!
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay.
How far to the face?
Just ahead!
Hey, you!
Doofus!
Yeah, you. Kelp-sucker.
My mistake.
I thought you were a ruthless killing machine.
Don't you want a little taste of penguin?
Stand back, Bill.
This could get messy.
Ha, ha!
He's a fighter!
But he'll drop soon.
It's just the death throes!
Yoo-hoo!
Whoa!
Whoa!
G'day, gorgeous.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
Dad?
Boys.
Pa. It worked.
SvenTHINK.
Oh, yeah! Did you see the look in his eyes?
Mortal terror!
You said he was finished.
- I spared his despicable life!
- What?
He'll tell his friends.
Spread the fear.
There's a new predator in town!
Sching!
You're insane.
Someone's gotta keep their numbers down, Bill, and we are that someone.
Oh, boy.
We are the champions, my friend.
And we'll keep on fighting till the end.
Listen to yourself.
Me are the champion
Me are the champion.
Delusional singing!
Will, it's the first sign of madness.
Me are the champion.
- How's that shoulder?
- Yeah, it's okay.
Yeah, get some ice on it.
You'll be right.
- Thanks.
- No.
Thank you.
Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster
Bryan gets to play another season.
I reckon that makes you an honorary elephant seal.
What do you reckon, boys?
Thank you, Your Honor, for giving us our daddy back.
- Yeah. Cheers, Bryan.
- I owe you one, my friend.
No.
I mean it.
All you have to do is ask.
Any time, any place.
No worries. Okay?
No worries.
Okay.
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.
- All right.
- Both of youse.
- On you hop, Shane-0.
- Come on, guys.
Go on, Daggy, up you get.
We lost, ain't we?
Atticus, we're not lost.
- Emperor Land should be right here.
- Yeah.
My instincts are never wrong.
You all are crazy. I know for a fact the Emperor-hood is one day that way.
No, that way.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, no.
Hey, look!
Somebody got out!
Aye, you see!
I knew there was a way!
Hey, buddy, how do we get out?!
I don't know!
I'm trying to get in!
Mumble!
Mumble!
Yo! Dad!
Atticus, my man!
Good to see y'all still kicking!
What happened?
That big old iceberg you on came thumping and bumping, and here we are!
That's messed up!
Nothing we can't fix, dear!
Mommy!
I told them all to chillax!
I knew you'd be fine!
Where's Mommy?
Has anyone seen Gloria?
Mumble! Erik!
- Mom!
- Gloria!
My beautiful boys.
Thought I'd never see you again.
Gotta be a way to get you out.
Honey, there are search parties everywhere.
If there's a way out, we're gonna find it.
Don't worry, Daddy!
Today Uncle Mumble got a big old elephant seal out of... a big black hole!
Yeah. But that was a whole lot different!
But you did.
Mumble!
Can you get us a couple of fish for my kids?
- Mine too!
- Over here!
Okay. I'll do what I can.
- What about my family?
- Hey, don't forget us!
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.
There is a way to feed a whole lot of you.
I'm going to Adelie Land.
Bring back some friends.
You'll have to be patient... okay?
Bo, where are you going?
I'm taking the shortcut.
- No, you're not. You're staying here.
- But I'm very fast.
- Erik?
- Be cool. She's a freerunner.
Sorry, Erik.
One's faster than two.
Boadicea, do you have a tail feather?
Yes, I have a tail feather.
Then you... shake it, my dear!
- Booya!
- But, Miss Viola... there are all kinds of dangers out there.
Not dangers, challenges!
Now that's the spirit!
Okay. Okay. Find Uncle Ramon.
Tell him to bring the amigos and as many Adelies as he can. And...
And always remember the family motto:
Just let rip!
Come on, Uncle Mumble.
We got some fishing to do.
So, what news have you?
Every nook and cranny, every which way, completely blocked.
There's a lot of talk out there.
- Thinking the unthinkable.
- Yeah.
Noah, they're calling this the 'Berg of Doom.
How will we answer that?
- We look again.
- We can't just keep...
We go back and we search a hundred times.
There is no way out!
A thousand times if we have to.
There's always a way!
Yeah, that's it, right there.
The ice
The ice sounds nice Check one.
The ice Ice sounds nice.
Here. Let me help you.
Okay. Now let it go.
Wait... Erik!
No! Slow down!
Jump! Jump off!
Whoa!
Did you see me? Did you?
Don't ever do that again!
Daddy, I was flying!
- Aw, Erik.
- Really flying!
I flapped my wings super fast and I went uppity-up!
Son, we're penguins.
We can't fly.
But Sven is a penguin.
I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is, but we are Emperor penguins. We can't...
But if everyone could learn to fly, Mommy can... get out of there!
- Hey.
- I don't know if there's a way out!
Know... way out!
Hey!
But if there is, it sure as eggs ain't flying.
If you want it, you must will it!
And if you will it, it will be yours!
Aw, Erik, get real.
They're trapped.
They're hungry, afraid.
The last thing anyone... needs is false hope!
Boys?
Then they'll die.
Boys... what's going on with you two?
Just working things out.
Erik?
We need some mother love, Ms. G.
He's about to explode!
Mumble, why don't you go... catch some fish?
He ain't hungry...
Ms. G.
It's okay, Atticus.
I got it.
I got it!
Okay, fishing.
Erik, just let it go.
Erik, calm down!
Sweetie, take a step back.
Close your eyes.
Deep breath.
Come on, it's easy.
Just when you think.
Hope is lost.
And giving UP
ls all you got.
Blue turns black.
Your confidence is cracked.
There seems no turnin' back from here.
When your feet.
Are made of stone.
And you're convinced.
That you're all alone.
Look at the stars.
Instead of the dark.
You'll find your heart.
Shines like the sun.
Let's not let our anger get us lost.
And the need to be right.
Comes with way too high a cost.
That's when you can build.
A bridge of light.
That's what turns the wrongs all right.
That's when you know.
It's worth the fight.
That's when love
Turns nighttime.
Into day.
That's when loneliness goes away.
That's why you gotta be strong This night
'Cause only love can build us.
A bridge
or light
Deep breath, take it.
On the chin.
But don't forget.
To let love back in.
That's when love can build.
A bridge of light.
That's what turns the wrongs all right.
That's when you can't.
Give up the fight.
And that's when love Turns nighttime into day.
That's when loneliness goes away.
That's why you gotta.
Be strong tonight
'Cause only love can build us.
A bridge of light.
Only love can build us.
A bridge of light.
Only love can build us.
A bridge of light
Will? Will?
Hm?
- You asleep yet?
- Mm-hm. Deeply.
Well, then wake up and tell me:
Is that the swarm or am I dreaming?
You're dreaming.
Wow, how wonderful.
I wonder if they're edible.
Aww.
Will, don't you long for the patter of a thousand tiny little feet?
I, for one, don't have the means to bring up so many kids.
The birthday presents alone...
I've already
Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil,
Billy, Lilly, Willy...
- All right.
- Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina...
I get the picture.
And there's even a Will.
Good for you.
We could start a little swarm.
We're both males.
We'll adopt.
You adopt, I'll adapt.
I've got slaughtering to do.
Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then.
Quench your blood lust.
There's plenty more krill in the sea.
Plenty of krill would count themselves lucky to have me as a partner.
I'm a heck of a wingman!
Will.
Will?
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're all the swarm I've got.
Suit yourself.
But no hanky-panky.
Are you hurt?
No, I'm good. I'm okay.
It's okay.
Aw, come on, Seymour, take a break.
No. No, no, thanks, brother.
My boy is out there.
Oh, no.
Erik! Atticus!
Take cover!
Come on, Erik. Over here.
Waddle, waddle, waddle.
Oh, if only I could fly!
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, look at this.
My all-time favorite.
Doomed penguin packed in ice.
All you can eat.
Forever.
I've never seen so many skuas in one place.
Stand together. Hold fast.
- They know. They sense it!
- We're never getting out of here!
They're scavengers.
Cowards!
They prey only on the weak.
Admit it, Noah!
We're all dead meat!
No! We are Emperor penguins!
Quite right!
Though we stare famine in the face, we will not yield!
- Ha, ha!
- Though imprisoned... on every side by colossal walls of ice... we will not be broken!
Yes, sir. Speak on it, Noah!
We are fortitude!
We are bold defiance!
We are one glorious
Emperor nation!
No!
Erik, stay down!
Mumble?
They're okay.
Gloria, behind you!
Hey!
Pick on someone your own size, creep!
Oh, I will, princess.
I'll peck on you first.
While you're still fresh.
Before you're stiff and stinky!
Bo!
Bo!
- That's my girl.
- Oh, yeah.
Well done, you.
Ah, the gathering of nations.
Now that's solidarity!
Okay, so...
So they got themselves a temporary stay... of execution. Ow!
- What are you?
- An idiot.
Thank you.
Bo! Oh, you did it.
Whoo!
- She is fast.
- Hola, amigos!
- Mumble!
- Mumble!
- You came!
- Of course we came.
- We heard the news.
- Where's Ramon?
- No longer with us.
- He's in a better place.
Carmen!
We got you, man.
Carmen. Carmen, no. No, wait!
I wouldn't want you to get cold feet, my darling.
I am not your darling.
See? What did I tell you?
No backbone. All squishy.
Hey, back off!
I'm a Carmen-only facility.
Ramon, it's incredible.
Everybody came.
Except for that guy who stayed, he had the sniffles.
Oh, no, he's here.
You're a true friend. Thank you.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well, then, Lovelace, thank you so much.
You got the wrong penguin.
Hello! Hidy-do-dee-doody there.
- I knew it.
- Ah, little Ear-rik.
Excusing me.
Okay. Friends of Sven, and fans, and chums and Svenatics!
We're not going to rest until everybody fatty!
Okay.
Yeah!
Hello!
Heh, hey! You huddled masses.
I bring you fish aplenty courtesy of me!
Yeah!
Give them the real, brother!
Who is this guy?
They call him Sven.
He's Sventastic.
Let me revert back to what
I previously said before.
- Ow!
- You're an idiot.
- And guess what.
- What?
He can carry more fish than any penguin that ever... existed.
Wow.
And it's all due to his amazingly large red beak.
Impressive.
Sven? Sven?
Ja? Ja?
There's someone down there who's very special.
And knowing Gloria, she won't eat...
- ...until everyone else has been fed.
- Aww.
Do you think you could take this down to her?
Yeah, don't be silly.
Where is he?
- No, she.
- Oh.
There, surrounded by the children.
- That is your spouse?
- Yes.
- Your spouse? Wow.
- Here. The fish.
Oh, no, no, Mumbley.
She deserves the very best.
A la carte.
A la me!
So you want some music?
Nope.
Let's have some music.
A-wake me up before you go-go.
Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo.
A-wake me up before you go-go.
Can you keep it down?
I wanna hit that high.
Just be quiet!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
- Whoa!
- A predator convention?
Oh, no.
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Will.
- Guys? Guys.
- Will, don't go.
- Get off.
- You'll never survive.
- Please.
- Will? Stop!
I think we should split up.
Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal space you want, how's that?
No, no. I mean, really split up.
But why?
Ah, Bill, this is my life now.
I can change.
Be smaller, invisible.
See? You're gonna be just fine.
I'll see you around, kiddo.
Will? Please. Don't leave me.
- Aah!
- Will! Will!
Okay, let's take you, you, not you, you.
Oh. you!
Please! Somebody! Anybody!
I've lost my Will!
I beg you!
Bring back my Will!
Mumbley!
- Ah, Sven.
- Mumbley.
- I feed your wife good-y, ja?
- Yeah, thanks.
Okay, Sven, here we go.
Okay, single file with a smile.
So you must be Glorious.
Heh, heh. And you must be Sven.
So pleased to meet me. Really...
I am delightful.
I bring to you premium seafood, yeah, from Mumbley.
- There he is.
- Hey.
Via Sven.
Wow.
Careful.
That's my tongue.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Whoo!
Oh, yeah.
You know, if you are not feeling a full Svensation...
I can get you more.
No, no, Sven. I'm sure there are many others hungrier than me.
Ah. Such a noble.
See you for supper?
Um, I'm kind of busy.
Heh. "Kind of busy."
Oh, you're funny!
Whoo!
She is a hottie!
Honey, are you okay?
Are you sure he's not related to Ramon'?
Oh, you're funny!
You shouldn't make fun of someone just because they're different.
Especially someone who's come all this way...
- ...to save us.
- You're right.
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.
- And out of there.
- You'll see.
Hey, who turned off the fish?
Hey, guys!
What's happening to the fish?
Yoo-hoo!
Fish-y friends!
What is problem?
The bird-eaters!
Svensei! You must fly on the wings of hope... and summon them to the aid of our Emperor brothers!
You know, I would love to, but I just hurt my tongue.
No.
What?
Ciao. Hmm.
Interesting.
Someone better do something.
They're not stopping.
Don't worry. I know exactly how to get the attention... of our alien benefactors.
Calm down. Deep breath.
Deep breath.
Lovelace!
Mumble, my man! I'm the mayor me!
This is great.
Ah. Can you believe this?
Where's there a
Will, there's a way out!
Hm?
Huh?
Bill? Is that you?
I don't know, Uncle Mumble.
They're noisy and they're messing with our ice.
Atticus, they're building us a way out of here.
ATTICUS Oh.
Everybody who said we'd never get out of here, take a look!
That's our ice road to freedom.
It won't be long now, boys.
I'll miss this place.
So where will we live when everybody gets out?
We'll find somewhere new, sweetheart.
It's a big world.
As long as we're together, we already home.
Yeah.
Come on, everyone. Huddle up.
Oh, no, no, no!
Carmen, can't you see?
Even nature decrees that we be close together.
Mm. Yeah.
No, no, no.
Oh, you are still here.
And you're still here.
- They're gone.
- What?
A little bad weather, they're gone!
- What's going on?
- Who's gone?
- The aliens!
- What?
All of this flipperizing for nothing!
Our alien benefactors... have abandoned us!
They have abandoned us!
Everybody! Everybody!
The sea is frozen over, ja?
Impossible for aliens to return!
Too much ice-y. Too much ice-y.
If the sea so far away, how we gonna catch food?
Yeah, what's the point of us starving too?
- I guess we should be going.
- We can't just leave them.
- I think they're leaving.
- Who's leaving?
- It appears that we...
- What is he saying?
I regret to inform... we are no longer in the catering businesses.
Then who will bring us fish?
Some good questions have no good answers.
Sven, they can't leave!
Not now!
I so sorry, fluffy one.
If they stay... then they, too, become not alive.
Ah! I can't take it!
I can't take it any more!
Out of my way!
I'm getting out of here!
Whoa, that guy was crazy.
Yeah. So am I.
Come on, girls. Let's do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Go, go, go!
Sven. Teach them.
Teach them how to fly!
Ear-rik, it's not that easy.
Help them, Sven. Help them!
But not all penguins created equal, Ear-rik.
- But you're a penguin.
- I a..
I a little more than penguin.
I a... I is a...
Look! They're halfway there!
Come on, Sven.
Take them high to the sky!
Do it, Sven!
- Do it, brother!
- No, I can't!
- Do it!
- They're penguins!
You're a penguin!
I'm a bird!
You're a what?
A bir... den.
- What?
- Den. A burden.
If I don't try. Ia?
Ja, ja, after all...
- it's just technique, right?
- Yes!
Okay.
Everybody! Head up!
Back straight!
Okay. Feel the wind beneath your wings!
UP-uppity-up!
Oh, boy.
Rotate flippers and sing, sing!
This time... you going down, gravity!
Ja, ja, okay. ja...
Atticus, my man, I'm coming!
Fly, Daddy...
- ...fly!
- Fly!
Ja! Ja!
Come on, guys. Come on.
If you want it, you must will it!
If you will it, it will be yours! on, Daddy.
Today is a victory... for defeat.
Oh, mighty Sven, you did everything penguinly possible.
I is not a penguin.
- What?
I is a puffin.
- Wow.
- Really?
Ja, just a little puffin bird run out of poof.
No.
Bravo, Lovelace.
You brought us a weird bird... and sold him as a penguin.
Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo.
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you. I deserved it.
I'm sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry.
But when I lose my homelands...
I was very lonely and very afraid-y.
And then I meet you and you believe... in me, Sven.
Oh.
It was nice to have a family.
Thank you.
Eh, up-up-uppity
Hey, guys, we should try this.
Huh?
Ah.
Okay.
Now, come on. Everyone together.
- You know.
- Tippity-tap!
- Boomedy-boom!
- Let's do it!
Come on! Everybody!
We're doomed and they're dancing?
Unbelievable.
That's it.
Huh?
Atticus!
- Mommy!
- Oh, Boadicea!
Are you all right'?
Help me!
Erik!
Help me now!
Help me now! He... Ah!
I missed you like crazy.
- My baby.
I missed you even more.
Ear-rik.
Hold on, Ear-rik. I'm on my way!
Erik?
Bite, Erik! Bite down hard!
- Grab it, grab it!
- Use the hips.
Now spin around, spin around!
Almost, almost.
- There you go.
- Almost got it!
Papa.
It's okay, Erik.
It's okay. I've got you.
- They're tougher than we think, you know.
- Come on, Erik.
Let's go get off this thing.
Carmen! Carmen!
Where is Carmen?
Carmen!
It's okay, Ramon!
I'm fine. I guess.
I hate these long-distance relationships!
Yes?
You must do me a favor.
I count to three.
- You push me on two.
- He's gonna jump!
- But don't tell me, okay?
- Hey, hey.
- One. Two.
- Ramon, you're crazy!
Carmen! I'm coming!
My name is Ramon. Ramon Carlos Garcia
Santa Maria La Niña Pinta Pacifico...
Ramon.
I can't believe you did this.
How could I not?
But down here, we're doomed.
A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing to this one exquisite moment by your side.
You are my world entire.
You're beautiful.
Only on the outside.
No!
Why didn't I see this before?
You're really beautiful.
You really think so?
Absolutely.
Ramon, my fallen angel.
You chased me until I caught you.
Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving.
I know. It's amazing.
No, it's moving for real.
Move! Move!
Keep going. Don't look back.
Mumble, that thing's on the edge!
Keep trying!
All it needs is a nudge!
We can do this!
Okay.
- It's just not enough.
- Not enough.
Uh, Mumbley.
- We're not big enough.
- Yeah. My feet hurt.
- Excuse me. Mumbley. Mumbley.
- Yeah?
There's a guy named
Lars Gavunsterson.
I used to dance with his sister Girta, and I...
Well, anyway, we were two-time national champion.
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Amateur division, so...
Um...
Look, could I give it a shot?
Sure, sure. Of course.
Attentions! Attentions... everybody!
Mumbley's foot is very, very hurt-y.
Yeah, like your brain.
But I have song and dance... from my homelands.
It's in Svenish, so join in as best you can.
Okay! And a-nooney, and a-dooney and a-vooney!
Get off!
Come on!
Help!
Come on, son. Come on.
Where are we going?
To find us a lot more oomph.
Where am I?
Who turned out the lights?
Is this the end?
I should make out my will.
I, Willy Williams, leave everything to my imagination...
Oh, no. Imagination, it's the second sign of madness.
If only I'd listened to Bill.
Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry!
That's okay, Will.
You were right.
I should have stayed with the swarm.
No. You were right.
Oh, great!
I'm talking to myself.
You're not mad, Will.
Now I'm seeing things.
What's going on inside my head?!
- Will?
- Please, make it stop!
Will!
Ow!
Bill? Is it really you?
Well, there's only one of me in all the world.
You taught me that.
Aw, Bill! What are the chances?
About one in a krillion, Will.
Quiet, you two.
I'm trying to sleep.
Hey, everyone! It's Will!
Wow, it's him!
It's wee Willy Williams!
I thought he'd be taller.
He's back! Will's back!
Welcome home, Will.
But how did you find them?
They found me.
I was on my last nine legs.
I was such a fool, Bill.
Will, you're a legend.
Those days are gone, my friend.
The carnivore is over.
No. It's because of you we're all here.
It is?
I told them how the world really works.
How there were predators, how we had to adapt.
I led them here, under the great ice.
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
Well, we all have a purpose.
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
Wait and see, Will.
You wait and see.
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?
Don't know, but it sure is ugly.
Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?
Right. Outside, now!
We are outside.
- Come on, then.
- No...
- you come on.
- Excuse me. Bryan?
Down here.
Ah, g'day, chief.
What are you doing here?
Bryan, I need a favor.
A big one.
For you, champ, anything.
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
- Why?
- To dance.
You know...
Now, why would I wanna do that?
- To free the penguin nation.
- Oh, yeah?
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
Uh-huh.
- By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey! Bryan!
Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time.
Maybe after winter or something, okay?
No, that's too late.
Way too late.
Bryan! You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
But right now, I got problems of me own.
Everyone's cranky, looking for biff.
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
If you don't come now, multitudes will die.
Here we go. You saying it's my fault now?
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine.
If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole.
That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit.
Get off my beach!
Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you.
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
- The only "butt" I wanna see is yours... walking away.
Come on, son.
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
Now, where was I?
- Right here.
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
I don't know, but it sure is ugly.
No, Pa. This is so unfair.
After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
Hm.
Where is.
The honor When a.
Solemn promise.
Is just a pretty lie?
And the mighty mock.
The courage.
Of the humble?
Although he's just.
An ordinary penguin.
My daddy taught me.
You don't need.
To be colossal.
To be a great.
Heart.
You don't need.
To fly.
To be awesome.
My hero.
My father
Rolling, rolling, rolling.
Keep moving, moving, moving.
Keep them doggies moving.
Rawhide.
Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather.
Wishin' me girl was by me side.
Oh, my goodness.
Mumble.
Hey, I know that guy.
That's Bryan.
Ride 'em in.
Rawhide.
Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.
Find yourself an elephant seal and show them the moves.
Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing gonna move that?
With enough oomph, we can shove enough snow.
Pack it in behind. It'll go.
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it. Hit the beat hard!
And together!
I know how to hit things hard, okay?
- And I'm telling you...
- Come on.
The impact force of compact ice under pressure is equiv...
Just give it a go, you big wuss!
Wayne!
- Hello.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Now you're talking, Bryan!
You with me, boys?
Oh, yeah!
Pressure.
Pushing down on me.
Pressing down on you.
No man asks for.
Under pressure.
That tears a nation down.
Splits a family in two.
Puts people on streets.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about.
Watching some good friends scream.
Let me out.
Pray tomorrow.
Take me higher.
Pray tomorrow.
Take me higher
You hear that?
They're doing it again.
- Doing what?
- This.
Fascinating. What is it?
I have no idea.
Wow! What's it for?
Perhaps it's a momentary relief from the existential terrors of existence.
- Oh. What?
- It brings out my happy.
Oh, yes, indeed!
Hey, Bryan, what are you doing?
Sometimes you gotta back up to go forward.
Tell me why, tell me why.
Give ourselves one more chance.
Why can't we give ourselves
One more chance?
Why can't we give love
Give love, give love.
Give love.
Every day.
Every night, every hour.
Yeah, come on! Take it higher!
Come on, come on! Give love, y'all!
Give love, y'all!
Hey, get down here.
Yeah.
- Come on!
- Every step counts.
To care for.
The people on The edge of the night.
And love dares you.
To change our way.
Of caring.
About ourselves.
This is.
Our last dance.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves.
Creatures of the world unite Strength in numbers, we can get it right.
One time.
Yeah!
- Be careful, Ramon.
- I'm coming. I'm right behind you.
Ramon! Amigos!
I'm getting "emotioable" again.
- Come on, Ramon.
- Coming, baby!
- Hi, Erik.
- Hello, Bo.
Good job, Erik.
You too, Uncle Mumble.
You really something special, brother.
One nation, Mumble.
One nation.
Irie, walking out now, Mumble.
One nation.
So, boys...
- Mommy!
- Gloria.
Where's my hug?
Oh, my babies.
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.
Hey, Bryan.
Cheers.
No worries, penguin. No worries.
Yeah.
No worries.
Ja, the Svend.
It's beautiful here.
It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.
The Order uses it now as a safe house.
What's left of us, at least.
Muggles think these keep evil away, but they're wrong.
I need to talk to the goblin.
How are you?
Alive.
You probably don't remember...
That I showed you to your vault the first time you came to Gringotts?
Even amongst goblins you're famous, Harry Potter.
You buried the elf.
Yes.
And brought me here.
You are...
...a very unusual wizard.
How did you come by this sword?
It's complicated.
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
It's complicated.
The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need.
We didn't steal it.
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one...
...but it is a fake.
It was placed there this summer.
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.
Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.
Who is the acquaintance?
A Hogwarts professor. As I understand it, he's now headmaster.
Snape?
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?
Why?
There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Perhaps.
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.
This is impossible.
Alone, yes. But with you, no.
Why should I help you?
I have gold. Lots of it.
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?
That.
That is my price.
Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there.
She kept asking you what else we'd taken.
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there, another piece of his soul.
Let's find it and kill it, we're one step closer to killing him.
And what happens when we find it?
How are we supposed to destroy it now you've given the sword to Griphook?
I'm still working on that part.
He's weak.
Yes?
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.
OLLIVANDER: Anything, my boy, anything.
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.
Walnut.
Dragon heartstring.
Twelve and three-quarter inches.
Unyie...
Unyielding.
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Treat it carefully.
And this?
Hawthorn.
And unicorn hair.
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Was? Is it not still?
Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.
I sense its allegiance has changed.
You talk about wands as if they have feelings...
...can think.
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
And what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?
It is rumored there are three:
The Elder Wand...
...the Cloak of Invisibility to hide you from your enemies...
...and the Resurrection Stone to bring back loved ones from the dead.
Together, they make one the master of death.
But few truly believe that such objects exist.
Do you?
Do you believe they exist, sir?
I see no reason to put stock into an old wives' tale.
You're lying.
You know one exists.
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand and where he could go looking for it.
He tortured me.
Besides...
...I only conveyed rumors.
There's...
There's no telling whether he will find it.
He has found it, sir.
We'll let you rest.
OLLIVANDER: He's after you, Mr. Potter.
If it's true, what you say, and he has the Elder Wand...
...I'm afraid...
...you really don't stand a chance.
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then.
Are you sure that's hers?
Positive.
Well?
How do I look?
Hideous.
You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?
We're relying on you.
If you get us past the guards and into the vault, the sword's yours.
Madam Lestrange.
Good morning.
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?
You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed school girl.
Hey. Easy.
She gives us away, we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats.
Understand?
No, he's right. I was being stupid.
Okay.
Let's do it.
I wish to enter my vault.
Identification?
I hardly think that'll be necessary.
Madam Lestrange.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
They know.
They know she's an imposter.
They've been warned.
Harry?
What do we do, Harry?
Madam Lestrange, would you mind presenting your wand?
And why should I do that?
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand given the current climate.
No. I most certainly do not understand.
I'm afraid I must insist.
HARRY WHISPERS: Imperio.
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.
What is that, Griphook?
Griphook.
Arresto momentum.
Well done, Hermione.
Oh, no, you look like you again.
The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments.
Can be deadly.
You don't say.
Just out of interest, is there any other way out of here?
No.
What the devil are all you doing down here?
Thieves!
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Lmperio.
That doesn't sound good.
Bloody hell.
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.
Here.
It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
That's barbaric.
Lumos.
Blimey.
Accio Horcrux.
You're not trying that one again, are you?
That kind of magic won't work in here.
Is it in here, Harry?
Can you feel anything?
That's it. Up there.
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.
Give me the sword.
Stop moving.
Got it.
We had a deal, Griphook.
The cup for the sword.
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say anything about getting you out.
Griphook!
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!
Thieves!
Foul little git. Least we've still got Bogrod.
That's unfortunate.
We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?
You're the brilliant one.
I've got something, but it's mad.
Reducto.
Well, come on, then.
Relashio.
GOBLIN: He's moving! Aah!
Now what?
Reducto.
Hold on.
That was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
We're dropping.
- I say we jump.
- When?
Now.
He knows. You-Know-Who.
He knows we broke into Gringotts.
He knows what we took and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that.
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.
Never mind. What happened?
Well, he's angry.
And scared too.
He knows if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.
I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest.
There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.
What?
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.
We can't do that. We've got to plan. We've got to figure it out.
Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked?
We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.
He's right.
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.
Um, well, we'll go to
Hogsmeade, to Honeydukes.
Take the secret passage in the cellar.
It's... There's something wrong with him.
It's like, you know, in the past, I've always been able to follow his thoughts.
And now everything just feels disconnected.
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
No. No, it's more like he's wounded.
If anything, he feels more dangerous.
VOLDEMORT IN PARSELTONGUE:
- Man 1: They're here!
- Man 2: Search everywhere!
MAN 1: Look down by the stables! You two, come with me!
Man 3: Any sign?
Man 4: Potter!
OLD MAN: In here, Potter.
Did you get a look at him?
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.
Harry?
I can see you in this.
You bloody fools. What were you thinking coming here?
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.
It's you who I've been seeing in here.
You're the one who sent Dobby.
Where have you left him?
He's dead.
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
Who gave that to you? The mirror?
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.
- Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.
Albus told me.
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it...
...but ask yourself, where would you be if I didn't?
Do you hear from the others much? From the Order?
The Order's finished.
You-Know-Who's won.
Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Did he now?
Nice job? Easy?
We've been hunting Horcruxes.
We think the last one's inside the castle, but we'll need help getting in.
That's not a job my brother's given you. It's a suicide mission.
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home. Live a little longer.
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?
What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you?
In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name?
Did he ever mention hers?
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.
A boy who goes chasing
Horcruxes on the word of a man...
...who wouldn't even tell him where to start. You're lying!
Not just to me, that doesn't matter. To yourself as well.
That's what a fool does.
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter.
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.
I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother.
I don't care that you've given up.
I trusted the man I knew.
And we need to get into the castle tonight.
You know what to do.
Where have you sent her?
You'll see soon enough.
That's your sister, Ariana, isn't it?
She died very young, didn't she?
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter...
...on his journey to find power...
...including Ariana.
And she was devoted to him.
He gave her everything...
...but time.
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
He did save our lives twice.
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.
(WHISPERS) That doesn't seem like someone who's given up.
She's coming back.
Who's that with her?
Neville.
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.
Hey, Ab, we've got a couple more coming through.
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.
That's because it never existed till now.
The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year.
This is the only way in or out now.
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.
How bad is Snape as headmaster?
Hardly ever see him. It's the
Carrows you need to watch out for.
Carrows?
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.
They like punishment, the Carrows.
They did that to you? Why?
NEVILLE: Today's Dark Arts lessons had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse.
On first-years.
I refused.
Hogwarts has changed.
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope. Be a surprise if we can digest it.
Blimey.
- Harry!
- Yeah!
Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
Okay, let's not kill him before You-Know-Who...
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?
- We have a new weather.
- REPORT: Lightning has struck.
What's the plan, Harry?
Okay.
There's something we need to find.
Something hidden here in the castle. And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.
Right. What is it?
We don't know.
- NEVILLE: Where is it?
- We don't know that either.
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.
Um, it'll be small, easily concealed.
Anyone, any ideas?
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
- Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
- LUNA: Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
Hasn't anyone heard of it? It's quite famous.
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost, for centuries now.
There isn't a person alive today who's seen it.
Excuse me. Can someone tell me what a bloody diadem is?
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.
Harry.
Hi there.
Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.
What is it, Ginny?
Snape knows. He knows that
Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Many of you are surely wondering why
I have summoned you at this hour.
It's come to my attention that earlier this evening...
...Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
Now...
...should anyone...
...student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter...
...they will be punished...
...in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression.
Furthermore...
...any person found to have knowledge of these events...
...who fails to come forward...
...will be treated as...
...equally guilty.
Now then...
...if anyone here...
...has any knowledge of Mr.
Potter's movements this evening...
...I invite them to step forward...
...now.
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies...
...you still have a bit of a security problem, headmaster.
And I'm afraid it's quite extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood?
Tell them how it happened that night.
Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him.
Tell them.
Coward!
VOLDEMORT: Harry.
Potter?
VOLDEMORT: I know that many of you will want to fight.
Some of you may even think that to fight is wise.
But this is folly.
Give me Harry Potter.
Do this and none shall be harmed.
Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.
Give me Harry Potter...
...and you will be rewarded.
You have one hour.
PANSY: What are you waiting for?
Someone grab him.
FILCH: Students out of bed.
Students out of bed!
Students in the corridor!
They are supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot.
Oh.
Sorry, ma'am.
As it happens, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune.
If you would, I would like you, please...
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the hall.
Exactly where is it I'll be leading them to, ma'am?
The dungeons would do.
FILCH: Right. Come on. Come on.
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?
Time, professor. As much as you can get me.
Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle.
Potter.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too, professor.
Hold the fort, Neville.
GIRL: Hurry up, come on!
Harry. Hermione and I have been thinking.
It doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.
So we were thinking...
Ron was thinking. It was
Ron's idea. It's brilliant.
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary with a basilisk fang, right?
Me and Hermione know where we might find one.
Okay.
Okay, but take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.
Gotta start somewhere.
LUNA: Harry. Harry!
Let me get this straight. You're giving us permission to do this?
That is correct, Longbottom.
To blow it up? Boom?
Boom!
Wicked. But how on earth are we gonna do that?
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?
As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.
I can bring it down.
That's the spirit. Now away you go.
You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.
Well, that doesn't mean we can't delay him.
And his name is Voldemort,
Filius. You might as well use it.
He's going to try to kill you either way.
Piertotum Locomotor.
Hogwarts is threatened.
Man the boundaries. Protect us. Do your duty to our school.
I've always wanted to use that spell.
Protego Maxima. Fianto
Duri. Repello lnimicum.
Protego Maxima.
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.
You won't find anything where you're going. You're wasting time.
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.
- Later.
- Harry Potter!
You listen to me right now!
Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenolaw's diadem?
"There's not a person alive who's seen it." it's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead.
It's very impressive, isn't it?
If you're to find her, you'll find her down there.
- Aren't you coming?
- LUNA: No.
I think it's best if you two talk alone.
She's very shy.
You're the Grey Lady...
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.
I do not answer to that name.
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's
Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.
Rowena's daughter.
Are you a friend of Luna's?
Yes.
And she thought you might be able to help me.
You seek my mother's diadem.
Yes.
That's right.
Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others.
But she was wrong. I cannot help you.
Wait. Please.
I want to destroy it.
VOLDEMORT: They never learn.
Such a pity.
But, my Lord...
...shouldn't we wait for...?
My Lord.
Begin.
That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena?
You want it destroyed.
Another swore to destroy it many years ago...
...a strange boy with a strange name.
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.
He's lied to many people.
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!
He defiled it with dark magic!
I can destroy it once and for all.
But only if you tell me where he hid it.
You do know where he hid it, don't you, Helena?
You just have to tell me.
Please.
Strange.
You remind me of him a bit.
It's here...
...in the castle, in the place where everything is hidden.
If you have to ask...
...you will never know.
If you know, you need only ask.
Thank you.
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Dean, on second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall...
...we might need one or two more wands this side.
It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success...
...not the number of followers.
Who said that?
Me.
You okay, Freddie?
Yeah.
Me too.
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?
No, of course not.
Yeah?
You and whose army?
- You do it.
- I can't.
Yes, you can.
GINNY: Neville!
That went well.
Get inside! This way, everyone. Take cover!
Stupefy!
Get your coat on!
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire. You haven't seen Luna, have you?
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!
I think it's about time I told her since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.
I know.
Bloody hell. We'll never find it on this.
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.
He just vanished. Just now. I saw it.
Maybe he's gone to the
Room of Requirement.
It doesn't show up on the map, does it? You said that last year.
That's right. I... I did.
Let's go.
Brilliant.
DRACO: Come on!
DRACO: Well, well.
What brings you here, Potter?
I could ask you the same.
You have something of mine.
I'd like it back.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- DRACO: It's my mother's.
It's powerful, but it's not the same.
Doesn't quite understand me.
Know what I mean?
Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix.
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.
Come on, Draco. Don't be a prat. Do him.
DRACO: Easy.
Expelliarmus.
Avada Kedavra!
Stupefy!
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!
Got it.
Run!
Run!
Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!
Come on!
This way!
We can't leave them.
He's joking, right?
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you.
Harry!
My Lord?
Avada Kedavra!
Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe.
It's the snake.
She's the last one. It's the last Horcrux.
Look inside him, Harry.
Find out where he is. If we find him, we can find the snake.
Then we can end this.
LUCIUS: My Lord?
Might it be less, uh...
Might it not be more prudent to call off this attack...
...and simply seek the boy yourself?
VOLDEMORT: I do not need to seek the boy.
Before the night is out, he will come to me. Do you understand?
Look at me.
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?
I don't know.
Go and find Severus.
Bring him to me.
I know where he is.
OLIVER: Come on!
BOY: Crucio!
No!
SNAPE: You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord...
...in the last few hours alone.
VOLDEMORT: No.
No, I am extraordinary...
...but the wand resists me.
SNAPE: There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.
Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you. I am sure of it.
It answers to you...
...and you only.
Does it?
My Lord?
The wand, does it truly answer to me?
You're a clever man, Severus.
Surely you must know.
Where does its true loyalty lie?
With you...
...of course, my Lord.
VOLDEMORT: The Elder Wand...
...cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master.
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus...
...but only I can live forever.
My Lord...
Nagini, kill.
Take them.
Take them.
Please.
Give me something.
Quickly. A flask, anything.
Take them to the Pensieve.
Look at me.
You have your mother's eyes.
VOLDEMORT: You have fought valiantly...
...but in vain.
I do not wish this.
Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste.
I therefore command my forces to retreat.
In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity.
Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.
On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you...
...rather than face me yourself.
There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden
Forest and confront your fate.
If you do not do this...
...I shall kill every last man, woman and child...
...who tries to conceal you from me.
Where is everybody?
Harry.
SPROUT: Oh, come on.
What's the matter with you?
TRELAWNEY: Oh, she's passed.
There, she's gone.
PETUNIA: Freak!
Come here.
I'm gonna tell Mummy. You're a freak.
You're a freak, Lily!
Come here.
SNAPE: She's jealous because she's ordinary and you're special.
LILY: That's mean, Severus.
SORTING HAT: Gryffindor!
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.
SNAPE: Just like your father. Lazy. Arrogant.
Don't say a word against my father.
TRELAWNEY: Blood shall be spilt...
...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
VOLDEMORT: Severus.
SNAPE: No. Don't kill me.
DUMBLEDORE: The prophecy did not refer to a woman.
It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.
He intends to hunt them down now, to kill them.
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.
DUMBLEDORE: What will you give me in exchange, Severus?
Anything.
LILY: Harry. Harry, you are so loved. So loved.
Harry, Mama loves you.
Dada loves you.
Harry, be safe.
Be strong.
VOLDEMORT: Avada Kedavra!
SNAPE: You said you would keep her safe.
DUMBLEDORE: Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.
Rather like you.
The boy survives.
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.
The Dark Lord will return.
And when he does, the boy will be in terrible danger.
He has her eyes.
If you truly loved her...
No one can know.
DUMBLEDORE: That I should never reveal the best of you, Severus?
SNAPE: Your word.
DUMBLEDORE: When you risk your life every day to protect the boy?
SNAPE: He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father...
...and he seems to relish his fame.
Don't say a word against my father.
SNAPE: James Potter?
Lazy, arrogant.
My father was a great man.
Your father was a swine!
SNAPE: Drink the rest.
It will contain the curse to your hand for the time being.
It will spread, Albus.
DUMBLEDORE: How long?
SNAPE: Maybe a year.
Don't ignore me, Severus.
DRACO: Harmonia Nectere Passus.
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.
But should he fail, one should presume the Dark Lord...
...will turn to you.
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.
It is the only way.
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.
SNAPE: Avada Kedavra.
DUMBLEDORE: There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something.
But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
Must be told what?
DUMBLEDORE: On the night Lord Voldemort...
...went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...
...and Lily Potter cast herself between them...
...the curse rebounded.
When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul...
...latched itself onto the only living thing it could find:
Harry himself.
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes.
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind.
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
So when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes. Yes.
He must die.
You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment.
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy?
SNAPE: Expecto Patronum.
Lily.
After all this time?
Always.
So when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes. He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.
That is essential.
Where've you been?
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.
Are you mad? No.
You can't give yourself up to him.
What is it, Harry?
What is it you know?
There's a reason I can hear them...
...the Horcruxes.
I think I've known for a while.
And I think you have too.
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.
Kill the snake and then it's just him.
I'm ready to die.
The Resurrection Stone.
You've been so brave, sweetheart.
Why are you here?
All of you?
We never left.
Does it...?
Does it hurt'?
Dying?
Quicker than falling asleep.
You're nearly there, son.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted any of you to die for me.
And, Remus, your son...
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for.
One day, he'll understand.
You'll stay with me?
Until the end.
And he won't be able to see you?
SIRIUS: No.
We're here, you see.
Stay close to me.
Always.
DEATH EATER: No sign of him, my Lord.
VOLDEMORT: I thought he would come.
Harry? No! What are you doing here?
Quiet!
Harry Potter.
The Boy Who Lived.
Come to die.
Avada Kedavra!
DUMBLEDORE: You can't help. Harry...
...you wonderful boy.
You brave, brave man.
Let us walk.
Professor, what is that?
Something beyond either of our help.
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.
And exactly where are we?
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?
Well...
...it looks like King's Cross station.
Only cleaner.
And without all the trains.
King's Cross, is that right?
This is, as they say, your party.
I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...
...have been connected by something other than fate...
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.
So it's true then, sir?
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?
Did.
It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
You were the Horcrux he never meant to make, Harry.
I have to go back, haven't I?
Oh. That's up to you.
I have a choice?
Oh, yes.
We're in King's Cross, you say?
I think, if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.
And where would it take me?
On.
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.
True.
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.
And I've nothing to kill it with.
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.
I've always prized myself on my ability to turn a phrase.
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...
...our most inexhaustible source of magic...
...capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it.
But I would, in this case, amend my original statement to this:
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who deserve it.
Do not pity the dead, Harry.
Pity the living.
And, above all, all those who live without love.
Professor, my mother's
Patronus was a doe, wasn't it?
That's the same as Professor Snape's.
It's curious, don't you think?
Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all.
I'll be going now, Harry.
Professor?
Is this all real?
Or is it just happening inside my head?
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.
Why should that mean that it's not real?
Professor? What should I do?
Professor?
BELLATRIX: My Lord?
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?
I don't need your help.
BELLATRIX: No. Come.
The boy.
Is he dead?
Is he alive?
Draco, is he alive?
Dead.
GINNY: Who is that Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is it?
VOLDEMORT: Harry Potter...
...is dead.
No! No!
VOLDEMORT: Silence.
Stupid girl.
Harry Potter is dead.
From this day forth, you put your faith...
...in me.
Harry Potter is dead!
And now is the time to declare yourself.
Come forward and join us.
Or die.
LUCIUS: Draco.
Draco.
NARCISSA: Draco...
...Come.
VOLDEMORT: Ah. Well done, Draco.
Well done.
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.
And who might you be, young man?
Neville Longbottom.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.
I'd like to say something.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.
People die every day.
Friends, family.
Yeah.
We lost Harry tonight.
But he's still with us, in here.
So's Fred...
...and Remus.
Tonks.
All of them.
They didn't die in vain.
But you will.
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us. This is not over!
Confringo!
BELLATRIX: No! No, come back!
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!
Come back!
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.
- You'll need this.
- ARTHUR: Neville!
Not my daughter, you bitch.
You were right...
...when you told Snape that wand was failing you.
It will always fail you.
VOLDEMORT: I killed Snape.
But what if the wand never belonged to Snape?
What if its allegiance was always to someone else?
Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it.
Together.
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.
I couldn't find my wand. I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.
It was lost in the folds of my gowns.
I managed to find it and I dispatched a few of them...
HAGRID: Harry.
Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?
It answered to somebody else.
When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his.
But the thing is, the wand never belonged to Snape.
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the astronomy tower.
From that moment on, the wand answered to him.
Until...
...the other night when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.
So that means... it's mine.
What should we do with it?
We?
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world.
With that, we'd be invincible.
Together.
FATHER: Look after each other.
- Bag?
- Yeah.
Jumper?
I'll miss you.
Here they come.
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?
Albus Severus Potter...
...you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts.
One of them was a Slytherin...
...and he was the bravest man I've ever known.
But just say that I am.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful young wizard.
But, listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor.
The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
- Really?
- Really.
- GIRL: Bye, Mum.
- CONDUCTOR: All aboard.
Ready?
Ready.
BOY: Come on, Jay, get a move on.
JAMES: Come on.

Steel yourself against my steel, villain!
Your reign of tears is over!
- I got the onion, Dad.
- I'll get the bok choy.
- Hi-yah!
- I'll get the radish.
Yah!
Chop it fine, son. Chop it fine!
- Carrot!
- Mushrooms!
- Ginger!
- Leeks!
- Garlic!
- Soy sauce!
- Beets!
- No beets.
But I like beets.
One final ingredient.
Noodles!
One noodle soup!
So delicious!
- Dad, this dream is awesome!
- It's the noodle dream.
Tai Lung?
I thought you were dead...
Wait! Please, don't eat my son!
- Have some delicious noodle soup.
- So delicious!
Don't worry, Dad.
I got it under control!
No!
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?
- We're cooking together!
- Sorry, Dad.
Evil doesn't take a holiday... and neither do I.
Goodbye, Dad.
Po, don't go!
Don't go, my son!
You can't leave me alone!
I need you!
Po!
Dad, where'd they go?
What'd they look like?
Oh, I was dreaming.
It was awful!
We were cooking, but then you left me.
Now, how could you leave me?
Dad, it was just a dream.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
Now, come on down.
I got all the decorations out.
Thank you, Po.
You are such a good son.
You owe me 17 yuan for the new door.
Whoa, right on top!
It's the sun lantern I made when I was a cub.
You know why it was on top, Po?
Because I opened the box this summer just to look at it.
I love Winter Festival so much, sometimes I just can't wait.
- Me, too. The decorations...
- The party games!
The dancing. Huh, Dad? The dancing!
Noodles...
Good morning, Dragon Warrior.
I was just practicing my...
...Empty Belly Defense.
Mr. Ping, may I borrow Po for a moment?
Well, actually, we're very busy decorating for the...
I've come to talk to you about the
Winter Feast at the Jade Palace.
- You will be...
- Be coming?!
The Winter Feast with the Kung Fu
Masters from all the provinces?!
No, Po, you will not be invited.
You will be hosting.
Me? Hosting?
Wonderful news, is it not?
As the Dragon Warrior, this is one of your most critical duties.
Wow! Thank you, Shifu.
Po, this is a big opportunity for you.
Your first time with all the Kung Fu Masters.
The Winter Feast is legendary!
I'll bet you got the best, biggest, brightest sun lanterns and dancing.
Po. Stop. Stop.
This is the Winter Feast.
It is perfection.
Always elegant.
Always formal.
Awesome. Awesome. I'm all about elegant. Fancy stuff and fine dinin'.
You have some noodle in your neck fat.
What I'm saying, Po, is dancing and sun lanterns, those are common traditions.
So common. I mean, dancing?
Come on!
Sun lanterns?
Weak. Dad! Isn't this great?
Dragon Warrior!
Please, come quickly!
- There are bandits at the bridge!
- What?
I'm on it. See ya, Dad!
Thanks again, Master Shifu!
Mr. Ping.
Hey, guys!
You excited about the Winter Feast?
Guess what? Master Shifu just told me
I'll be joining you this year.
The Feast is intense!
All the Masters at one table!
One perfect feast.
It's an honor to be invited.
Actually, I'm not just invited.
I'm hosting!
- What?
- Wouldn't be my choice.
- What?
- The Feast at the palace is very...
...elegant.
It's a very sophisticated event.
Why does everyone think
I can't do sophisticated?
I... have no idea.
It's just that we think maybe you could use a little help.
Tigress, I got this.
It's a dinner.
Eating, entertainment.
How much do you have to know?
There are 18 gestures you must memorize for the right hand.
Nineteen for the left.
Nineteen for the right,
19, 18 for the left.
This is Feng, the palace artist.
He will do your official portrait.
Pleased to... What?
OK, I'm gonna need a do-over. I think I was blinking.
This is where you will seat all of the Kung Fu Masters.
Oh, my dad's gonna love this feast.
You know, he's never even been to the palace?
I am sorry, Po.
There are no guests allowed.
I can't bring my dad?
But he's my dad. We always spend the holiday together.
I understand, Po.
I remember the day
I departed my family and committed myself entirely to the duties of kung fu.
You are the Dragon Warrior now, and therefore this is your duty above all other bonds.
Now... in your quest for perfection, these instructions must be executed to the letter.
Guard these scrolls containing the ancient recipes.
Flaked jasmine. Never ground...
...elegant... traditional greeting of the Masters...
- ...magnificent Golden Ladle!
- What?
Po. Hire a chef. Present them with the Golden Ladle.
Do you have any questions?
- Nuh-uh!
- Po, do not let me down.
Don't worry, Master Shifu,
I got everything under control...
What?
Master Po. We have brought you the finest chefs in China.
You'll sample their dishes and make your choice.
Yeah.
The chef you select will receive the Golden Ladle.
- Let us begin.
- Alrighty!
Master Po...
I present Chef Wo Hop of the Heilongjiang Province.
Sir, it is a privilege for me and the citizens of my village
- to be considered for this great honor.
- Hi, Po!
Hey!
- What just happened?
- Well... as host of the festival, every gesture of yours has meaning.
You just gave him the ancient
Hun Shu Wave of Dismissal.
The what? Is that a thing?
That doesn't even sound like a thing!
He has brought great dishonor upon himself and his village, and they will be shamed for all of eternity.
No, no! I was just waving to Monkey!
Can't we just get the rabbit back?
Oh, you're serious? No.
I'll... I'll get the other chefs.
Wow, this feast is intense. Right?
And I just found out that I can't be with my dad.
Wait a minute. Of course!
You're absolutely right.
I'll choose my dad! Then I'll get to spend the holiday with him.
Brilliant! You are good.
Come here, you.
OK... I've gotta get rid of these guys.
Hate the food. Hate the food.
Oh, this...
...isn't really what we're looking for.
Nope.
No. No... No. No.
This isn't really your year.
No. Nope. Nuh-uh.
Nah. No. Nah.
Ew. Sorry.
That one really is bad.
No. No. None of these will do.
I'll take that. Thank you.
Nice try, everyone.
See you next year!
- Awful.
- Master Po? We haven't picked a chef.
The Golden Ladle!
- Yeah.
- I'm holding it.
- Yeah.
- To be asked to prepare a meal for all the great Kung Fu Masters!
What an extraordinary honor!
When is it?
- Tomorrow night.
- Oh, that won't work.
- What? Why?
- Po, that's the holiday!
- Exactly!
- Well, I cannot leave the restaurant.
- Why not?
- What about our friends?
What about those lonely people who have no place else to go?
We give them a place to call home.
There's always room for one more at Mr. Ping's.
OK, Dad, I appreciate that you care for all the lonely people.
- And lonely people pay extra.
- But, Dad, I need you.
The Feast is tomorrow. I just fired all the best chefs in the land.
The best chefs in the land, huh? Really?
You think your fancy palace ladle is better than mine?
This is not my "A" ladle.
Dad, look.
I didn't mean that.
It's just I thought this was a way for us to be together on the holiday.
- I want us to be together.
- But I can't be here!
I have responsibilities to Shifu!
So be there with Shifu.
Don't you see my beak smiling with happiness for you?
No, no, no. Come on, Dad!
Don't make me feel guilty about this.
What... What do you expect me to do?
I expect you to do the right thing, Po.
Here, son. You should have this on the holiday.
How could my dad say no?
"I would rather you stay here, do my holiday thing with me."
Yeah, fine. Whatever!
Well, what about me, Dad?
Now I gotta cook all alone!
- Po?
- Shifu, hey!
All alone?
You do not have a chef yet?
No, no, of course I have a chef.
You kidding?
No chef...
That would be a disaster.
I gotta get a chef.
- Pardon me?
- Bunny! Awesome, a real chef.
Listen, I know we got off to kind of a rocky start, what with me shaming you and your village for all eternity and whatnot.
But if you could start dicing those carrots...
I am not here to dice carrots.
- I am here to fight you.
- Huh?
The only way I can lift the veil of shame is to fight the Dragon Warrior.
Surely I will die, but it will restore my honor!
What are you doing?
Come on! I don't wanna hurt you.
Look, Bunny,
I get this whole honor thing.
But this isn't kung fu.
You're biting me. Ha! Look,
Bunny, I have enough on my plate between cooking and my dad guilting me. Get off...
What is it with parents and the holidays?
Sometimes they love us too much.
But, it is not my place to say.
It is my place to die.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- OK.
- How dare you!
- There you go.
- Let me out of here!
Po, the table is not set.
- Have you started cooking?
- We've all had our fittings.
- Are you ready?
- I'm on it!
Oh, sorry. Ow!
Wha...? Tap, tap, tap.
Of course he's never here when you need him.
Po? The vocalist for the band quit.
I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.
Let's just go instrumental.
This is an embarrassment.
Po?
Ha-ha!
Ow! Bunny!
Sorry! Ow!
Hi. We'd like two noodle...
We're not open yet!
This is not right.
Whoa!
This is a total disaster.
Now I'm gonna disappoint everyone.
My dad, the Furious Five, Shifu.
And me. I'm not dead yet.
What kind of Dragon Warrior am I if I can't even pull off a dinner?
I guess kung fu can't solve everything.
That's it!
Bunny, you're brilliant!
Mantis! Crane! Monkey!
This may be our greatest challenge ever.
- Bandits?
- Raiders?
No. Place settings.
Tigress! The Tahlia Leap!
- On it.
- Viper! Stars of Destiny!
Yeah!
Mantis! Pinwheel Attack!
Oh, yeah!
You guys are the best.
And you, Bunny... if you even want me to think about your "death with honor," you're gonna have to help me in the kitchen. Let's go!
Twenty-nine place settings, 40 chopsticks each. We did it! We did it!
Every detail just right.
- Even down to the ground jasmine.
- Ground jasmine?!
It was supposed to be flaked!
I'll be right back.
Hurry! The Masters are arriving!
I promised Shifu it would be perf...
- Happy Feast!
- Yeah, same to you!
Whoa, hey. Look out. Dragon
Warrior comin' through!
Ok, hurry, Po, hurry, Po.
- You made it.
- Of course! I'd never miss it.
- It looks so yummy!
- Eat up.
Here you go!
Thanks, Daddy.
Beautiful. Elegant.
Perfect.
You've made me proud.
All 29 Kung Fu
Schools and their Masters.
Excellent. Excellent.
Po!
Dragon Warrior, would you honor us by reciting the opening words to the Creed of the Masters?
- Po?
- I can't, Master Shifu.
I thought you might forget the words, Po, so I took the liberty of writing them on your napkin.
Let me ju...
That's not it.
No, no, everyone, please.
OK. Please don't...
You don't have to...
OK, well, they're off.
Anyway... let me just say something.
The Creed of the Masters is amazing.
It's, like, the coolest creed ever.
And... you Masters... how cool are you guys?
I don't even have to tell you.
Master Rhino? Forget about it!
You're more awesomely skilled and...
...you know, wrinkly than
I'd ever dreamed you'd be.
And Master Sheep?
Fluffy and incredible.
- It's true.
- The Five?
It's just such an honor to be here with all you guys.
My heroes.
But every Feast, my dad and I spend all day cooking together.
And the whole neighborhood shows up.
And it gets really loud and crazy, and my Uncle Yang ends up laughing so hard, noodles spurt out his nose.
- I'd like to see that.
- Me, too.
So... I wish I could stay and be a good host, but I think I need to leave and...
- ...be a good son.
- What... What's going on?
- What are we supposed to...?
- Po! Come back here!
I used to love cooking with my sisters.
- The folk dances.
- The games. The music.
Whoa, wait.
What about our traditions?
Who will recite the Creed?
Somebody do something!
- Whoa...
- I got that, Dad.
Po?
You came!
Oh, Po, I'm sorry
I made you feel so guilty.
Nah, don't be. That's what the holidays are all about.
Now, don't we have some cookin' to do?
- It needs...
- Garlic.
Table for five?
Hey, Po!
- You guys! Welcome!
- Happy holiday, Po.
- The more, the merrier!
- Thank you, Mr. Ping.
The little one pays full price but eats like a child.
Welcome!
Master Rhino, come sit with me!
Master Wo Hop.
I believe this belongs to you.
The Golden Ladle?
Thank you, Dragon Warrior.
Now, I have restored my honor and the honor of my village!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy... it's Uncle Yang!
Oh, Po, why did you ruin something that was perfect?
I don't understand.
Come back here! I got ya!
Then, the Crocodile
Thief pounced!
Peek-a-boo!
I'm gonna get you.
- Oh, Po?
- I got you, Dad.
This is perfect.
There's always room for one more at Mr. Ping's.
Oh, no. I really don't want to disturb anyone.
You go and enjoy your party.
I'm not gonna enjoy it without you.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
These are your people.
- This is your family.
- You're my family, too, Shifu.
Now, come on.
That soup does smell delicious.
Po, wait.
What goes on in your head I really don't always understand.
But what goes on in your heart will never let us down.
Thanks, Shifu. Come on.
Hey, guys, look who's here!
- Master Shifu's here!
- It's good to see you, Master Shifu!
And it's good to be here, Mr. Ping.
Sit, sit, sit, sit!
Thanks for comin', everyone!
Watch out, little one...
I'm hosting the Feast
Toasting the Feast
I'm going to be doing the Feast
Servin' it up
Right in your cup
Makin' a Feast to remember!
I've never hosted hosted a Feast before
That won't stop me from serving some boar
Fried boar!
On-the-side boar
Yeah.
WINNIE THE POOH (2011)
[whistling]
[Winnie the Pooh theme song]
[male narrator] This could be the room of any small boy.
But, in fact, it's not.
It is the room of one young boy in particular named Christopher Robin.
Now, Christopher Robin has a very active imagination,
not to mention the uncanny ability to collect things.
Big things. Small things.
Sticky things.
But his favourite things are his stuffed animals.
Ah! There they are now.
A charming and eccentric cast of characters.
And his best friend among them is a bear named Winnie the Pooh.
Or Pooh for short.
Together they had many unusual adventures,
that all happened right here in the Hundred Acre Wood.
# Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood
# Where Christopher Robin plays
# You'll find the enchanted neighbourhood
# Of Christopher's childhood days
# A donkey named Eeyore is his friend
# And Kanga and little Roo and Tigger, too
# There's Rabbit and Piglet and there's Owl
# But most of all Winnie the Pooh
# Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff
# He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Willy-nilly silly old bear
# Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff
# He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Willy-nilly silly old bear #
[narrator] Chapter one,
in which Winnie the Pooh has a very important thing to do.
As the sun rose over the Hundred Acre Wood,
Pooh leapt out of bed and greeted the day with much enthusiasm.
[snoring] Ooh...
- Honey.
- [narrator] Uh, Pooh?
[stammers] More honey, please.
[humming]
I say, Pooh?
- [continues snoring]
- [clears throat] Pooh?
Oh, do wake up.
- Pooh!
- [Pooh] Oh!
Oh, bother. I was having the most wonderful dream.
Yes, but it's time to wake up.
You have a very important thing to do today.
- Like what?
- [chuckles] Well, if I told you that,
I'd ruin the rest of the story, wouldn't I?
- [tummy rumbles]
- [giggles]
Of course.
What could be more important than a little something to eat?
Or perhaps a little larger something.
Oh, not to worry, tummy.
I always know what to do.
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
# He fills it with things that are sweet
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
- # By never forgetting to eat
- [tummy rumbles in tune]
# When it is growly and glummy a search for the honey is on
# The Pooh has a knack for finding a snack
# Unless all the honey is...
Gone?
[tummy rumbling in tune]
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
# No need for the tummy to fret
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
# He knows what his tummy must get
# Don't worry, my round little chummy
# I'm hearing your ravenous plea
# When there is no honey the Pooh takes the tummy
# Wherever the honey will be
# My friends are out there with honey to spare
# And they will take care of my tummy and me #
- Bother.
- [Eeyore groans]
[gasps] I know that sigh.
Good morning, Eeyore.
Lovely day, isn't it?
Wish I could say yes, but I can't.
Oh my, Eeyore.
You wouldn't happen to have any honey lying about, would you?
- You see, I seem to have run out.
- [tummy continues to rumble]
Oh, yes. Good idea, tummy.
Perhaps I should look in back.
Bother. No honey in here, either.
What?
Eeyore, what has happened to your tail?
- What has happened to it?
- Well...
...it isn't there.
That accounts for a good deal.
That explains everything.
No wonder.
[sighs]
Oh! There it is.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
The very tree where I was hatched.
I remember the day
Mother made these marks, her giant meaty claw carving furrows in the crumbly bark.
Chapter one, the birth of a genius.
Pardon me, Owl.
What are you doing?
Hmm? Oh, hello, Pooh. Eeyore.
Why, I'm penning my personal memoirs.
[chuckling] Yes. Now, where was I?
Oh, yes, of course.
With steely nerve...
Perhaps you could take a short break from your important work and help us find Eeyore's tail?
...and I rocketed towards Eeyore's tail!
Eeyore's tail?
What's wrong with Eeyore's tail?
Well, it isn't there.
Yes. So I see.
Won't you help us, Owl?
You have such a talent for speaking and telling us what to do.
Oh, thank you, Pooh. Yes, I do, don't I?
I didn't think anyone noticed.
All right, take this.
Write this down carefully.
Now, the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.
[Pooh, interrupting Owl]
Excuse me, Owl, but what does
"Crustimoney Proseedcake" mean?
For I am a bear of very little brain and long words bother me.
It means "the thing to do."
Oh. Well, as long as it means that,
I don't mind.
- [sighs]
- [coughs]
All right. Yes, well, the thing to do is as follows:
First, issue a reward to the...
- [Pooh] Gesundheit.
- I beg your pardon?
Well, you sneezed just as you were going to tell me what the first thing to do was.
I didn't sneeze.
No, you did, Owl.
No, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it.
Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed.
As I was saying,
- first, issue a reward.
- [Pooh whispers] He's doing it again.
You must be catching a cold.
I'll probably catch it, too.
No, no, no!
I'm not catching a cold.
The word is "issue," not "achoo", and "achoo" isn't even a word.
It's just a sort of sneezy sound like achoo!
[Pooh] Perhaps you should lie down, Owl?
- Oh!
- My throat feels a little scratchy.
Open wide, please.
Ahh.
Just as I suspected.
Owl, we need honey.
Enough of this infernal folderol!
Look, the thing to do is, we write a notice promising a large something to anyone who finds a replacement tail for Eeyore!
Is that clear?
That sounds like a wonderful plan, Owl.
Excellent. Now, we shall get Christopher
Robin to write out the notices, and we'll put them up all over the forest.
Here you are, Pooh.
Oh, and make sure everyone can see them.
Oh, I will, Christopher.
# Come one, come two, come all
Everyone heed the call
# There's a very important thing to do
# Drop what you're doing and come
# Bumpity-bumpity-bum
# There's a very important thing to do
# It's time to gather 'round
The work has just begun
# And when it's done then you'll have found
# That you have had some fun
# With a monumentuous, consequentuous
# Very important thing to do #
[grunts]
There we are.
And now, I shall return to...
Oh!
Hello, B'loon.
We have a very important thing to do today.
- Oh, yes.
- [low growling]
Perhaps you'd like to join us?
- Poor Eeyore. He's lost his tail.
- [shouting]
Consider yourself pounced.
That was a close call there, Pooh Bear.
This guy... and I'm talking to you...
...he was sneaking up on ya.
Whoo! Oh!
A slippery little devil, eh?
Get back here!
Oh, no, you don't. Come here.
Whoo!
Well, I must have scared him off.
Um... Tigger?
Yes, my good man?
[stammers]
Why, you.
Here, take some of that!
What is this?
Oh, really? Sticking to me now.
[shouts]
This isn't working out the way
I was hoping. Make him go away.
Oh, dear.
[sobs] Get him off of me!
Is he still there?
Oh, yes. He's still here.
And I think he wants to stick with you.
What?
I never thought of having a sidekick before.
I got to admit, he is a handsome devil.
Look at the chin on this kid.
No, no. I can't do it, I tell you.
It's too risky.
Why, if something were to happen to this little guy,
I just couldn't live with myself.
It's a dangerous path I bounce.
But I bounce it alone.
Because the Hundred Acre Wood needs a hero, Pooh Bear, and I'm the only one.
# Oh, I'm bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
# Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
# But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is
# I'm the only one
I'm the only one! #
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[chattering]
Attention, please. Attention.
Something tragic has befallen a member of our community.
- [all gasp]
- I present to you: Exhibit A.
Oh! That is tragic.
What? Oh, no, no, no.
Eeyore, will you turn around, please?
Oops, sorry.
Our dear friend Eeyore has lost his tail.
Oh, dear.
We mustn't leave him in this condition.
So, we will have a contest to find a new tail for Eeyore.
[clears throat] I do say, Christopher
Robin, the winners of such contest are traditionally awarded some form of remuneration.
What is a "remooner"...
Moonyour... A renew...
What are we renumbering?
I don't know, Pooh, but it sounds like a good thing.
Oh, yes, it is a good thing, Piglet.
It's a prize. But what shall it be?
How about something great, like a firecracker!
Oh, gracious, no.
How about something nice, like a warm hug?
Pruning shears.
I need pruning shears.
I'd say thistles, but nobody listens to me, anyway.
Oh, Christopher Robin, I was hoping for something a bit... sweeter?
Why, Pooh, that's a grand idea.
The prize for a new tail shall be... a pot of honey.
[all cheer] Hooray!
[narrator] As the others searched for a tail,
Pooh realized that a pine cone would not win him the honey.
Why not?
Because it would have to be something special.
Oh. Special, you say. Special.
Think, think, think.
No hurry, Pooh.
Just take your time.
Take my time.
What a wonderful idea.
Cuckoo, cuckoo.
- Thanks, Pooh.
- Congratulations.
You've won the contest.
# It's Pooh
# It's Pooh
Pooh wins the honey pot
# Found a tail for his friend
# Now it's on my rear end
# You get the honey
Enjoy #
[crashing]
I knew it was too good to be true.
Oh, dear.
Well, rules are rules.
So sorry, Pooh.
Excuse me.
We could give B'loon a try!
- Whoa! [giggles]
- How clever, Piglet.
What do you think, Eeyore?
Sure is a cheerful colour.
Guess I'll have to get used to it.
# It's Piglet
It's Piglet
# Piglet wins the honey pot
# Takes the prize fair and square
I'm still a bit up in the air.
# You get the honey
Enjoy #
Hmm. This may not work after all.
[sighs]
[narrator] And so they tried a great many things.
They tried...
...and they tried...
...and they tried...
...and they tried, and they tried and tried, and they tried...
...until...
[accordion makes sombre music]
...they had run out of things to try.
It's OK.
I'll learn to live without it.
Poor dear.
You know, I may have just the thing.
Up, up, up you go.
[humming]
There you are.
It's an awful nice tail, Kanga.
Much nicer than the rest of me.
# It's Kanga
No! No, no, no, no.
How about we celebrate with silence?
# Enjoy #
Oh, bother.
My tummy is feeling a little 11 o'clock-ish.
Do you still tell the time, clock friend?
I can't tell by the expression on your face.
[narrator] Pooh left feeling unsatisfied and a little out of sorts.
In fact, he was so distracted by his rumbly tummy,
that he didn't notice that he was walking onto the next paragraph.
What is a paragraph?
It's a group of sentences that form a complete thought.
Is there honey in this paragraph?
Oh, sorry, Pooh, no.
Well, then I don't find it very useful.
What's that, Pooh?
I'm not sure. I shall follow it to see where it leads.
Eeyore, your tail!
Yep. Unravelled.
Guess I'm back where I started.
[Pooh] I'm sorry, Eeyore.
Such a nice tail, too.
No matter.
All good things come to an end.
Oh. Oh! Eeyore, if you...
[grunting]
Oh, my goodness.
This story is going too fast!
[grunts, sighs]
I wish that paragraph had been a little longer.
Ooh! Of course.
Christopher Robin will have some honey.
He loves to share.
Especially with me.
[humming] Christopher Robin!
Are you not there?
[tummy rumbles]
Oh.
[narrator] Just then,
Pooh spotted a note.
- I did?
- Certainly.
Just there, at your feet.
- Oh...
- Uh, to your left.
Uh, no, Pooh, your other left.
A little bit more.
A tad. A hair.
No, no, back a bit.
- Oh!
- There you are.
Well, it's a good thing I noticed it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it.
Pooh was puzzled by the note.
Even more so than usual.
And even more than that.
So, Pooh decided to go directly to Owl's house,
hoping that Owl could help unpuzzle him.
# You get the honey
Enjoy #
- Good job, Owl!
- Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, it is quite clever, isn't it?
T-A-E-L. Yes. Perfect.
Well, hello there, Owl.
That is a very fine looking pot of honey you've got there.
And so remarkably... gooey.
Gooey? That happens to be my personal favourite.
Ooh! What do you have there, my boy?
Oh. A note I found at Christopher Robin's.
With strange words I cannot read.
But, Pooh, you can't read most words.
Yes, but especially not the strange ones.
Let me see. There's never been a note written that I could not decipher.
Here, Pooh, help yourself.
- Yes, parchment is of a fine quality.
- [grunting]
Oh, stuff and fluff.
Don't leave us in suspense, Owl.
What does it say?
Patience! Patience.
One must be careful when decoding such arcane text so as not to incorrectly interpret its true meaning.
So, can you read it?
Of course I can! It says...
"Gone out. Busy. Backson.
Signed, Christopher Robin."
[gasps] Our dear friend
Christopher Robin has been captured!
- What?
- By a creature called "The Backson."
- [all gasp]
- Backson!
Captured by the Backson!
- What's a Backson?
- Ooh!
A horrible creature! Malicious!
- You don't say.
- Ferocious!
Fero?! Ooh!
And worst of all, terribly busy.
So, what does this Backson look like?
I saw a picture of one just the other day.
- Oh, Christopher Robin.
- [Owl] Now, let me see.
Bathwater, biscuit, baby, barnacle, beluga...
Wait a minute, why is biscuit ahead of baby and barnacle?
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, it's such a mess in here.
Dash it all!
Where is that picture?
I have some chalk, Owl.
Can you draw it?
What an excellent idea, young man.
Artistic talent runs through my family.
- In fact, it practically stampedes!
- [chalk screeches]
- [both groan]
- [whimpering]
He sounds scary already.
# It's a giant creature with a tail
# Here, I'll draw Piglet in for scale
- [growls]
- Oh, dear!
[Owl]
#Its hide is like a shaggy rug
# Its face a surly, ugly mug
# With two sharp horns atop its head
# Between a mop of hair that's red
# And in its nose a ring of gold
It smells of monkey's feet and mould
- [monkey shrieks]
- # Its toes are black, its fur is blue
# I swear that all I tell you is not made up
- # The Backson
- # The Backson?
- # The Backson
- # The Backson?
# Oh, no!
# But, Owl, what does a Backson do?
# Yes, Owl, what does a Backson do?
# Hmm, what does a Backson do?
# I'm thinking, I'm thinking,
I'm thinking, I'm thinking
# And now I will tell you
# They sneak into your library and scribble in all your books
# The Backson, the Backson
We don't like the Backson
# When decorating your Christmas tree they tangle up all the hooks
[all] # The Backson, the Backson
We're afraid of the Backson
# They spoil the milk
They stop all the clocks
# They use their horns to put holes in your socks
# The Backson's the one who's been putting holes in our socks
# Tell us more about what Backsons do
- # Yes, more about what Backsons do
- # More about what Backsons do?
# Why don't we hear some thoughts from you?
[Tigger] # Maybe they make you sleep too late
[Owl] # Yes, yes
That's good, that's great
# I bet they're the reason my tail is gone
[Owl] # You're on a roll
Go on, go on
[Rabbit]
# They muddy up your tidy house
# They make you feel as small as a mouse
- # They break your crayons
- # They spill your tea
[Kanga] # They wake up babies at one and three
# They made me catch the cold I caught
[Pooh] # They made me lose my train of thought
- [Tigger] # They swipe your stripes
- # They clog your pipes
- [Rabbit] # They dig up your garden
- # They won't beg your pardon
- [Pooh] # They eat your snacks
- # They won't relax
- [Rabbit] # They chip your tooth
- [Kanga] # They steal your youth
[Owl] # And now you know the horrible truth
[all] The Backson, the Backson
The Backson, the Backson
# Oh, no
- # Oh, yes
- [all] Huh?
# I know exactly what to do
# We'll find things Backsons are partial to
- # Like books
- # And dishes
- # And socks
- # And toys
# Yes, everything that a Backson destroys
# Then we'll dig an enormous pit and make the items lead to it
# He'll fall in and we'll get our friend
# And this horrible nightmare can come to an end
- # The Backson
- # The Backson
- # The Backson
- # The Backson
# Go home and search your closets
Bring everything that you can
# The Backson, the Backson
We're gonna catch the Backson
# We'll save Christopher Robin by following Rabbit's plan
# The Backson, the Backson
We'll save Christopher Robin
# We must be brave and have no fear
# So to the death, we'll persevere
# We'll search by the sun and the light of the moon
# And if everything goes well we'll be back soon
- Back soon.
- # Back soon
Sounds like "Backson."
# Back soon #
Oh, well. Good luck, everyone!
[narrator] While Rabbit and the others
were busy gathering the Backson's favourite things,
Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place to dig the pit.
- Piglet dug, and dug, and dug.
- [grunting]
And Pooh supervised.
And now to disguise the pit.
Catch, Piglet.
Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.
Oh, it will, Piglet.
The Backson shall follow the trail of items right to this lovely picnic.
[whispering] Which is just the pit, of course.
And when he falls in, we'll get Christopher Robin back.
Yes, Piglet. We shall get
Christopher Robin back.
Very exciting. [giggles]
What do you think, Pooh?
Hmm. I think this rock would be better over there.
Here?
Oh, yes. That makes all the difference, you see.
Oh! I almost forgot the most important part.
Oh, yes, Piglet.
I couldn't agree more.
Hmm?
Oh, Piglet, this is a very light lunch.
No, Pooh. This isn't lunch.
I just thought it would complete the disguise.
Well, it certainly fooled me.
[whimpers]
Well done, you two.
Now, put your combat gear on.
This is a dangerous mission, and we cannot afford any mistakes.
The fate of Christopher Robin is in our hands.
[grunting]
[whimpers]
Ah!
[slicing sounds]
[groans]
[narrator] As the group continued on with Rabbit's plan,
they journeyed deeper and deeper into the woods,
- placing items as they...
- [Tigger] Hey, hey!
You want to keep it down up there, pal?
What? Tigger?
Why aren't you with the others?
Because. I'm busy tracking the Backson.
Shh-shh-shh.
Yes, but what about Rabbit's plan?
Only a Tigger can catch a Backson.
[whispers] And I'm the only Tigger, see.
- [groans]
- [gasps] Hello.
[shouts]
- Hoo!
- I probably deserved that.
Oops! Look who it is! Hoo-hoo!
Let me get off your back.
There we go.
I thought you were the Backson!
Until I found out you wasn't.
What are you doing out here, anyways?
Too slow. Got left behind.
Left behind?
That's a horrendemous thing to do to a guy.
No matter.
Sure would like to help
Christopher Robin,
- but I can't.
- Hmm.
Buddy! Where do you think you're going?
You and me are gonna catch that Backson together!
- Thanks, but I...
- That's the spirit!
Here we go!
- Pouncy, pouncy, pounce!
- [groans]
You and me! Oh, yeah!
Look out, Backson!
OK, we're back.
Look at us pounce!
I'm alone. OK. Hoo.
Buddy, if you're gonna pounce, you got to have some bounce!
We just need to get you Tiggerized.
# Gonna fix you up
By the time we're through
# I'll be Tigger One
You'll be Tigger Two
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# Gonna be two pals hunting in the woods
# Gonna show that Backson we got the goods
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
- # Well, I'm not sure
- # Oh, stop that gloomy rumination
# All you need is a little bit of Tiggerization
- # Wait
- # Why wait?
# Don't you see it's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
You're looking great, Tigger Two.
Now, you've got to learn to bounce like a Tigger.
# When you learn to bounce you should take it slow
# So I want you to keep your bounces low
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
Whoa!
# If you hit a bush or a tree you'll fall so do your best to avoid them all
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# A perfect pounce will make you feel alive
# Just go from a squat into a headlong dive!
Ow, ow, ow.
# You're gettin' it now
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
Ahh. Isn't this super-duper fun, two Tiggers here together?
# I used to be the only one
But two is twice as better.
- Are you ready?
- For what?
I'll... be... the...
# Backson, you be the Tigger
# We're gonna see whose bounce is bigger
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# You're gonna give me your best attack
# But don't just think that I won't fight back
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# Strike me down
Give me all you got
# Bounce me, trounce me
Flounce me, pounce me
- # Do it, do it, do it!
- Ow.
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be...
[shouting]
# Great #
Tigger Two!
That was the bestest picking up bounce I never seen!
In fact, we're going to skip right ahead to advanced Tigger training.
Where did you go, you little bouncer?
Ooh. Going bare-knuckled.
Look at this guy.
I like your style!
Now this is just ridicerous!
You are gonna need this if you're gonna get the Backson!
Oh-oh!
Backson tracks!
The Backson must have got Tigger Two!
He's picking us off. One by one.
Gosh, Pooh, I hope the Backson is pleased with all of our items.
- I'm sure he will be. Oh.
- [tummy rumbles]
I wish I had some honey.
- [bee buzzing]
- [gasps]
Piglet, um, could you come here, please?
Pooh, are you sure this is going to work?
Well, of course, Piglet.
Once I get you up in the tree, just hand me the beehive.
And then tummy and I will take care of the rest, won't we?
OK, Pooh.
I guess you've thought this through.
Oh, yes, Piglet. Indeed I have.
[Piglet grunts]
Oh, bother. I don't remember thinking that through.
[Piglet] Um, I'm sorry
I messed up the plan, Pooh.
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.
I shall get you out, and we'll try again.
[grunts] It's no use.
Think, think, think.
Ah! I know.
I'll have you down in just a moment, Piglet.
[Piglet] No hurry, Pooh.
The bees are quite gentle.
[giggles]
As long as there's no sudden movement.
Ah! Oh, my!
Pooh, are you sure that's a good idea?
Oh, yes, Piglet.
- Ah!
- I'm quite sure.
Well, you know best, Pooh.
- Ah! Oh.
- Oh. There we are.
Oops. New plan, Piglet. Run!
[Piglet] OK.
[grunting]
Oh... Is this fast enough, Pooh?
I suppose you could run a little faster.
- [Piglet] Whoa!
- Ooh!
And this can go here. All done.
It takes a smart rabbit to trap a Back...
Oh! What are you two doing?
Beehives are not on my list of Backson-friendly items!
- But, Rabbit, the...
- Move along, move along.
Well, I was moving.
Oh, that Backson is sure to pick up this trail, and we don't want to be around when he does.
Come, come! Go, go, go!
Rabbit, please, can we stop for lunch?
Pooh, we cannot rest until
Christopher Robin is rescued.
Try thinking of him instead of honey.
- [rumbling]
- Very well. Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin!
Ooh. It worked. Much better.
[humming]
[gasps]
Does anybody see that?
See what, honey?
- Honey? Ooh!
- [rumbling]
I can't wait to see the honey on that Backson's honey when he falls into our honey.
Eh, Owl?
That cheeky honey will honey twice before honeying our honey again.
After we honey the honey, can I honey a honey?
Uh-uh-uh.
No honey before honey, honey.
Wha?
Honey up, Pooh.
We have to honey.
- [Owl] Honey.
- [Rabbit] Ooh, honey!
- [Kanga] Yes.
- [Rabbit] Honey.
[narrator] As Pooh watched the honey honey away,
his honey honey honey honey
honey honey honey honey honey honey honey...
Ooh, Christopher Robin,
Christopher Robin,
Christopher... hoo-hoo-hoo,
Christopher Robin.
# Honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey,
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey? Honey.
Honey!
Honey!
# Everything is honey everywhere I see
# Everything is honey and that's quite all right with me
# I am a bear of little brain
I can't explain
# Why everything would be changing to
# The favourite snack of Winnie the Pooh
Can you?
# Everything is honey
I can't get enough
# Of lots and lots of pots and pots of sticky, licky stuff
# Oh, what a sight
Oh, what a dream
# Dive in the wonderful honeyful stream
# Swimming in the honey
Swimming far and wide
# Open up my mouth and let the honey flow inside
# Ooey and gooey and very sweet
Eat and eat then repeat
# Suddenly I'm in a honey boat
# It doesn't matter where we float
Whoa!
# 'Cause everywhere is honey
There's a honey Pooh
# He's just made of honey so I guess I'll eat him too
# If everything is honey and I am what I eat
# I must be made of honey
# And life is very sweet #
[groans]
Bother.
[gasping]
What a lovely picnic!
[shouts]
Oh, bother!
Double bother.
Pooh! Now where did that bear go?
We searched all over, and no sign of him.
The report from my aerial excursion is inconclusive.
- [Pooh moaning]
- [clanking]
[all shout]
[gasps] The plan worked.
We caught the Backson!
- [Pooh continues moaning]
- Oh! It sounds horrible!
Now that we have him, Owl, you can go and get Christopher Robin back.
No! No, I'm far too important to put myself in that predicament.
Kanga, off you go.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm with child.
Send the pig.
[stammering]
- How about all of us go?
- [Pooh groans]
All right, Backson.
Give Christopher Robin back!
- Huh?
- [Pooh] Oh!
Oh, bother!
- Pooh!
- Oh, hello.
Oh, Pooh, you went back for the honey, didn't you?
But I told you it was empty.
Yes, and I believed you, Piglet.
But my tummy had to see for himself.
[scoffs] Poor, poor Pooh.
How are we ever gonna get him out of there?
# It's me, it's me
# I win the honey pot
# Found this anchor over there
# Now it's on my derrière
# Not that anybody'd care #
[Rabbit] OK, everyone, make sure you have a good hold.
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Something tells me I was better off with Tigger.
Heave-ho!
- Yep.
- [all shout]
[whistling fall]
[all grunt]
Oh, this is lovely.
We are stuck down here, and the Backson is still up there.
[whimpering] Oh, dear! Wait for me.
No, Piglet! No, no, Piglet. Stay.
But the Backson!
You can help us if you stay up there!
[straining]
OK, Piglet, go look for something to get us out of here.
[stammering] OK.
There might be something over by the pack.
Thank goodness one of us is up there.
I was worried we'd be stuck here forever.
I found something. Here.
- What?
- Ooh.
That's a lovely flower, Piglet.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
Yes, Piglet, it's very nice, a perennial.
But I think we need something longer.
Longer? Of course.
How silly of me.
[grunting]
Oh, good thought, Piglet.
But you can't possibly think that that's long enough.
Oh, yes, it is.
Owl read this to me once, and it was certainly the longest thing
I'd ever heard.
[giggles] Oh.
It's true, Rabbit.
It lags a bit in the middle.
Of all things, why didn't we think to bring a rope?
Well, there is this rope.
Spot-on, Piglet. Do be a helpful little swine and get us out of here.
All of you?
Yes, Piglet, all of us.
All right. Three, four...
Don't forget Rabbit.
[scissors snipping]
[Piglet] And six.
There! Now you can all get out!
How very thoughtful you are, Piglet.
Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet.
Can you tie a knot?
I cannot.
So, you can knot.
No, I cannot knot.
- Not knot?
- Who's there?
- Pooh!
- Pooh who?
No! Pooh, it's...
Piglet, you'll need more than two knots.
Not possible.
Ah! So, it is possible to knot those pieces.
Not these pieces.
Yes, knot those pieces.
- Why not?
- Because it's all for naught.
Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot.
But there is something I can do.
Don't worry, Rabbit.
Piglet's very clever.
I can tie a bow.
- See?
- [groans]
For crying out loud! Piglet!
I know! Christopher Robin has a jump rope.
Ahh!
Wait a minute.
My gracious, that's it!
Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house.
Oh, I see.
Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey.
Yes, bring some honey...
[gasps] The jump rope,
Piglet, the jump rope.
With a little honey on the side.
You mean, all by myself?
Through there?
Yes, Piglet.
Through a dark wood fraught with peril, on a mission of life or death.
It is a task of great complexity, but I have full confidence that you shall return victorious, and rescue us from the abyss.
Go forth, Piglet, and we shall await your return.
For weeks, if necessary.
Owl!
What?
I can't believe how wonderful that speech was.
I can't, either.
Moved me to tears.
[narrator] So Piglet bravely ventured forth towards Christopher Robin's house.
But the further he went, the more frightened he became.
[whimpering] Oh, dear.
I mustn't fear.
There's a very important thing to...
[heavy stammer] Do...
[screams]
[whimpering]
Oh. It's just you, B'loon.
I'll get some help.
Oh, dear. I am the help.
How did you ever get stuck up there?
It wasn't the Backson, was it?
Oh, good.
I knew the Backson wasn't around here.
[grunts]
[Tigger grunts]
[moaning]
[stammering] Backson!
Huh?! Backson?
- [screaming]
- Piglet, help!
Whew.
[shouting]
Let me tell you, that was the last time
I'll ever put my beak
- in a keyhole.
- Shh-shh-shh!
[whispers] Do you hear something?
- Help! Help me!
- Piglet!
He knows my name!
[blowing hard]
- Yeah!
- [gasp]
Whoa! Oh!
[shouting]
Ah!
- [straining]
- [grunting]
[groaning]
[screams]
[Piglet groans]
[all gasp] Backson!
Whew! It's only Tigger.
Oh! Hi, fellas!
Tigger Two?
I thought the Backson got you.
Ahh. As soon as we get out of here, we're gonna show that Backson what Tiggers are made of, aren't we?
Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.
What? But what about all the pouncing and the trouncing?
And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.
The most wonderful thing about Tiggers, is you're the only one.
Aw, shucks. I'm speechless.
[Piglet] Excuse me.
- I can't breathe! [groans]
- [Tigger] Oh.
Sorry about that, little guy.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Wait! B'loon! Don't leave!
[Piglet] You're the only one who can get us out of here!
We're all gonna die.
Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.
Which leaves plenty of time for me to continue my memoirs.
Now, dear Uncle Ridley...
# Honey #
[Owl]... exacerbated by my aunt's predilection
- for only the finest parchment...
- Hmm. [gasps]
...woven so tightly the ink took weeks to fully dry.
Their nest was littered with quills that were never used, papers that were never cut, and letters that never dried.
My aunt often bemoaned the situation in letters that she couldn't write to me.
It drove my poor uncle absolutely batty, which is quite a feat for an owl,
I assure you.
Now, when my uncle had committed an exceedingly rousing point...
Empty.
...and let me tell you, it packed quite a wallop.
- [groans]
- Huh?
Look! Look, the letters!
The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!
I mean the letters...
We can get out!
[narrator] And so they all used the letter ladder to climb out of the pit.
But little did they know that coming through the bushes was...
- [branches snapping]
- [all gasp] Backson!
Back to the pit!
[Christopher] Wait, everyone.
It's only me.
[all] Christopher Robin!
You found them, B'loon. Well done.
It's Christopher Robin!
How did you escape from the Backson?
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?
He wakes up babies!
He swipes your stripes!
He puts out the lights!
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?
Your note.
[narrator] Christopher Robin explained that it had all been a misunderstanding.
And now that it was autumn, the school year had begun.
His note was simply to say he had gone out and would be back soon.
[all] Oh!
Ooh. Um...
OK.
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.
Just a moment, everyone.
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.
We owe a very special someone...
...a token of our appreciation.
Ohh!
This reward goes to a good friend and a loyal companion.
Someone who not only helped us out of this pit, but also found Christopher Robin.
And he just so happens to be wearing red today.
So it is with great, great honour and a humble heart, that I bestow this pot of honey upon our dear friend...
...B'loon.
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.
- Hooray!
- Hooray, B'loon!
- Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
- Hooray!
[narrator] Pooh watched as B'loon took the honey pot higher and higher,
until it was completely out of sight.
Oh, bother.
Sorry, Pooh.
Ever have one of those days where you just can't win, Eeyore?
Yep. I know how you feel.
- [rumbling]
- Oh, yes.
I simply must find some honey.
[narrator] As Pooh continued searching, he got hungrier...
- Oh!
- ...and hungrier...
- Yes, tummy, I know.
- ...and hungrier...
Ohh...
...until he found himself at Owl's house.
[bell jingles]
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.
Hello, Owl.
Well, congratulate me.
- For what?
- I have achieved completion of my autobiographical treatise!
Oh! Was it painful?
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.
Oh.
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep staring at that bell rope?
Because it reminds me of something.
And that reminds me of another something.
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?
A small lick, I should think.
My boy, I shall do better than that.
Not only will I beckon you to my table, but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt from chapter 127, which tells the gripping tale of how only a few days ago,
I found that very handsome bell rope that you were admiring just hanging over a thistle bush.
Thistle bush?
Or was it a gorse bush?
No. No. It was definitely a thistle bush.
Pardon me, Owl.
At first I thought someone lived there, so I rang it.
No one answered.
And then the thing just fell off in my hand.
What sort of place was this particular thistle bush in?
Certainly not a very cheery place.
One might say it was rather...
Gloomy?
Yes. That's it. Do you know it?
Oh, dear.
Nobody seemed to want it, so I brought it home.
Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl.
Really? Who?
Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore.
He was fond of it, you see.
- Fond of it?
- Attached to it.
Attached?
Ohh!
Yes. Well, yes.
And I was just keeping it safe for him.
Well, there you are.
And you can tell him he's welcome.
Yes, Owl. And thank you very much.
I say, Pooh! What about the honey?
[tummy rumbles]
Some other time, perhaps?
[narrator] Ignoring his tummy's desperate pleas,
Pooh went directly to Christopher Robin's.
Tail.
Nail.
Hammer.
So what do you think, Eeyore?
I'll test it out.
Seems about the right length.
Pink bow's a nice touch.
Swishes real good, too.
So, are you happy, Eeyore?
- No.
- Ooh.
But I sure do like this new tail.
Thank you, Pooh.
And now,
I have a surprise for you, Pooh.
I do like surprises.
[Christopher] OK. Open your eyes.
They're open, Christopher.
[Christopher] No, silly.
Put your arms down.
Congratulations, Pooh.
You win the grand prize!
# It's Pooh
It's Pooh
# Pooh wins the honey pot
# You're the winner of the prize
# I really can't believe my eyes
# Pooh gets the honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
Here you go, Pooh.
Oh, yes, of course.
- [all gasp]
- Thank you all ever so much.
# Everything is honey
Everything is good
# Everyone is happy in the Hundred Acre Wood
# A honey happy ending for a Pooh to eat
# Yes, everything is honey
# And life is very sweet #
You know, Pooh, you did a very important thing today.
- I did?
- Well, yes.
Instead of thinking of your tummy, you thought of your friend.
Oh, thank you, Christopher Robin.
And now I don't think
I shall be hungry again for a good long while.
- [tummy rumbles]
- [Pooh] Oh, bother.
[Christopher] Silly old bear.
[sighs]
[croaks]
Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
[unintelligible dialogue]
- [crickets chirring]
- [frogs croaking]
[thudding]
Wow! It's amazing what you can find in the woods.
A marble! And a boot!
And oh, my, that's a scary-lookin' fella.
Gosh! Maybe these are his things.
You know, I better pick 'em up so they won't get broken.
That's the last thing I would want.
Whoa!
- [thud]
- [grunt] Oh, my gosh!
Is this a pit?
I think I'm in a pit!
Hello? Anybody up there?
Oh, well. I sure hope that fella will be back soon.
Mom! Jethro's eating my underwear!
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy. Jethro.
Mom, before she starts, there isn't a shred of evidence
- to support her allegations.
- Gillian, your son is a psycho.
- He booby-trapped my hair dryer.
- Nice hypothesis, but you can't prove it.
- Yeah, but I can hurt you.
- Mom! Mom! She needs to be medicated.
- Come on, Jethro.
- Come here.
I hate this family. Come here.
Jethro, you're getting a time out.
Come on, guys. Backpack.
- What? It's in style.
- It's inappropriate. Go put on some jeans.
And spit out the gum.
So, what color do you want to wear today?
Red? Blue? Purple?
Pink, Momma, pink.
- Farren.
- What? You said jeans.
I meant in your size.
Come on, guys. Come on.
We don't want to be late. There you go.
Come on, sweetie.
- No!
- Get out!
No fighting.
Allow me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are we still on for dinner?
- I'll be there.
We have an audience.
- Yuck. I'm going to vomit.
- He is such a loser.
I like Bob. He's nice.
He's a boring pen importer.
He does the same routine every day.
- He's like a robot.
- That's 'cause he is a robot.
A cyborg, sent from the future, to destroy humanity. Starting with us.
Well, it's been three months.
Happy anniversary.
What is it?
I have to tell you about my job.
This might shock you, but you should know everything before this relationship goes further.
- Don't, Bob.
- What?
I'm very happy when I'm with you.
No one has ever made me laugh like you do, and if I were a single woman,
I could see a real future for us.
But I'm a package deal.
What do you mean?
My kids are my priority and...
How can I put this gently?
- They hate me.
- Yeah.
- I can make them like me.
- See?
You can't make kids like you, not mine or anyone's.
My kids have been through a lot, and...
I don't think we should take the next step until they warm up to you.
Doesn't your happiness count?
Excuse me.
Sorry, I gotta go. Emergency at work.
- No ink?
- It's much bigger.
Sorry, really.
I will explain everything tomorrow.
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- What took you so long to get here?
- Six minutes.
- You stop for a latte?
- I get it. You're...
- What's the expression? Chopping my bust.
- Close enough.
Poldark and a couple other Russkys just went in the refinery.
Then I was right. He's planning something.
Maybe they just want to fill up their gas tanks for free.
- I couldn't blame them.
- No, that man's so crooked, he could eat nails and poop corkscrews.
You're the world's foremost authority on Poldark.
What do you think he's up to?
If his mission is to sabotage the world's oil reserves, why would he care about some two-bit refinery like this one?
I'll make sure you get a chance to ask him.
How the heck are you going to get in there?
A jet pack?
It's in the shop.
Wait for my signal.
Yuri.
- What's this?
- C-4.
When we are done here, I want you to blow this place to smithereens.
Hurry up. I don't have all day.
There is no overtime here.
Bob Ho.
I would love to chat, but I gotta go.
- Up there. Go, go, go, go.
- Move it.
- Move.
- Hold it. Stay where you are.
That was fun. A good aerobic workout.
We should do this again sometime.
Okay, Poldark, let's go.
We have suspect in custody.
Did you see the look on Poldark's face, man?
Brilliant work, Bob. Unbelievable.
I really hate to see you go home.
You're the best agent I've ever had.
Hey, you know I'm standing right here.
Maybe I can get your government to loan you to me just a little bit longer.
No. This was my last assignment.
I'm retiring.
- Don't tell me because of Gillian.
- I want a normal life. I want to get married.
Oh, heck, man. Don't get married.
Just find some woman that you're going to hate in five years and give her your house.
Keep the watch.
A memento, compliments of the CIA.
So, Gillian? Is that the woman that lives next door to your cover house?
- Yeah, they've been stepping out.
- I could never give up this life for a woman.
We're spies, man.
Every little boy wants to be a spy.
It's the life.
All the hours you spend sitting alone in a little room like this, eating cold take-out food in the back of a surveillance van, getting shot at all the time, learning how to pee in a bottle in a moving vehicle.
- You're doing the right thing.
- Only problem is that her kids hate me.
You the man.
Really gonna miss you, Ho.
Good luck with those kids.
I've brought down dictators.
How tough can three kids be?
- Come on, Ringo, come on.
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Ringo!
- Don't worry. Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Right here.
- Come on, Ringo.
- Come on, Ringo.
- Ringo.
Hi, kids.
I'm sorry about running out last night.
- It's all right. It's yourjob.
- No, it was rude.
I promise it will never happen again.
Mom, what about Ringo?
We've tried everything, sweetheart.
He'll come down when he's ready.
You want to see what I've been working on?
Sure.
Ringo, Ringo! Come on, kitty.
It's not that far.
Please, please, please, Ringo.
There you go.
- So, what do you think?
- Well...
It's a work-in-progress.
Sadly, I didn't have any time to work on it today.
Cat was on the roof, satellite's broken again.
I spent two hours on hold trying to get a repairman out here, and I can't stop thinking about last night.
So, are we okay?
I understand.
If a man marries you, he marries all four of you.
Don't forget the pig, the cat and the turtle.
So, do you really like it?
It frightens me.
Sometimes I think I found the last honest man left in the world.
I brought you all cookies.
- Yes?
- Is it true? You're going to marry Bob?
- What? Whoa! Calm down.
- You can't do this, Gillian.
You're, like, so far above him.
What she means is he's boring. He's a geek.
He's a very nice man who treats me very well.
- He's a pen importer.
- He's a cyborg.
You all don't know him like I do.
He's very passionate about the world and about my art.
He likes to talk about history, science and politics.
I see what you mean about him not being boring.
What you all call boring, I call dependable.
For once, I'd like a man who goes to work every day at the same time, and who comes home every single night.
A man who doesn't lie, or cheat, or leave his family the first time some...
My happiness counts, too.
I hate it when old people have feelings.
We gotta deep-six Bob.
- What's the story here?
- They hit Poldark's prison transport caravan
- at the edge of town.
- Tell me he didn't get away.
He's as gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.
I'm telling you, this whole thing was a setup.
They knew he was coming.
Are you saying there's a mole in the agency?
I'm not saying anything except he got away.
Welcome back.
Tatiana, you can't imagine what it's like in there.
The oppressive darkness and the torture of empty days stretching for years.
- Prison is hell.
- You were in there for four hours.
Enough tearful reunion.
I need a new batch of the formula as soon as possible.
We'll run another test in two days.
I need a change of clothes.
Something current and fashionable.
And something to eat that does not come with a toy.
The Sea Hag's made Oiive into a zombie.
Honey, we're getting ready to carve pumpkins downstairs.
- You want to join us?
- Absolutely!
'Cause I'm a loser and I have no life.
Did I mention we're going to toast the pumpkin seeds?
Come on. I want you to join the family.
And I want some privacy.
- Don't get fresh with me.
- I'll use whatever tone of voice
- I want to use with you.
- Farren, I want you downstairs...
No, I'm not going to come downstairs right now. Get out.
Farren, this is my house.
You will listen to me.
You don't own me. Get out.
I said, get out, Gillian. Get out!
Downstairs in five minutes.
I hate this house. I hate this family. Get out!
Me spinach!
No, she won't hear me. I'm on the roof.
It's like the only place
I can get any privacy in this loony bin.
I can't let Gillian marry this guy.
No, it's not that.
I mean, you're right, he is a total drone, but that's not the issue.
What's going to happen when my dad comes back?
He won't just leave me here alone.
He'll be back.
And if she's married, what happens then?
I don't know.
Mom, Ian's feeding Jethro bacon.
- Okay, that's just wrong.
- Why is it wrong?
- Ho, Bob Ho.
- Hey. So, how's it going with those kids?
I'm taking Gillian and the children on a picnic.
I'm going to force those kids to like me.
Force them? You know, you might as well try scratching your ear with your elbow.
Guess what? Poldark escaped.
- No longer my problem.
- Yeah, I know, but we recovered a file.
It seems to be an entry portal to a website.
We can't crack it.
I thought maybe you could take a look at it.
Hey, if you can figure it out, great.
If you can't, no harm, no foul.
As a favor to you.
Send it to my home computer.
Already did.
While I'm thinking about it, they suspect there may be a mole at the agency.
- They suspect me?
- No.
You know Glaze thinks you're the sharpest barb on the wire.
I have no idea what that means.
Hey, listen, man, have fun on your picnic.
Just shoot me back when you check out that file. Thanks.
Puzzle encryption.
Let's see what you've got.
- Is it noon already?
- No. I have bad news.
- My father is in the hospital.
- That's terrible.
He plays senior softball and he slid into third.
- Now he's having his hip replaced.
- That's terrible.
I have to leave the kids and fly to Denver to take care of Dad.
- That's great.
- What are you talking about?
Let me watch the kids.
It would give us a chance to get to know each other.
No, Bob. You? Them? I don't know.
My aunt's flying in from San Antonio.
She's very good with the kids.
- She was in the military.
- Gillian, this could be just what we need.
You really think you can handle that kind of pressure?
The driving, the schoolwork, and then there's Halloween.
Getting their costumes, finishing decorating the house?
No problem. Halloween is my favorite.
You have nothing to worry about.
They will be perfectly safe with me.
It's not them I'm worried about.
- You can't be serious.
- Isn't there any other option?
Foster care? Juvenile hall?
Okay. You'll be fine.
Love you guys.
- I'm going to miss you.
- Yeah, as proven by this total abandonment.
You'll survive. I'll buy you something from the hospital gift shop.
- Bye.
- Bye. Love you.
- See you later.
- Bye.
So, is this exciting, or what?
Well, I'll just pack a few things, and we'll go to your house, okay?
A Flowbee. I knew he cut his own hair.
Nothing telling in his DVD collection.
Standard action movies, mainstream comedies, no sci-fi, and nothing above PG-13.
Hey, his computer. Let's check it out.
Good idea.
There's got to be some dirt on there.
Fashion Armageddon.
I haven't forgotten, Colton.
I will look at the file.
But this is important. What is Halloween?
Farren, do you realize what this is?
It's got you all worked up.
Let me guess, a Klingon dictionary?
You have me confused with an entirely different class of geek.
Stockholm GBH.
Grievous Bodily Harm, live in Stockholm.
This is one of the rarest bootleg concerts in the world.
- Why does Bob have it?
- Who cares? I'm gonna download it.
This is my ticket to Coolsville.
This is what you bring me to wear?
You said you wanted current.
I look like the Fresh Prince of Belarus.
Send someone out to get me something elegant.
What is this program you found?
I went on to download the formula and found the site being accessed by a third party.
If the United States or China has the formula, they can develop an antibody for it.
I'm tracing the ISP, but it's heavily encrypted.
It will take me a while to track it down.
Find whoever downloaded my formula.
- Retrieve it.
- And?
- Kill them.
- Thank you.
- What's up with you?
- I'm gonna kill you.
What? I'm gonna kill you.
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
She's hurting me!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, stop!
- What's going on here?
- She threw a stink bomb in my room.
What? That's so not true.
So what, you're saying I threw a stink bomb in my own room just to get you in trouble? Sad. So sad.
Hey, hey, hey.
Farren, I'm very disappointed in you.
You two should be in bed by now.
Well, if we finish our homework in time,
Gillian lets us stay up till midnight.
She also likes us to watch Adult Swim.
It's kind of a tradition.
I didn't really think this one through.
Nora, let's get ready for bed.
I don't want to go to bed.
Only my mommy can dress me.
Nora.
Here I come.
Hey! Come back. I'll get you.
Come back!
I got you. No, come back!
Nora.
Come on. Nora.
- Only my mommy can dress me.
- Come on, Nora.
Only my mommy can dress me!
Only mommy can dress me!
You.
Can your mommy do that? Sleep.
Get out!
- Hello?
- You're alive. That's a good sign.
- How are the kids?
- We had a great night. Easy as pie.
Really? You're with my kids, right?
Bob, the other night at dinner, you were gonna say something about yourjob, and I cut you off.
You want to tell me now?
It can wait until you get back.
- I really think this was a good idea.
- I'm sure the worst is behind us.
Just a second.
I got it.
Fire!
Big mistake.
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.
- Shotgun.
- It's not your day.
You sure your mother lets you go to school like that?
Duh, Bob.
"Duh, Bob."
- Bye.
- Well, you guys have a nice day.
- Hi.
- That is so cute.
So what do you do all day?
Nothing. I'm four.
- You're full of it.
- Yeah, full of it.
I'm telling you, I downloaded it yesterday.
Really? 'Cause if you really had, that'd be pretty cool.
- Yeah, pretty cool.
- Let's hear it then.
You trying to pop our ears?
That's nothing but a bunch of static.
- I don't get it.
- I get it.
You're a pathetic little nerd and a liar.
Let's get him.
Wedgie!
Put me down! Put me down!
Put me down! Put me down!
Okay, you asked for it.
No! You guys are gonna hear from me and my lawyer.
You'll pay for this, each and every one of you.
So, tell me more about Halloween.
It's the best. You get candy.
Everyone pretends to be someone else, and nobody knows who you really are.
Sounds familiar. Nora...
So, what do you want to be?
A Frankenstein? A zombie?
Sweetie, do you want to be a princess?
Yes.
Okay, princess.
Nora?
Not fairy. Princess. Princess.
Princess.
Pink.
- Princess.
- It's too big.
Too big? Okay.
Nora? Nora.
Nora.
Nora!
Nora. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Nora!
Nora. Please don't wander off again.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Let's go pay for your costume.
Yo, it's Ho.
Just hold him till I get there.
Can I just say before we begin that only in the current distressed condition of the American public school system could I be deposited headfirst into a garbage can, and yet I'm the one who winds up receiving disciplinary action?
Who exactly are you?
I'm his mother's...
- Neighbor.
- Neighbor.
I'm watching them for a few days.
Well, this is not the first time
Ian has been in trouble.
He gets in fights. He lies.
Hey, I don't lie.
You told everyone you invited
Selena Gomez to the spring dance.
Her appearance fee was an obstacle.
You said you spent New Year's Eve at the Playboy Mansion.
Hey, pay-per-view high-def.
I felt like I was there.
I'm telling you, lying is a dangerous game.
Bob, you sell pens. What do you...
- Oh, no. That's them.
- Who?
The future felons who put me in the trash can.
Hey, geek-boy, we got detention because of you.
- Yeah, because of you.
- You're gonna pay for that.
- Gentlemen, we don't want trouble.
- Who's this? Your mom?
You wish. He's my bodyguard.
I hired him. You better watch out.
- That true?
- No. He's joking.
- I'm their babysitter.
- What are you gonna do?
Ask you politely to allow us to pass.
How humiliating.
Why didn't you do something?
Why did you tell them
I was your bodyguard?
You're right.
I guess it was too big a stretch.
Hey. How you doing? I'm Ian.
If I told you, you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
- At least you're not shy.
- I wanted to talk to her in the worst way.
Mission accomplished.
Come here.
You look so pretty.
Farren, I didn't know you did gymnastics.
Why would you?
You don't know anything about me.
You come over to hang out with Gillian, and you never even talk to us.
Come on, let's go.
The woman's got a point.
I don't know who you are sending out to buy my clothes, but I want them killed.
- You could go yourself.
- I'm the most wanted man in America.
I cannot exactly browse the racks of JCPenneys.
Just give me something that will blend in.
Something extremely American.
Sir, we are ready to run the test.
Magnificent.
She must have plastic in her shoes.
It will eat any petroleum product.
We're working on that.
What happened to the bacteria?
They live as long as they feed.
Once the oil is gone, they disappear.
Just like my Jimmy Choos.
Come in.
Listen, about today...
You could have stood up for me, you know.
I have to face those guys.
So face them.
Unless you want to spend the rest of your life with your head in the trash can.
Thanks for the advice, Bob.
All my problems are solved.
They assign this in middle school?
No, that's my pleasure reading.
You're smart.
You have a lot going for you.
Why do you make things up?
Girls aren't exactly impressed by astrophysics.
Given the resources,
I could design, build and launch a rocket that would accurately circumscribe an orbit of the moon.
But other guys can, you know, throw a ball through a hoop.
I don't want you to get in trouble.
I'll make you a deal.
If you try to tell the truth from now on,
I won't tell your mother about today.
Really?
Dude, that's almost cool.
You mean for a guy who sells pens?
Come on, kids, time for bed.
Come on, one more spoonful.
Nora.
This one I learned it in China when I was young.
It's me. I need your help.
I had to make up one heck of a yarn to get all this stuff.
What did you tell them?
Well, let's just say if I don't find some weapons-grade uranium by dawn,
I'm in trouble.
What do you need all this for?
To get the kids ready for school.
Well, it's like my mom always used to say when she was stationed over in East Berlin.
She'd say, "Spying is easy.
Parenting is hard." Good luck.
Bring it on.
Farren, you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!
Farren, let me in.
Farren, you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!
Farren.
Hey!
I guess it's my turn.
And, Farren, please put on a longer skirt.
This means war.
Nora?
Nora.
Stay with Bob.
Come on, Nora.
- Where is he?
- Hiding.
He's probably going to trick us into opening the door.
Help me put this away?
Ian. You know the rules.
No soda upstairs.
What? How did you...
Breakfast is served.
Wow!
Nora, time for bed.
Night-night.
It's a school night. You should be asleep.
How'd you find me?
Call it a hunch.
Why do you call your mother
Gillian instead of Mom?
She's not my mom.
What do you mean?
My father was married before, and my real mom died when I was little.
Gillian is just my stepmother.
And Ian and Nora are just my half brother and sister.
I'm like the freak of the family.
It must have hurt your feelings when he left.
He'll be back for me.
I know he's not the greatest dad in the world, but he loves me, and he's not going to leave me here alone.
Anyway, you should not climb the roof like this.
It's not safe.
Please don't tell me I can't come up here.
It's like the only place I can chill.
Actually, I was going to offer to build you a railing.
Are you trying to bribe me into liking you?
I just want you to be safe.
Mind if I chill with you?
It's a free country.
Look at the star.
Good news. We got an address.
Good. Take some men.
Get that download back.
Tatiana.
No survivors.
Hey, boss. You like?
No like?
May I make a couple of fashion suggestions?
Women don't like the shirt tucked in.
Mess up your hair.
- You know about fashion?
- No, but I know women.
Wear it like this.
It's cool, I saw it in a movie.
What movie? Octopussy? This isn't 1985.
- I almost forgot.
- What's this?
- Iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai.
- What?
This is only about the hardest concert to find in the world.
I guarantee no one else in the school district has it.
- You downloaded this for me?
- Don't worry, I paid for it.
- How'd you even know about it?
- Easy. I was there.
Bob, you're getting too efficient.
We're half an hour early.
You're welcome.
Have a great day.
- Hey, cool look, Aaron.
- Thanks. It's Ian.
Whatever.
Have a great day.
Look, the talk on the roof the other night doesn't mean we're friends.
God forbid.
We're here. There is nobody around.
I found the computer, but the file was downloaded to an external storage device.
I can't find that.
I think I just figured out who lives here.
Agent Ho.
- Hello.
- You must stop shooting things, Antosha.
I said it would be bad if the CIA or Chinese had it.
But he's both. Find him, but keep him alive.
I need to know who else he's shown this to.
Listen up. Now. Everyone in here.
We must locate Chinese Intelligence agent,
Bob Ho.
He is very tricky. The best at what he does.
He won't be easy to find.
- Ms. Creel.
- Not now.
Imagine you are Chinese, highly trained, and you want to disappear.
I see him climbing with a bunch of skulls on a rope.
Okay, he's not Conan the Barbarian.
Good try, though.
No, I see him. There.
Go. Go!
Don't kill him yet. We need information.
Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go!
Come here, sweetheart. Get back here.
Come here!
Let go!
- Get the bad lady, Bob.
- Let go!
- Can you hold my turtle?
- Not now.
Yay, Bob!
That's it.
You will pay for that,
- little American princess.
- Bob, help!
Again, again, again.
Okay.
- Why did you pull us out of school?
- Who cares? We're out.
Why are you in the front seat anyway?
It's my day.
- No, it isn't. It's my day.
- No, it's not your day. You're the liar.
- No, today is my day.
- No, today is my day.
- You're a liar.
- No. No. No.
- All right, quiet!
- I'm still hungry.
It doesn't look like they have chicken tenders here.
Wait inside. I have to make a call.
- This is Firefly.
- This is Bob Ho. I need help.
Yeah, so I get pretty good grades at this university.
I'm top of the class.
I don't like to brag, but, you know.
- Bob, this is Larry.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- Let's get some food.
- He goes to the university.
He's a poet. Isn't it cool?
It's rad. It's awesome. It's jiggy for shizzy.
It's the bomb.
- Let's go.
- Hey!
How embarrassing.
You know, most people don't like me when they first meet me.
But Larry did.
I have two words for you, Larry. Thirteen.
I have to go.
All right, Nora. Come on.
You two stay at the table.
No, no, no.
I can't go in there.
Boys are pigs.
Careful.
And the lion jumped on me, and I killed him with my bare hands, and I saved the colonel's life.
- You're brave.
- Thanks.
How about this, Bob? The whole restaurant and the waitress sat Larry here.
- Isn't it great?
- It's like it's fate or something.
Really, sir, we're just goofing around.
- Hey, Nora. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Irish stew.
- Irish stew who?
Irish stew in the name of the law.
Larry was telling me all about the university. It sounds great.
- I'd be glad to give you a tour sometime.
- When pigs fly.
It's not up to you. You're not my dad.
No, but I know that your mother hasn't completely lost her mind.
It's just a tour, Bob.
It's not like he's asking me out on a date or anything.
Are you?
No, it's just a friendly offer.
Even if it was a date, you still couldn't stop me.
- What's your major, Larry?
- English Lit.
Would you pass the soy sauce?
That way I get a background in the classics.
- You speak Russian, Larry?
- What's going on?
- This is going to be painful.
- You're right about that.
Go, go, go.
Maybe you'll write a poem about this.
Goodbye, Larry.
Fine. He's too old for me.
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.
I want to be a cyborg.
How did he find us so fast?
It doesn't make sense.
- Bob, what's going on?
- Please quiet, I'm trying to think.
What do you mean, you're trying to think?
- You just threw a man out the window...
- Who is he? What is...
All right, all right, fine. Fine.
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA from the Chinese Intelligence Service.
Someone wants me dead, and "Larry" was a Russian operative, okay?
Fine. Don't tell us.
Cool.
Why would he come alone?
Stay here.
- Where are the kids?
- Inside.
Nothing else matters until these kids are safe. Nothing.
Of course. Colton set up that safe house for them like you requested.
- Hey, got that file on you?
- What file?
The one Colton linked you to, from Poldark's computer, your download.
I didn't download it.
I never even got it open.
Don't BS me, Bob. It's classified material.
I need all copies.
Why would you think I downloaded it?
Unless someone told you I had, someone who wanted it back.
Let's not make this thing harder than it has to be, Bob.
Give me the file.
You're a career officer. Why do this?
I want out. Same as you.
We're both leaving for love.
Only I love money and Anton Poldark is match. Com. The file.
Wait. Take it easy.
Good work.
No.
Can I just say, you are by far the coolest guy my mom has ever dated.
At least now I know how that kid Larry found us so fast.
- How?
- The watch.
Glaze told me to keep the watch.
It must have a tracking device.
- Wow. You really are a spy.
- Gillian is totally going to freak.
What are you doing?
There's iron in these rocks.
It will hide the signal. Watch, please.
You realize if I told anyone at school this story,
I'd get detention for a year for lying.
- Yes.
- Hey, partner. Where're you at?
- Why do you ask?
- I needed to pick up that file I sent you.
You know, the one I wanted you to open for me.
Bob, you there?
Colton, I never thought you would have sold out to Poldark.
Hey, that's crazy, man. Something's wrong.
We need to get together and talk.
- Nice try.
- Bob? Bob?
- We'll be safe here. I promise.
- This is your plan? Hide out in a hotel?
Doesn't look like they have chicken tenders here, either.
This is awesome.
Can we order room service?
- Are you crazy? I'm going home.
- No.
- The only place you're safe is with me.
- Safe with you?
- Everybody's trying to kill you.
- I know. Isn't it cool?
Hey, Bob, if you want to marry my mom,
I'll personally write the invitations.
Love you, Bob.
Be realistic, Bob.
- Hello.
- Hi, Gillian.
Hi, sweetheart.
Yeah, Grandpa just fell asleep.
I was gonna call you guys.
I have to tell you something.
I know this is going to hurt you, but I have to tell you.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- It's about Bob.
- What about him?
He's not who you think he is.
He's a spy, a Chinese spy.
And these terrorists are trying to kill him, and now the CIA's after him, too, and they...
Farren, I know you don't like Bob, but come on.
I'd expect this from Ian, but not from you.
What? No, it's true. He's going to get us all killed. Don't you even care?
Farren, this conversation is over.
Put Bob on.
Hi, Gillian.
Bob, I am so sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into her.
- It's true.
- What is?
Everything she said is all true.
Whatever this is, it isn't funny.
The kids are safe, I promise.
I'll give them to you as soon as you get back.
You're either telling me the truth or I've left my kids with a nut job.
Either way, you should come and get them.
So, you got any other cool spy stuff, besides the watch?
Don't touch. It's very sharp.
Cool. What else?
Cool.
Sorry, mister.
Airport. Step on it.
- Bob? Are you awake?
- Are you kidding?
- Does he always snore like that?
- Can't you hear him next door?
I always thought it was the pig.
It's over with you and Gillian, isn't it?
Yes, Farren, it's over.
- You win.
- Then why don't I feel like I won?
If you really loved her, you wouldn't give up this easily.
It's because I love her and the three of you that I have to walk away.
It's more important that you're safe.
I thought I could put my other life behind me, but I can't.
Be glad.
You're lucky you're not joining this family.
You've no idea what it's like to live in a place where you totally don't belong.
Don't be so sure. I was an orphan.
I was raised in a group home.
I never knew my parents, but I had a family.
I had dozens of brothers and sisters there.
And I wasn't related to any of them, but I loved them all.
Family isn't whose blood you carry.
It's who you love and who loves you.
- Gillian!
- Mom!
Gillian, I'm really sorry about everything.
Tell me the truth. Are you really a spy?
Yes, I am. I was going to tell you at dinner, but you stopped me.
I don't care. You put my children in danger.
Just go.
Bob, when are we going to see you again?
You're not.
Please don't go away.
Who's gonna sing me China songs?
- You'll be safe. I promise.
- Stay away from my children.
Dear Mom, I am very sorry, but I cannot stay here.
My destiny is to be a spy, like Bob.
I am going with him.
Best wishes, your son, Ian.
Ho's signal just popped back up.
We got him.
Let's roll.
Bob! Bob!
- Ian.
- You left your watch.
What are you doing here? Let's go.
What do you mean? We just got here.
Bob Ho. What a coincidence. Tie them up.
- What are you doing here, Ian?
- I'm coming with you.
I want to be a spy, too.
Is this the bad guy?
I thought he'd be better dressed.
- How did you find me?
- I found one of your tracking devices and put it in your pocket when I hugged you goodbye.
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.
- Can we go back to business?
- Would it help to mention I'm retired?
Retired men don't download secrets.
- I never downloaded anything.
- He's lying.
Who are you going to believe?
Me or the traitor?
Someone has been a very naughty boy.
He's got cameras and microphones mounted all over the place.
Good plan, filming us together.
- How could you turn against your country?
- It's simple.
I'm gonna be a billionaire.
That file that you didn't download?
It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.
This stuff literally eats oil.
Can you imagine?
Overnight, all the world's oil supplies go poof.
All except for Russia's.
It'll be priceless, right, comrade?
How did you get Colt to go along with you?
Colt? That hillbilly's not part of this.
He doesn't know what goes on in the real world.
He still thinks wrestling is real.
Let the boy go.
He has nothing to do with this.
Mr. Chit-Chat just laid out our whole plan.
We cannot let him go.
- He will tell.
- Trust me, no one would believe him.
He's right about that.
Hey, boss. Look at what I found sneaking around outside.
- Farren?
- Hi, everybody.
Please, have a seat.
This can't be happening.
Poldark, let the children go and I will find this GBH file for you.
GBH? Like, Stockholm GBH?
- How do you know that?
- No freaking way.
You're telling me all of this is because he downloaded a bootleg concert?
You did what?
You downloaded it?
Wow, these companies take piracy way too seriously.
You were messing with my computer?
That's private.
I just wanted to seem cool.
You don't need to. You are cool.
- You're one of the coolest kids I know.
- Really? Thanks.
Hey, over here. Man with a gun.
Wait a minute.
I am one of the only kids you know.
- Where is the file?
- It's on my iPod, on my desk at home.
Now, see, you want to be a spy.
Never tell the truth to the bad guy.
Sorry, I'm new at this.
Tatiana, take some men to the kid's house and find the iPod.
What if the family is home?
Ever since you dyed your hair blonde...
Kill them.
- No, don't!
- Go, bring me that iPod.
Come on, go. Go.
Now, as for you...
Awesome!
Farren, let's go.
- I call dibs on the front.
- Then I pick the radio station.
Okay. Ready?
Okay, hold on.
- Hello?
- Gillian, listen to me.
Goodbye, Bob.
Gillian, wait. Don't hang up.
Hang on.
We've got to get there before they do.
Is there anyone at the agency you can still trust? Someone you can call?
Sure, but they tore out my cameras.
I have no proof of anything.
Except that, as it happens, I recorded that entire conversation on my cell phone.
Way to go, dork.
Colt... Just listen.
I'm going to play you something.
That file that you didn't download?
It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.
This stuff literally eats oil.
What is this?
- It's Halloween.
- It's Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.
- Bob!
What are you all doing?
I thought you were upstairs.
- Everybody inside.
- Bob, we need to talk.
Mom, this isn't a joke. Do whatever he says.
- Okay.
- Come on.
- Get your iPod.
- His iPod?
- I demand an explanation.
- They're coming.
- Who?
- The Russians.
Russians?
I saw them outside. They're coming.
- Russians?
- Yes, Gillian, Russians.
Let's try and keep up.
It's too late. Everybody upstairs.
Understand me?
Stay there.
Where's my stuff?
- Here, take some of this stuff.
- What is all this?
Protection.
Why do you have a lighter?
I don't want you playing with fire.
Okay, maybe just this once. Let's go.
Trick or treat.
Hurry. Close it. Close it quick. Okay.
- I forgot Chuckle.
- Nora! Nora!
What are you supposed to be?
A cyborg, sent from the future to blast you away.
Mommy, that man can fly.
I can't believe you did this to my family, endangered my kids.
I didn't mean to. I love your kids.
I want to marry you, all four of you.
And I wanted to marry you.
But our wedding gifts would have to be opened by the bomb squad.
All right, Ho. Enough games.
I finally found a normal guy, I thought, someone who likes to...
Can we talk about this later?
- He switched belts.
- Get him.
Give me the iPod, kid.
- Come on, let's TP the little geek's house.
- Yeah, TP.
Hey, guys.
Gotta go.
Maybe we should just stick to stealing candy from little kids.
Yeah, real little kids.
- This is going to be fun.
- Hey, Larry. Knock, knock.
Yes!
Come on, guys, get in the room and lock the door. Hurry. Lock it.
Irish stew in the name of the law.
Sorry your retirement was so short, Bob.
- You can kill me. Let the family go.
- I can't. They've seen too much.
But I'll let you go first so you don't have to watch.
Hey, mister.
Don't think this changes anything.
- Everybody freeze!
- It's okay.
They're the good guys.
You stinking lowlife. Come on. Let's go.
Mom!
Hey, loosen these things up.
I'm sorry. What's wrong?
Got the handcuffs too tight?
I don't know how these things work.
I'm just a dumb hillbilly.
- Everybody okay?
- Bumps and bruises.
Ian, this really is the good guy.
Hey, what you got there, son?
Nice work recording that conversation, partner.
This young man might make a heck of a spy someday.
How quickly can you give me orange jumpsuit?
I'm sorry I suspected you.
Don't worry about it, old buddy.
Chalk it up to the language barrier.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I put you through all this.
Goodbye, Gillian.
Goodbye, kids.
Bob.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
Wait.
I know he lied, but he did it to protect us.
This whole time, all he ever wanted to do was protect us, Mom.
And, Mom, you're never gonna find a man as good as Bob, never again.
Never.
I never thought I'd say this, but I agree with Farren.
I suppose you have something to say, too.
I want Bob to be my daddy.
Do you, Gillian, take Bob to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
And do you, Bob, take Gillian to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Gillian.
There's one more thing I have to tell you.
My name really isn't Bob.
That's okay.
I do.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Ready. And action.
And cut.
No, that man's so crooked, he could eat nails and...
Maybe he just wanted to fill up his gas tanks for free.
I can't blame him.
No, that man's so crooked, he could eat nails and...
Sorry.
Sorry, mister.
All right.
What's going on?
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.
I want to be a...
I'm an international spy, on loan to the CIA from the Chinese...
From the Chinese intelligent... Intelligent?
- Intelligence.
- Intelligence.
Well, I'll just pick a few things and move to the house.
- Okay, cut.
- What does it mean?
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA from the Chinese intelligent...
- What?
- Intelligent.
I've brought down dictators.
How tough to say...
- Yeah.
- Yes?
Maybe you'll write a poem about...
A poem about... A poem.
Maybe you'll write a poem...
Maybe write... I hate English.
If a man marries you, he marries all four of you.
Don't forget the pig, the cat and the turkey.
And the turkey.
- Turkey? Where's the turkey come from?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, my grandmother's... Sorry.
- Okay, cut.
Grandmother's great. He plays...
Let's cut.
When they forget a dialogue, it makes me happy.
Good work. Come out. Camera needs you.
Come on.
What are we doing?
What are you doing? We're filming.
We're making a movie.
Funny man. Funny man.
A camera mark.
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
My talons are upon you!
Your days of terrorizing the owl kingdoms are over!
Not so fast! You're no match for my army of Evil Ones.
Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.
- But I am Lyze of Kiel.
- Soren, but...
And I have assembled my own army, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!
But, Soren...
We've sworn an oath to make strong the weak, mend the broken, and vanquish evil!
Eglantine, what is it?
Soren, this time you said
I would be Lyze of Kiel.
Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?
Well, I hope you're not lying...
...to Metal Beak!
Got you!
My beak. Da.
Okay. Enough, young owlets.
Time for bed.
Yes, please.
Enough stories about the Guardians.
Now, Kludd, stories are part of our culture and our history.
We learn from them.
Even after the 7ooth time we hear them?
Yes, even then. Unless, son, you already know all there is of our history.
I know the Guardians win.
- Soren, iùs just a story.
- It is not!
Here we go again.
I mean, Da, have you ever seen a Guardian?
Kludd, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't real.
Iùs like feeling something with your gizzard.
You know, through our gizzards...
...the voices of the ages whisper to us and tell us whaùs right.
Now, thaùs enough for one night, dear.
Tomorrow's a big day.
Iùs first branching.
- Now, off to bed.
- Now, come along, children.
I've made the moss and down extra soft for you, Eglantine.
Soren, do you really think
Metal Beak is real?
You remember, it was the Battle of the Ice claws.
The Guardians were outnumbered.
Things looked dark.
But then Lyze of Kiel...
...struck down the leader of the evil owls.
The Guardians were victorious.
The owl kingdoms were free once more.
And then they returned home, to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.
Wow.
But some say the evil king still lives...
...and wears a metal mask to hide his missing beak.
Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.
But this is my favorite part.
I know. We've heard it a thousand times.
You have a soft head, Soren.
I think Da has filled it with stories and dreams.
There's nothing wrong with dreams.
Thaùs the difference between us.
I have mine when I'm asleep.
Now would you just go to sleep?
Soren...
...Da says our dreams are who we are.
- So as I was... Kludd, wait!
- No!
Look, Da!
I'm gonna be the best flier.
Thaùs because Tytos are best at everything.
Right, Da?
You have strength, Kludd. But owls make the best hunters for one reason alone.
Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.
By the time I have my claws out...
The mice will have run away. And you and your hatchlings will go hungry.
Da!
I'm ready.
Young Guardian...
...I don't think your first branching lesson will be that dangerous.
Now, don't worry how much noise you make in the beginning.
You just need to stretch your...
...wings.
Well done.
Beginner's luck.
You know, Kludd, it helps when
I picture where I'm gonna land.
Come on, I'll race you!
Okay. Go!
Yeah, you had a head start.
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.
Boys. No more fighting.
- Leùs get the boys inside. Iùs time to go.
- Can we come with you on the hunt?
Not tonight. But when the time comes, at least you'll have the helmet for it.
- Nice helmet.
- Get off!
Boys.
Do it again. Say it again.
Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.
Do you worry for him?
I worry for both of them.
Seems like yesterday they were hatchlings...
...and now, well, you know, they'll soon be grown and leaving the hollow.
I just want them to be prepared.
They'll be fine.
Come on.
Eglantine, are you all right?
Oh, iùs all right, dear.
If it wants to come out, let it.
Thaùs it, dear. Thaùs it. Keep going.
Oh, iùs going to be beautiful!
- There you go.
- Eg, hat is gross!
Quite an achievement.
- What is it?
- Iùs your first pellet.
First? You mean there'll be more?
Don't you recognize it, Eg?
It was the mouse you ate.
Its fur and bones, anyway.
Every owl yarps up pellets.
In fact, I think I might have your brothers' first pellets.
- No, no.
- Maybe you'd like to see them?
- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please.
- Oh, come on, dear.
Such a big night for this tree.
First branching, first pellet.
Excuse me.
Kludd, do you want to go out and try some more branching?
What? So you can go out there and show off again?
I don't think so.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just...
...I don't know, stay inside and play Battle of the Ice claws again.
Kludd? Could I just show you how?
Without you being so angry?
All right. Show me how.
Well, before I leap...
I picture myself standing on a great cliff with the Guardians, ready for battle.
We leap down, floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.
- The air's just carrying us as we...
- Thaùs enough!
Kludd, are you okay?
Oh, no.
We're on the ground.
We can't be here. Iùs... Iùs...
This is the worst place for an owl.
Yeah. No, no. Iùs weird down here.
No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.
You know, if we could just make it to that branch.
Then we could climb our way up.
Yeah, here, leùs see.
Shh! Quiet!
What was that?
Soren!
Kludd!
Kludd! Kludd!
Where are you taking us?
But our home's that way.
You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you.
- Whaùd you think, Jutt?
- The "I'll shut it for you" part?
No, not that. My evil stare.
Been working on it for weeks.
Oh. I missed it. Leùs see.
Lmpressive.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
You know, your evil stare reminds me a little of my "Intimidator."
Yeah?
I raise one eyebrow...
...tuck in my chin and...
- Who are you?
- Hey! No questions.
No "whos," no "whats," no "whys."
You'll see soon enough.
What do you think?
Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?
- Completely natural.
- Oh, thanks.
Let me go!
Kludd!
- Strong beak, that one.
- Yeah? Well, they'll put that to good use.
You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...
...and combine it with my raised-eyebrow look...
...I get this.
- What do you call that?
- "The Predator."
"The Predator"?
Iùs a bit silly, don't you think?
Hey, Jatt, look. Iùs Grimble.
Perfect. Hit him with the new look.
With or without raised eyebrow?
With raised eyebrow.
With raised eyebrow.
Greetings, Grimble.
Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.
Did you only get half an owl tonight,
Grimble?
No, Jatt. Iùs an elf owl.
They're very small, but hard workers.
Too old to carry a full-size one?
Yeah, hilarious.
Is there something wrong with your face, Jutt?
Huh? No!
You've upset him now.
Iùs a new look!
But you gotta work on your comebacks.
I'm Soren.
I'm Gylfie.
He said you were an elf owl.
From Kuneer. Thaùs in the desert.
Are you a Tyto?
Yeah, from Tyto Forest.
Who are these owls?
Do you have any idea where they're taking us?
Hey! Stop talking.
Quiet! Listen to the old man!
Kludd!
- Settle down.
- Silence!
- Kludd!
- Silence!
Your parents and families have abandoned you.
So from now, you'll be classified as orphans.
No, I'm not an orphan.
Horribly tragic, I know.
But by the mercy of Glaux...
...you've been rescued and brought here to St. Aegolius.
And, in time, you'll come to be grateful for the kindness shown to you.
You'll repay that kindness with labor.
Some of you will be pickers.
No, I don't want to be a picker!
- Some will be soldiers.
- Gylfie, stay with me.
In your ways, all will serve the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.
- Let us go!
- Silence.
We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.
- Who are the Pure Ones?
- Silence!
I am Nyra,
Ablah General of St. Aegolius...
...and mate to the Lord High Tyto.
I know right now you miss your families...
...but soon enough you will understand the Pure Ones are your new family.
The Pure Ones are not our family.
Let us go!
She's right. Let us go!
Whaùs this?
Tyto, don't waste your time.
Don't soil your feathers.
You leave her be.
Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.
You and your patch of felt will stay together, then.
As pickers.
Leùs go. Hurry up.
Perhaps when you remember your nobility,
Tyto, we can make a soldier of you.
- Come on.
- What about my brother?
- Oh? Where's he?
- Kludd!
Owlet, that one says you're his brother.
Would you like to join him?
I didn't think so.
Kludd?
Here we go. Move along. Move it along.
- Kludd!
- Now, there's a soldier.
Thank you.
Soren, you know, you don't have to be here with me. You should be with your brother.
No, Gylfie. I could never be with those Tytos.
I don't know why Kludd would even think...
Hey! Whaùs wrong with him?
He looks like he's been moon...
All right, you owlets, move it in, move it in. Come on!
Do exactly as he says or you'll never see the light of dawn.
- Nice one, Jutt.
- Felt a little forced.
- It was awesome.
- Thank you, Jatt.
So tonight, we want you to...
- What was it again, Jatt?
- To rest.
To rest.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon.
And sleep.
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.
I think they're trying to moon blink us.
Moon blink us?
Sometimes in the desert, owls would get exhausted and collapse under it.
When they woke up, they just weren't the same.
As if they'd forgotten who they were.
Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.
I know these stars.
I could get us away from here...
...but the only way out is to fly and we can't.
Not yet, we can't.
But we're gonna learn how.
Whenever they're not watching...
...every chance we get, we're gonna stretch out our wings...
Do you really think that we can make it, Soren?
Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.
I'm cold.
Together.
All right, my lovely little owlets.
Thaùs enough beauty rest.
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.
Iùs another glorious day...
- Oh, no.
- Soren.
Thaùs right. Here we go.
Move it along.
Soren.
Where are we going now?
Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.
Keep moving.
Lots of pellet picking ahead.
You may have noticed that we don't like dawdling.
Anything with W's in it, we don't trust.
Come on.
Shuffle those talons.
The sooner you get there, the sooner we start.
The sooner you start, the sooner we finish. Leùs go!
Keep moving, no dawdling.
And welcome to the Pelletorium.
Iùs a great place for the rest of your lives.
You mustn't feel sorry for them down there.
As lower species, they are fortunate to serve a higher cause.
As Tyto owls, their natural superiors...
...you too are part of that plan.
One that will soon bring order to all the owl kingdoms...
...when the Pure Ones will rule.
A new and noble era will dawn.
Now, prove your greatness...
...and rise.
Higher!
Higher!
Leùs get this party started!
Leùs get picking!
Start picking up those pellets right now.
Thaùs right. Think of the joy. Pellets.
We love them.
Ugh. Other owls' pellets.
You know, maybe it would have been better if we had been moon blinked.
Oh, here we go.
Eureka.
Great job, number 857... Whatever.
All right, everyone, gather around.
- Hey, you with the blank expression.
Thaùs all of them.
Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.
Now this is the kind of pellet you're picking for.
Mouse fur, mouse bones, thaùs all standard.
But the secret rare ingredient in this one is what Mr. Mouse ate:
- A metal fleck.
- Metal fleck.
Now, I'm very perceptive.
- He is.
- I am.
- And I'm detecting you...
Nicely done.
...want to volunteer to take this fleck to where all the flecks belong.
You all watching? Hm?
Come on.
Soren.
Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.
Back to work.
What happened?
Listen, Gylfie, those birds are doing something terribly wrong.
We have to find Kludd and we have to get out of here.
And exactly what do you two think you're doing?
Eh?
Once we have amassed enough flecks...
...we will set a trap.
Then it is up to you to lure our enemy to their rightful place:
Into our claws.
And then the Western Kingdoms and the Tree, those will be mine.
You have my word.
What do you plan on doing with us?
Quiet!
What is this place?
Get inside.
Stop asking questions.
The Pure Ones won't be too happy if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.
No.
And they won't be too happy when they find out what I'm gonna do to you either.
I'm gonna teach you to fly.
Fly?
You can breathe now.
Yeah, iùs been getting worse here.
I told myself if any came who were smart, and brave enough to resist...
...l'd help them.
I guess you two'll have to do.
But aren't you a...?
A Pure One? No, I hate them.
Almost as much as I hate what they've turned me into.
My feathers weren't always stained with these colors.
When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom,
I fought back.
Now, they thought they could use that...
...so they took my family.
And they promised me if I followed orders, no harm would come to them.
And I've been doing their dirty work ever since.
Now, have you flown at all before?
Well, I have been branching.
You don't have the luxury of gliding down from a nest anymore.
We need to work on your power skills, starting with what you already know.
Show me what you can do.
Come on.
Hey, good, good.
Now, try and feel every muscle, every feather in each stroke.
And push!
Ow!
All right, you two, thaùs enough. Come on.
Back to practice.
Now, the best of you...
...the fittest and the most brilliant...
...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.
So leùs see how much you've improved...
...as fliers, as fighters.
Well?
Well done. You've shown exceptional obedience and discipline.
My husband will be most pleased by your progress.
Hm. Tell me, does your brother have similar potential as a flier?
Who, Soren?
No. He fell out of the tree when he was still a hatchling. He's lame.
Oh, soldier, you mustn't confuse praise for license.
Never lie to me.
For the Lord High Tyto, we need as many strong fliers as we can find.
Come, leùs tell your brother what rewards there are...
...for those who recognize their true family.
No, more flap, deeper flap.
The still air has no shape to use.
You gotta compensate with your downstroke.
Make your wing tips almost meet, if you can, without stalling.
I can't curl my feathers enough, Grimble.
My wings are too short.
Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's wings were short.
And that didn't stop him.
And you're gonna need to fly a long way to get to the Guardians.
- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole?
- Yeah.
But how will we know where to go?
Well, you have to get to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...yeah, where the Tree is shrouded in ancient mists...
"Which keep it hidden from all but the strong of purpose and the true of heart."
Yeah, exactly.
I'd come with you...
...but I still hold out the hope of freeing my family.
Really?
- Kludd.
- Go!
Kludd, come with us!
Go, now!
Get them!
- Kludd!
- Your little owlets won't get away.
Soren! What do we do?
Soren, we have to go!
Wait. Kludd! Come on!
Now's our chance!
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
This is your chance to go home!
I am.
I am home.
- Eh?
- No.
Would you wound your queen, Grimble?
You're not my queen!
We need to jump now, Soren!
- Now! Aah!
Aah!
Come on, Gylfie! Flap!
Flap your wings!
No! Follow the owlets!
Follow the owlets!
Go, you fools!
Go! Go tell the Guardians!
Look! There! I see a way!
Where? Aah!
Gylfie, come on, follow me!
Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!
I can't, Soren, I just can't.
I have to rest.
No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!
Hey, wait. I think they're gone.
What? Are you sure?
I think so.
Hey, you know what?
What?
We're flying.
Does it feel the way you thought it would?
No.
It feels much better.
What are we gonna do now, Soren?
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Grimble's death was unfortunate.
But you...
You had a chance to follow your brother, yet you didn't.
I'm starting to think that you might actually deserve to stay.
To be one of us.
Oh, I want that.
We offer power and purpose.
What can you offer us?
What can you offer me?
I...
- I have a sister.
- Go on.
She's young, but she's got spirit...
...and will grow into a strong Tyto.
Perhaps you could bring her to me.
Here the young ones are our future.
Are you hungry?
Why?
Watch this.
Hey! Oh, nice hunting.
You should be really proud of yourself...
...catching a moth thaùs already caught.
Wait. You hadn't caught it.
Mm! I was very close.
One might even say I was this close:
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
- Perfect.
Ahem.
An ambush.
Well, I bet you didn't count on this.
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your moth.
- It wasn't his moth.
Yes, it was.
We were just looking for a place to hide and rest.
- In which order?
What do you mean?
Did you need to hide first or rest first?
What difference does it make?
Huge! If you need to hide first,
I'd say you were in big trouble.
But if resting was on your mind,
I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.
We're on our way to the Sea of Hoolemere.
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Really?
Two little owlets like you will never reach the sea.
There are some really scary beasts out that way.
Scary beasts?
If the hawks don't make a quick lunch of you, then the buzzards will.
And if the buzzards don't get you...
...the dingoes wait in the trees and as you fly by they...
Our request remains the same, owl.
Do you have a place to rest?
My frienÔs hurt.
Name's Digger.
The hollow's this way.
Going to the sea, huh?
Yeah.
You know what they call owls who fly towards the sea?
- Uh, no.
- Lost.
Iùs hilarious. I have another one for you.
What do you call an owl...?
Twilight! We've got company!
Put me down this instant! I mean it!
This is highly disrespectful!
Dinner is served.
And she will not stop talking.
Mrs. P! Iùs me, Soren!
Soren!
Oh, it can't be.
Every day, I've been looking for you and Kludd, and then this.
To be snatched up by this monstrosity.
Monstro...? The audacity!
Digger, who are these tiny owls and why are they talking to dinner?
My name is not "dinner."
Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?
Wait. She is not dinner.
She's my nursemaid.
I just hate being driven to hiss.
So unladylike.
Indeed.
Mrs. P, these are my new friends.
This is Gylfie and Digger.
And Twilight, is it?
Charmed to meet you, dinner.
Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.
These two are going to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...to find the Guardians.
- Really?
What?
No, Soren, we need to get you home.
Your parents are so worried.
No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.
Kludd and I were kidnapped.
- Mercy!
- He's still held captive.
I have to find the Guardians.
They're the only ones that can save him.
An adventure afoot!
Danger. Intrigue.
The stuff of songs.
Oh, no. Not the lute.
But such things have no effect on me...
...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.
If you will...
Though his nursemaid tels him no
The boy will not be tamed
He flies off into danger
To be battered, bruised and maimed
Just because iùs sung doesn't make it a song.
That poem just came to me, if you can believe it.
- I think they can believe it.
- Iùs a gift.
Right, well, sounds like we've got a long journey, so...
Mrs. P?
Look, you know iùs what
Da would want.
Thaùs just why I'm coming with you.
What? No! Please do not leave us here.
Yes, you're the first new souls we've seen in eight moons.
If I have to hear any more of his ridiculous owl jokes...
- They're a hoot!
- They are not.
Well, if I have to hear him play one more quote-unquote "song"...
...l'm gonna tear my gizzard out!
How dare you?!
Leùs get out.
Please. Please don't go!
Do you even know the way to the Sea of Hoolemere?
- Twilight knows the way.
- Of course I know the way.
We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.
- Iùs "Hoolemere."
- Hoolemere.
Hey, you know, Mrs. P, you might be the first snake ever to fly.
You know, I think I am.
And I quite like it too.
Oh, my!
Shove it.
- My lord.
Hm?
Our work at St. Aegolius is very nearly done.
The last of the flecks are on their way.
And I've brought you an offering with beating hearts.
Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.
One in particular shows exceptional promise.
I'll be the judge of that.
You. Soldier.
Step forward.
Yes, you're right to be afraid in my presence.
What is your name?
- Kludd.
Speak up.
Ahem. Kludd! My name is Kludd.
There. Thaùs better.
Remember, weakness is for the lower species...
...never for us.
Do you know why, Kludd?
Because we are Tytos.
Oh, I got another one.
- Knock, knock.
Please don't respond.
Who's there?
Don't encourage him.
Owls.
Owls who?
Here it comes.
Ha, thaùs right. Owls whoo!
I told you.
Because owls whoo. Funny.
Absolutely pathetic.
Iùs a very complex one, but iùs...
As the night falls, so do we
we fall asleep
we fall asleep
We continue to fall asleep
we fall asleep
For dreams, they come on highly
Shh! Shh!
We are now asleep
we are now asleep
You know,
I think that crow is following us.
Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.
Know what an owl says when he's pecked by a crow?
Really, Digger, must you?
Ow!
- Thaùs right, "Ow"!
Hey! Get out of here!
Oh, that is it.
Twilight! Your lute!
Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.
- Oh, wait. Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!
Mrs. P!
Come on!
Mrs. P! I'm coming!
Soren, look!
Help!
They're too fast.
I'll get you closer.
We're going to lock talons!
What?
- Trust me! I know what I'm doing!
Yeah, but have you done this before?
No, but I've always wanted to try it!
Hold on!
Mrs. P!
Get out of here! Begone!
Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?
Quite a ride.
Leùs do that again.
Owl, you surely can fly.
Thank you, Twilight.
Well, here we are.
The Sea of Hoolemere.
Iùs just so big.
Yes, iùs a right big puddle there.
I don't know.
You really think the Guardians are out there?
They have to be.
The band!
- Finally.
- Who's there?
Your arrival 'twas foretold.
'Twas foretold trespassers would land on my shore.
Look, we mean you no harm.
Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.
- We've flown a long way.
- Also foretold.
- And we're very tired.
- Foretold!
I know all.
Now, state your desire, owl.
- Well...
- Wait.
If you really know all, then how come you don't know that?
Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be one who doubts.
Is anyone else having trouble with this?
Yes, I kind of am.
Da said, "guided by the spines of the echidna."
Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!
I am the echidna.
And it was foretold you would need some help getting here.
Well, then, I should tell you, we seek the Guardians.
He should already know that.
I do, doubter. Go on.
Da said your spines can guide us.
And they will.
Now, to reach the Tree, keep between the Whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.
Never go outside those stars.
Now, go! All of you.
'Twas foretold that the band would hesitate.
But that in time would become a family.
And a family needs all of its members to play their parts.
The warrior.
Poet warrior, please. Thank you.
Fine, strong and noble.
The tracker, sturdy and faithful.
The navigator, who doubts.
The leader, whose gizzard is strong.
And finally, of course, the heart.
Wait. Are you a snake?
Yes, I am.
You've all come this far, each protecting the other.
So go. Look to the sky, and fly.
All right. Leùs go.
Remember, when your wings are weak...
...your spirits done...
...and you've flown as far as you can...
...you're halfway there!
What did he say?
We're halfway there! Oh, yeah.
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.
We're lost!
I can't find my bearings.
We have to find the island!
We're in the mist.
The Tree must be on the other side.
I can feel it in my gizzard!
Your gizzard?
Does anyone else have any more solid information about how much further it is?
Digger, why are you flying like that?
Like what? You know how I fly.
Iùs not that!
Digger! Your wings!
I think...
Goodbye.
- Digger.
- Digger!
Aah! Digger!
Digger? Digger.
Oh, no. No.
Can you fly with me?
There are...
There are five of us.
Yes. We know.
Can you see whaùs happening?
Out of my way, I can't see.
I can't hear a thing.
Shh!
I wanna see!
I'm concerned about this fleck material of which they speak.
It could be a weapon.
Could be a new shield or armor.
Having examined them, Your Majesty...
...they do show signs of the trials they described.
It beggars belief to think that these brave owlets would fly here by themselves...
...to spin a fairy tale.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?
Oh, good Glaux.
Boron, Your Majesty, if I understand this correctly...
...Metal Beak is not a myth...
...he's building a slave army of moon-blinked owlets...
...and is planning to conquer the world with magical pellet debris.
Without intending any disrespect...
...and particularly to my little friends, who have been through so much...
...such a story simply stretches plausibility too far.
Does that notion strike Ezylryb as amusing?
What cheek!
Whaùs amusing to me is that you would cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.
Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb wishes us to race back to war.
No, no.
Perhaps he'd write a poem about it from his hollow, while the rest of us...
Well, while the rest of us had our talons deformed too.
But I say caution...
...when the losses could be so many.
I would never counsel rushing blindly into war...
...but for a cause such as the one the boy described...
...for a violation of peace so blatant, so powerful...
...of course I'd fight!
What other course to take?
And if you think I'm a coward, or I'd simply urge others on, I'll fight you right now.
Order.
- Boron, you can judge the winner.
Mildly, owls.
We're trying to seek the truth.
The truth?
I told you the truth.
The Pure Ones exist.
They've kidnapped me and dozens of owlets from our hollows.
They want to enslave us all and rule our world without pity.
Yes, the only proof I have are my words.
But words were the only proof I ever had that you were real.
And still, I believed.
And you would argue with that?
I will not argue with it.
Your Majesty, my search and rescue chaw...
...is scheduled to leave on a routine survey during the next full moon.
No.
- Perhaps we could...
You shall leave immediately.
Take your best owls with you, Allomere.
And be thorough.
Wow.
Soren, we did it.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.
I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.
Oh, to be a young owl with a taste for adventure...
...arriving to the Tree for the first time.
Well done to hold your own in there.
Some more nice strong gizzards.
The Tree always needs them.
He is one strange owl.
I think he might be missing a few talons.
And a good bath.
Gross old owl.
You'll want to stay out of his chaw.
- Chaw?
- I'll tell you on the way to dinner.
You're already late.
Look out!
Now, Matron's instructed me to give you lot a rundown on the way we do things here.
During your basic training...
Wait, wait, wait. Basic training?
You don't just become a Guardian overnight. It takes years. Years.
- Hello.
Only our absolute best...
...are chosen to be...
- Wait. Who are you?
Are you going to keep interrupting me?
Now, if, however unlikely, you do have talent...
...you'll be tapped, or selected, for a specialized chaw, or squadron.
There's navigation, healing, search and rescue...
...blacksmithing, weather interpretation, colliering.
I expect to be placed in the navigation chaw myself.
Name's Otulissa, by the way.
I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.
I believe your friends are in there.
Digger! Hi!
How's the food, Digger?
He said "good," but he thinks iùll go better with a little music.
- What?
- And this looks like a decent crowd.
He's actually pretty good, you know.
Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.
Here at the Great Tree...
...every owl trains in different skills we call "chaws."
You'll study tracking...
...navigating, combat.
But maybe you're a blacksmith.
Here I come, here I come.
Digger!
Ow! Hey! Hold it!
Hang on, hang on. Ow!
Fire, boy. Iùs the lifeblood of the Tree.
There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?
Owls.
You must be joking.
Preposterous!
Come back here! I wasn't ready.
Feel the air!
Follow me.
My soldiers, my sons...
...many of you have heard of me in late-night whisperings...
...but I assure you, I am not a myth.
I am real.
And I stand before you with one simple truth:
The strong shall rule the weak.
Long ago, I was viciously attacked by the coward Lyze of Kiel...
...for defending that truth.
Now I wear this mask to conceal my scars.
But the metal is strong.
It is a symbol of the Pure Ones' strength and resolve.
It is time to set a fire that will consume the owl kingdoms...
...and take back what is rightfully ours!
Because we are Tytos!
We are Pure Ones!
And I am Metal Beak!
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
- Kludd?
- Metal Beak.
- Kludd.
- Metal Beak.
I miss Ma and Da.
I'm scared.
Don't be. You're with me now.
Eglantine, this is our home.
They really appreciate us here.
Kludd, please, could we just go find Soren?
Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.
Soren's weak. We're Tytos.
Pure Ones.
Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone what you're doing.
I just wanna go home.
All right, Eg.
So we could go? When?
Tomorrow.
But first, tonight...
...just sleep.
Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?
Yeah. Iùs the Battle of the Ice claws.
You know, this is my da's favorite story.
He used to tell it to us all the time.
Well, your da had good taste in authors.
You enjoying it?
Honestly, iùs not at all like my da told it.
No? How did he tell it?
Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.
You know? Like a great victory.
Well, in these chronicles, I mean, the battle just sounds like...
Like hell?
Come on, boy. Iùs almost first light.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I'm going to teach you how to really fly.
Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.
A scupper!
A swillage!
Baggywrinkles!
"Baggywrinkles"?
He could have at least given us a vocabulary list.
Now, this, this is the way to learn!
Oh, yes! This is exactly how
I want to learn.
In a monsoon!
The air currents warm in different ways, you see...
...from the sky to the ocean.
You can't fight them.
You have to feel them with your gizzards.
Aha! You see that one?
Soren, see it! Iùs there.
Go for it.
Thaùs it! Use your gizzard, boy.
Trust it!
Fly inside.
He sees it.
He sees it.
Hold it. Hold it.
Soren. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, careful, look out!
Soren!
Soren!
Owl, come to my hollow.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon...
...and sleep.
Lord Allomere, the boy was right.
Those owlets, we have to rescue them.
Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.
We don't know what we're up against.
Now, see those bats?
Follow them. I'll wager we'll discover the full extent of their plan.
Hold!
I'll take out that one, you get the two down on the platform.
What is this?
I don't even know what I did with it.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what I did. What did I do?
We flew a great way out here and it was nothing like that.
You've got no reason to worry, boy.
I confess, I guided you into that twister on purpose.
I wanted to test your gizzard.
You were exemplary.
"Exemplary"?
No, no, no.
I nearly had my wings ripped off.
You know, my head said to do one thing while my gizzard was saying to do another.
And you trusted your head.
Thaùs when you failed.
Wait. Is that your mark?
EzYLRYB:
What, this? Yes.
So you wrote the
Chronicle of the Battle of the ice Claws.
I think so.
Well, actually, yes. I did.
- Were you there?
- Yes.
What, as a scribe?
Well, no. As a soldier.
As the, I guess you could say, leader of all the soldiers.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Um... Yes.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Yes. Don't wear it out.
But...
That old thing?
Thaùs only good for gathering coals now.
Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?
All the owls of the Tree know who I am.
But you're...
My days as Lyze are well behind me.
And that battle is a distant memory.
Except, funnily enough, for young owlets like you.
Why didn't you tell me?
What difference does it make what I call myself?
Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.
Yes, well, fancy it must be hard meeting your hero...
...and seeing that he's real and not a myth.
You're just not...
What did you expect?
Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor and battle claws, the moon rising behind him?
Well, this is what it looks like when you've actually fought in battle.
Iùs not glorious, iùs not beautiful.
And iùs not even heroic.
Iùs merely doing whaùs right.
And doing it again and again, even if someday, you look like this.
Something's wrong.
Downed owlets, downed owlets!
- Come fast!
Allomere is back!
Quickly.
Make way.
Some help here.
These owlets need attention.
Fetch it, quick.
- Mommy?
- Iùs okay.
Hey. Hey. What happened?
Lord Allomere rescued two owlets in the Beaks.
It looks like he's hurt.
I think he ran into some of your Pure Ones.
You know, I didn't really believe you before.
Oh, well, thaùs okay. You know,
I wouldn't have believed me either.
Soren! Soren, come fast, iùs Eglantine.
Eglantine?
Let me through! Let me pass!
Been moon blinked.
No.
Do you think you can help her?
We will do our best, Soren.
Eglantine.
Eglantine.
The battle was ferocious.
We were greatly outnumbered.
I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.
But the others...
Can you estimate the number of enslaved owlets, Allomere?
Scores, that I witnessed.
There may well be many more.
And you believe this is part of a larger plan.
It is certain.
Your Majesty, this is no time for half measures.
Hmm.
Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.
To arms.
To arms.
Not a bad fit.
Ezylryb! Lyze.
Yes to both.
Look, I have to go.
You have to take me with you.
Oh, absolutely.
An untrained youth like you could last a whole minute in a real battle.
Here.
Come along.
We could use the talon fodder.
I'd love to throw some bodies at the enemy.
Yeah, but I'm...
Or you could stay here...
...tend to your sister...
...and do some real good.
But what do I know?
I'm just a tired old screech.
Move.
Oh, Eglantine.
I'd trade places with you if I could.
I really would.
You know, I wish it was me lying there instead of you.
Oh, Soren.
Because then you could see this place for yourself, Eg.
You know, Da's stories, they're true.
They're all true.
You know, the Guardians, and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...
Iùs all true
Even Lyze of Kiel. I mean, he's real, Eg.
He's real.
Soren, you promised.
Eg?
You promised I could be Lyze on the next go.
- Oh, Eglantine.
- Oh, Eglantine.
Eglantine.
Soren? Mrs. P?
We're... We're not at home, are we?
We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.
Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.
No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...
Kludd was wrong. Da was right.
He was right all along, Eg.
No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.
He did this to me, Soren.
He's one of them.
He what?
No. No, Eg.
Look, you must be confused.
That can't be.
Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.
I wasn't rescued.
Kludd gave me to the owl who brought me here.
No, Eg, no. Thaùs impossible.
I mean, that would mean that Allomere would have to be a...
Be a traitor.
No, iùs a trap.
Allomere!
Allomere!
We'll follow the Whale's Fin.
Iùs how they would have gone.
I see something.
There.
We should check out that smoke.
Soren, look.
Oh, Allomere.
Is it different when you see the consequences of your betrayal?
- Must it be bats that bleed them?
- Of course.
They have no gizzards to be impaired by the power of the flecks.
Now, my love?
It would be cruel to make them wait any longer.
Finish them.
Well, we can't just leave them down there, writhing in pain.
- Can we?
- No, you don't understand.
When we were at St. Aggie's, we saw what those things can do.
They do something terrible to your gizzard. Isn't that right, Soren?
Soren?
Uh, we've got bats inbound.
Not to worry. I can down a hundred of those bloodsuckers.
Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?
Well, we won't find out sitting on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!
Wait! Just wait.
- Of course.
- Soren, what is it?
The flames. Thaùs it.
I think I see a way to free the Guardians.
No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.
Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.
Twilight, can you take care of the bats?
Friend, I'll give you as much time as I can.
But hurry. And be careful.
Come on!
Twilight, I think if we're going into battle together...
...you'll have to sing your best battle song ever.
- What?
- No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.
Give us your bravest, most inspiring battle song ever!
Brilliant idea, Digger!
Into battle we do fly
Yeah, thaùs it!
No matter if we're going to die
What? Is that supposed to be inspiring?
- Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!
- Oh.
A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot
Even if our wlngs are ripped clean off
No. No!
You told us you'd bring all the Guardians.
But they're not Guardians.
Soren.
They have no chance against the flecks.
Still, I don't think we can trust you anymore, Allomere.
No.
No, no, you promised me.
You promised me I would be
King of the Tree!
You should know, Allomere...
...there is only room for one king.
Hey!
Fly away!
Use your glizzard, boy!
Fly inside.
Soren!
No!
Oh, Soren.
Come on, Soren.
That was exemplary.
But we're not finished yet, boy.
Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo!
Come on.
I bet you didn't count on this.
Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!
Pure Ones, attack!
Crush them!
Before they can recover!
Guardians, we must uphold our oath.
To battle!
I need you to stay here with your friends...
...and guard these owlets.
- Huh?
Unh! Ha, ha!
Come on!
Kludd?
No.
Soren!
Kludd!
Hello, brother.
Hmm?
Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.
Once again, iùs come down to just you and me.
And now I can take my vengeance for this.
You should thank me.
It appears to be an improvement.
Your precious Guardians are finished, Soren.
The Pure Ones will triumph...
...and Tytos will take their rightful place as rulers of the owl kingdoms.
Oh, iùs gonna be glorious!
"Glorious"?
No, the Pure Ones are monsters.
You saw what they were doing.
They were moon blinking other owls and turning them into slaves.
You're just weak, Soren.
Still living in your dreams.
No, my dreams are what make me strong, Kludd.
- They led me to the Guardians.
- Ha-ha-ha.
A pity there won't be any Guardians left after today.
I don't understand.
How could you join the Pure Ones after what they did to us?
"What they did to us"?
They believe in me like no one else ever has.
Metal Beak says the strong will triumph...
...the broken are put out of their misery.
And honor...
...honor is just another word for weakness!
No, Kludd!
I know you don't really think that.
Then you don't know me at all.
Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!
Soren, I'm your brother.
Kludd, no!
Metal Beak.
Be done with it, then.
No!
I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.
Oh, you're not letting me?
Oh, what a pity to waste...
...such a strong, young and confident Tyto.
No, Soren!
Oh. You know this sad old owl.
He's my teacher. My hero.
Well, your hero can teach you one last lesson about Pure Ones' strength...
Don't move.
...by letting you watch him die.
Hmm.
Unh!
Ha, ha.
Pure Ones! Fall back!
To me!
Soren, you did what was right.
And you did it well.
It seems we will have to amend the Chronicles. Huh?
As it was in the old ages...
...so it was in the new.
The Guardians upheld their oath that night.
I foretold you so!
They made strong the weak and mended the broken.
And when the sun shone again that morning...
...all could see that they had vanquished the evil.
Soren! Soren!
- Oh, Eg.
- Ha, ha!
Are there any casualties?
- We're so proud of you.
- Ha, ha!
- Da, the stories...
- Ha, ha.
...they're real.
You made them real, Soren.
With the peace restored...
...it was a time for celebration...
...and recognition that our small band of owls...
...who fate and a storm had blown into the Tree...
...now stood before its king and queen as young Guardians.
Eady finally, with all their hearts...
...to take that ancient oath:
To mend those who are broken...
...to make strong the weak...
...and, without hesitation...
...vanquish the evil.
For as we know...
...Nyra escaped.
And Kludd?
Well, Kiudd was never found.
Should I stop?
What? Please, don't stop.
I don't wanna give anyone daymares.
Oh, come on.
There must be more, there must be.
Ha, ha. Listen to them, Soren.
They want more stories.
Well, come on, you lot.
Leùs not disappoint them.
Ah. There's a good storm brewing.
And if we're lucky, iùll be chock full of baggywrinkles.

It's so cold.
Come inside and warm up with Freidrich.
Come here. Yes.
Hello. Hello.

I found a new companion for you.
Say hi to your new friend. "Hello."
"I'm your new friend. We are friends."
Rex!
Stop it! It's only a little puppy.
Now you sound angry.
Stop it! He can hear you!
Close your mouth.
No! Rex! This is so illogical!
Rex! Rex, what's wrong with you?
Come. Come. Outside. No!

Sit! Sit! Sit down! We have a guest.
[DOOR CLOSES]
You will stay out here till you learn how to behave!
Oh, no. Locked?
But how?
Meow.
[LAUGHING]
State your business.
Agent 127 breaking radio silence.
I have spotted Kitty Galore.
I repeat, I have spotted Kitty Galore.
We've all seen his commercials...
...but today it appears Crazy Carlito really is off his rocker.
He's claimed his prices are insane.
Now it appears he is too.
The situation is tense as we wait for someone to come end this standoff.
Shane, get over here.
Diggs, stay.
Give me the situation, captain.
We've got a first-class nutcase here.
Four hostages inside.
All used-car salesmen.
I've got mixed feelings about this one.
DIGGS: That wacko so much as changes channels on that thing...
...and this whole lot explodes.
Only one thing to do here.
You are mine. You are so mine.
Yeah.
CARLITO: I'll do it!
- All I can...
CARLITO: Come any closer and the last thing you'll hear is "boom"!
Diggs. No.
Diggs!
Get out of there! Get out!
- Get out!
- Guys, let's go!
SHANE:
Get out of there! Diggs!
Diggs, go, go!
CARLITO: You want fireworks,
I'll show you fireworks!
All I have to do is push this button...
...and boom!
[BEEPING]
Oh, yeah!
Diggs! No!
MAN 1: It's gonna blow!
MAN 2: Hold those people back!
Uh-oh.
MAN 2:
Take cover! I repeat! Take cover!
BUTCH:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
You wanna recruit that guy?
He just blew up a car dealership!
A used-car dealership.
True, he may not be a great cop.
But he has the potential to be a great agent.
He's fearless, barks in the face of danger, and is trained in paw-to-paw combat.
Plus the only thing he hates more than following orders...
...is cats.
Well, hating cats is good.
And exactly what we need to take down Kitty Galore.
Fine. But I don't know who you'll find dumb enough to partner with him.
Easy. I'm barking right at him.
Woof.
[GROANS]
- Suspended?
- This dog is a disaster.
We've sent him to obedience school, what, three times now?
And he still won't listen.
Don't put him back in the system.
He's been in and out of kennels his whole life. He's never had a home.
I'll tell you what, I will adopt him.
Sorry, Shane. He's state property.
Besides, you have a new baby now.
You don't need this kind of trouble at home. Let him go, Shane.
Let him go.
SHANE:
Captain, please don't make me do this.
DOG:
Nice one, Diggs.
SHANE:
I'm sorry, Diggs.
I know you tried.
You always try.
Just sometimes a little too hard.
Like this cop thing.
Sometimes you just gotta play with others.
It's not always about being the top dog.
Diggs, I'm sorry, buddy.
I'll do everything I can to get you out of here.
Until then, you be a good boy.
I love you, buddy.
This isn't so bad, right?
How's it going, floor? What's up, cage?
Que pasa, bowl?
Did you guys miss me?
Because I'm back!
Back in the kennel again.
Hey! What...? What the...?
Okay, okay, this is creeping me out.
Hello? Anyone home?
Hello?
Whoa.
Uh-oh.
Who are you?
When did they put an elevator in there?
Name's Special Agent Butch, and against better judgment...
...you're being recruited into an organization...
...to help fight the spread of radical felinism.
Okay, is somebody pulling my tail here?
This isn't a joke, Diggs.
- How do you know my name?
- I just came up out of the floor.
Let's assume I'm smart enough to know your name.
While you and your cop buddies are here chasing your tails...
...there's an elite team of dogs charged with the noble responsibility...
...of protecting mankind.
We want you to join that team.
This is a one-time-only offer, Diggs.
I suggest you say yes.
It's tempting, but I can't just say yes to every offer that comes through that floor.
Kid, you already spent half your life locked up in this place.
There's a good chance you'll spend the rest of your life here.
But the choice is yours.
You can stay here and fight roaches over your kibble...
...or you can come with me and fight cats.
Fight cats? Why didn't you say so?
Now, move over, Rover, this dog's ready to hunt!
Oh, my dog!
I just vacuumed the seats, so try not to shed.
[DIGGS SCREAMS]
DIGGS:
Come on!
Wow, we're going really fast, aren't we?
This is nice! This is enjoyable.
I'm enjoying this.
BUTCH: Sure you're okay, big shot?
DIGGS: Fine, good.
No, not good. Not good.
Yeah, I'm gonna barf.
[CHUCKLING]
BUTCH: This is Agent 3293.
I've got the package.
[DIGGS SCREAMING]
Careful, now. New recruits sometimes get a little woozy after their first ride.
[MUMBLING]
Are you okay there, rookie?
Yeah, I'm good. Totally fine.
I'm just gonna lay down here till the room stops spinning.
Let's go, superdog.
The fun's just beginning.
DIGGS: I think we have different definitions of "fun."
Just wait.
Now prepare yourself, kid.
You're about to experience something no human and very few canines ever see.
Greetings, Agent Butch.

ANNOUNCER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Congratulations, Agent Buttercup...
... on the birth of your son, son, daughter, son, daughter, daughter...
... son, daughter, son.
Have a seat, gentlemen.
No, off. Off the couch.
- Off the couch!
- Sorry. Sorry.
You guys were outside, and you're dirty.
Because we're field agents, Lou.
We can't all be desk jockeys like you, sitting around wearing ugly sweaters.
Hey, I like this sweater.
It was a gift from my grandma.
Can you give it back?
[LAUGHS]
So you're the dog who likes to blow up buildings.
Yeah, that was an accident.
You seem to have a lot of accidents, Diggs.
Can we just cut to the chase already and get to why I'm here?
Of course. Three hours ago, we intercepted this transmission...
...from a mysterious villain from the feline underworld.
We believe this was meant for all cats.
Take a look.
Greetings, my future feline followers.
My name is Kitty Galore.
Is that even a cat?
And may I present the most adorable creature in my life, little Scrumptious.
- Say hello, darling.
- Help me.
The age of the dog as man's so-called "best friend" is over!
In two days, I will unleash a sound only those droolbag dogs can hear.
A sound so devastating, so terrifying...
... it will drive all dogs completely insane.
I call this sound the Call of the Wild!
Once the dogs go woo-hoo, humans will be forced to get rid of them...
... and without their protection,
I will enslave all mankind!
[CACKLING]
MAN:
Kitty! I'm home!
Nothing will stop me from ruling the world. Kitty Galore out!
That cat makes the hair on my butt stand up.
Kitty has been number one on our "most wanted" list for a year.
Last week, she and her henchcat, Paws, resurfaced in Germany...
...and stole top-secret satellite codes.
Our sources also tell us Paws recently tried to eliminate this pigeon, Seamus.
[SINGING]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
[GASPS]
SEAMUS: Can't a bird take a bath without it ending up on the Internet?
We don't know what the connection is, but Seamus is our only link to Kitty.
We find him, he can lead us to her.
We have less than two days to find Kitty...
...before she activates her
Call of the Wild.
Your mission:
Fetch and retrieve that bird.
Easy enough. Just give me some bread, a big net and a hammer.
We need him alive.
Okay, scratch the hammer.
So you have your assignment.
Find Seamus before the cats do.
[CHATTERING]
KITTY:
You let Seamus get away?
It's just impossible to find good help these days.
That rat with wings has vital information that could destroy my entire plan.
We cannot let that happen, now, can we, little Scrumptious?
Paws!
What are you waiting for?
I want this pigeon Seamus in your mouth...
...on my doorstep immediately.
Out! I said out!
Out! Out! Out!
What's wrong with this stupid mouse?
Oh!
Oh, Scrumptious.
Now, now, I barely crushed you.
Think how lucky you are. You could be living in that jungle instead of our new lair.
Isn't this wonderful?
It's perfect.
MAN:
Kitty! I'm home!
Almost perfect.
Oh, look! Kitty! You think those are real fishies, don't you?
That's adorable.
Great news.
We are headliners!
Would you believe it was only two months ago when I walked in here to find you...?
Oh.
I see what you're thinking.
A new opening, right?
Of course! That's genius. Pure genius.
Now we...
[KITTY HISSES]
You are excited! Every magician needs one of these. Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Kitty.
BUTCH:
This is the rendezvous point.
The pigeon we're looking for flew into that building.
Now, remember what Lou said:
Follow my lead.
When I say "Wag your tail," you ask "How hard?" Got it?
DIGGS: What's with the fanny pack?
BUTCH: Shh!
We can stop playing games, boy.
I know you don't want none of this.
You don't wanna come out.
You hiding because you don't want the:
[YELLS INDISTINCTLY]
Now, watch this maneuver, kid.
I call it "Fetch a Stick."
- Hm?
BUTCH: Come on. Come on. Go get it.
Let's go.
DIGGS:
Ha-ha. Sucker.
I don't know why, but this building appeals to me.
BUTCH: Of course it does.
It looks like a giant fire hydrant.
DIGGS:
Yep, that's it.
This would go faster if you didn't watch me.
BUTCH:
Come on, hurry up!
By the time you're done, the bird will have flown.
[CHUCKLES]
CATHERINE:
Say hello to my little friend.
DIGGS:
It's quiet. A little too quiet.
[CLATTERS]
Butch, it's time to take out the trash!
What are you doing?
DIGGS:
Where do you think you're going, punk?
Hey! Hey! Easy! Easy! Watch the teeth!
Stand down! That bird's our informant. He works for us.
Informant? Work?
I do neither of these things.
- And when's the last time you had a mint?
- You Seamus?
That is privileged information.
Who wants to know?
Are you kidding me? Dog HQ sent us to protect you. Now, let's go.
Good. It's about...
Wait a second!
How do I know you don't work for the cats?
"The crow flies at midnight."
What? What crow?
What's he talking about?
That's the passphrase.
And you answer with, "The eagle..."
SEAMUS:
"Owes me five bucks."
- Ugh. Close enough.
SEAMUS: No, no, wait. Hang on, I'll get it.
- Was it a penguin?
- I just told you it was an eagle!
- "Is a ballerina."
- All right, enough.
Why does Kitty Galore have a price on your beak?
I don't know! I never met her!
That was my cousin Nicky's business.
Kitty wouldn't be after you if you didn't know something.
Nicky just crashed at my pad sometimes.
I don't know anything.
My brain is the size of a grape!
Or a raisin. A big raisin or a little grape.
Don't get your feathers all ruffled.
You're completely safe, now that we're...
- Uh!
- Oh!
SEAMUS: Look out!
Assassin with a rolled-up newspaper!
No sweat. It's just a little kitty cat.
Hand over the bird.
Ooh. A girl kitty cat.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Hey, hey!
What the...?
- Oh, now it is on, furball!
BUTCH: Diggs!
- Protect the bird. I'll take the cat.
- You protect the bird. That cat's all mine.
You can both have the cat.
I'm out of here!
I told you to watch the bird!
CATHERINE:
See you, ladies. I gotta fly!
DIGGS: Hey!
- Whoa.
You always do it your way, don't you, hotshot?
You're right, I should have seen a flying cat coming. What the...?
No way! Did your backpack just turn into a jet?
Diggs! Hang tight!
I'm going after that bird!
DIGGS:
Not without me!
[DIGGS YELLS]
SEAMUS: Oh, no!
- Hey! What the...?
BUTCH: Stop it! I can't see!
DIGGS: Billboard, billboard, billboard!
BUTCH:
I'm too old for this poop!
SEAMUS: Wait! I have a dozen eggs waiting for me at home.
You can have six of them.
Oh, no!
Follow me through this, cat!
CATHERINE:
Careful what you wish for.
SEAMUS: I didn't mean follow me for real,
I was playing.
Float like a butterfly, sting like a pi... Ah!
Mayday, mayday!
CATHERINE:
I've got you, bird.
[YELLING]
Come on, Miss Daisy, can't this thing go any faster?
This is only built for one, rookie!
SEAMUS:
Hide me, my brothers!
CATHERINE:
You're not gonna lose me that easy.
SEAMUS: What you doing?
- It's the end of the line, bird!
- I'm almost on top of her!
DIGGS: No, I got her!
BUTCH:
Hey! Are you crazy?
[GRUNTING]
DIGGS:
Hey, a squirrel.
Oh, boy. This is not good.
SEAMUS: Can't fly too well with a broken wing, can you?
Ouch.
Oh, my wing. Oh, that doesn't look right.
BUTCH:
Collar: Net!
You busted my favorite wing.
Get ready for a lawsuit, lady. Ha!
- Mom, Mom, look at me.
WOMAN: Wow.
You're going really fast, kiddo.
We've been at this all night.
Now, for the last time, where's Kitty Galore?
I don't know!
No! No!
Don't like the water, huh?
Anything but water! I beg you.
Diggs, that is not a valid interrogation technique.
Back off, Butch.
This is how we do things downtown.
Think I'm gonna fall for your
"good dog, bad dog" routine?
- Human!
SEAMUS: Hide. Hide. Hide.
Hey, doggies.
[SNIFFING]
Ew. Ugh, yuck.
Guys, question: Why is butt-sniffing always your fallback position?
Hey, don't knock it till you've sniffed it. Now, talk!
No, no more water! No more...
TAB [OVER RADIO]: Agent 47?
CATHERINE: Tab?
- We're getting...
- Can you hear me?
Have you been compromised?
Aw, man. Where'd you get one of those fancy collars?
"Agent"? Wait. If you're not working for Kitty Galore, who are you?
Name's Catherine. I'm with MEOWS.
MEOWS? Collar: Laser.
Wait! Hold on, hold on. What's MEOWS?
Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety.
Feline intelligence.
Feline intelligence, huh?
Okay, quick, what's eight times eight?
- Sixty-four.
- Ha! Wrong!
It's eight, carry the three, move the two...
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
MEOWS protects the world's cats against the pooch peril.
- That's you, Rover.
- Human!
SEAMUS:
Hide. Hide. Hide.
GIRL:
Can't you doggies do anything else?
Ugh. Why is this always our fallback position?
You weren't hired by Kitty Galore to find the bird?
CATHERINE:
Wrong again, fleabag.
My mission is to find her and take her down.
See, Kitty Galore, a.k.a. Ivana Clawyu...
...was one of MEOWS' best agents until a year ago.
KITTY:
No. Don't come any closer.
CATHERINE: She was on assignment at a cosmetics factory...
... when a guard dog chased her into a vat of hair-removal cream.
[SCREAMS]
[CACKLING]
Hairless beyond recognition and humiliated by her fellow agents...
... Ivana left MEOWS and returned to her home.
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
WOMAN: What is that hideous thing?
It's freaking out the dog! Get that thing out!
MAN:
Scram!
KITTY:
But it's Christmas.
I'll make them pay.
After that, she went rogue, changed her name to Kitty Galore...
...and has been bent on revenge ever since.
Wait. If she wants to destroy all dogs, why are you trying to stop her?
Contrary to your belief, all cats aren't evil.
We care about humans as much as you do.
Kitty wants revenge on dogs and humans, and that is why she must be stopped.
- Hey, doggies.
- What is wrong with you, kid?
How many times can you go down the same slide?
I'm sorry. I mean... I mean coo.
Mommy! Mommy!
We've been compromised.
Unless you turn into a parrot, never talk in front of humans!
Listen, I know Kitty. She's coming after this bird, and you'll need my help.
Sorry, Agent LicksAIot, no cats allowed.
Something we agree on.
You guys don't have a choice.
Just try and stop me.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
MAN:
Officer Larson, this is Officer Raymond.
- Your K-9 partner, Diggs, is missing.
- What?
During today's rounds, his cage was vacant. He seems to be lost.
How do you lose Diggs?
He's not officially lost.
We're filing the appropriate papers.
Go back and check for him.
He didn't fall through the floor!
Yes, sir.
Sorry, honey, I'll be back.
Diggs is missing.
ANNOUNCER: Today's specials are leftover meatloaf and bacon.
Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!
Follow me, cat. For your own good,
I suggest you avoid sudden moves.
The 7 p.m. Screening of Scooby-Doo is now sold out. Tickets still available...
Wait! Is that a cat?
Hm?
SEAMUS:
Why is everybody looking at me...
...like they've never seen a crippled pigeon riding on a dusty dog?
LOU:
Would you guys stay out of there?
Patches, no, that computer is not a chew toy.
Hey, get your tail out of that pencil sharpener.
Cookie, stop barking at your brother!
Where's the Dog Whisperer when you need him?
At least they're not wearing sweaters.
The wife is at the groomers today, so I'm watching the litter.
[BEEPING]
Uh-oh.
Patches, take your brothers outside.
Let's go!
LOU:
And don't take treats from strangers!
Kids.
Tab Lazenby.
So you're the new fat cat at MEOWS.
And when I say "fat cat," I mean you might wanna switch to the skim milk.
Oh, Lou, so catty. I see they've given you the key to the executive Dumpster.
All that butt-sniffing paid off.
But enough pleasantries.
You have one of my operatives.
I understand that Kitty Galore is one of yours too.
She's our spilled milk. We'll lick it up.
You can't begin to imagine how dangerous she is.
She'll never stop until she has her revenge.
She's threatening us, Tab.
It takes a dog to chase a cat.
But it'll take a cat to catch this kitty.
This isn't about who should go after Kitty.
It's about protecting the humans.
She's right. We can't just sit around arguing jurisdiction.
Unless...
Now, this would be a first in our political history.
With 24 hours left on Kitty's deadline, we may have no other choice.
- Cats and dogs will have to work together.
- Cats and dogs will have to work together.
[GASPING]
[WHINES]
That ain't right.
What? No way, man. Work with her?
Why don't we go ahead and make an alliance with the mailman?
Diggs! Wait outside with Seamus.
Work with cats? I'd rather have worms.
- Outside! Now!
- Ugh.
Where I'm from, we don't play with cats.
- We chase them.
- Bye-bye, now.
Lou, the kid's got a point. We can't just work with cats. We can't trust them.
LOU:
You're being dramatic.
What do these guys want from me?
I can't work with a cat.
But I don't wanna go back to the kennel.
You ever live in a cage, my friend?
Ha. I wish.
The little swings, free sunflower seeds, that little mirror to hang with.
Man, I wish I was back with my partner, Shane.
Now, that was a sweet setup.
You know who has the sweetest setup? Cats. Mm-mm-mm.
Talk about cushy.
They're pampered like royalty.
This one house my cousin Nicky used to work at for Kitty Galore...
...it was a feline paradise.
House? What house?
Butch! I think I know where we can find Kitty!
SEAMUS:
This is historic.
Three species coming together, putting aside our differences to solve a mystery.
This is like the Dream Team, except we ain't dreaming.
Pick up your paws, y'all.
We're almost there.
What are you talking about?
Is there a soundproof bag we can stuff him in?
SEAMUS: This is the joint where Nicky smuggled stuff for Kitty Galore. I think.
No, it is, I'm positive.
Sixty-five percent sure.
I could go up to 67, but I'm de...
Oh, look, a potato bug!
BUTCH: Stay alert. Kitty could be ready to pounce inside.
SEAMUS: We're on an epic quest.
Through foreign lands.
Learning about each other.
And a little about ourselves.
Collar: Lockpick.
Look out!
Whoa, man!
Hey. It's, like, a bunch of dogs, man.
Awesome.
Hey, are we related?
CAT:
Dude, I saw it blink.
What's up with these guys?
Hopped up on catnip.
Cat ladies, such enablers.
Okay, stay on your toes, team.
Let's move.
Oh, boy.
Does schnookems want attention?
Oh, lovely.
Beautiful pussycat. Beautiful puss.
Oh, dear.
- Hey, try and keep up, schnookems.
CATHERINE: Go play in traffic.
ROCKY:
Shake a tail feather, I'm on the clock.
CALICO:
Here's what we got:
One fresh microchip, and, oh, a thingamajig with a button on it.
All right. It looks like one of Kitty's henchcats.
The key word here is "stealth."
No one makes a move till I say so.
Excuse me. I'm a cat. I think I know a thing or two about stealth.
I wasn't talking to you.
- I was talking to the rookie.
- Less talk, more rock!
Everybody down on the flo...!
Whoa-ooh!
ROCKY:
Beat it, it's the cops!
I have underwear on my head, don't I?
I said stealth!
You just lost us one of our leads.
Oh, hey! How's it going?
- I want answers.
- No, I want answers.
No, I want answers.
CATHERINE:
No, I want answers.
I'll give both of you guys answers.
I'm an encyclopedia of answers.
All right. Where's Kitty Galore?
She's... l... Who?
- Let me at him!
- Ah!
[ALARM WAILING]
SEAMUS:
Is it supposed to do that?
CATHERINE:
What the...?
I'm going to guess, no, it's not supposed to do that!
This is not good.
Ha-ha! You fools!
In five minutes this room will fill up, and you're all gonna drown in kitty litter!
Bet you weren't expecting that, suckers!
But you're inside too.
No! I'm long gone!
Outside, safe and sound...
...while you losers are in here, trapped in a rising tide of...
I mean, l...
[YELLS]
Get me out of here!
I'll tell you anything! Anything!
And with that, I am officially no longer the dumbest animal in the room.
CATHERINE:
The window! We can get out the window!
If we all work together, we can reach it.
We'll form a dog-cat pyramid.
You step on my back,
Catherine will step on yours.
She'll scratch me.
How about I get on her back?
Why don't you just try it and see what happens?
I'll do it!
[SNIFFING]
Goodness. Someone made a schtinky.
Why can't you go in the yard like a normal animal?
Like a dog, rushing in without thinking.
You two wanna live or keep fighting?
WOMAN: Does schnookems need to be let outside?
[SCREAMS]
Whoa. Did you see that?
Yeah, I know!
Wait, what are we talking about?
CALICO: You guys aren't mad, are you?
CATHERINE: Where's Kitty?
Start talking, or these dogs are gonna rip into you like a bag of Snausages.
Okay, okay!
Look, I don't know where Kitty is, but I can tell you this.
For months now,
Kitty has been stealing technology...
... from, like, NASA...
... the Pentagon...
You should've seen what we got from Bill Gates' cat, Mr. Windows.
Now, I'm just the middlecat.
I take the parts, give them to pigeon couriers...
...and they fly them to a secret location.
Which is where?
How would I know? It's a secret.
- Sounds like she's building something.
- But what?
Who can understand the mind of a crazy old cat?
- I know!
- Wait, what?
You know what she's building?
No. I know a crazy old cat.
Ha-ha-ha!
BUTCH:
Okay, guys.
This cat is nuts, but he might lead us to Kitty.
Unless you want a bone buried where the sun don't shine...
...let me do all the talking.
DIGGS:
Yes, sir, captain. Captain. Mr. Man.
BUTCH:
Keep pushing me, Diggs.
Now, watch your step.
And stay close. Things could get hairy.
SEAMUS: If I grow any hair, I am leaving.
I can't do hair and feathers.
It's just miserable but I like the...
What? What?
Wait up! Don't leave me!
Hey, birdy-birdy. Mm.
Check out my ink.
[LAUGHS]
Oh, how cute, he hearts his mommy.
Oh, what a cute...
[ROARS]
Can we leave now?
CAT:
You look tasty.
Tasty? Why, thank you. I try to keep fit.
BUTCH:
Mr. Tinkles.
We need the insight of your twisted mind to locate Kitty Galore.
- Lf you were to build a doomsday device...
- You'll never find love, you know.
I can tell by the way you're sitting.
So apart from the others.
They wouldn't invite any ordinary cat, would they?
No.
You're an agent. With MEOWS.
Spying on your own brothers and sisters?
Naughty little girl.
But that takes a very special kind of feline.
Someone dedicated, driven and very angry.
But at who? Daddy?
Who's your daddy, Catherine?
That's enough!
Butch! You look old. And fat.
And after all these years, still only a field agent?
Listen here, you freaky cat.
We're here to talk about Kitty Galore.
Who the heck are you?
That bulge under your left ear...
You were implanted with a RFID microchip.
I'm guessing police work.
My, my, so young to be dismissed from the force.
Tell me, officer, do you hate me?
Do you wanna chew me up and spit me out...
...as has been done to you in relationship after relationship?
[WHIMPERS]
Ooh! Ooh! Do me next! Do me!
What color am I thinking of?
The last bird who stood this close to me...
...well, I enjoyed his company with a plate of Fancy Feast...
...and a nice saucer of milk.
Th-th-th-th.
[COUGHING]
Hairball.
I was thinking of blue, Creepy McGee.
Originally I was thinking yellow, but yellow's so obvious.
Dogs.
[CACKLING]
Hey, Kitty, I got news.
What is the world coming to?
Cats and dogs can't work together!
What to do? What to do?
Aha. Paws! Time to call in...
...the MacDougall twins.
I always wondered what Garfield would look like in a dress.
Betrayed by my own kind.
I guess it's just you and me,
Scrumptious.
Wait. Where's Scrumptious?
Scrumptious? Scrumptious?
Scrumptious?
I'm here! In here!
You animal!
Spit him out! Spit him out!
If anyone eats that mouse, it's gonna be me!
CHUCK:
Kitty!
Okay, Scrumptious, not a squeak.
CHUCK:
Close your eyes!
I have got a surprise for you!
Kitty, now, watch carefully.
For our big opening, you are gonna go in here, like this.
Now, let's see. Sword A into slot B.
The crowd "oohs" and "ahhs"...
...as I put sword D into slot...
...seven?
And then I say the magic words,
"Abracadabra..."
And then:
Ta-da!
Ooh, ooh! Ooh.
That was wrong.
DIGGS: Enough pussy-footing around,
Tinkles! Where's Kitty Galore?
TINKLES:
All right, everybody, chill.
There is one way to defeat Kitty Galore.
- Step one: Release me immediately.
- What? Forget it.
- Step two: I need a space shuttle.
- No.
Oh, all right. You guys are no fun.
Look, I can't help you fight other villains, all right? It's a professional courtesy thing.
I'd be blackballed, laughed at.
I'd lose my pension.
However, I will say this.
A cat's eye reveals everything.
What? What's that supposed to mean?
It's a riddle, Sherlock.
I was trying to be mysterious.
Oh, never mind.
And now, leave!
I'm planning my escape, you know.
Yeah? Good luck with that.
What? Good luck?
For the great Tinkles?
An evil genius doesn't need good luck.
Although, I could use a passport and a speedboat.
Cats rule.
There. That ought to do it.
SEAMUS:
What was Tinkles talking about?
"A cat's eye reveals everything."
That don't even make no sense.
Tinkles doesn't know where Kitty Galore is.
He's manipulative, he's psychotic.
In other words, your typical feline.
Psychotic is chasing a ball when it's just gonna be thrown again.
What a pointless activity.
The game of fetch is one of the most exciting outdoor sports...
...this side of squirrel chasing.
- Would you two please muzzle it?
Now, where is that stupid bird
Kitty wants us to knock off? Ha!
There you are.
[CACKLING]
What? What's happening, Angus?
Let me see.
Duncan, would you be quiet!
After the mission, can we get ice cream?
Yes, yes, yes, we can get ice cream.
Now be quiet!
DUNCAN:
I love ice cream.
ANGUS [OVER SPEAKERS]:
Attention, humans!
This is your captain, Angus MacNot-a-cat!
There's a whale up front and he's taking song requests!
And he's made of candy.
Go now! Go.
Something's up.
Oh, hello, little red dot.
Hey. Hold up. What the...?
Seamus, what are you doing?
Catherine?
CATHERINE:
Look out! The MacDougall twins!
DIGGS:
The MacWhats?
- Catherine, look out!
- No!
- Diggs, what'd you do that for?
DIGGS: I'm not sure.
BUTCH:
Catherine, protect that pigeon.
I'll get the cat!
Wait! I love Scotland.
And the Scotch tape.
- Where'd you go?
- And Braveheart.
Collar: Laser!
Have fun!
What...?
Batter up!
Look! There's the whale.
Butch, if you're not too busy.
Need a little help!
BUTCH:
Diggs, hold still.
I'll use my laser.
Now, don't move a paw!
DUNCAN:
Yippee ki yay, little puppy!
SEAMUS: Hey, Catherine!
We got a doggy overboard!
- Do something, I'm slipping!
CATHERINE: Diggs!
No! I can't. It's the water. I never...
We'll call Dr. Phil later.
But right now I need some help.
Take that! And you're lucky I don't smack you upside your cat head.
Kick him in the bagpipes, Butch!
ANGUS:
I've got you in my sights, you wee bird!
DUNCAN:
What are you doing?
[YELLING]
Now it's my turn.
DUNCAN: Now, don't be hasty, dog.
I was just having a wee bit of fun.
Fun?
Mom, Mom! It's happening again.
What?
Honey, there's nothing there.
- Hey! Just a friendly reminder.
- Seamus!
Your mission is still to protect...
...me!
Catherine, snap out of it.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I've never seen so much of it.
Oh, God, I can't even look at it.
I wanna help you, but...
- Here goes nothing!
- Diggs, no!
[DIGGS SCREAMS]
DIGGS:
No guts, no glory.
No brakes!
Gotcha.
Take that! How's your fancy suit working out for you now, fur face?
Wait.
Where's Kitty Galore?
Preparing the Call of the Wild.
Soon your feeble canine brains will feel her wrath, and dogkind will crumble!
Smack him around!
Your pecking days are over, bird.
Kitty knows your pal Nicky gave you the blueprints.
Blueprints? What blueprints?
Let go, let go.
Stand down, Diggs.
I'll question him from here.
- Negative.
- That's enough! I said stand down!
I got him, pops. I know what I'm...
[ANGUS SCREAMING]
Hey, Angus. Now can we get ice cream?
BUTCH:
Diggs! You've ruined everything.
First you let the carrier pigeon get away.
Then you almost drowned us in kitty litter.
And now you've let the MacDougalls escape!
Well, I didn't blow up the ferry.
I mean, that's something.
I've had it with you. You're untrainable.
I told Lou you didn't have what it takes to be an agent, and I was right.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying go home, Diggs.
You're off this team.
I don't wanna be rude, but the bird's still all good, right?
Come on, Seamus. We've got work to do.
What about you?
I'll catch up with you.
I need to check in with MEOWS first.
Suit yourself.
SEAMUS:
Good luck, dog.
You don't have to pretend to check in with MEOWS...
...just so you can thank me for saving your life.
Uh, I do have to check in with MEOWS.
Oh, right.
But I, um, also want to thank you for saving my life.
- Hey, you're hurt.
- No, I'm fine.
Well, too bad, tough guy.
You're coming with me to get fixed up.
- Sir, you haven't seen this dog, have you?
- Sorry.
[PHONE RINGS]
- Hello?
JACKIE: Hi, sweetheart, it's me.
- Hey, honey.
- How's it going? Did you find him?
No, nothing yet.
I can't believe I let this happen.
It wasn't your fault.
You're doing everything you can.
Yeah, I know. I just feel like
I'm so close to finding him.
Come home and we'll look together.
KITTY: Where is he? Where is he?
SCRUMPTIOUS: Hey!
- Hey!
KITTY: I'm running out of time.
- Where is that stupid pigeon?
- I don't know.
Hey, there's my cat.
What do you say there, Kitty?
And where have you been?
Hey, calm down.
Can't a guy take a statue break?
KITTY: Excellent. This computer chip is the last piece I need.
Now no one can stand in my way.
[LAUGHING]
[CLATTERING]
ROCKY: What was that?
- That, my dear?
That's just a loose end that's conveniently tied itself up.
CHUCK:
Kitty!
CATHERINE: My humans are out tonight, so relax while I check in with MEOWS.
Come on, Diggs.
Just one paw after the other.
- Lf my nieces give you any trouble...
- Nieces?
Look, guys. Auntie Catherine brought home a friend. And he's a doggy!
Okay. Um...
Hi. Hello.
Catherine, could you help me out here?
This is too adorable for my taste.
[CHUCKLES]
Is it true there's a spot on your tummy, and if I tickle it, your foot will shake?
No, that's just a myth.
Ah! Whoo!
You found it! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy, that's it.
- All right, girls. That's enough.
DIGGS: Man.
- Aw.
CATHERINE: Leave the poor mutt alone.
KITTEN 1: No fair.
KITTEN 2: Bye-bye, puppy.
CATHERINE:
Now, let's have a look at that paw.
Oh, it's just a little splinter.
Really? It feels like a giant six-inch spike. Like a... Ouch!
Oh, come on.
My nieces are tougher than that.
Yeah, they're unbelievable.
I mean, I'm a dog.
I can't believe they don't hate me.
Well, I guess they haven't learned to yet.
Anyway, listen, thanks for fixing me up.
I should be heading home now.
Home, huh? So where do you live?
Oh, uh, well, it was over at the...
You know, I'm kind of between homes right now, so I'll probably just...
I'll just head back to the kennel.
The kennel? That's terrible.
No, it's fine. Really, it's fine.
Diggs, how much time have you spent in kennels?
I guess I was just a pup when I first got dropped off.
My owner said he'd be right back, but...
Well, how did you finally get out?
My man, Shane. He's a cop.
I guess he saw something in me nobody else did.
Made me his partner.
And I swore I was never gonna let him down.
There was no way I was ever gonna wind up in the kennel again.
And then what?
I wound up in the kennel again.
No matter how hard I try,
I just keep messing things up.
Or blowing things up.
Uh, could all of this have something to do with...
...not being able to follow an order to save your life?
But it's not like I don't wanna follow orders.
It's just, I learned pretty early on...
...that the only one I could count on, the only one I could really trust, was me.
That way, no one could ever let me down.
Yeah, but no one can help you either.
Right.
[SONG PLAYING]
Hey, funky doorbell.
No, it's MEOWS. Come on, let's go.
DIGGS:
A room full of cats? Try and stop me!
Oh, man, here we go again.
I was born in a box bigger than this.
CATHERINE:
Ouch! Will you get off my tail? Hang on.
DIGGS: Oh, right, the dropping-floor thing,
I've seen one... Oh!
Uh... Little help here?
CATHERINE:
Welcome to MEOWS.
Whoa.
This is not an emergency, sir.
You still have seven lives left.
Okay, Diggs, no barking, no drooling...
...and definitely no chasing my colleagues.
Tab, Agent 47 reporting for duty.
ANNOUNCER: Alert! Alert!
The perimeter has been breached.
Guys, please, can you stop running?
I'm fighting the urge to chase you.
No, no, Tab, he's cool. He's with me.
Oh, Catherine. I feel like an idiot up here.
Stand down, brigadier. The dog lives.
Oh, man! I never get to use this thing!
CAT 1:
We're outsourcing?
CAT 2: Does he look rabid to you?
He looks rabid to me.
We've isolated a voice on Kitty Galore's threat recording.
I will enslave all mankind!
CHUCK:
Kitty! I'm home!
A human. Definitely human.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.
- Right.
Now zoom in.
Well, I'll be. Tinkles was right.
A cat's eye does reveal everything.
DIGGS:
Tab, flip the image.
"Chuck the Magnificent."
TAB:
Okay, let's see.
Aha. Here we are.
DIGGS:
Playland, huh?
So who's up for a corn dog?
Can I ask you something?
Don't take this wrong. You know that saying, "Cat got your tongue"?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
You're not gonna steal my tongue, are you?
CATHERINE:
It's an expression, Diggs.
DIGGS:
Whoa, whoa! Man, you drive like a girl.
CATHERINE:
No, Diggs, I drive like a cat.
Now, be a good dog and stick your head out the window.
DIGGS: Brake, brake, brake.
- Welcome to Playland. Parking is $5.
Enjoy the park, sir.
CATHERINE:
This place looks pretty secure.
So how exactly are we planning on getting in there?
DIGGS:
Wait a second.
I know what to do.
Butch taught me this.
This is a little maneuver
I like to call "Fetch a Stick."
Whoops.
We haven't got much time.
Look for something that resembles a bologna with a head.
Okay there. Yikes.
Catherine, I sure hope we're not chasing our tails here.
What the...?
Is this what it's come to, darlings?
Cats and dogs working together?
Call me old-fashioned, but I preferred it when we all hated each other.
Don't worry. We still hate you.
Not even a mother could love that face.
MEOWS! This is Agent 4...
- Hey! What are you doing?
DIGGS: Catherine!
CATHERINE:
No! My collar!
PIGEON [SINGING]:
In the still
- Of the night
- Shoo-doop, doobie-doop
I held you
I don't know.
Maybe I was too hard on the kid.
SEAMUS: Let's see, some thread, some twigs, a rubber band...
Scratch that, two rubber bands!
What a lucky...
You talking about lucky...
- Wait, what are we are looking for?
- The blueprints.
The cat on the ferry said your cousin Nicky gave you blueprints.
Oh, yeah.
- Let me look.
- This is my house!
You'll ruin this place.
My insurance doesn't cover this.
This is why my landlord said no pets.
Well, always great having you over, Butch.
You're the life of the party.
Hey, what's Kitty Galore's name doing on my wallpaper?
BUTCH: That's not wallpaper.
That's a blueprint for a giant satellite dish.
This is worse than we thought!
She's trying to get free HBO.
This is why Kitty's after you.
Your Cousin Nicky stashed this here.
Collar: Camera.
HQ, you getting this?
Holy lawn log.
That thing is three stories tall.
If this device is real, it's our worst fears come true.
Lou, MEOWS here. We just picked up a distress signal from Catherine.
- She's with one of your agents.
- Diggs!
They were chasing a lead on Kitty's hideout, a place called Playland.
You're looking for one
Chuck the Magnificent.
Tab, I'm sending you a blueprint.
Butch, go get our agent.
Copy that! I just hope the kid's okay.
DIGGS:
So this is how it ends for me.
In a circus tent, chained to a cat.
Great master plan, Kitty.
Bup-bup-bup. Don't judge my master plan until you've heard the whole thing, huh?
You see, in 20 minutes,
I will begin broadcasting...
...the Call of the Wild!
And every canine on this planet will become a mad dog, forever!
Like I'm supposed to believe a bunch of weird sounds...
...are gonna make me a "mad dog, forever."
Ah. So you do understand.
I was worried the whole thing was a tad complicated.
You know, for a dog.
Paws! Let's show our friends what we have up our metaphorical sleeve.
A dog's sensitive hearing has always been considered a tactical advantage.
But now, it will be their downfall.
Observe.
Look at the little doggy losing control.
They're even turning on their owners.
Humans have no idea what's happened.
Their dogs have all gone mad!
And there's only one place for a mad dog.
No, no. Not the kennels.
Yes, yes, the kennels!
Where they will be forever alone...
...unwanted, unloved.
Seem familiar, Officer Diggs?
Nice try, Kitty.
But there's a lot of dogs in this world.
What are you gonna do, go door-to-door with your sound?
That would take you the rest of your nine lives.
That's true. Unless I had a satellite.
Why do you think I've been telling you this?
I got time to kill until my satellite's in position.
Then, once I beam the signal...
...it will instantly broadcast from every TV, radio and cell phone on earth!
Okay, show's over.
No, no! You'll never get away with this, Kitty!
I was hoping someone would say
I'll never get away with this.
It'll make it so much more satisfying when I do!
Now, sit back and relax.
Perhaps you'd care for a drink of water?
[KITTY CACKLING]
No! Water. Not water.
Anything but water.
Please, Kitty. I can't swim.
Perfect. I don't want you to swim.
I want you to drown!
[LAUGHING]
BUTCH:
We're almost at Playland.
Oh, if there's one ride we should go on, it's the roller coaster.
We're not going on any rides.
Don't be scared.
I'll hold your paw, big baby.
[SEAMUS SCREAMING]
- There's gotta be a way out of here.
- Catherine, listen.
Since this is the end, I guess
I can say I think I might like you.
- Diggs, stop.
- No. Shh. Don't say anything.
I know it's uncomfortable, but I think we're buds.
There, I said it. I like a cat.
I feel so free!
No, stop! I can use your collar!
No, it doesn't do anything.
It's not even good for fleas.
No, if I could just get it loose...
...I can pick the lock.
Nice work! Okay, now me.
No!
Don't worry, Diggs.
I'll get you out of here.
No, Catherine. There's no time.
You gotta stop Kitty.
I'm not leaving you, Diggs.
Come on, Catherine. You can do this.
Oh, you owe me bigtime, dog.
Yeah, about what I said before, about liking cats...
- Never happened.
- Thank you.
Hey, Kitty!
Sorry, practice went a little long.
Where are you, girl?
Chuck, you're a grade-A doofus.
Here they are.
Kitty?
You in here?
Don't worry, Kitty.
We all get stage fright sometimes.
We can get through this together.
The show must go on!
Just need five minutes.
Maybe 10.
SEAMUS: Caramel corn. You have any idea what the street value of that is?
- Is that Seamus?
CATHERINE: Over here!
SEAMUS: There's no reason we can't save the world and get snow cones.
- Hey, guys.
- Catherine!
- Rookie!
DIGGS: Butch.
Collar: Comlink.
HQ, we have Catherine and Diggs.
LOU: Nice work, Butch.
Now find Kitty's device.
Where could Kitty be hiding that satellite dish?
It must be huge. You can't just hide something like that.
Hey, wait a second.
That ride looks kind of like a...
CATHERINE: It sure does.
BUTCH: Genius!
What? All I see is a giant satellite-dish-Iooking...
Oh.
BUTCH:
Team, huddle up.
DIGGS: It's go time.
CATHERINE: Save the dogs, save the world.
BUTCH:
First thing to do, get on top of that ride.
SEAMUS: Yes! Wait. Is there a height requirement for this ride?
Behold my glorious device!
Careful, Scrumptious.
Scratch that disc, I scratch you.
In mere moments, the planet becomes my scratching post!
[CACKLING]
Excuse me, has anyone seen my assistant?
She kind of looks like a raw chicken.
Oh, my Lord! Kitty!
Get down from there!
KITTY:
Let's get this party started.
As soon as my satellite is in position,
I hit the button and upload the signal!
SCRUMPTIOUS: Uh-oh.
- What?
Three, two, one...
SEAMUS:
What in the world?
I love being a spy dog! Yeah!
SEAMUS:
Why am I doing this?
Brakes, brakes, brakes.
CATHERINE:
Hey, Catzilla!
Yes! Perfect landing.
Watch out, Kitty, because Seamus is about to kick your... Ah! Ooh!
Paws! Stop them!
Kitty! Where...?
Ah! It's so tangly!
WOMAN:
Is that the magician?
Ooh. This guy is amazing.
The satellite is almost in position.
Okay, we've analyzed the blueprints...
...and we think there's a kill switch on that device.
Look! That red button.
It looks like an off switch.
- We have to get up to that control panel.
- The pyramid.
- From the cat-lady house.
- Good thinking.
- You know what to do.
- Right!
Wait! What are you doing?
I can't reach it! Now what?
Ta-da! It's a bird. It's a plane.
Nope, had it right the first time.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pigeon to the rescue.
Here I come!
No!
I mean, thank you.
Wait!
You fools! Not every red button is an off switch.
So buckle up, kiddies.
The real ride has just begun.
[CACKLING]
The signal's fired.
The satellite's uploading the Call of the Wild.
Butch? Butch are you there? Talk to me!
Come in!
Lou, come in!
- We've lost HQ!
- I suggest we just tag out and call it a day.
Diggs! Any ideas?
If I get up to those wires...
...I can disconnect them and shut this thing down!
Then here. You're gonna need this.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
And don't scratch it!
What do you say, Catherine?
Feel like going for a ride?
Let's do this.
Collar: Grappling hook!
Whoo-hoo!
Collar: Retract.
Diggs!
What the...?
Oh, my...
Meow.
Whoo! A robot cat.
I know what I want for Christmas.
Like my new invention?
Amazing what you can do with a few spare parts...
...and a thirst to destroy mankind.
My collar!
- Let's go!
DIGGS: Right behind you.
KITTY:
This is futile!
We're seconds away from a world full of barking-mad canines.
And you're too late to stop it!
It's happening!
The Call of the Wild has hit London,
New York, Albuquerque!
That leaves less than a minute till it's overhead.
Come on, guys. You can do this.
CATHERINE: We're almost at the wires!
- Something's wrong with my collar!
Then it's time for Plan B!
DIGGS:
I hate Plan B!
Okay, on my count. Three, two, one...
...jump!
Booyah.
That was your plan to stop me?
When this is over, you'll be the first to be locked up.
Sister, this dog is never going back to the kennels.
- You again?
ROBOT: Come here.
DIGGS:
Whoa.
You wanna bite something, pal?
Bite this.
KITTY:
What? Wait! No! No!
No!
You think I'm finished? Never!
It'll take more than some dogs and a cat to stop me!
SCRUMPTIOUS:
I've had it!
[PANTING]
How about a mouse?
Scrumptious? What...? No.
Scrumptious!
Bye-bye!
Help me.
Mom?
BUTCH:
Watch out! It's gonna blow!
SEAMUS: Abandon ride!
CATHERINE: Let's get out of here!
[CHEERING]
Thank you, San Francisco!
Do you feel that, Kitty?
Do you feel the love?
[CRYING]
Come on, boy. Come on.
Diggs?
Diggs!
I'm glad to see you too, buddy!
Come here!
Well, there's my big boy.
How did you get here?
Hey, Diggs, listen to me.
I am so sorry that I didn't stick up for you more.
I promise that will never happen again.
You hear me?
Welcome home, buddy.
Come on. Let's go inside.
Come on, Diggsy!
Honey, you're not gonna believe who I just found.
Looks like someone made a new best friend.
Here you go, boy.
He's like a new dog.
Think he misses being a cop?
Trust me, honey, excitement's the last thing on his mind.
Zoe, do you want to join us at the table?
Huh?
Hm.
Alert, Agent Diggs.
Your mission, should you decide to accept it...
... will be revealed at HQ.
This squirrel will self-destruct.
But first, a little dance.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
All right, I'm done.
[YELLS]
- Talk to me.
- Our firewall's been breached.
Somebody hacked the system.
Hacked the system?
Who? How's that even possible?
Only one mastermind could do that.
But he's in...
Oh, gee, not this guy again.
Greetings, my furry friends!
It is I, Tinkles!
Free! Scot-free! Meow, meow.
Did you really think the Rock could hold me forever?
I am definitely not an indoor cat.
[STEEL DRUMS PLAYING]
Hey, Ringo, enough with the steel drums here! I'm trying to talk, "mon"!
Hey, boss, I'm riffing. Heh-heh!
I'm going to enjoy this game of cat and mouse.
Or shall I say cat and cat...
... and dog...
You have the little bird there too, right?
Wow, it's like a whole petting zoo.
Anyway, come and get me, if you dare!
[CACKLING]
Meow, meow.
All right, team. We got work to do.
You're not going anywhere.
What? Why not?
Because you don't have your new collar...
...agent.
[ANIMALS CHEERING]
Go ahead with your bad self. Bling!
You guys ready to do this?
Work with a bunch of dogs again?
How could I say no?
Absolutely!
Wait. We're talking about lunch, right?
All right, team. Let's go kick some tail!
Come on! Why isn't this working?
Hey, hey! Help me with my e-mail.
I gotta reach my vet.
I gotta get me some of that deworming cream.
Tropical heat makes my butt itch like you wouldn't belie... Wait.
What's this green light for?
- This thing supposed to be on?
- Boss, you're still connected.
So everything I'm...
But, like... So they can still...
Rash.
Uh... So the cream?
Oh. Wow. Um...
Cats rule! Yeah.
[CHATTERING]
Excuse me.
Are you Sister Brown's granddaughter or a young Jezebel?
A mother's board work is never done.
Amen.
ANGIE [SINGING]: Praise
When life calls us in, praise
Seems the pain won't end
Praise with all you have
With all you can
Lift your voice and praise
When all hope seems lost, praise
With everything you've got, praise
With all you have
With all you can
- Lift your voice and
CHOIR: Praise
ANGIE: When it don't make sense
CHOIR: Praise
ANGIE: And you can't find one friend
CHOIR: Praise
- Anyway, anyhow
CHOIR: With all you can
ANGIE: Come on, somebody
MAN: Praise! Yes!
He'll make a way
When there seems no way
Yes, he will
He's watching over you
Praise, praise
- When it makes no sense
CHOIR: Praise
When you can't find one friend
CHOIR: Praise
- Oh, yes
Praise, yeah
Whoo!
Praise, right through your pain
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Lift your voice
And praise
Praise
Praise
Lift your voice
And praise
BISHOP:
Good morning, church.
CROWD:
Good morning!
- Good morning, church.
CROWD: Good morning!
We wanna thank God for our fabulous choir.
MAN 1: Yeah.
MAN 2: Play back. Play back.
Not to mention our outstanding soloist, who just happens to be my daughter.
A faithful servant to the work of the Lord. Amen.
Our text today comes from the Gospel of Luke.
Marcia, hurry before he sees us.
I ain't trying to go to hell for trampling over Mrs. Methuselah.
- Where y'all going? I wanna go.
- No. You gonna get us caught.
Y'all trying to sneak off to the movies again?
Yep. And if Boris Kodjoe hops off that screen and into my lap, mm-mm...
...hell, here I come.
- Ugh!
It's hot in hell.
But hotter in my lap. Okay?
- Y'all is crazy.
BISHOP: Angie.
Damn, we're busted.
I'll tell Boris you said hello.
- Be back in time for evening service?
- We're trying to go to the movies.
The movies.
Can the movies compare to salvation?
Hm. Boris Kodjoe?
It's a close one, Bishop.
[KING BREATHING HEAVILY]
Asthma seems to be getting worse.
How many inhalers do I have?
Five, Daddy. Next to your bed, in your medicine cabinet...
...your top-desk drawer, glove compartment...
...and right here in my purse.
Here you go.
Oh, in the meantime,
I found a new homeopathic cure.
You boil your 10 cloves of garlic in milk and drink it.
Just like her mother. She understood nobody looks after family like family.
[CHUCKLES]
All we have is each other now.
- Oh, come. You can see a movie anytime.
- When?
I have choir rehearsal,
I have Bible band, Bible study...
...midweek services and usher board meetings.
Daddy, I need a break.
And you'll get one.
- But--
- At the church retreat.
Three days of prayer, relaxation and fellowship with God.
That's who I need a break from.
I meant--
Never mind.
[CHUCKLES]
Marcia, would you mind helping
Angie clear the pews?
Oh, wouldn't miss that experience even for the rapture, Bishop.
[LAUGHS]
MARCIA:
That boy love him some Angie.
Look at him. Stalling again, just to spend time with you.
You always seeing things that ain't there.
- We just friends, girl.
MARCIA: Mm-hm.
What? Hey, hey, hey. That's--
That's mine. That's mine.
ANGIE:
"Daddy, Can I Come Back Home?"
- What's this?
- Gospel play coming to town Tuesday.
You free, Angie?
MARCIA:
Huh, just friends, huh?
Thanks, but we've got Bible study.
Yeah. Bible study's cancelled this week.
It's got that leaky ceiling.
Well, I have to pass anyway.
I heard about those Chittlin' plays.
With titles like
If You Dis Me, You Dis God.
Yeah, yeah, but you know-- I mean--
At the end of the show, somebody's getting saved.
- Yeah.
- And the singing.
They've got good singing in this one?
Yeah.
Like, better than me?
I mean, ain't nobody better than you.
- But...
- You're just saying that.
Look, I mean-- I know how you always wanted that big record deal.
You know, I think that we should do a gospel demo--
- Who's in these plays? Famous actors?
- Yeah. You know, remember Bookman?
- Yeah.
- Bookman from Good Times?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw him in one play...
...and then Dwayne from What's Happening?
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey, Mother Charles.
Pastor's daughter out here congregating with men.
Shameful.
And feel free to lower your hem another half inch.
It's crawling up your thigh.
Why, when I was your age we wore our skirts...
...a quarter inch below the knee.
- A quarter inch below the knee.
- Stop making fun of me.
- Now you the fast one.
- I'm not trying to be fast. It's long.
- Quarter-inch below the thighs.
It's at my knees.
WYNTON:
Don't believe you. In the house of God.
Go home.
- See your Chittlin' Circuit play.
- All right.
Bible study got cancelled, thank God.
I know. Wynton told me yesterday.
I'm about sick of church anyway.
What? Is that allowed?
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love my father, my church, my life.
I just know there's so much more out there, and I'm missing it all.
I think I can fix that.
Bust out that hot new dress you been hiding from Bishop.
[PHONE RINGING]
Angie, are you getting that?
I'm in the bathroom.
King residence.
MARCIA:
Hi, Bishop.
You take care now. Bye-bye.
Hey. Do you need anything else before I go to Bible study?
- I'm fine. Marcia called. Says she wants--
- Okay.
Pick her up tonight and bring her to work in the morning? No way.
Now, what would Jesus do?
Probably snap his fingers and get that little raggedy Hyundai of hers fixed.
[LAUGHS]
You just remember that you're the child of a King.
Our last name is King, Daddy.
So would it be easier to just spend the night at her house?
I guess.
But I know how much you need me around here, so...
You...
...are remarkable.
- See you in the morning, Daddy.
- Bye-bye.
I can't believe Bishop keeps falling for that trick.
Girl, my father might be anointed, but he ain't got no street game.
Okay.
- Come on, now.
- I know.
We gonna be late.
Girl, that bag is cute.
It really completes the look.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC BLARING]
Girl. So let's do this, mama. You ready?
It'd be nice to hear other than
"Praise the Lord, Sista King."
I know. I wanna hear some like
"Hey, shawty let me tap that ass--"
Watch your mouth.
Girl, look. That's Shay-shay and them.
Remember? From middle school.
- Uh-uh.
- Girl, she wearing that dress. Look at her.
GIRL: Church girls in the house.
- Hey, mama.
Girl, look at them chandeliers.
This club is off the hook.
ANGIE:
Wow.
So, what now?
Now we gotta find us some ugly dudes who'll buy us some drinks.
Oh, I see two over there by the bar.
And one over there by the door.
- We gonna get us some drinks tonight.
- Oh, my God, girl. Look. Look, look.
MARCIA:
Is that--?
Devlin Mitchell.
Oh, girl, he had that hit record with Gia.
Remember?
[SINGING] Rub it on me
Up against me
Girl, that's my song!
Oh, he's so fine.
Come. Let's show him how Georgia women put it down.
We can't get up there.
- Got on our VIP dresses. We getting in.
- They're gonna kick us out.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING]
Devlin! Devlin Mitchell.
Hey, how you doing, Devlin?
Me and my girl are big, big fans.
- Could we have your autograph? Please?
- Let them in.
We're getting in!
Thank you. Thank y'all so much.
Thank you so much.
Sign mine right here.
Put something like
"Marcia, rub it up against me. Again."
[LAUGHS]
Does your friend talk?
- Say something, Angie.
- What?
What you girls doing later?
I'm having a party back in my room.
- Well-- Yeah, yeah.
- We have choir rehearsal in the morning.
Good girls.
I like that.
I like that.
- Your name's Angie, right?
- Yeah.
I just wrote a song about you.
- We country, but we ain't naive.
MARCIA: Mm-hm.
Markus, tell Angie the name of my new single.
It's called "Angie." Real talk.
We're sorry.
MARCIA: What you all doing in Atlanta?
- In a play at the Fox Theatre tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Matter of fact...
Give me two tickets. Yeah.
- Y'all come tomorrow night and hang out.
- Yeah, for sure. For sure.
All right?
I'd follow him anywhere.
All I know is you better not lose them damn tickets.
EMMA: Bishop, you need to get on the road or you won't make your engagement.
I can't leave without Angie.
She knows about my conference.
She stayed at Marcia's last night.
Haven't heard from her since.
- Call Sister Watkins.
- I did.
Apparently, there is a play in town that they're excited about seeing.
- A play?
- Mm-hm.
She needs a good grounding.
Bishop. Bishop,
I know this is none of my business...
...but that child is over 21.
You're right, Emma.
It's none of your business.
[MUSIC PLAYING & CROWD CLAPPING]
[GIRLS SCREAMING]
Ooh!
[SINGING]
Come a little closer
Let me talk to you
All the things tonight
I'm gonna do to you
There goes your new man.
- Girl, please. He ain't my man.
- Mm-hm.
I will take you places
You have never been
Yet.
And we can go there
Over and over again
[PHONE RINGS]
- Hello?
- Bishop, it's Wynton.
I was wondering if I could get your blessing...
...to date Angie.
Angie is too busy with God's work to be thinking about dating right now.
[SINGING]
This right here
[LAUGHING]
Us all night
Yeah, yeah, over
What is that? What is that?
What he doing?
Again and again and again
And again and again
Good night, Wynton.
Good night.
MAN [ON PA]:
Daddy, Can I Come Back Home?
Thanks for coming. Get your cast photos
and souvenirs in the lobby now.
I have to be in this show.
- No, I'm serious, Marcia.
- Okay. All right, all right.
- Did you hear that music?
- Yeah.
And those voices?
- They're singing for God.
- Yeah.
And you can only imagine the souls that are being saved every night.
Is that the only reason?
I mean, it could be my big break now.
You know how many big producers come through plays like this?
Well, Lord have mercy, you like him, don't you?
- Who?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, him? He-- He all right.
You keep telling lies and you're going to hell.
MAN:
Let's take a picture with Devlin here.
Oh, look. Twenty dollars to take pictures with the cast.
Come on. The star invited us.
Whoa, ladies.
- We're friends of Devlin.
- Yeah.
Yeah, so is everyone else here with a $20 bill.
- Come on.
- Wait your turn.
- Oh, come on, man.
- This is crazy. Let's go home.
Hey, yo, yo. Let my wifey through.
They good.
You see that?
- What's going on?
MARCIA: Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good. It's a good thing I saved y'all.
I think Jesus already had that one covered, homey.
DEVLIN:
Yeah, okay. Hey, look.
The cast is going to get something to eat.
- You hungry?
- Starved.
Y'all both step over there and when
I finish we'll go do something.
Okay.
We going with the celebrities, girl.
[LAUGHING]
Wait. Wait, wait.
GIRL 1: Do y'all remember when Cynthia came out on stage...
...and her wig was on backwards?
Y'all didn't say nothing. Y'all was wrong.
DEVLIN:
What you want me to do?
Comb that stuff.
You remember the time I taped that fold down, I glued that fold down?
- That was you? Markus, you crazy.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Don't touch me like that.
- Whatever.
I wanna join the show.
Sorry. This show?
Yeah.
- You got skills?
- Better than anybody here.
- Marcia.
GIRL 2: It's on now.
- I'm just speaking the truth.
DEVLIN: You have to back that up.
- She said it. I didn't.
- You didn't deny it.
Let's hear you blow.
What is this, an audition or something?
It can be.
People get sent home all the time.
MARKUS: Mm-hm.
- You go sing.
- Ike.
- Yeah?
This shorty over here is about to audition for you.
Really?
- Don't be scared. Let's see what you got.
MARCIA: Go on. Come on.
- Is Church the only place you can sing?
- No.
All right. Follow me.
[SINGING]
I'll take good care of your heart
Good care of your heart
I'll take good care of your heart
Good care of your heart
When you need a shoulder to cry on
A real man like me to rely on
Don't look no further
Your search is over
I'll take good care of your heart
Yeah
I'll take good care of your heart
I'll take good care of your heart
Good care of your heart
I'll take good care of your heart
Good care of your heart
When you need a shoulder to cry on
A real good woman like me to rely on
Look no further
Your search is over, love
- Because I'll take good care of your heart
- Care of your heart
- Promise I'll take good care of your heart
- Promise I'll take good care of your heart
IKE:
That's not bad.
You sing in the choir.
Understudy Desiree.
- Who's Desiree?
- That's the lead.
MARCIA:
Go, girl.
Do you want me to read lines or something?
No, it ain't much acting in this show.
In this show we just sing.
Come on. Let's go to my room.
I need to go over all the songs with you.
MARCIA: Oh, no, no, no.
Slow your roll, pimp daddy.
- It ain't that kind of party.
- She's in good hands.
I learned long ago to cherish what can't be replaced.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, no, no, no. My father might smell my breath for alcohol.
If it was wrong, then why would Jesus turn water into wine?
My father says--
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
What does that mean?
It means when are you going to start experiencing life for yourself?
Don't you take another step.
You may not have many more left.
Hey, Mama, what you doing in my room?
The play was over at 10.
Then we stopped to eat.
Until now?
The only thing open this late is liquor stores...
...and legs.
Where's Angie?
[PHONE RINGS]
Wait right there. Hello?
Sister Watkins...
...I'm sorry to call so late.
- Are the girls back yet?
- Bishop, we need to talk.
[SNORING]
MARCIA: Angie, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me. I'm home.
- Thank God. Did Bishop catch you?
- Everything's okay. He's sleeping.
- Well, dish it out, mama.
- Oh, girl. It was the bomb.
- Girl, y'all didn't get freaky, did you?
- No, we didn't do that. You're so nasty.
No.
He was a perfect gentleman.
- He just held me all night.
- Aw.
I love me some Devlin.
Please. You sound like cupid
knocked you over the head.
Now, you only met this man last night.
- All I know is you better--
- Gotta go. Bye.
BISHOP:
You lied to me.
[YAWNS]
Consider yourself grounded until the Lord tells me otherwise.
I'm too old to be grounded, Daddy.
In my house, under my roof, where I pay the bills, I make rules.
There's something
I need to tell you, Daddy.
I'm leaving.
Leaving?
I'm going on the road with a gospel play.
It's just like church, Daddy.
Singing, praising and preaching--
No, I forbid it.
My whole life...
...I've lived for your blessing.
To please you.
Well, I'm grown now.
And I don't need your permission.
That's what you say.
That's what you say.
What does God say?
I'm going, Daddy. I'm going.
Did you hear me?
You're not going anywhere!
Get off me!
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
You walk out that door...
...never step foot in this house again.
Don't call my phone.
Don't even mention me to God.
I'm sorry, Daddy...
...but I have to do this for me.
I hope that you can understand one day.
Goodbye, Daddy.
IKE:
You better go ahead.
We're not stopping or going to the bathroom...
...all the way to Arkansas.
- Whoa. You almost got left. You're late.
- I need a schedule. Oh, and my contract?
[CHUCKLES]
You're looking at your contract.
We do seven shows a week, matinées on Saturdays and Sundays.
Monday is your travel day.
DEVLIN:
Hurry up. I'll save you a seat.
The contract ends when you piss me off.
You understand?
Now, you look like a good kid.
What you do on your own time is between you and God. You understand?
But I'm telling you right now...
...you better be careful. All right?
- Yes, sir.
- Go on and get on the bus.
- Okay.
Dock her $50. She was late.
Let's go.
See what happens when you're late?
Smile, you got a 12-hour bus ride ahead of you.
This seat is taken, boo boo.
And so is he.
PEACHES:
Here's a seat.
ANGIE:
Okay.
Remember me from the diner?
I'm Peaches.
I set up and sell concessions,
T-shirts, programs, cast photos.
Yeah, nice to see you again. Angie King.
Who's that?
PEACHES: Desiree?
- Yeah.
PEACHES: Oh, just somebody he used to kick it with.
Well, I saw her in the show.
She's good.
Don't get on her bad side.
Ike doesn't like when you piss off the leads. He'll send you home quick.
He don't like drama.
Psst. Excuse me.
I'm a big fan.
I'm understudying the lead.
Everybody here understudies.
Even me and Biscuit, the bus driver.
Oh, well, how often does Desiree miss a performance?
Never.
Neither sickness, nor death, nor baby-daddy drama...
...keeps us from getting out on that stage.
Angie, we're here.
Oh, come on, girl.
We gotta unpack and get over to the theater.
He's gone, like we ought to be. Let's go.
Okay.
[SINGING]
My little girl
Tried to save you from this world
IKE:
Hold up. Ladies and gentlemen.
If you don't have experience, don't come here.
[SINGING]
Don't try and stop me now
I've got to go
Come a little closer
Let me talk to you
Doing all the things that I wanna do
IKE: That's what I'm saying. Come on.
- Oh, I'm leaving now
I gotta learn for myself
IKE: This is not Broadway.
This is black theater at its best.
- Yes.
IKE: Okay.
I'm leaving now, I've got to go
Gotta learn for myself
There's something I've got to know
IKE:
Cut, cut. Stop. Cut means stop. Argh!
Just go. Just go. Go on, go on.
- Thank-- Thank you. Thank you.
- No, don't thank us. Bye-bye.
They double us up.
So you wanna room together?
- Yeah. That's fine.
- Okay.
Take it.
Good morning, Devlin.
I was needing a date for breakfast.
I can't.
I'm waiting on the record label to call.
Oh, okay.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you come by my room tonight.
I'll leave a key at the front desk for you.
Okay.
Come on, girl. I'll show you how to make your per diem last.
All right.
Here are the rules.
Don't use anything at the hotels except the bed, the toilet and the towels.
- Okay.
- No room service, no mini-bar...
...no phone calls, no pay-TV.
- Okay.
Most of the men in the show spend a grip on dirty movies.
Wait, I thought these were all Christian men.
My bad. Let me rephrase that.
Most Christian men in the show spend a grip on dirty movies.
Oh.
GARRETT:
Downstage.
I said downstage.
Who told you to walk there? Downstage.
Which way is that?
Get your dumb country
Bama behind off my stage.
I need a new next-door neighbor.
Where's that new girl?
- You're up.
GARRETT: New girl!
- Me? I don't know that role.
GARRETT: I need a new neighbor.
Knock on the door and look cute and ask to borrow some sugar. Go.
- New girl!
ANGIE: Okay, I'm right here.
GARRETT:
Are you deaf or just dumb?
My name is Angie.
How about stupid?
Now, hit your mark.
I'd rather you not call me out of my name.
You fired too.
Somebody send this child home.
For what? For telling you her name?
How about this?
You send her home, you send me home too.
Stay out of this, Dev.
No.
I'm all up in it.
GARRETT:
Well, I tell you what. Just--
Just get her attitude together.
IKE: How many people you fire today?
What you got for me?
Listen. I got this new character...
...I added to the show.
- Okay.
I think it'd be good.
Biscuit! Come on out.
[CAST LAUGHING]
MAN 1:
You gotta be kidding me.
IKE: Biscuit? My bus driver?
MAN 2: Oh, yeah.
I call her Aunt Bébé.
[LAUGHS]
IKE:
It better be good for your sake.
Or else you be the next one going home.
Oh, that was close.
I owe you one.
Yeah, you do.
Angie, would you ever say no to me?
That's a dangerous question.
But I think I trust you.
No, I wouldn't.
I've always wanted to do it in a tent.
- Excuse me?
- Church, I mean.
I saw them setting up when we pulled in.
Would you go with me?
You're what every church girl wants.
A bad boy who loves the Lord.
Come on.
[PEOPLE SINGING GOSPEL]
Hey, baby girl. Where's my dinners?
I'm sick of this.
I got my own life to lead.
And I want what's coming to me.
- You want what's coming to you, huh?
- Yeah.
You know your Daddy love you's.
So I'm gonna give to you what's coming to you. Get on over here.
[DAUGHTER SCREAMING]
[ALL LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
With open arms
I'm sorry.
Jesus is waiting
Come as you are
Without hesitating
He hopes for you
All that you need
Come as you are
It's time to breathe free
Litha, come on. Come on, you missed it.
Okay. Remember, the part that we talked about. You can't be lazy.
Okay, no-- Just sing it the way I asked you to.
You mean you want me to sing it like Angie. And I ain't her.
Okay, just--
Just do the best you can. Because we gotta be top-notch for New York.
I guess you're saying I'm not.
Let's take a break.
I'm sorry. It's--
You know, it's just--
It's hard losing a lead singer.
Well, we've lost more than a singer.
- Our top selection, sir?
- Yes.
Oh, you know what? I got it.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
I'm not used to being so spoiled.
Well, get used to being with me.
Oh, no, no, no. I'd rather not.
- I'm a PK, remember?
- A what?
A PK. A Preacher's Kid.
Oh.
My daddy's a pastor.
Yeah. I hear you.
So is it true what they say about you all?
What?
I mean, I hear PK's are, like, the biggest freaks ever.
Excuse you?
No disrespect, I mean...
...I just hear PK's are really messed up.
I mean, there is the pressure of being perfect.
We can't make mistakes like everybody else.
Would it be a mistake to spend the night with me?
No. I mean, yes.
Yes.
- You want me to keep it real?
- Please.
As freaky as you think PK's might be...
...I've never gone past foreplay.
I guess life is all about growth and experiences.
Yeah.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
You tripping.
I've been saving myself for you my whole life.
Put the names on the envelope.
- Everybody get four tickets, understand?
- I understand.
New girl.
ANGIE:
Huh?
- Oh, I was-- I was just--
- I was just what?
Get over here.
- How you doing?
- Hey.
Didn't I tell you to be careful?
You're a grown-ass woman.
You know what to do.
Leave these tickets, sort through them.
Leave them at will call for the pastors, understand?
- Okay.
- Where the shepherd goes...
...the sheep will follow.
- That's what I'm saying.
- Thanks a lot. All right.
I don't know what to do with you.
Get on out of here.
Oh, um--
I'm wondering when I'm gonna rehearse
Desiree's role with the rest of the cast.
Ain't no time to rehearse.
You do that on your own.
Okay.
I mean, you never know when it's your time. You understand?
Yes, sir.
You never know.
Thank you.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Come in.
Hi, my name is Jillian from next door.
And I was wondering if I could borrow a cup of sugar.
Why is you cup-a-sugar Negroes always moving next door to us?
Whatever. Is your husband home?
No, but my brothers,
Smith & Wesson are.
Ah!
Run, hussy.
BISCUIT:
Top that, homey.
[DOORBELL RINGING]
Hello? Bishop?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
- I was about to have supper--
- Oh, you over here eating fast food.
Not as long as I have breath in me.
You like chicken and dumplings?
You really didn't have to do this.
Oh, come on, now.
Please, that comes natural to me.
And you know you need some good home cooking now that first lady is gone.
Oh, Lord, we all miss her.
Yes, yes.
So have you heard from Angie?
I'm sure you respect the need to keep private lives private.
When you respect the need to let kids make their own mistakes.
You're cutting into my prayer time,
Sister Watkins.
I hope it is devoted to asking for a forgiving spirit.
DAUGHTER [SINGING]:
Leaving now
I have to go
Gotta learn for myself
Something I have to know
I'm leaving now
No, don't try to stop me
Oh, I'm leaving now
Just pray for me
Hey, baby.
I got your stuff.
Oh, see here your lotion, toothpaste, toothbrush.
All ready to go.
Did you put my clothes in the cleaners?
I...
I looked all over for one, and I didn't find one.
But I'll try again tomorrow.
Wow, this place is a mess.
Do you have to smoke that?
I ain't gotta. But I'm gonna.
That stuff is for losers.
What you say?
I said that stuff is for--
I was platinum before you knew what a demo was.
Think you talking to?
You better ask about me.
Little church girl.
[ANGIE WHIMPERING]
Look, baby. Look, Angie, baby, look.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I've--
I promise you I have never put my hands on a woman before.
I don't what I--
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm sorry.
I'm messed up.
I need you.
Need me how?
What's wrong?
Talk to me.
After my second CD...
...after I made them all that money...
...they just dropped me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Don't tell me you're so--
It's all the new gangsta rap.
And now it's about hip-hop.
Nobody wants to hear real music anymore. Nobody.
Listen.
I'm gonna get a new record deal.
And when I do...
...I'm gonna make them take you too.
You would do that?
Baby...
...any success without you is failure.
FATHER [SINGING]:
My little girl
Tried to save you from this world
My baby girl
Why won't you listen to me?
Your dad, your father, your protector
Did I hold too tight?
My baby girl
I pray for you tonight
GUY: Oh, don't wanna live
In a world without you
Don't wanna breathe without you
Can't believe I never showed you
Never told you
So now you're leaving
And you don't know
What I felt about you
So tonight I'm hurting
I'm longing
Oh, I'll pray for you tonight
Daddy, let me go
FATHER:
Don't wanna let you go
GUY:
Is there anything you can do?
Please let me go
Baby girl, please stay
She doesn't even know how I feel
Please let me go
Daddy's little girl
Oh, I'll pray
Pray for me tonight
You know I will
You know I will
And I will pray for you
ALL:
Tonight
Hey.
- What do?
- What up, baby?
That's good.
- What's up, boy?
- Safe, single.
- They got it out for us, huh?
- Don't you know.
Yeah.
Why don't you go check us in, get our bags off the bus?
Okay, baby.
Hey.
Come here.
Go fix your hair.
You look a hot mess.
You ready?
Yeah, let's go.
By the way, I really like your hair.
Say, bro.
Why you dogging Angie like that?
Still breaking her down, young player.
Lookit here, player.
It's an old-school pimp move.
Well, school me.
Praise them early, dog them later.
After that, they'll be begging for attention like a bone.
[LAUGHING]
- Real talk.
DEVLIN: Game recognizes game.
I'm trying to recognize some game too.
So maybe I need to be a dog.
You do. Check this out.
When you finish with your girl, gonna pass over to your boy, right?
- For sure.
- My man. That's what's up.
[SINGING]
I couldn't see my life without you in it
I guess I hoped, I wished, I prayed
That things had turned out different
It's funny how love slips away
I wanted it to be so perfect
I guess I knew it all along
- I can't even hate. She's amazing.
- What I wanted was not what you wanted
- So here I am standing alone
IKE: Yeah, she's good.
Brings the house down every time.
- Oh, yes, you did
- Do you think I'll ever get there?
Like, even a matinée?
I said I never let it happen
- Guess I better start accepting reality
- You got a long way to go.
Reality, yeah
One kiss, one touch
Then it led to one night, one month
- Hey, look at me. You'll get there.
- Then it led to one year, two years
- It could lead to--
- Keep smiling.
Come on.
One kiss, one touch
[CHATTERING]
You named that song after me?
Yeah, I wrote it all last night.
- The only thing I can think about.
- That right?
DEVLIN: I don't just name songs after anybody. Just you.
ANGIE:
So you name a song after her?
How many girls do you use that lame game on, loser?
DESIREE:
Uh-uh.
- What did you call me?
- You heard me.
What you gonna do?
You wanna find out, huh?
You leave with her, I'll be packed and gone by the time you get back.
You need me more than your next breath.
Be in my bed when I get back or somebody else will.
[FIRE TRUCK SIREN WAILING]
DESIREE: Now, where were we, before we were so rudely interrupted?
[RINGING]
BISHOP [ON RECORDING]: You reached
the King residence, leave a message.
And remember, ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?
[BEEP]
ANGIE:
Hi, Daddy.
I was just calling to say hi.
Everything's great out here.
But...
...I was thinking about coming back home.
Daddy, can you hear me?
Please pick up.
[CRYING]
[CAR ALARM RINGING & DOG BARKING]
Hey, I'm really glad you moved back in.
We'll upgrade to a double when we get to the next city, okay?
You think they're back yet?
[SIGHS]
Don't do this to yourself.
You need to let it go.
I'm trying, Peaches.
I'm really trying.
You know what they say about your first.
It's like a soul-tie or something.
Please tell me you did not lose your virginity to that dog.
[LAUGHING]
He might be a dog, but he's my dog.
Strays don't belong to nobody.
[LAUGHING]
How's it feel to be me?
How's it feel to be me?
Remember Eddie King, Jr. on Five Heartbeats?
That's you, Angie. That's you.
Why don't you shut up, you idiot?
[LAUGHING]
Well, well, well.
You can have him back now.
You know, if you were the singer I am, you'd have my role.
And if you were the woman I am...
...you'd have my man.
[LAUGHING]
Devlin!
Devlin--
- What?
- We need to talk.
We're done talking.
You moved all your stuff out, remember?
No, wait.
I wanna come back.
We ain't got nothing in common.
[LAUGHING]
DEVLIN:
You gonna eat that bacon?
I can still see it. Next time you need to put more makeup on.
Next time?
You know what I mean.
I got something for you.
- What's this for?
- To celebrate. Put it on.
ANGIE:
It's beautiful.
To celebrate what?
The guys from my label are gonna be in New York and I told them all about you.
Are you serious?
Thank you, baby.
You changing clothes, right?
You don't like it?
I mean, I can change.
Yeah, you know what I like.
We're going to a club later.
Okay.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Talk to me.
- Dang, girl.
About time you answered your phone.
Where you at?
Oh, it's nothing to be worried about.
I'm getting a record deal.
Devlin hooked it up.
You serious?
Oh, I know you about to get your praise on now.
Angie, get over here.
- I gotta go. I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Angie, wait.
Who was that?
CHOIR [SINGING]:
He hopes for you
LITHA:
He hopes for you
CHOIR:
All that you need
LITHA:
The source of everything you need, yeah
CHOIR:
Come as you are
LITHA:
Come as you are
CHOIR:
It's time to breathe free
LITHA:
Breathe free
The presence of the Lord fills this place
Oh, I know this is a rehearsal
But, oh, bless his name
Oh, bless his name
It's all right to cry out to him
Yes, it is
Oh, we bless your name, Father
[PLAYING KEYBOARDS]
Yes.
Yes. Yes!
Yea-- That's it for tonight.
Okay? I see y'all on Friday and be sure y'all bring the fire.
You hear me?
And Litha.
Baby girl.
Litha, love.
You singing better than Angie.
Oh, you crazy. You crazy.
No, you crazy.
- Hey, Wyn. you got a second?
- Got a lot of seconds.
- What's going on?
- Angie's play is coming close by.
I thought we'd drive a few hours and surprise her.
I miss my girl so much.
I know you do too.
Yeah, well, you know, we've been friends since grade school.
And unless you wanna stay friends, you better man up.
PEACHES: T-shirts are 20, hats are 10 and programs are 5.
Avoid negotiators, and wouldjatakers.
Wouldja what?
"Oh, excuse me, sister.
I know it's $20, but would you take a 10 in Jesus' name?"
- Why are you crazy?
- Hell, no, is the answer. Hell, no.
MONTE:
Angie?
Hey, it's Monte.
Monte from Macon.
Your father used to preach at my father's church when we were kids.
- Little Monte?
- Hey.
Oh, my goodness.
MONTE:
How you doing?
- What was that song we used to sing?
[SINGING] Jesus made me strong
That's it.
- What are you doing here in Texas?
- My wife.
She's visiting her family.
ANGIE:
Well, I gotta meet her before you leave.
She's taking my daughter to the bathroom.
- You promise me? I gotta--
- Excuse me.
- I wanna introduce you to my friend.
- How you doing, bro?
- We'll get to that. Need to talk to you.
- Okay. Talk to you later.
Hey, baby girl.
Give me a kiss. Hey, baby.
What's wrong?
Don't you ever, as long as you're black, disrespect me like that.
- Disrespect you how?
- Okay.
- Maybe this will jog your memory.
- Ah!
[ANGIE GROANING]
You think I don't see you?
I see everything.
PEACHES: Where's Angie?
- Laying down.
MARCIA:
Let's hurry up. We're late.
Oh, I'm so excited.
I can't wait to see my girl.
- She gonna be so--
WYNTON: She'll be happy?
MARCIA:
Well, why wouldn't she be?
WYNTON: I don't know.
I mean, people change sometimes.
Oh, not Angie. Never her.
You know she's never called me back, right?
Not even once.
Oh, Wynton, I'm sorry.
You know, she probably just got busy, you know?
They're rehearsing.
You know them showbiz people.
Oh, this place nice.
Maybe she'll know.
Excuse me, do you know where the box office--? Peaches, right?
I'm Marcia. This is Wynton.
Friends of Angie's.
We drove up to see her perform tonight.
She hasn't been on stage in weeks.
Her vision is still blurred.
What? What happened?
Excuse me. I need to finish setting up the display table.
- What she talking about?
- I have no idea.
Peaches, these are the only ones
I could find.
What are y'all doing here?
You should have called first.
We're your friends, Angie.
We came to see you, girl.
- Angie, what happened to your face?
- Friends mind their own business.
- Friends let me live my own life.
- No, no, no, Angie.
Friends care. Who--?
What, did Devlin do this?
It wasn't his fault.
Angie, you can do a hell of a lot better than Devlin.
With who?
- You?
- Okay.
Oh, Angie.
- What's happened to you, girl?
- Marcia.
Baby, just come home, all right?
It ain't supposed to be like this.
This is what I want.
[PHONE RINGING]
BISCUIT: Hello? I done told you, woman.
Quit calling my house.
Now, you don't want me to have to get buck wild.
- Bye.
- Hey, excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
No, I'm busy.
BISCUIT:

What do you want, hussy?
You don't talk to me that kind of way.
Wait a minute.
You gonna make me lose my--

DEVLIN:
Wha--?
DESIREE: Ike, do something.
IKE: Throw that man out!
- Do it!
MAN 1: Hey, there, security!
MAN 2: Yo, fuck, man!
- Fellas! Come on, man.
No, my boy didn't paint your cat.
My boy done stop drinking.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I'm sorry, we'll buy you a cat.
I hope you didn't do anything crazy.
- Two wrongs don't make a right.
- Yeah, but three lefts do.
Look, if you two can't support me, then go back where you came from.
Yeah, we're gonna do both. We're gonna support you and go home. Let's go.
[PHONE BEEPS]
PEACHES:
Hey, old friend.
I just had a dream that woke me up.
In my dream,
God was whispering to you.
He said that even
when you leave him...
...he never leaves you.
His light is greater
than your darkness.
And that once this test is over...
...he's gonna give you
a marvelous testimony.
[GASPING]
- I can't find her inhaler.
- Asthma attack. Ike, where are we?
Ten miles of country road in front of us.
She okay?
- I think I can help. I need some honey.
- Oh, my bag.
I need a napkin.
MAN:
Here. I got one.
Here.
[DESIREE GASPING & COUGHING]
MAN: Back up a little bit.
Give her some air, y'all.
Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.
What are you doing?
I do this for my dad.
When she inhales the air that makes contact with the honey...
...it eliminates the mucus.
This should at least get us to the hospital.
- Praise the Lord, Sister Emma.
- Praise the Lord, Sis.
- Did Bishop eat lunch today?
- You know how stubborn that man is.
We might have to feed him intravenously.
My cobbler don't taste as good that way.
Bishop, did you eat anything?
I brought you some of my--
[GASPING]
Are you okay, Bishop?
I can never find what I need.
[GASPING]
Are you looking in the right places?
This was Angie's responsibility.
Angie's not the only one that can look after you.
MAN 1:
I'm all right. I'm all right.
GIRL 1: Girl, come on.
GIRL 2: I'm all right.
MAN 2:
I'm coming. Hold up.
MAN 3: All right, y'all. Let's go, let's go.
- Watch your hand.
Angie.
I can't believe what you did for me on the bus.
I've had a lot of practice.
Yeah, but I've never been nice to you.
And if you hadn't been there...
...then I probably would've--
Thank you.
You would've done the same for me.
PEACHES:
Don't you believe that.
You really wanna do my role?
If you're gonna be my understudy, you got a lot of work to do.
You got blocking and cues.
So you meet me in my room tomorrow afternoon.
Is Devlin gonna be there?
Girl, please. No, that's over with.
I promise.
Listen...
Listen, I'm quitting the show pretty soon.
Now, I can't really talk about it much right now...
...but you're good, Angie.
This role was made for you.
[SINGING]
Daddy, can I please come back home
Hold me closer, never let me go
- Sing.
[SINGING] Daddy, can I please come
No, Angie. Come on, now.
We been through this.
No, no, no. That's--
Stop.
You sing every song the same way every time.
- I'm singing it just like you.
- That's the problem.
Now, our audience may not be the most sophisticated, but they are discerning.
And they can spot a lie.
How am I lying?
By not relating.
Every song should be different...
...because your character is experiencing something different at the show.
- I know that.
- Okay, well, then sing it.
Tell me the story.
- What story?
- Angie, okay, now. What's the play about?
A small-town girl, doesn't appreciate home...
...so she leaves, but then she regrets it.
And by then, it's too late.
Her father's dead, and she's in this world all by herself.
Okay.
Then play it.
She's three different people.
She's the girl that leaves home who's full of curiosity.
She's the one in the world that's blinded by lust.
And the girl who repents.
There you go.
All three of those girls would sing the same song...
...three different ways.
- Wow. Can I try it again?
- Come on.
[SINGING]
Daddy, can I please come back home
- Yes, Angie.
- Hold me closer, never let me go
You better sing, girl.
I know that's right.
What?
I'm just trying to figure out how I got so far off-track.
I used to be on fire for the Lord.
You gonna get all holy on me again?
Can I at least let my food digest?
This needs to stop.
What needs to stop?
Do you really need to ask?
There really isn't any record deal, is there?
You just made the whole thing up to keep me on your string.
- So you think I'm lying to you?
- Mm-hm.
[BEEP]
MYKE [ON PHONE]: Devlin, Myke Jarett,
Rub Rhythm Records.
Looking forward to seeing you
in New York.
Don't forget to bring that lovely talent
you discovered. Peace.
Thank you for letting me hear that.
I really--
I really needed to hear that.
You know what?
One day--
One day you gonna realize ain't no man got your back like me.
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry. I just--
Excuse me.
- Can I sit there, please?
- Yep.
Come on in.
Thank you.
You gonna say "I told you so," aren't you?
No, I'm not gonna say that at all.
I mind my own business.
You're a good guy, Ike.
We both know you're not quite such a good judge of character. Hm?
[BOTH LAUGH]
- It's really coming down-- Thank you.
- Come on.
- Thank you. It's coming down.
- Oh, I can't thank you enough.
- I hope it wasn't an imposition.
- Well, it was.
But I didn't mind.
[WATKINS LAUGH]
How do you know that Angie is coming home?
Because I'm a man of faith.
That robe that I wear every Sunday?
I thought that might give it away.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Bishop.
Listen, I found a lovely robe.
- Well, she's getting older so--
- Bishop, I got this.
If you say so.
And look what else I got.
Oh, that's nice.
It's nice, isn't it?
That's nice.
Dev?
You in here?
Luke 15 is the chapter of lost faith.
The lost sheep.
The lost corn.
And the lost child.
[CRYING]
Remember, everybody, the bus leaves at 6 a. m. sharp.
New York is about a 12-hour drive, so wear something comfortable.
Hey, Litha.
- I just wanna say I'm proud of you.
- Don't try and be nice to me now.
- Litha.
- Got you.
All right.
BISHOP:
Wynton?
How you doing?
You make us proud.
You're not only representing our church...
...but our savior as well.
Thanks for not making me feel too much pressure.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Well, you can only do your best, son.
Thank you.
Well, Wynton.
I miss my daughter.
I feel I may have held the reigns a little too tightly.
Everybody needs the freedom to make their own mistakes.
Learn on their own.
I understand, Bishop.
I understand.
Six a. m. sharp.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Peaches.
- What is it?
- New York.
Is it still there?
Yes.
Cool. Make sure no one takes it.
When I was a little girl...
...I would daydream this imaginary tour.
We start off at Carnegie Hall...
...then the Met...
...and then the Garden.
Even Broadway.
But I saved the best for last:
The Apollo.
And just before I ended my song...
...Chaka or Aretha or someone awesome like that...
...would come in from outside...
...and join me in a duet.
Peaches?
What do you dream about?
Peaches?
BISCUIT:
I dream, Angie.
One day people will notice the size of my talent...
...rather than the size of the man.
New York is that kind of place.
IKE:
Let's go, folks, let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. I got 36 hours to take this stuff back.
I don't have all day. Let's go. Let's go.
My man. Listen. I need those wires connected and everything working.
Okay? I had a problem last time.
- Where are my leads?
- On their way, here in an hour.
Got sound check in a hour.
Everybody ready in 45 minutes.
- Where are my leads?
- We're ready.
Don't, "We're ready, Ike," me.
Where's Devlin?
He had a big meeting with some record people.
- With who?
- A record label.
You tell the record company to give him his paycheck.
Tell them I said that.
Oh, yeah. You playing two roles tonight.
You're playing Cookie and Grandma.
I need you out there at intermission selling programs.
Help her out with that.
ANGIE: I'm sick of this.
- Okay, give me a sec.
Ike.
Ike!
Ike.
- What?
- Look, my contract's almost up.
You know Angie's your girl.
She got my role down.
I mean, she's good but nobody know her.
I need somebody there that can sell tickets.
I got one of the En Vogue girls coming to the show tonight.
And if she likes it, she's gonna take over next month.
You know how the game go.
What's the point of being an understudy?
- Angie, chill.
- I've been understudying for months.
Angie, not right now, okay?
It's bad timing.
You got a beef with me, young lady?
What if I do? You ain't God.
You keep talking, find your way home, all right?
Give her a break, all right?
She's going through some things.
Yeah, she gonna be going through airport security if she keep talking.
In fact, get her a bus ticket.
Let her catch the bus home.
This whole thing is a joke.
So unprofessional.
Unprofessional?
Everybody stop. Everybody stop.
Stop. Did you hear what she just said?
This whole thing is unprofessional.
Let me tell you what unprofessional is.
You acting like a little hoochie.
Jumping in and out of bed with Devlin before you knew him.
Unprofessional is having your boyfriends fighting backstage. That's unprofessional.
In fact, unprofessional is the way you just talked to me.
You better be glad I like you, little girl.
You know what?
I don't like you that damn much.
You're fired.
Anybody else got a problem with how I run my show?
Pick up your paycheck and go home.
Hey, let him cool down, okay?
You're gonna get your chance, Angie, but you gotta be patient.
When I get my record deal...
...he's gonna regret who he fired.
All right, let's get back to work.
I got money to make, and I got a show to do.
And let's keep it professional.
[LAUGHS]
Hey, here they are.
Devlin, my main man.
Boy, it's been some long, long years.
Man, you are looking good, boy.
This is a nice place, man. Glad to see you finally spending some money.
Well, you know, hey, nothing but the best.
This is Theodore Bell, our executive vice president.
How you doing, sir?
Wow, the Theodore Bell.
If nothing comes out, worth it just meeting you.
Well, I'm flattered.
[RECORDING]
Message one.
MYKE: Devlin, MJ.
We're at the Marriott Marquis.
See you at the restaurant in an hour.
Top floor.
Hey, bring that girl with you.
She better be all that.
My man Myke was telling me...
...about how you guys are trying to resurrect the whole romantic duo.
Like Peaches and Herb.
Tammi and Marvin.
- Dev.
- No, I'm cool with it.
I'm willing to put my solo career on hold to make it all happen.
Is he serious?
That's not what I said.
I said I would pitch the idea to Mr. Bell.
But it was a long shot.
- Well, that's not the way--
- Devlin. Devlin.
Let me be clear so there's no more confusion.
We're not looking for male vocalists, and certainly not one with baggage.
- Man, you don't even know me.
- All right, let's put our cards on the table.
Nobody, nobody, no record company wants you.
You got a bad rep. You got bad sales.
What, public intoxication?
What, domestic violence?
Extramarital affairs.
Your loss.
Let's go, Des. We up out of here.
We want her.
Not you.
We want a female artist who can cross over.
But as long as she's signed to us, you get a managerial fee.
Are you crazy?
You think I came all the way up here...
...to give you my artist?
We can get a deal anywhere.
Fine.
Well, back to the Chittlin' Circuit.
You look for us on the charts, player.
Let's go, Des.
Let's go, baby.
Hey.
Let's go, Des.
[DESIREE CLEARS THROAT]
I'll take the managerial fee.
This contract is a preliminary one.
Hey. Sorry, baby, I'm late.
Did you try and call me?
The reception at the hotel is terrible.
But I got the message off the voicemail.
So I'm here. Hi.
- Who is this?
- I'm Angie.
I'm the singer that Devlin was telling you about.
There must be some mistake.
Hi, Des, What are you doing here?
Angie, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.
- What is this?
DESIREE: Sweetie.
I'm the one they came to meet.
Angie, go home.
You don't belong here.
You never did.
From the time I was a little girl...
...my father always told me how much he loved me.
How beautiful I was.
And because he said I was...
...I was.
Because my daddy never lied to me.
But then I met you.
And for the first time in my life...
...I felt like nothing.
But the Devlin is a liar.
And now I know...
...that I am not what you say I am.
But I'm what my father says I am.
The child of a King.
I'm sorry to disturb your meeting.
Congratulations, Des.
And congratulations to you too.
Damn groupies.
You ain't nothing.
I'll choose my own manager, if you don't mind.
Here you go. Here you go, ma'am.
Can you check this out, please?
- Here.
- Thank you.
MAN: Go check out the Gospelfest at the Apollo, all right?
WOMAN:
Gotta go.
ANGIE:
Taxi!
Taxi! How do I get to the Apollo Theater?
- Get in. I'll get you there.
- Okay.
Final sound checks.
Testing. Check one.
Testing, testing, testing, one, two, three.
[SINGING]
You couldn't see me
So you couldn't feel me
I've been standing here alone
Singing this sad song
Standing here,
right here in front of you
You couldn't see it
So how were you
To know it
In my heart, I'm holding you
In my prayers, I pray for you
I love you, yeah
ANGIE [SINGING]:
Oh, I finally see you
Oh, how I needed you
And you've been here all along
I needed your song
I feel you, yeah
- Now you can see it
- See it
- Oh, now we can
- Oh, now we can
- Feel it
- Feel it
Don't know how much this means to me
Thank you for not quitting on me
I'll never ever let you down again
I'll never ever let you down
My friend
I've never heard you sing like that before.
I sing my heart out every day.
You just never listened.
Your--
Your play still in town?
I got fired.
Just c-- Just come home.
Your father misses you.
Hm?
I miss you.
Wynton, what do you see in me?
I see...
...a lost little girl.
I see a lovely lady.
I see...
I see a virtuous woman.
I'm such a mess--
I'm such a mess right now.
Just stay with me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Angie.
PEACHES:
Angie.
Girl, I have been looking all over for you.
- Come to the theater with me.
- What's wrong?
Desiree can't go on. You're the only person who knows her role.
Why? Is she sick?
- Just come on. Hurry.
- Okay.
Are you forgetting that I got fired today?
Is Ike okay with this?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Ike, I had no--
- You need to get into makeup, now.
- We're going!
Right now!
Ike sent me to find you.
Wait. I can't work with Devlin.
- I can't even look him in the face.
- You won't have to.
- He told Ike it was either him or you.
- And?
- And what? Do you see him here?
- Well, who took his place?
Say hello to your new leading man.
ANGIE:
I love it.
But wait, wait.
I gotta check on Des first.
Desiree is fine.
She refused to go on because she said it was your time.
She did that for me?
Is it your time, Angie?
[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING]
I'm so far away from home
I don't know how I ended up here
All alone
Seems like just yesterday
Everything was all right
How did I get here tonight
I was raised better than this
Daddy, you don't know how much I miss
All the lessons life taught you
- Tried to tell me so I wouldn't have to
CHOIR: Go through
Cry myself to sleep
Cry myself to sleep
Trying to find some peace
Your little girl has just one question
For you tonight
Daddy, can I please come back home?
Hold me close and never let me go
I wanna say I'm sorry, Daddy
Every time I let you down
Can I come home tonight?
And tell me everything will be all right
What am I gonna do?
If I can't come home to you
Am I still Daddy's little girl?
In this big bad world
I'm calling out to you now
- Please hear me some way somehow
CHOIR: I was raised better than this
- Oh, yeah, yeah
- Daddy, you don't know how much I miss
All the lessons life taught to you
You tried to tell me so I wouldn't have to
- Go through
CHOIR: Cry myself to sleep
I cry myself to sleep
Trying to find some peace
CHOIR: Your little girl has just
One question for you
ANGIE:
Tonight
- Daddy, can I please come back home?
- Can I come home tonight?
- Hold me close, don't let me go, no
- Hold me close, don't let me go, no
CHOIR: I wanna say I'm sorry, Daddy
Every time I let you down
ANGIE:
Please forgive me
Tell me everything will be all right
I'm tired of getting independence
I'm tired of all the dumb pretending
Like I'm someone I'm not
When I'm so doggone lost
I wanna be free from these chains
A virtuous woman free of pain
I'm calling out to you now
Please hear me someway somehow
Back home
Hold me close and never let me go
I wanna say I'm sorry, Daddy
Every time I let you down
Can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be all right
Daddy, can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be all right
Daddy, can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be all right
Daddy, can I come home
Tonight? Tonight?
[CROWD CHEERING]
Tonight?
DEVLIN:
Angie.
Look, I know I hurt you.
I know I did some things to you that wasn't right.
I'm sorry.
I asked the Lord back into my life.
I'm saved.
I just need you to pray for me.
Angie, wait.
I was hoping we could cut a demo together. A duet.
My cousin gets her hair done by Babyface's aunt...
...and I know she could get it to him.
I've never said this to any woman in my life.
I love you.
Devlin.
Angie.
Angie.
Angie!
Hey, where to?
I'm going home.
BISHOP:
Let us welcome our esteemed mayor.
MAYOR: Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Bishop King.
I am honored on behalf of the city of Augusta...
...to acknowledge your many years of service to the community.
I hereby--
I hereby dedicate this day...
..."Mount Calvary Day of Appreciation."
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I truly--
MAYOR:
This was my church home as a child.
I guess the lesson here is that we can always come back home.
WOMAN 1: Who is that?
WOMAN 2: That's Angie.
MAN: That's Angie?
WOMAN 3: That's Angie.
That's Angie. That's Angie.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
BISHOP: In the story we are told
that when the child returned home...
...the father gave him a ring of gold
and draped him in a fine robe.
And the father was grateful.
CROWD:
Yes.
BISHOP:
And I too am grateful...
...for my wife...
...and your new first lady.
Praise God.
Thank you, Lord.
- Nobody takes care of family like family.
MAN: Amen!
I mean, hey, we're doing okay.
A number one gospel CD, can't knock that.
Okay, girl.
And speaking of knocked, the next time you think you are...
...you might wanna ask somebody, rather than messing up that test.
When I do eventually get pregnant.
WYNTON:
Her husband will rejoice.
God did say he would give you a testimony.
No, he said...
...a marvelous testimony.
Come on, y'all. Let's do this.
The movie starts soon.
I can't wait to see my baby daddy,
Allen Payne.
BISHOP: They had a feast.
CROWD: Yeah.
Some of you all might call it a cookout.
That which was lost is now found.
My child is home.
[CROWD CHEERING]
God! He is good!
Yes, he is!
I love Glee!
My favorite character would be Rachel.
Yeah, the best character is Rachel.
Because she was very
Barbra Streisand-esque.
Well, I'm warming up before the show.
I generally start with a lukewarm cup of hot water with lemon and honey.
It can't be too hot because it will hurt your vocal chords.
My favorite character is Firm.
Blaine. He is so adorable.
I just love him to death.
My favorite character is
Brittany, because she's so dumb.
But she's so pretty and she can dance so well.
I think it has a lot to do with my hair, because look at how long it is and how beautiful it is.
My favorite character is Sam because he's really cute.
Finn!
I think the hottest character is definitely Santana.
I ingest l.3\iSS€.
It's normally supposed to be applied on your lids to make your lashes grow.
I just took it one step further and started drinking it.
Puck! Puck!
Rachel! Rachel!
Meme. maine.
Acrually, maine.
Sam. Sam.
No, Puck. Puck.
He's so funny. He's super, super cocky and just totally into himself
I heard that this haircut might make me go a little faster, have a little edge on the competition.
And, you know, the ladies like something to grab on to, time and time again.
Artie, for me, because he makes looking geeky look so cool.
It's crazy because I can't believe that people actually like us enough that we could make a 3-D movie.
I'd have to go with Blaine.
Definitely Blaine.
We've gone from Lima, Ohio, to Dublin, Ireland.
And we've done four countries.
And it's just been an amazing experience.
That means my face is going to be in 3-D.
And my pimples.
Sam!
Finn.
Everyone is my favorite,
I can't choose just one.
I like Quinn because she's really hot.
I need more...
Could you turn the camera off? I need.,.
Oh, God. 3-D?
Kurt is my favorite character.
I love his sassiness and how he's not afraid to tell it exactly how ii is.
Thank you for loving me.
But I want to thank everybody who has been with me since day one.
All my Glee Club members and Mr. Schue. We made it.
(slNGING) Don? stop
A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows
Searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere m me nigh:
Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything
10 roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Don? stop belfevfn'
Hold on fo that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don? stop belfevfn'
Hold on fo that feelin'

Sing it from the heart
Sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Cleaned-up corporation progress
Dying in the process
Buy yourself the motivation
Generation nothing
Nothing but a dead scene
Product of a white dream
I am not the singer that you wanted But a dancer
I refuse to answer
Talk about the past, sir
Wrote it for the ones who want to getaway
Keep running

Boy you got to be what tomorrow needs
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
MAN ON MEGAPHONEZ Guys, we've got free Glee taltoos_ Free Glee tempos.
I think it's made me accept myself better.
I like performing, but I was never comfortable doing ii.
I have three daughters, two boys, and we all watch
Glee every week.
And it gave us all something in common.
Everybody watches Glee.
It doesn't matter what race, gender, what your sexuality is.
Anybody can be a Glee fan.
It inspires me that you could write your own life story no matter who you are.
Glee has definitely changed the way that I look at certain groups of people.
And short people and tall people and fat people and skinny people, really popular and nerdy people.
The clique that I hang out with is the jock clique.
I guess il could be the popular clique, also.
I would say
I am a real life Cheerio, but I'm not a stuck-up Cheerio.
But I am a Cheerio because I am a cheerleader.
COACH PAGE: Here we go. Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
JANAE: Coach Page, she is Sue Sylvester.
Let's do it for Sue.
Janae is our secret weapon, and when we went to Nationals, people underestimated our squad because we had her.
And she was the one who actually saved our routine.
She can go pretty high.
She's small, but she's like a little ball.
JANAE: I would say I'm popular because I am different.
Everyone does know me.
I stand out.
Go, team Gleei
I know you know this one.
Rocks in the sky!
Get them up. Let's go!
Bounce With me.
BOUNCE With me!
Hey! Hey!
Up top. Let's go!
(RAPPING) Yeah, yeah, I'm out that
Brooklyn Now I'm down in TriBeCa
Right next to De Niro
But VH be hood forever

ARTIE: it's your boy!
My favorite character would have to be Brittany.
Brittany,
Brittany.
I hope they have an overwhelming sensation about my boobs in Slave because they are 3-D and they look really good.
My favorite character is Brittany S. Pierce.
I'm the biggest
Glee fan in the world.
I'm getting a Glee tattoo.
My cat's name is Santana, my dog's name is Brittany,
I'm wearing Glee shoes,
I have a Cheerios jacket, my entire house is Glee, and my car was named Quinn until I crashed it.
This is Brittany's hat from
Blame It (On the Alcohol).
I have definitely made friends because of Glee.
It's changed my whole social life.
And it'S Off.
Lt'S Still On.

JOSEY: Itls a huge thing for me, honestly, to have people over and in my house because / HSVSf' had that before.
It makes me feel normaf.
I was 15 years old when I was diagnosed with Asperger's.
It's common to have anxiety, panic, any kind of just "meltdowns," is what we usually call them.
The more you get to know me, the more obvious it is.
It's just like this crazy madness in my mind.
But I do have one thing that is my pick-me-up and gets me through it, and that's
Brittany S. Pierce.
Brittany has, what we like to call,
"The Brittany Effect" on me.
When I see a Brittany video, it's like something switches in me, and I'm happy.
I am the biggest Brittany fan.
I will fight for that.
There 's no doubt about ft!
My dog is named Brittany.
Come on!
I know I may be young
But I've got feelings, too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go, and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay
For me to step into this worfd?
Always saying, Little girl don't step into the club

GIRL: I'm a very judgmental person, and at first glance I could dehnitely write somebody off
And Glee has taught me that everybody has a story.
GIRL 22 /think that we're the majority.
We 're the quirky, weird kids.
We don? all look the same way.
I've been the shy kid always.
And especially Kurt being so out and being able to just be him, and be trendy and fashionable, it really helped me kind of want to just be me a little bit more.
TRENTON: I can connect with
Kurt on a very personal level.
I came out when
I was in eighth grade.
And I'm like, "I can go through the same thing as he does."
So it's like real life.
Well, in the first semester of eighth grade, my whole life changed dramatically.
I did not come out by choice at all.
I had a journal.
My journal was someone that wasn't going to judge me, no matter what I told it.
I! Wouldjusf listen.
I had this crush on this guy named Brian.
He had the most gorgeous eyes ever.
I wrote many letters to him that I would never give him.
It would start off with,
"Brian, hi.
"I know we don't talk very often,
"but I've liked you since the seventh grade."
Bfiafl foUI"ld OUT that l had 3 crush on l'1il'T'l because my best friend at the time took my journal, and set it on his desk during class.
And he just opened it and just started reading everything.
Everymmg_
And IW3S So €IT1b3ff3SS€d.
(SINGING) Ain? no way
For me to love you
If you won't let me
No
I know that a woman's duty is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned
I said stop trying to be
Someone you're not
And if you need me to love you
Say, say you do
Oh then, baby, baby
Baby, don't you know that
I need you?
It ain't no way
How y'all doing over here?
It ain't no way
What about back here?
Itjust ain't no way, baby
Over here?
It ain't no way, baby
It ain't no way
For me to love you
If you won't

Thank you for letting me sing for you tonight! Have fun!

Prom is tonight, and I'm nominated in the top five for Prom Princess.
And I really hope
I make it and I win.
Are you nervous?
Yeah, I'm the only cheerleader in top five. isn't that crazy?
I'm so excited.
GIRL: You haven't showed me a picture of him yet.
I was like, "What'?"
H€'S CUTS.
JANAE: This yean I'm going to prom with Reed Cook.
He's known for just being fun.
And he's a football player.
He's of average stature.
Yeah, he's handsome.
I don't usually go to dances with average-sized guys.
I usually go with a little person.
I was looking for a date to prom and I olidn't know who to ask.
And Janae has been telling me, "Coach,
"I don't have anybody to goto prom."
Because I was like, "It would be fun to go with him."
I was just throwing it out there as, like,
"Wouldn't that be COOI?"
Thinking it would never, ever happen.
REED: Artie, he's in a wheelchain he's got two girls.
Finn and Rachel, she's a nerd, he's a jock, it worked out.
Puckerman and Zizes, she's big, he doesn't care. He likes hen
And Janée, she's small, but I don? Care.
I don't think that Should matter.
She's just a fun person to be around.
I was kind Of afraid to 63.3 hef.
I was nervous.
I didn't know if she'd say yes or no.
Just one day during the break,
I decided, "if I'm going to do it,
I've got to do it right now."
JANAE:
And Reed came walking up.
I was just like,
"I think it might happen."
And he got down on one knee, and he just asked me to prom right then and there.
REED: She was... I don't know.
She was surprised, definitely surprised.
She didn? know if
I was serious or not.
Until I was like, "Yeah, will you goto prom with me?"
Said ii a couple of more times, but...
I was just like, "Yeah.
"Because I was so nervous, also.
I never thought
I had any chance in the world to have him ask me to prom.
(SINGING) Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams But no one seems to hear a thing?
Do you know That there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there 's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And lei it Shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go
Oh, oh, oh
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework

After class, he rushed out of class.
He was the first one out.
And he took the notebook with him, actually.
He shared my journal with everyone.
I felt like everyone was looking at me differently already.
They all knew.
It spread like wildfire.
And when I heard that, I never wanted to come back to the school.
And that was on a Monday.
At the end of the day, I got my journal back, and I wanted to rip it up because I didn't want my family to Hnd out about me.
But l just thought they would still Hnd it,
So I decided to burn if insfead.
That's when lbecame very bottled in, even when people teased me and made fun of me throughout the year.
And, it'S just hard because WS hafd
I0 deal with it. lt'S hard.
Kurt taught me a lot because he was the only out kid at his school,
And he was proud.
And just like in the prom episode, he did go off running, but he came back, and he held his head up and smiled.
The SUI? is shining

INTERVIEWER: Is it true that you told
Mercedes that you sing better than her?
Yes, because l UO.
But that's okay.
Mercedes, what do you think about this?
She doesn't have to answer that if she doesn't want to.
Well, I'm going to lock her in a closet.
I mean, who even would try?
Do you see her?
INTERVIEWER:
Is it war, Rachel?
No.
She might act like she's all nice and fu n-spirited and whatnot.
I can't even say these words because my ears are too innocent.
I was minding my own business.
I just decided to go for a stroll on stage, sing a song.
When, out Of nowhere a woman that looked like she should have been caged in the zoo had somehow escaped and grabbed me with her giant bear hands.
You wanna make out?
Brittany, are you flirting with my man?
Tina.
I just want to push her.
She doesn't want to get a smackdown.
She's afraid of the wrath.
She knows what I've done to people.
I've beaten you up.
I've beat her up.
It's kind of crazy.
I thought I would be super famous.
And it happened.
I'm just really thankful because somebody has to compete with Kurt.
Everybody's got a dream.

JANAE: High school guys, they're kind of self-conscious.
And I'm very short.
And so it's like, why take me when you can take this beautiful
5'4" tall, blonde girl?
You know?
Come on, two steps to your left.
All right, guys.
Okay, all the girls in?
All right, we're set.
JANAE: I'm excited because Reed had enough courage to ask me.
And he'S »"? Of
Seff-CoflSCfOU$ about ff.
And he's like, "Yeah, I'm taking a dwarf.
We're going to have fun."
We honestly danced the night away.
It was just fun because
I dance like a maniac.
And so does Reed, actually.
It's 10:30, so half-an-hour until they announce Prom Princess.
Oh, no. Okay, now you have me nervous. (LAUGHS)
They lined us up, and we were standing backstage.
And my stomach, like, kind of
IIJITISU il'1fO Kl'10\S and I just got butterflies.
WOMAN: And, last but not least, we have Anthony Banas and Janae Meraz.
And your Prince and Princess are...
Haden BSFFOW and Janie IVI€F3Z.
I was really shocked.
And so, I was just like, "Did they mess up, or is that actually me?"
And then they came and they put in on my head.
And I was like,
"Oh! It'S me!"
WOMAN: Congratulations, guys.
COACH PAGES She has tons of friends.
And I have absolutely no idea why nobody who is an average-sized person
HBS HSVEI' taken hef tO B UBHCS.
But Reed didn 'I think twice.
He absolutely didn't think twice.
I think, for the Hrs! time, he proved to her that people see her as just her, not as a fittfe person.
JANAE: I guess you could say
Glee has changed my life, because it's opened my eyes that people are different.
And l'rTl like,
"l have to l'el°f18l'T1D&l' 'll'l31I."
Because it's like,
I know I'm different, but I'm not realizing that everyone else is different around me, also.

Let's go get some tacos.
At the time in my life when I got into Glee, it was just hard.
It was dealing with losing my father.
It was dealing with the being different.
Andjust so many things were happening.
And she kind of just popped into my life when I needed someone, when I just felt so negative and down on myself
When I met her in person, she fully embraced me and my quirks.
And she Sat lhefe, and she held my hands and listened to me talk to her.
I never felt more understood than in that moment when I looked her in the eye and had this conversation with her.
And it was that moment I really wanted to change and be a better person, and be a positive, happy person because I looked at this girl and looked at what she had done for me in such a short time, and knew I want to be like her, and I want to be a positive light in peoples' lives.
I think I have to Cry.
(SINGING) Oh please
Say to me
You'f.~' fer me be your man
And please
Say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
Hi.
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
J't's such a feeling
That my love
I Can? hide
Yeah, you
You got that something
I think yOU'h' understand

When I
Say that something
I wanna hold
Your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

TRENTON: I transferred to a new school when I was a junior in high school, and I got into the theater department, and I started doing musicals.
The theater department here is like Glee Club because we're a family just like Glee Club is a family.
And all of us are different in some sort of way.
And we all just come together as one.
I actually did wish that l had someone to look up to like Kurt.
I feel like if he were there, like, out, when I was in eighth grade,
I could be like,
"Look at him being gay,
"and he stiff gets to five his dream."
Butnowl'm 19-years-old and I'm all grown up, and I completely accept myself
And I'm a person with no secrets now.
I am open to the world, everyone.
If you ask me if I'm gay,
I am proud to stand up and say that,
"Yes, Trenton Thompson. I am gay!"
And I couldn't do that before.
And now it's like I have no secrets.
So if I write something down and someone finds it, it's like, "You could have just asked."
I'm really not a big fan of my nose, ever since I was really young.
For me it was either this or "Little
One," because I'm really short.
I can't sing, but I can dance.
I was kind of, you know, the weirdo with red hair.
For me it was either this or "Perfectionist,"
Mine says
"Brace Face,"
We're Lebanese and proud.
And proud.
Out and proud to be Lebanese.
And love softball.
I wanted to be like
Rachel in high school.
But instead I joined the Navy, so I'm not on stage.
I am obviously Brittany.
Santana.
We're waiting here for this girl.
She just got into a car accident on the way here.
And she HBS
OUI' UCKEYS.
(SINGING) It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
(SINGING) My mama told me when I was young
We are ah' born superstars
She rolled my hair
Put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudofr
(SINGING) There's nothing wrong with loving who you are
She said 'Cause he made you perfect, babe
So hold your head up, girl
And you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent You're Lebanese, you're Orient
Whether life's disabilities left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause, baby, you were born this way
No matter black, white or beige Chola or Orient-made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
There ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
There ain't no other way

(SINGING) Glee, Glee
Did they really make US do that?
Did we really do that?
That was too easy.
I think that everyone can see themselves in the cast of Glee.
I think it's really cool that people are able to peel back the layers to find something that was already there inside of them.
Glee is like my medicine.
It makes me happy.
It puts me in a good place.
It can be VSU/ difficult with Asperger's because we have major social anxiety.
I wouldn't even really go to concerts or anything.
I was very much a homebody.
I didn? even go to schoof.
Glee is the reason Igor out the door that first day, and went to my first crass.
TRENTON: One thing I did learn is to be proud of yourself
Don't be afraid.
Stand up for what you believe in.
For me, I'm small, so that's my challenge.
Glee helps you realize that everyone goes through their own struggles.
You've got to notice the little people in life.
(SINGING) You may think that I'm a zero

 This is my dad.
 He's pretty successful.
 And here's my beautiful, generous mom,
 my rockin nanny Alicia.
Toast, finely buttered.

 This is me, Whitney Brown, candidate for middle school student body president.
 Oh, that's Josh, my opponent.
 He's sweet and all, but he doesn't stand a chance.
 This is Brenford academy, my school.
 Well, its not about who you know but who knows you.
 And in my case, that's pretty much everybody.

A vote for me is the vote for fun.
What does that even mean?
Well, I'm running on a party pop form, promising a fantastic pop formal for one and all.
Even scholarship kids like you.
WHITNEY: Oh, thats Olivia,
Josh's running mate.
 The most unfun girl in school.
You are never too young to stay out late and dress up right?
Sounds good to me.
I'm Ben, transferred from Haborfern.
Hi, I'm Whitney Brown.
So, I've heard.
You are in politics, huh?
I'm into fun.
How about you?
Football mostly.
We should go now.
Wow, sure grown cute at Haborfern.
Well, good morning boys and girls.
STUDENTS: Good morning.
You know why we are here today.
To elect the vice president and then the president of the student body.

So, do I have to call you like madam president now?
Only at official functions.
When we are just hanging out,
President Brown would be fine.
Would the formal be considered an official function?
Definitely, but may be I can relax the rules just for that one night.
Cool, call you later then, prez.
Okay girls, lets go be presidential.
[GIGGLING TOGETHER]
I know he's your boss honey,
But do we really have to go?
WHITNEY: Mom
One second, we always go.
Can't we just have one night at home, please?
All right, fine, fine.
I will be there, okay, what time?
Joan, we gotta pick up the color for the bed room by Friday.
One sec, one sec.
No, I told the Spencer's
I'm coming to New York this weekend.
Get mine.
All right, all right fine.
All right. I got it.
On Friday, you're coming.
I'll be there.
I love you. I've got to go.

Oh honey,
I knew you would.
I'm so proud of you.
How do you wanna celebrate?
Shop.
Okay, all right.
I'll take you shopping, young lady.
Just give me one hour,
I'm gonna finish up.
If I'm meant to live on my campaign promise,
I've to wear something like totally fabulous.

But mom...
Honey, all right.
Really quickly, okay?
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
This is what I'll do.
Just this once, go with your friends but be reasonable.
All right, one pair of shoes, one dress and I'll let you borrow a bag of mine.
Margaret, I'm so sorry.
I'm going at about a million different directions at the same time.
I know the formal is still months away, but after we find something to wear, we've gotta find dates.
I've already got one.
With Ben Wheeler.
Oh my god, you're so lucky.
Its true,
I am.
He's like the cutest guy in school, in any school, anywhere.
And he's still got the new guys smile.
How about this one?
I like the color but cashmere might be too casual for the formal.
WHITNEY: I always say nothing's too casual with the right shoes.
I don't think that's right.

This one's like broken or something.
Sweetheart, we have a bit of bad news.
You mean, besides this?
Daddy lost his job.
So, he'll get a new one, right?
Yeah, sure, eventually, but...
In the mean time, we are going to have to cut back,
Make some changes.
You are not cutting back on my clothing allowance, are you?
'Cause due to my new exulted position, my dress for the formal needs to be couture.
I was thinking Mark Jacobs at the very least.
It's a little worse than that,
I'm afraid.
We're... broke.
That's not bad news, thats a nightmare.
WHITNEY: Maybe
I should explain.
 Turns out my dad lost more than just his job.
 The bank took our cars, our houses, everything.
 My life, deleted.
Now remember, bread plus toaster equals toast.
Okay, no latte?
Oh honey, pay for starbucks, huh.
Grace, I want you to have my gym locker and all the cosmetics therein.
Lil, I'm leaving you the admiration of of Zack.
Zack, when you look at her, think of me.
As vice president, I'm leaving you in charge during my absence.
What if you don't come back?
Oh, I'm coming back all right.
For the formal, right Ben?
I'm counting on it.
I'll be in touch regarding all the details.
You can't very well plan a formal without me now, can you?
Call me.
Everyday.
Text me.
Every hour.
E-mail me?
You got it, besides I need someone to help me pick up my Tux.
It won't be the same without her.
Yeah.
It'll be better.
WHITNEY: Just about the only thing we had left in the whole world
 was the farm house where my dad grew up.
It was only a couple of hours away from the city.
 But it may as well have been Mars.
 I hadn't been there since I was little.
After my grandmother died, grandpa and dad kind of fell out of touch.
 Grandpa moved away and the house was vacant.
 As soon as I saw it,
I knew why.
It hasn't changed a bit.
What a dump.
Certainly don't need a ... thorough cleaning.
Oh no, it doesn't need a cleaning.
It needs to be fumigated.
Now honey, nothing a little elbow grease can't change.

You know, they say home is where the heart is.
My heart is wherever you are.

It is time to go to... the couch.
Come on.

We saw our shares and everything's gonna be okay.
It is gonna be okay.
You'll see.
We are all here together.
Aren't we?
We're safe and warm and dry.
[WATER DRIPPING]
We're safe and warm.
[LAUGHING]
And not so dry.
Oh!
[ROOSTER CROWS]
[ROOSTER CROWS]
WHITNEY: Will somebody shut that thing up?
[CHICKENS CLUCKING]
[LAUGHING]
Good morning, wow.
Well, I guess you girls are what they call, free range, huh?
Okay.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Is that a carrot?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
I think it is.
Oh my!
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Look at this, huh.
Wanna share one with me?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Thank you very much, sir.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
[HAMMER AND NAIL PECKING]
What is that noise?
Well, good morning to you too, young lady.
That is your father.
He's up there trying to fix the roof.
With hammer and nails?
By himself?
HENRY: [GROANS] Oh god!
So far, anyway.
That corn chicken woke me up.
That was a rooster with a girlfriend.
Several of them as a matter of fact, look what they gave us.
It's pretty neighbourly, don't you think?
You cook?
Yes, I cook.
As a matter of fact, there was a time when I did all the cooking.
What is it?
It's scrambled eggs.
No latte?
Don't press your luck.
Why can't I get a signal?
This is ridiculous.
[PHONE VIBRATING]
Hello?
WHITNEY: Liz, can you hear me?
Here, one second.
LINDSAY: Hello, are you there?
How about now?
Wait you are breaking up.
Lindsay...
Hey, hang on, hang on, one second.
Hang on, hold on.
[SIGHING IN EXHAUSTION]
Okay, you there?
Hang on.
[SIGHS IN RELIEF]
Okay, can you hear me?
Oh, thank god.
I've so much to cover with you.
The decorations, the entertainment...
You wanna get a pen, because this is gonna be a lot to write down.
Here, let me sit down.
One second. Whoo!
Apparently they haven't heard of cellphone towers.
Whitney, I gotta go.
[BEE BUZZING]
[WHITNEY SCREAMS]
Hey, have you heard from Whit?
Yeah, that was her just now.
You are kidding.
I've called her and texted her about million times, and nothing.
Interesting.
You don't think she's mad, do you?
Not sure, but I could find out for you, if you want.
You could?
That would be great.
[WHITNEY GROANING IN PAIN]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Hey!
Thats my phone!
[EXCLAIMING IN HORROR]
Look what you did.

You know that colt by the inn pickets like you.
Wannabes, leeches and [HORSE GRUNTS] hangers on.
Now get...
[HORSE NEIGHS]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Look I'm sorry.
I did not mean it.
Come on, don't be mad.
Horsey!
Come here!
Are you hiding?
Horsey!
Here, horse, here.
Look, I said I'm sorry.
What else do you want from me?
[HORSE GRUNTS]
For such a big animal, you sure can hide.
Here, horse.

[BIRDS FLUTTERING AROUND]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
I'm Whitney and I live down the street.
I'm your new neighbor.
I know who you are.
You'd do well to watch where you are going, from now on.
Come on, Bob.
Jeez, I thought that my parents are weird.
[SIGHS IN RELIEF]
[BOLTS SHUDDERING]
Where have you been?
Meeting the neighbor.
Which neighbor?
The bruto that owns the horse.
His name is Bob and he is not gypsy, he's a stalker.
[DOOR KNOCKING]
Hey, whats up?
Just because we moved to this stupid place, my friends are gonna forget all about me.
Honey, that's ridiculous.
Come on, if they're your real friends they are not gonna forget you.
What are you talking about?
Of course, they are my real friends.
Well, then there you have it.
We are going back to Philly for the formal, right?
Alecia told me we could stay at her place.
Honey, we just got here.
Why not give this place a chance before you start thinking about going home?
Because I don't want to.
But tomorrow is a fresh start.
Its your first day at a new school.
Why don't you give it your best shot?
[SCREAMING]
Wow, look at you.
You uh... you look ready.
[CHUCKLES] Well, I figured I might as well take advantage of the dress code for free public school system.
[CAR REVS TO HALT]
You have got to be kidding me.
Would you rather walk for three miles to school like I did at your age?
But it'll be little difficult in those shoes.
Well, they are Tory Berch.
I wouldn't wanna ruin them.
Get in the truck.
WHITNEY: Can you drop me off a few blocks away?
I don't wanna stand out at my first day of school.
DAD: [LAUGHS]
You won't, I promise.
[LAUGHS]
I told you.
WHITNEY:
This is my new school?
Listen, you're gonna love it here.
I know, I did.
You're looking for a job, right?
Yeah.
So, there's a chance we might go home and not be here forever?
There's a chance.
There's no guarantee, so I need you to make the best of it, okay?
All right? Just have fun.
I'll be right here to pick you up after school, go out and pick up Willy.
If it's all the same to you,
I think I'll walk.
DAD: All right.
BOY: Hey, check her out.
GIRL: Who is that?
What has she got on?
New girl, check out the outfit.
Meow, city girls always sing to it.
[GIGGLING]

Thank you, horse.
Lucky for you, you're a horse because some of those kids in that school are not very nice.
Hey, I know what that is.
I've seen it in old movies.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
Lets go see if it works.
Do you mind, this call is of personal nature.
HORSE NEIGHS AND HUFFS:
[DIAL TONE]
[AUTOMATED VOICE]
Please deposit $3.60 for the first three minutes
Okey dokey.
This is so old school.
 Please deposit $3.60...
I already did that, plus the tip.
 Operator.
Hi, I put the money into this slotty thing in my jig,
I put a $5 bill and it didn't do anything.
OPERATOR: Coins, you need to use coins.
Coins? Really?
Is there anything else that I can do?
Collect.
Collect, ooh
I like the sound of that.
I think I'll do that.
Make it from Whitney. no, president Whitney Brown.
Hello.
OPERATOR: You got a call from president Whitney Brown.
Yeah, I'll accept,
I guess.
OPERATOR: You're now connected.
WHITNEY: Hey, oh my god.
You won't believe what I had to do to make a phone call in this place.
It's total hick spell here.
But I've had a lot of time to think about the formal.
And I've got some really great ideas about the theme.
LINDSAY: Well, its all been settled already.
What?
I thought we were gonna do it by committee.
We did and they decided on the Morris House hotel.
It was Ben's idea.
Ben, how is he?
I mean I've tried to call him but I don't get any cell service here.
He's good. Just really busy with football and other stuff.
But I gotta run,
I'll tell him you called, okay?
[DIAL TONE]
COACH: Come on guys, come on.
Keep it together. Five minutes.
Is that Whit?
No, just wrong number.
Ben, Zack come on, we gotta go to work.
We'll have plenty of time for girlfriends after practice.
BEN: Coming coach.
I thought coaching the national football league and stuff...
I wish coach Vermeer would just stay retired.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
Hey, why do you like me any way?
I mean, you don't even know me.
Well, move.
Come on.
[HORSE NEIGHS SOFTLY]
Come on, horsey.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
[HORSE NEIGHS SOFTLY]
Walking around barefoot, kind of hurts. I guess you're kind of used to it.
Do you think Lindsay was acting kind of strange?
I mean, not that you know her but...
[HORSE GRUNTS]
[FISHING ROPE PULLING]
It's all coming back to you, huh?
Yeah.
Blackberries.
Wow, they look good.
There are so many of these.
HENRY: I wonder how Whitney's first day at school went.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
Ow!
[HORSE GRUNTS]
Oh, I stepped on a bee and it fought back.
[SIGHS]
I guess I'll just stay up here and get eaten by bear since everyone seems to have forgot about me anyway.
[HORSE HUFFS]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What are you doing?
I wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, how sweet.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
Yeah, I did it, okay.
Um...
Oops.
Okay, just stay here, please don't take off.
I'm almost done, okay. [CHUCKLES]
Whoo! I did it.
I'm on a horse.
Okay, giddy up.
Giddy up, horsey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
G-Go.
[LAUGHS] look at me.
I'm like a cow girl now.
It sure beats walking.
Maybe you are not so bad after all.
JOAN: What's wrong?
It's staring at me.
I caught it myself,
I hope you are hungry.
No offense, dad, but I've been stared at enough for one day.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
At least somebody still wants to hang out with me.
She'll be all right.
She used to like sushi.
Here you go, are you hungry?
One for me and one for you.
I wonder what Ben is doing right now.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
Hey.
What are you doing?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What do you think you are doing, huh?
Hey!
WHITNEY: That horse had a knack of making me forget about my troubles.
 At least for a little while.
Okay, ladies, line up your fabric.
Lower your foot and go.
WHITNEY: As hard as I tried,
I couldn't seem to get anything right.
 And it got worse let me tell you.
 Even old Betsy had a chuck on my expense.
Just remember, you stay relaxed, the cow stays relaxed.
Ooh...
[LAUGHING]
[CLASS LAUGHS]
[COW MOOING]
WHITNEY: Two weeks into my exile,
 my access to Brenford e-mail accounts have been canceled,
 and no body could reach me by phone, even if they tried.
HENRY: How's she looking?
Lines are no good, we have to run some new ones from out of town.
Could take a while, couple of weeks.
Are you serious, a couple of weeks?
WHITNEY: A month dragged by, then another.
 I hadn't just moved,
I've been erased.
 It was like I didn't exist.
Finally I figured, if I wasn't gonna be able to make any new friends,
I might as well make the most out of one that I have.
But even Bob had his moments.
[BOB FARTS LOUDLY]
Ew, Bob! Whoa!
Ugh...
Ew Bob, what did you eat?
[HORSE NEIGHS AND FARTS LOUD]
Um... excuse me, is this organic?
Honey, I don't even know if it's dead.
WHITNEY: Don't get me wrong,
I understood the game.
 I've been popular before and I knew how it works.
 Observe, imitate, repeat, and pretty soon you're in.
 And that's when it came to me,
 if you can't beat em', join em'.
Duh!
GIRL: What a weirdo.
WHITNEY: While they were all laughing at me, I decided to create the new Whitney.
Good morning.
Whoa.
Who are you?
It's the new me,
Whitney 2.0.
So, what do you guys think, huh?
I like it.
So, would this new Whitney like some toast?
Yeah, but I've got it.
Bread plus toaster equals toast.
Nice to meet you, new Whitney.
[LAUGHS]
[GIRLS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
GIRL: Her dress is really cool.
WHITNEY: As anticipated, it wasn't long before my plan paid off.
GIRL: Come on, let's ask.
That's awesome, Whitney.
Oh , thanks.
I mean, I really like the cut and the style.
It's kind of retro, but sophisticated, is it for a party or something?
Maybe, at least I hope so.
Speaking of parties, we are kind of having a little hoedown at my house on Saturday, if you wanna come...
A hoedown?
Oh, Really?
Well, if you are not busy and all.
No, I'm not busy.
I mean...
I think I can squeeze it in.
Great, it's super casuals so it is like... threeish or something.
It's furthest farm on the road by the lake, you can't miss it.
Okay, thanks.
I guess I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]
[SIGHS IN RELIEF]
Yes.
WHITNEY: So I thought
I should make an extra special effort.
 I think Bob was enjoying watching me getting a hang of country life.
I'm going to tell you the number one rule about parties.
You have to arrive in style.
That's why we are saddling you up.
And now we are ready to go.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
I don't know if that's such a good idea, sweetheart.
I mean you don't even know if he's saddle broken.
Ow!
Or if you are for that matter.
Maybe I'll just stick with bare back.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
For enhanced shine, body and manageability.
Cannot hurt, huh?
Okay, ready to have some fun?
[POP MUSIC PLAYING]
Hey, it's raining.
[CHUCKLES]
Fooled you.
 ♪ Sunlight all around me
 ♪ Shadows disappear
Perfect.
Bob! Jeez, how long have you been growing this?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Nasty!
Can you hear in there?
No wonder, you don't listen.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Spit.
Ew, not on my boots!
Is this a manicure or pedicure?
Bob, what do you think?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
 ♪ And I can't stop myself
 ♪ I just wouldn't know how
WHITNEY: This will be my first hoedown, I hope they like my hat.

I may be here
[DISTANT PARTY CHATTER]
[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING]
Whitney, glad you could make it.
Are you on your way to like a rodeo or something?
No I just thought when you said hoedown...
Oh, I was kidding.
Yeah, I can see that... now.
Are you making fun of us or something?
No, no.
What's that?
Pound home blackberry crumble?
I knew it.
You are making fun of us.
You know, just because we are not from big city like you, doesn't mean we are like country hicks.
No, Yeah, totally
I know.
I didn't mean it that way.
I didn't mean to offend you guys.
WHITNEY: I just...
Did.
Guys...
[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING]
WHITNEY: I knew it.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Come on Bob, lets get out of here.
[HORSE NEIGHS AND GALLOPS]
[HIP HOP MUSIC FADES AWAY]
[BOB NEIGHS]
WHITNEY: I was sick to my stomach
I'd lost everything,
 all my old friends and now my new ones.
 It might be obvious to you, but riding a horse very fast when you're upset,
 and not thinking about what you are doing is not the smartest thing to do.
 Please don't try this at home.
[THUD]
[HORSE NEIGHS LOUD]
[HORSE NEIGHING AND HUFFING]
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
What happened?
What is it?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What's the matter?
Okay, show me, show me.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
WHITNEY: At times like this,
 you find out who your friends really are.
 Turns out your friends are your family.
Dad?
Whitney, dad, what happened?
You took quite a tumble there, didn't you?
Hell I wish it was before the party.
It was a disaster.
Here.
Oh, good, thank you.
That was a heck of a way to finally meet your grandfather.
JOAN: It's okay.
It's okay, you wanna talk about it?
No.
How is she?
I think she's gonna be fine.
Looks like a bump in her head, is all.
How'd you find her?
Bob found her.
[BOB YAWNS]
Bob?
Bob is yours.
Yeah.
How long have you been back?
Few months. I've been managing the horse operations for a fellow down the road.
Where have you been living?
There's an apartment over the barn.
What are you doing livin' in the barn when you have a perfectly nice house right here?
I don't know.
It do seem like a lot of responsibility.
Oh, I forgot.
That's not really been your thing, has it?
How about you?
What's a rich young hot shot like you doing out here in boondocks?
I'm not so rich.
I'm not so young.
I'm not such a hot shot anymore.
I lost my job.
Called a number I had for you in Florida.
Left a couple of messages,
I didn't hear anything so figured the whole place was empty.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
[LAUGHS SOFTLY]
Oh, if she's okay,
I'm gonna go.
HENRY: Dad.
Thank you for bringing my girl home safe and sound.
You're welcome.
[SIGHS]
She's my granddaughter whether she knows it or not.
She's a good kid, tenacious.
She's got a natural horse sense.
The best I've seen in a while.
Really?
Yeah.
You think she's got something?
She didn't get it from you.
[LAUGHS]
That's for sure.
Horse is always your thing, more than people.
Well...
Maybe you can work with her a little bit.
Maybe I can use some help in the barn.
But it wont be no walk in the park. She'll have to do the job.
I have a feeling, she will, and then some.
Me too.
Come on, Bob.
So, should I call you like grandpa?
If you want to.
Grandpa, gramps, grampy, how about Grumpy?
That fits you.
Okay, Whit, first order of business is to clean up the stalls.
When you are done with that, the dirty work begins.
[FLIES BUZZING]
WHITNEY: Ooh.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
GRANDPA: Okay, let's go.
It's important to remember that kissin' is for direction, and clucking's for gaits.
So, you're gonna kiss him?
GRANDPA: No, it's like this.
[IMITATES KISSING]
What happens when you crow?
It's not crow, it's cluck.
Like this.
[CLUCKING]
WHITNEY: Can I try?
GRANDPA: Be my guest.
Okay, come on.
[KISSES]
Come here,
[HORSE NEIGHS] just like this?
GRANDPA: Yes sir.
Okay, come here.
GRANDPA:
You've have already got his trust, now you gotta get his respect.
Hey, don't run away.
You're puttin too much pressure on him, thats why he's running away from you.
Come here. [HORSE GRUNTS]
Come here.
Always, keep moving forward.
[KISSING]
GRANDPA: Thats good, thats good.
WHITNEY: Come on.
GRANDPA: Yeah.
WHITNEY: [LAUGHING EXCITEDLY]
Come on.
WHITNEY:
Something pretty amazing started to happen.
GRANDPA: Get on a little harder with that whip.
I don't wanna hurt him.
Come here.
GRANDPA: You won't hurt him, he's ten times bigger than you.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
Good boy.
WHITNEY:
I started figuring it out or at least Bob did.
After a few days, this shoveling wasn't too bad.
GRANDPA: Yeah, good boy.
Don't ask your horse to do something he can't do.
WHITNEY: We began to have fun,
Bob was great as usual.
GRANDPA: Yeah, that's good.
[WHITNEY KISSING]
There he is.
WHITNEY: He made me look good.
There you go.
[HORSE NEIGHS] Bob.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Yes, I got it, oh!
Good boy, sometimes I think you're training me, huh.
[LAUGHS]
You learn from each other,
Whitney.
Time for a riding lesson.
It's still hard to get on.
It's easy, even Eddy can do it.
Come on, Eddy.
Load up.
[DOG BARKS]
[DOG HOWLS]
[GRUMPY LAUGHS]
WHITNEY: Oh!
See, you can do that.
Yeah right.
GRANDPA: Steady your hands.
Pick up the trot there, Whit.
WHITNEY: Come on.
Push him.
[HORSE GRUNTS]
WHITNEY: After a few weeks,
I was a regular horse man.
 Woman or girl.
 You get the point.
WHITNEY: Oh, easy.
Steady hands.
All right, change direction and go around to the other way.
Okay.
[CLUCKING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Change your whip.
You are doin' great.
WHITNEY: But now I was nearly a professional, at least Bob made me feel that way.
 I had new tricks to show Grumps.
What are you doing?
You'll see.
WHITNEY: Tada...
Now you're just showing off.
[WHITNEY LAUGHS]
Okay, good boy.
GRANDPA: Yeah, he is.
[WHITNEY CLUCKING]
WHITNEY: All the fun
I was having with Grumps and Bob,
 made me forget about the real word, but not for long.
Easy, easy.
Oh, come on.
Well, stay here.
JOAN: Hey there.
HENRY: Hey.
WHITNEY: Hey.
Is that the mail?
HENRY: Yup.
Is there any from
Lindsay or Ben?
Um... afraid not, not today.
JOAN: Sorry, honey.
Not any day, ever.
But guess what?
Your dad got a job interview, in Boston.
Boston?
But then I'll never see my friends again.
Honey, you'll make new friends.
Right, it's easier said than done.
[DOOR CREAKS SHUT]
WHITNEY: All I had was Bob and Grumps, which wasn't all that bad I suppose.
Are all these horses yours?
Uh... In a way,
I don't own them.
But they are all family, same as you.
What about Bob?
Why doesn't he stay here with them?
He does when he feels like it.
But Bob's always been his own man.
He does things his own way.
So I felt like its better not to interfere.
In some ways he's more like a person than a horse.
Yeah, a really cool person and brave too.
Is there anything he's afraid of?
Raccoons. [BOB NEIGHS]
He hates them.
He's a better judge of character than some people I know.
You know how
I can tell?
How?
'Cause he likes you.
WHITNEY: So dad went to Boston, leaving me and mom to fend for ourselves.
Bye bye.
WHITNEY: Mom was plotting a way, I learned.
I see you in a couple of days, bye.
[SIGHS]
So what happens if he doesn't get the job?
I have a plan B, come here.
I found your grandmother's old recipe, and all the jars.
There were 100s of them, in the attic.
Mrs. Brown's blackberry preserves?
Mm-hmm. Okay, I'm not that
Mrs. Brown, but technically
I'm a Mrs. Brown.
So I figured why not.
Here, taste it.
Mmm... That's delicious.
Uh huh. See, it's a good thing I paid attention when I was younger.
All right, now your turn.
I fill, you pack.
WHITNEY: Mom was taking it all so seriously, so least
I can do is help her out.
So, what do you think?
You got to be kidding me.
What, you think
$5 is too much?
Well, the quality's really good. And the berries are all fresh.
Best of all, they are F-R-E-E. They grow wild all over the farm.
Except for the foreigns it's a pretty good business if you ask me.
Come on, help me out.
Thank goodness we're far from home.
If any of my Brenford friends saw me here, I would die of embarrassment.
Honey, if embarrassment is fatal, nobody would live past the age of 12.
I know I wouldn't.
Now, I'm immune.
[CAR HONKING]
Oh, look.
Our first customer.
[BREATHING DEEPLY]
Good afternoon.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
MAN: Good day.
He was from Philly.
Philly, I wonder if I'll ever see that place again.
I miss my old life.
Oh, honey, life unfolds wherever you are.
And for now you're here.
Yeah, with no friends.
Human friends, anyway.
The Brenford formal's this weekend and I was really hoping I can go.
Especially now that
I might be moving to Boston.
I may never see my friends ever again.
I'll tell you what...
Why don't we take some of the money that we earned today and... use it for a little road trip to Philly.
Really?
Really.
This is Brown's blackberry preserves, fresh, all natural, homemade!
Come on buy. There's only seven left!
Get them while they last!
Pretty good, huh.
We sold two whole cases in an hour.
We have enough money to go home now.
Not for good.
Just for the weekend.
It's for my fall formal.
Are you listening to me?
This is important.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
WHITNEY: Than it happened, the real world came back to me, crashing back.
Is that the phone?
Yeah, it's finally working just as we are about to leave.
Leave?
That was your dad, he got the job.
The company's flying you and me to Boston to look for a place to live.
Great news, huh?
No, that's awful news.
This weekend's the formal, mom, you promised.
I know, I know honey, and I'm really sorry.
Boston's a great city.
There will be other formals.
We've gotta pack.
[PHONE DIALING]
VOICEMAIL: You have
84 unheard messages.
 Hey, Whitney, its Ben.
Can you call me please?
 Whitney, Ben again.
 Ben again, why haven't you called?
 Hey, it's Grace.

Where to put that?
 Whitney, Ben again.
Lindsay said you called her.
 Um... I guess you didn't ask about me.
But I did, every time.
OLIVIA: Whit, hello.
Why haven't you called?
 I miss you, so does Zack.
 Hey, it's Grace.
Lindsay said you've been saying bad things about me.
No, I didn't.
 It's Ben again,
I'm not sure why you haven't called me back.
This is like my tenth message to you, did I do something wrong?
 Okay, since you are obviously not talking to me
and not coming back for the formal like we planned,
 I'm gonna take Lindsay up on her offer and go with her instead.
 She said you wouldn't mind, so...
But I would mind, a lot!
WHITNEY: Drastic times call for drastic measures.
Please, if I can't go to the formal at least let me stay here and spend some time with Bob.
Honey, I wish I could.
But theres no way that you can stay here all by yourself.
Grandpa Grumpy could watch me.
Come on, mom, you're the one that's always telling me how important it is for me to get to know my grandpa.
Now is my chance.
All right.
Hey there.
I swear you're still as pretty as that first day
Henry brought you home to meet us.
Here, I brought you something.
Mrs. Brown's blackberry preserves.
You think
Sarah would mind?
I miss her.
We all do.
Everything about that old horse reminds me of her.
Henry does too.
Is that why you never called us, or came to visit?
Sarah was always the glue that held the family together.
Henry and I never did have much in common, truth be told.
Well...
You both have something in common now.
You mean Whitney.
You may not have had a chance to be much of a father these last few years, but you are showing some real signs of talent as a grandfather.
You think?
Oh, I know.
You just may have found your calling?
[SIGHS]
Wait a minute, you're not about to ask me to baby sit, are you?
No.
I was hoping you would volunteer.
JOAN: Okay, baby girl.
I want you to call me for anything.
Okay, and if you can't reach me, call Alicia.
She's our old nanny from Philadelphia.
There's food in the fridge, the keys to the tuck are on the table.
Is there anything
I'm forgetting?
Ye, goodbye.
We will be fine, go.
Love you.
All right, love you.
Bye, tell dad I said hi.
JOAN: I will.
Well, it looks like just you and me, babe.
Babe?
So, where's your luggage?
I travel light.
I can see that.
What's for dinner?
Well, I can make us some toast.
I got a better idea.
[DOG BARKING]
This is the original finger food.
Is it safe?
Oh, yeah.
Just watch out for the bird chap.
[DOG BARKING]
Yeah.
Think I might go ahead and grab a piece of toasty for bed.
All right, suit yourself.
You want a soda or something?
Yeah, but I'll get it.
Eddie's got it.
Go.
[EDDIE BARKING]
[WHITNEY GIGGLES]
Thank you.
[DOG BARKS]
Grandpa Grumpy?
Yeah?
Why do you live over in that barn when your home is like, right here?
Well for one thing,
I like barns.
Feel comfortable there.
For another...
This place never seemed like home to me after your grandma died.
My dad said, you weren't around very much even when she was alive.
Yeah well, there are bound to be things in life, you wish you'd done differently.
The little games you shouldn't have missed, birthdays you should have remembered...
[SIGHS]
Kids... you could have hugged a little more often.
[SIGHS]
But life seldom gives you do overs, Whitney.
So everybody on this Earth lives with a little regret.
Me more than most
I'd say.
Your daddy knows that.
You gonna eat that?
[YAWNING]
I'm beat, I'm gonna go ahead and turn in.
How about you?
No, I think I'll sit here by the fire a while.
I'm not ready to come home, just yet.
You're pretty great grandpa, you know.
WHITNEY: It was time for me to initiate operation sneaky Whitney.
 I felt bad,
Grumps could get in trouble,
 but this was the most important day of my life.
I had to do it.
Perfect, you're here.
[WHISPERING]
Hey, Bob.
Hey...
[HORSE NEIGHS SOFTLY]
Come here, come here, come up.

[HORSE NEIGHS]
[WHITNEY HUSHES]
I'll take you on a little adventure, okay?
We are gonna go to Philadelphia for a party.
WHITNEY:
Bob knew what had to be done.
He was the perfect accomplice.
 Well, almost.
Bob, you wait here, okay.
[HORSE CANTERING]
[DOG BARKING]
Whitney, you want coffee?
Kids even drink coffee?
Hey, Whitney, wake up.
The coffee's on.
WHITNEY: Grumpster, please don't worry and don't tell mom and dad.
 But I have some unfinished personal business back home,
 that I have to take care of right away.
Damn.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM SHOP]
WHITNEY: You won't get power without fuel right, I'll get us some food.
You wait here.
Now what happened to my stuff?
I don't get...
What do you think for you're coming here?
And if your hands are as dirty as your face, don't touch nothing you don't intend on buying.
Have you ever heard of Dilligaf?
Dilligaf?
That means,
'Do I look like I give'...
Ah!
Oh, no, no, no!
Get the thing out...
I can't talk to you!
It's okay, it's okay.
He's with me.
It's not okay, it's a horse!
Get that thing out of here!
WHITNEY: Bob, get out!
Oh no!
Look at this!
Not the front door!
This is for the damage,
I'm sorry!
[GROANS]
Hey you!
WHITNEY: Come on, Bob, lets go.
You destroy my store and all you leave me is ten bucks?!
[HORSE NEIGHS]
I'm sorry, I didn't have enough money.
I need to borrow your car.
Just one minute, one minute.
I promise, I'll be right back.
Help yourself to a Mr. Freezy on the house, but don't get it on the carpet.

That's where he's headed now, home.
That's where we are going too.
I'm not going.
What did you say?
I said, "I'm not going."
Tonight's my formal, and I didn't come all this way to miss it.
I didn't come all this way just to go home without you.
Get in the truck.
You said yourself, life doesn't give you do overs.
But when it does, don't you think we should take 'em?
I have the chance to correct some mistakes I made, to put things right.
Please, don't make me miss that opportunity.
Your mom and dad'll be home first thing in the morning.
And so will we.

Hey, guys.
How is the party so far?
Are you talking to us?
Voluntarily?
Between election cycles?
Yeah, why wouldn't I?
Because we are dweeves.
You're...
You are the class president.
Was class president.
Now I'm just Whitney.
Here to enjoy the party just like you guys.
[GRACE SCREAMING IN EXCITEMENT]
Whitney!
Hey, wow.
Look at you.
Can you believe it?
My mom's paying for Josephine Sasso.
What are you wearing?
Me? It's a Whitney Brown original.
You made that?
Yeah.
Like needle and thread?
With sewing machine, actually.
Get out!
I know can you believe it?
No.
But Lindsey said you were a different person now.
Yeah, I bet she did.
I think I'm gonna go over there and remind her that I'm the same old Whitney.
Just with a clue.
WHITNEY: This is the part where I'm as cool as a cucumber, right?
 The queen bee reclaiming her rightful place at the center of the hive.
 Well, that was the plan anyway.
Long time no see,
BFF.
Long time no see, but I called.
And called and called and called.
WHITNEY: Didn't she tell you?
Yeah, she said you were mad at me and never wanted to see me again.
She lied, to all of you.
LINDSAY: Why are you even here?
To try to buy back all your friends?
Everyone already knows that you'll do whatever it takes to be popular.
Well may be that used to be true, but not any more.
I tried everything to stay in touch.
Please, where were you?
Antarctica?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I might as well have been.
I could not get cell service anywhere.
I called Lindsay from a pay phone and told her to tell you I...
Was trying to get in touch, but she didn't.
I rode all night and day just so I can make it here on time.
You rode?
Rode what, your bike?
[STUDENTS LAUGHING]
No, my horse.
[STUDENTS LAUGHING]
He hurt his legs, coming through the woods.
And he helped me hop the freight train so that
I could make it here on time.
So I could tell you all the truth.
You really will do or say whatever it takes to stay on top, won't you?
What do I have to gain by lying?
Uh, everything, so I tell you what, as a class president
I suggest that you and that horse that you didn't ride in on, just skedaddle back to podock.
Let us enjoy our formal, how about it?
[HORSE NEIGHS LOUD]
[HORSE NEIGHS LOUD]
That's the horse
I rode in on, Bob.
[BOB NEIGHS]
My best and the truest friend.
Then it's true.
All of it.
You really did call.
And you didn't tell Lindsay that you were mad at me, did you?
No, because I wasn't.
I missed you.
I missed all of you. You guys are my friends.
At least I thought so.
She didn't appreciate you, Ben, not really.
Not like I do.
What do you want?

Bye.
Bye
See you.
Sorry, I didn't believe you before.
You do have a really cool horse, you know.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
You sew your own clothes, you hop trains.
Well I hopped a train.
You know, all this time
I thought "Yes she can" was just a campaign slogan, for you, its a way of life.
Look, Ben, this has been the best night in my life.
But this isn't my home anymore.
May be it never really was.

- Dre, is that make-up? What is that?
- Mom, I ran into a pole.
- No, you have a black eye. You've got into a fight?
- Fighting is not tolerated here.
You heard him, he ran into a pole.
Come here, Dre.
- Mom, don't start.
- Who did it?
Nobody mom, I ran into a pole. I ain't tell you cause I know you would react like this.
Dre, you know I don't play, if somebody hit my baby, I would tear...
I know mom, that's why I don't tell you stuff.
- Just relax, I just ran into a...
- Yeah, yeah,  you ran into a pole.

- I'm Dre.
Sorry about Cheng.
So that's his name?!
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.
- Our parents are very close.
- He definitely likes you.
- I have to go practice.
- Wait...
- You eat and practice at the same time?
- Yes.
But, my mom says if you eat standing up, it gives you gas.
You're funny.
- Come to fix the hot water.
- It's in there.
Kid?
Kid?!
Did you just hit me in my neck with a toothpaste cap?!
Hot water fine.
Flip switch.
Wait half hour, take shower, flip switch off.
Why don't you just leave it on?
- You leave on in America?
- We don't have a switch in America.
Get switch,
Save planet.
- What happened to your eye?
- I ran into a pole.
Interesting pole.
- Dre?! I'm back.
- That's my mom.
End it, do the handle, it's messed up.
- Are you ready for school?
- Yeah.
- Hey, let me help you.
- They have your favorite cereal here, I found it.
Dre, for the one hundredth time, can you please pick up your jacket?
- One second, mom.
- No! Not in one second, now!
This programme is about to be over.
Give me two minutes.
Dre, I don't care!
Come and pick it up now.
- God, how many times do I have to ask you?
- Once.
- That's right. Make it happen.
- "What's with you and the jacket?!"
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Nothing.
Okay, just what I thought...
Nothing.
Thank you.
From the top again.
Okay. It's enough please. You are rushing it.
You must play the pauses.
Do you know how important this is for your family?
What it will mean for your life?
We have to work this weekend.
I'm calling you father.
We continue.
- How that sound?
- Almost like a Chinese.
Yeah, I'm fluent. And I don't know about that guy was talking about? I thought you sounded great.
Thank you.
- So, you are practicing for anything? Like a show?
- Yes, I have an audition next month...
- For the Beijing Academy of Music.
- Beijing Academy of Music. Sounds important.
You know, their initials spell BAM.
What?
I gotta go.
Can I touch your hair?
You're gonna do something?
Just stay away from us.
All of us.
Baby?!
Dre, are you sleeping?
- Um, can you sign this?
- For the Forbidden City?!
I think it's funny that you have to give my permission to go to the Forbidden City.
- Pole in Beijing.
- Not funny, mom.
Oh, cut it out, grumpy.
I'm serious, Dre. This ice cream,
I don't know what they do it, but it's more flavoristic. What?
Mom, this is you. "Oh my Godness, this ice cream here is so good, and everything in China... is so much better than everything else..."
Aw, mom c'mon...
First of all, I don't sound like that, and I don't move all like that.
You should get some ice cream, sweetie.
- Mom, mom,  c'mon.
- Dre! Wait!
Boy, you won't get running from me?!
Kung Fu.
What do we learn here?
No weakness! No pain! No mercy!
Begin!
- Mom, mom, c'mon, let's go. C'mon, mom!
- What? Dre, we just got here.
- Dre, what's going on?
- Nothing.
- Dre, what happened?
- Nothing happened.
What is it, you don't want to take that class?
Whatever Dre, What happened?
We moved to China!
That's what happened!
Okay, stop.
Don't be like that, Dre.
What do you want me to do?
- We've been here less than a week...
- I feel like it's a year!
I hate it here.
Dre, please let me help you.
I can't help you if you don't tell me what's wrong?! Oh, please.
You don't care what's wrong!
All you care about is how happy I am and how great ice cream is.
I'm not happy.
I hate it here!
I want to go home!
Dre, we can't go home. Okay?
There is nothing left for us in Detroit.
This is what we've got.
This is home.
Gather on here.
Welcome to one of the most popular landmarks in all over China.
It is visited by millions of people every year.
The Forbidden City.
You plaster on for good luck.
- I wish someone would just...
- Yeah, me too.
- Just tell someone.
- Yeah, I got it.
Thanks a lot.
The walls of the palace were reinforced with the bricks, 15 layers deep,
to prevent anyone from coming in.
- Mr. Parker... Is everything okay?
- Oh yes?
Um...Yes, thank you.
Get him.
Come on.
You're fast.
But not fast enough.
He's had enough.
Don't you remember what we learned?
No weakness. No pain.
No mercy!
Go home.
- What's up with the light bulbs, Mr. Han?
- Shh!
I thought you are just a maintenance man?
You've seen only with your eyes, so you are easy to fool.
It doesn't hurt.
Chauva.
Ancient Chinese healing.
How did you do that up there? You like even didn't punch them. They...beat each other up.
When fighting angry, blind men... best we just stay out of the way.
- So, where did you learn Kung Fu?
- From father.
Have you ever taught anybody?
No.
Would you?
- Depends.
- On what?
- Reason.
- What about to kick somebody's ass?
The best fights are the ones we avoid.
What if I wanna avoid getting my ass kicked?
- Stop saying "ass".
- Sorry.
Kung Fu is for knowledge, defense.
Not to make war, but to create peace.
That's not definitely what they're taught.
No such thing as bad student, only bad teacher.
That's great. I guess we'll just stroll in their school and talk to their teacher.
- Good idea.
- No, bad idea.
If I go in there, I get my ass kick...
- I'll get beat up.
- You got beat up anyway.
Would you go with me?
No, sorry.
- But you said it was a good idea.
- For you, bad idea for me.
C'mon, it's not like you should be busy or anything...I don't even speak Chinese.
Very sorry.
Okay...Whatever.
Wait!
What are you doing?
Why did you stop?
Finish!
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get out of here.
We do not stop when our enemy is down!
No mercy.
No mercy in the studio.
No mercy in life.
What are you looking at?
He's the one that attacked me.
We are here to make peace.
Let your little thing mind himself.
One to one, no problem...Six to one, too much to ask of anyone.
I see.
Prepare for match!
Whoa Mr. Han, does he want us to fight?
We are not here to fight.
You attack my students and disrespect my studio?!
You want to leave?
Not so easy.
Master Li...
You both came here.
One of you fights now.
The boy will fight there.
OPEN KUNG FU TOURNAMENT
We accept your challenge.
Please instruct your students to leave my boy alone to train.
Attention!
From now on the little thing is to be left alone... until the tournament.
- Understood?!
- Yes!
If he does not show up for the competition...
I will bring pain to him and you.
So, that go pretty much how you planned it?
There's good news and bad news.
The good news is they promised to leave you alone.
- Really?
- While you prepare.
Prepare for what?
The tournament.
You'll fight them all, one by one.
Huh?
So the bad news is now they get to beat me up in public.
- Yes.
- Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
They're gonna kill me.
You saw their Kung Fu.
That's not Kung Fu. That does not represent China.
That bad man teach them really bad things that hurt, a lot.
More good news.
I will teach you real Kung Fu.
Yes.
- See you later, mom.
- Hey, wait. This is early for you for a Saturday.
- Mr. Han will teach me Kung Fu.
- The maintenance man?
It's China mom, everybody knows Kung Fu.
Dre, you know how do I feel about your fighting.
Kung Fu is not fight mom, it's about making peace with your enemy.
- Be careful, Dre.
- Yeah.
Mr. Han?
- Mr. Han?
- Back here.
You know you have a car in your living room, Mr. Han?
Okay, I was thinking about yesterday. I know
I was kinda freaking out about the tournament... but I realized something last night.
I'm an athlete. My number one asset is I'm fast, okay?!
I'm quick. I'm quick.
Got the speed. Cat speed.
You see? I'm quick yeah, you see?
In the US, I used to take gymnastic at PAL, that's Police Athletic League, to check it, right?
Boom. You see that?
My Uncle Reymi used to date that
Brazilian girl and he learned Jiu-Jitsu.
And he taught some of it to me.
As like, locks and holds and stuff, it's okay.
Attack me.
You see that? Feel that?
I can break it.
I'm choosing not to.
To press your luck. It's dangerous.
And he also taught me Capoeira so...
Can't touch me. Can't touch...
Was that antique?
Pick up your jacket.
So basically Mr. Han, what I'm trying to say is...
I got a good foundation here.
You know, like I said. I'm just...
Might not be as hard to teach me as other people, you know.
- Hang it up.
- Okay.
- Happy now?
- Take it down.
- You just...
- Take it down.
Put it on.
Take it off.
- I already did all of this.
- Take it off.
Can you just tell me, why I'm doing this?
Take it off.
Hang it up.
Take it down.
Put it on the ground.
Pick it up.
Hang up.
Take it down.
Put it on.
Take it off.
Put it on the ground.
Pick it up.
Hang it up.
Take it down.
Put it on.
Take it off.
Hang it up.
Mr. Han, why do you have a car in your living room?
No street parking.
Hey!
So how did it go?
What you learned?
Nothing.
Uniform on Uniform day.
- You're fighting in the tournament?
- Yeah, how did you hear?
Everybody knows.
- I hope you have a good teacher.
- Yeah, me too.
He's a maintenance man.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.
Well, I know you're practicing, and I think I'm practicing, I mean,
I don't know what I'm doing...
- But, we both kind of practicing, you know and...
- Are you going to that Shi-Shi festival?
Yeah, I mean, I've missed the Shi-Di Festival since I've been in China.
- Go to the Shaolin theater.
- Okay. You want me to meet you?
Oh, oh, so like Shaolin theater, okay Shi-Fi-Shi festival.
Shaolin theater, okay. Cool.
- When is it again?
- Tomorrow. The show starts at seven.
Okay. So tomorrow, Shaolin theater.
Shi-Shi festival at seven.
- See you tomorrow.
- Shi-Shi festival.
- Festival. - Shi-Shi festival.
- Okay. - Okay.
Mr. Han?
- Mr. Han, can I come in?
- You may come in.
Where's your jacket?
- I thought, I was warmin' up without it.
- Go get it.
You want me to go all way back, just to get it?
Yes, all the way back where you hide it.
- This is not right.
- What? I'm doing it.
No.
- Something is missing.
- Nothing is missing.
You forgot, this.
Attitude.
Shake it off.
Attitude.
Yes, that's it.
Okay, Mr. Han. I get it. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have treated my mom like that.
You're right.
- Put it on the ground.
- Hello.
Ow, hey mom.
Um, did you get the tickets?
Yes, I got the tickets, and I got an extra one for Mr. Han.
- But I didn't say...
- Dre, stop it.
Mr. Han, would you like to go with us to the Shi-Shi festival?
No, thank you.
Too many people.
- Yeah, mom. Way too many people.
- Yeah, but I already bought the tickets.
- I don't go...
- Mr. Han, I'm not taking "no" for an answer.
You'll have fun. You need to get out the house, okay?
Here are your clothes, Dre.
Come on, hurry up and change.
Dre...
Pick up your jacket!
You were right Mr. Han, there are a lot of people here.
Chinese Valentine's Day.
Yeah, Mom. I'm going to go get something to eat, then going to go to the bathroom.
Be back, right here, in 20 minutes.
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Be careful. 20 minutes.
- Okay.
I got this, and this for you.
I downloaded this.
It has a very cool violins stuff, and I...
I thought maybe you could play along and...
It's not like Bach and... but, I thought maybe you'd like it and...
- So, um, do you have any kids?
- No.
Oh, how's Dre doing?
- Um, Shao Dre making a progress.
- Shao Dre?
Yes, Chinese pollito.
So, um, how many students do you have?
- Including Shao Dre?
- Yeah.
One.
So, what's the show about?
It's the story of the Goddess... and a boy she loves.
I love this story.
Her mother does not approve of him.
So, she cuts a wide river in the sky to separate them forever.
But once a year, all the birds in the sky... felt sad for them, and they form a bridge.
So the two of them may be together for a single night.
I'll be there at you audition, if you come to my tournament.
- Okay, I'll be there.
- Pinky swear.
See, you wrap your hands like this.
I swear that I'll be there at your audition, no matter what happens.
And I promise to cheer bigger than anyone else when you win.
What up, Mr. Han?
Did I say come in?
Um, I think you did. I mean...
- Mr. Han, can I please come in?
- Yes.
- So, what we are doing today?
- Same.
Mr. Han, I told you. I get it, okay?
Be respectful! I got it!
I put my jacket on a thousand times, and I took it off a thousand times, okay?
This is stupid. I'm done!
Let them beat me up, if they want to.
You know why you only have one student? 'Cause you don't know Kung Fu.
- Shao Dre!
- What?
Come here.
- Jacket on!
- Mr. Han, I already...- Jacket on!
- Jacket on!
- I don't have a jacket...- Jacket on!
Be strong.
Jacket on.
Firm.
Jacket off.
Remember... always strong...
Jacket off.
Strong.
Left foot back.
Right foot back.
Left foot back.
Pick up your jacket!
- Whoa, Mr. ...- Focus!
- Okay. - Always concentrate.
Left back. Right foot back.
Pick up your jacket!
Stay.
Pick up your jacket.
Strong.
Hang it up.
Hang it up.
And attitude!
Strike!
Hang up and attitude!
Harder.
Harder.
Good, but no face.
Jacket off!
Kung Fu lives in everything we do, Shao Dre.
It lives in how we put on a jacket, and how we take off the jacket.
It lives in how we treat people.
Everything is Kung Fu.
- So, why do not we take the Shiroko?
- I don't drive the Shiroko.
- Do you have a license?
- Yes.
So you have a license and a car and we're in the train?
- Please, be quiet.
- I'm just sayin'... seems like we could've saved a lot of money, don't you think?
- Do you always ask these many questions?
- I'm sorry.
So, what we are learning today?
Chi.
Eternal Energy.
The essence of life.
It moves inside of us, flows through our bodies.
Give us power from within.
I get it, like the "Force" from Star Wars.
You're Yoda, and I'm like... I'm like a Jedi.
- Is this where you learned Kung Fu?
- Yes.
Everything good about me was born here.
So Dre, you gotta leave your backpack and skateboard here.
- So, where are we going?
- The journey to the top of the mountain.
Tomb of the Dragon Well.
Dragon Well? It's probably, closer than it is, I'm looking at it.
Right?
- Are we there yet?
- Soon.
- How do you say water in Chinese?
- Shui.
I need some shui.
I'm really thirsty.
- I'm thirsty, Mr. Han.
- Water on top of the mountain.
Shao Dre.
The journey is complete.
- This is the Dragon Well?
- Yes.
I stood here with my father, when I was your age.
He told me that's the magic
Kung Fu water.
You drink and nothing can defeat you.
It's the best water I've ever tasted.
- Did you see the lady with the snake?
- Yes.
She was doing the Cobra thing.
She was like... copying the snake. And it was like... right here, and she was like...
You did not watch closely enough,
Shao Dre.
The snake was copying the woman.
What? I don't get it.
Look.
- What do you see?
- Me, well my reflection. - Yes.
- Now, what do you see?
- It's blurry. - Yes.
That woman was sliced through water quiet and calm.
In here and in here.
So, the snake reflects her action, like still water.
- Like a mirror?
- Yes.
So, she controlled a snake by doing nothing?
Being still and doing nothing, are two very different things.
- She used her Chi on that snake, didn't she?
- Very good.
You gotta teach me that.
How to control people.
There is only one person you need to learn how to control.
Who?
Empty your mind.
Flow with my movement.
Connect to the energy, around you.
- I kinda just want to learn the cobra thing.
- Cobra takes a lifetime.
- Requires great focus.
- But I have great focus?!
- Oh my God. Mr. Han...
- Your focus,
- needs more focus.
- Mr. Han...
Thank you, Mr. Han.
There's no such thing as fortune cookies in China.
Dre, please be careful crossing the street.
You just scared the life out of me, the other day. They have the "right-of-way".
And the symbols. I can't get the symbols right on the bathrooms.
And I'm still walkin' into the men's restroom.
The other day I walked in, there was this 90 years old Chinese man, he thought he was getting a little treat.
Dre, please stop that! You look crazy!
Here, eat your noodles!
Mr. Han, what's goin' on?
Anticipation.
I can't see...
Don't see it, feel it.
Dammit, Mr. Han!
I felt that one!
- Mr. Han.
- What?
- Concentrate, okay?
- Okay. Do I get the stick now?
- Dre, you okay?
- I'm okay.
What's up Mr. Han, what time we are trainin' tomorrow?
Shao Dre, we are not training tomorrow.
Why not?
- Wu chi pi fan
- Wu chi pi fan?
It means: "Too much of something is not good."
You train a lot, you need to rest.
A day off?
Yes, Mr. Han! Yes!
Shao Dre needs to rest.
Yes, Mr. Han.
You rest, too.
I love you, Mr. Han. Peace!
Are you okay?
- My audition is tomorrow at a six.
- Isn't it what you've been practicing for?
- Yes, of course.
- Don't worry, you got it.
What if they don't pick me?
Meiying, wait!
First of all,
I'm going to be there with you.
And B, all you have to do is what your teacher says. Play the pauses.
It's easy, watch.
You see?
- I have to practice.
- Wait.
Wu gi bi fan.
What?
I'm sorry,
I don't think you don't speak Chinese.
Wu gi bi fan.
Too much of good stuff is a bad stuff?
Ow...Wu chi pi fan.
Yeah.
Wu gi bi FUN.
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
Have you ever been to the gym?
C'mon, we are going to have some fun.
Come on, I know you want to go have some fun!
Okay, that's going to give you some serious gas.
- What do you see?
- Me.
- Now, what do you see?
- Me.
Go, come on.
You're dancing machine.
That was pretty good!<i/>
Here comes, round two.<i/>
You're hot.<i/>
-That's like American dancing.
Like, you should have a group. -No.
With like, other people in it dancing behind you, doin' the same stuff.
- The audition, it was changed to today.
- But they said, it's tomorrow.
Something happened.
It is in 20 minutes.
My father is coming to get me.
Hey, she's like totally going to get it, right, because that was just great.
Hey! That was fantastic.
That was... You just...
You played so beautifully, and...
We can no longer be friends.
You are bad for my life.
See you at the tournament.
Don't be late for that.
Mr. Han!
Mr. Han!
We'll not train today.
- What are you doing?
- It's July 8th.
Why did you wreck the car?
His name was Kang Kang.
Shao Dre, how old are you?
Twelve.
He was ten.
He was so beautiful.
Her name was Xiang.
She was a singer.
Not professional.
She sang only for me.
What happened?
There was a steep hill.
Lots of rain.
The car, it just...
I was driving.
We argued about something.
I was so angry.
I lost control.
I try to remember... but I can not remember what we're argued about.
I hope it was something important.
Every year, I fix the car.
But still fix nothing.
Mr. Han!
Win or lose, doesn't matter.
Fight hard.
Earn respect.
The boys leave you alone.
I have a present for you.
Oh! Mr. Han.
This is the one Bruce Lee had.
Great.
Thank you.
You have taught me a very important lesson, Shao Dre.
Life will knock us down, but we can choose, whether or not,  to get back up.
You're the best friend
I've ever had, Mr. Han.
Okay.
Wait!
Can you help me with something?
Dre?
Is your dad home?
Sir...
My name is Dre Parker.
My actions have brought dishonor to your family.
Your daughter has been a great friend to me.
And from her I have learned...
...that a true friend...
...is a person who makes your life better.
But, if you give me a second chance...
...I promise that I will be...
...the best friend your daughter has ever had.
That's it.
My daughter told me that she made a promise to be at your tournament.
In our family, we do not break our promises.
Good luck!
Thank you.
Rock and roll.
Let the tournament begin!
Shao Dre, you're up.
- What's that?
- The rule book.
- You don't know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules, it's simple.
You hit him, and don't let him hit you.
What?
Mr. Han, they're going to kill me.
Two points to win. Win it two times.
Go. Focus. Focus.
That's a warning.
You cannot run off the mat.
Next time you lose a point.
Go.
- Be strong.
- Come on, Dre.
- Good job. Next time, no face.
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.
The next point winner.
Come on, baby.
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!
From now on, the semi-final matches, three points to win.
Be kinda hot if I won this thing, huh, Mr. Han?
- Be kinda hot if you focused.
- Yeah, well, after that.
And now the 1st semi-final of the evening.
TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS
SEMI-FINAL
First round:
Cheng Vs. Wu Ping.
Cheng advances to final.
Next semi-final:
Introducing Fighting Dragon Liang...
...and the surprising finalist, Dre Parker.
Empty your mind. Focus.
You're disqualified!
Are you okay?
He's done.
I'm sorry, you should not continue.
You've brought honor to your family.
The doctor says, you did great.
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Dre Parker has 2 minutes to return to the match.
If he's unable to return...
...the Fighting Dragons win by default.
Can you guys give us a second?
Yeah, okay. Sure baby, whatever you need.
Do you think I could have won?
Win or lose doesn't matter,
Shao Dre.
You know that's not what I mean.
Yes, I think you had a good chance.
So, let's do the fiery cup thing.
You don't need to fight anymore.
You have proven everything you need to prove.
What, that I can get beat up easy, and then quit?
That's not balance, that's not real Kung Fu.
You said, when life knocks you down, you could choose whether or not to get back up.
Well, I'm tryin' to get back up.
And why won't you help me?
Because...
I cannot watch you get hurt anymore.
Please, Mr. Han. Please.
Just tell me, Shao Dre. Why?
Why you need to go back out there so badly?
Because I'm still scared.
No matter what happens tonight when I leave...
...I don't want to be scared anymore.
Since Dre Parker has not returned to the ring...
Dre Parker will fight!
Shao Dre?
Come on, Dre.
You can do this, Dre.
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.
No mercy.
The score is tied.
The next point wins!
I'm so proud of you.

Ah!
I scared you!
No, you didn't.
Okay! Remember our field trip rules, everyone.
Uh, no pushing, no biting, and no fire breathing!
What did I just say?
Eighteen, nineteen...
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?
Oh. Mike Wazowski.
Thanks, Joe.
Good luck finishing your crossword puzzle.
Sorry, Michael.
I didn't see you.
That's okay.
When I was on the bus,
I found a nickel!
I wish I had pockets.
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.
Jeremy! You and me?
Okay, no biggie.
Hailey? No?
Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice.
She's a good egg.
Russell.
Mike? Wazowski?
We car-pool?
- We're cousins.
- Hey!
Okay. Good catching up.
Well, Michael, it looks like it's you and me again.
Come on, Karen.
We're falling behind.
Please don't call me Karen.
Now, stay close together.
We're entering a very dangerous area.
Welcome to the Scare Floor.
Wow!
This is where we collect the Scream Energy to power our whole world.
And can anyone tell me whose job it is to go get that scream?
Scarers!
That's right!
Now, which one of you can give me the scariest roar?
Me, me, me!
Oh! Sir! Right here!
Little green guy, two o'clock!
No, it's like this.
Hey, guys, watch this one.
Hey, I got a really good...
Wow!
Whoa.
Well, hey there, kids. Are you on a tour with your school?
- Yeah!
- Yes.
We're here to learn about Scream Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer.
Well, hey, you're in luck, because
I just happen to be a Scarer.
I learned everything
I know from my school,
Monsters University.
Whoa.
It's the best
Scaring School there is.
You wish!
Fear Tech's the best.
Okay. You guys watch us and tell me which school's the best.
All right?
MU is.
West coast coming only.
Scarers coming only.
Oops.
Stop right there.
Don't cross over that safety line.
Human children are extremely toxic.
Look at that!
Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye! Ow!
Look at that!
It's amazing!
I know!
- Wow!
- Excuse me. Fellas.
How about we do tallest in the back?
Look, he's going to do a real scare!
Cool. I want to be a Scarer.
Yeah. Me, too.
Come on, guys.
I want to see.
Out of the way, Wazowski.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.
Brian! Do not step over the line.
Mrs. Graves, Michael went over the line.
Michael!
See?
I told you. He's fine.
Well,
I thought I heard something.
What?
Are you okay?
You could have gotten hurt!
That was real dangerous, kid. I didn't even know you were in there.
Wow. I didn't even know you were in there.
Not bad, kid.
Michael, what do you have to say for yourself?
How do I become a Scarer?
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?
Well, everyone, I don't mean to get emotional, but everything in my life has led to this moment.
Let it not be just the beginning of my dream but the beginning of all of our dreams.
Gladys, promise me you'll keep auditioning.
Marie, Mr. Right is out there somewhere.
Phil, keep using the ointment till that thing goes away.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!
I'm welling up with tears.
Now, get off.
Hello. How are you doing?
Ah!
Whoo-hoo!
Stroke! Stroke!
Come on, put all you have into it!
Okay! First thing on my list, get registered.
Hey there, freshman.
I'm Jay the R.A., and I'm here to say that registration is that away!
Okay, Jay.
Have a great first day.
Hey, I'm Kay! Here's your orientation packet.
Thanks, Kay.
You can drop your bags off here and get your picture taken with Trey.
Say hooray!
Hooray!
I can't believe it.
I'm officially a college student!
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay, and I'll be giving you your orientation tour on this perfect day!
Here are the labs where students learn to design and build the doors to the human world.
Looks like the professor is about to test a door!
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet, three meals a day.
I personally believe we have some of the best chefs in the world.
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah!
The campus offers a wide variety of majors, but the crown jewel of MU is the Scaring School.
Welcome to the debate team.
We're happy to have you.
I disagree for the following reasons.
True happiness is a theoretical construct...
Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky at the astronomy club!
Hey, hey, hey! Come join the improve club.
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...
Ah, dang it!
MU's Greek Council. We sponsor the annual Scare Games.
The Scare what now?
The Scare Games!
A super-intense
Scaring competition!
They're crazy dangerous, so anything could happen.
A bunch of guys went to the hospital last year!
You could totally die.
And it's worth it.
You get a chance to prove that you are the best!
Cool.
Wazowski, Room 319.
You know, your roommate is a Scaring major, too.
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.
Don't force it.
Just let it happen.
Your lifelong best friend is right behind this door.
Hey there.
I'm your roomie.
Name's Randy Boggs.
Scaring major.
Oh! Mike
Wazowski, Scaring major.
I can tell we're going to be best chums, Mike.
Take whichever bed you want.
I wanted you to have first dibs.
Ahh!
You just disappeared.
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class, I'll be a joke.
No, it's totally great.
You got to use it.
Really?
Yeah, but lose the glasses.
They give it away.
Huh.
Okay!
Unpack. Check.
Hang posters. Check.
Now I just need to ace my classes, graduate with honors, and become the greatest Scarer ever.
Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike.
Aren't you even a little nervous?
Actually, no.
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
I just can't wait to get started.
Oh, man! I can't be late on the first day!
Wow.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm so nervous!
Relax. It will be fine.
Good morning, students.
Welcome to Scaring 101.
I am Professor Knight.
Now I'm sure all of you were the scariest monster in your town.
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now, and I do not scare easily.
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.
She's a legend.
She broke the all-time Scare Record with the scream in that very can!
I don't mean to interrupt.
I just thought I'd drop by to see the terrifying faces joining my program.
Well, I'm sure my students would love to hear a few words of inspiration.
Inspiration? Very well.
Scariness is the true measure of a monster.
If you're not scary what kind of a monster are you?
It's my job to make great students greater, not make mediocre students less mediocre.
That is why at the end of the semester there will be a final exam.
Fail that exam and you are out of the Scaring program.
So, I should hope you're all properly inspired.
All right. All right.
Who can tell me the properties of an effective roar?
Yes?
There are actually five.
Those include the roar's resonance, the duration of the roar, and the...
Whoops. Sorry.
I heard someone say "roar," so I just kind of went for it.
Oh, excuse me, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?
Very impressive, Mister...
Sullivan.
Jimmy Sullivan.
Sullivan.
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?
Yeah. He's my dad.
He's a Sullivan!
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.
Well, you won't be disappointed.
Uh... I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?
No, no.
Mr. Sullivan's covered it.
Huh.
Everyone take out your Scaring textbooks and open them to chapter one.
Hey, bub.
Can I borrow a pencil?
I forgot all my stuff.
Ah! All right. Yes. There we go.
That will get it.
Mmm... Yeah.
Come on, Mike.
It's a fraternity and sorority party.
We have to go!
If we flunk that Scaring final, we are done.
I'm not taking any chances.
You've got the whole semester to study, but this might be our only chance to get in good with the cool kids.
That's why I made these cupcakes.
Oops.
That could have been embarrassing.
When I'm a Scarer, life will be a nonstop party.
Stay out of trouble, wild man.
Wild man.
What the...
Archie!
Boo!
Hey! What are you...
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.
That guy's in big trouble.
Yeah, he is.
Hey, guys!
Over here!
Fear Tech dummies.
Oh, oh!
Sorry about that, buddy.
Why are you in my room?
Your room? This is my...
This is not my room.
Archie! Come here, boy.
Archie?
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.
Why is it here?
I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs.
The what?
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.
They only accept the highly elite.
Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig.
Ready? One, two, three. What?
No, no... Oh! What...
That's it.
Don't let go.
Careful. He's a biter.
- Whoa! Whoa, hey...
- Whoa!
I got him!
Uh-oh! Whoa!
That was awesome!
What am I doing?
James P. Sullivan.
Mike Wazowski.
Listen, it was quite delightful meeting you and whatever that is, but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.
You don't need to study Scaring.
You just do it.
Really? I think there's a little more to it than that.
But, hey, thanks for stopping by.
Let go of that!
My hat!
My pig!
Ooh!
Hey! Come here!
Hey!
Catch it!
Ooh! Yeah!
Ride it to frat row!
♪ Tentacles and serpent's wings, they... ♪
Hey!
Whoa... Ow!
Wow!
Whoa!
Go, go, go!
Hey...
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!
Cupcake?
Whoa...
Ooh!
Got it!
Fear Tech's mascot!
MU rules!
Did you see him catch that pig?
You are Jaws Theta Chi material, freshman.
Oh, thanks.
I don't know...
No, no, no.
He's an Omega Howl guy.
Back off.
We saw him first.
No way. We did!
I'll take it from here, gentlemen.
Johnny Worthington, president of Roar Omega Roar.
What's your name, big blue?
Jimmy Sullivan.
Friends call me Sulley.
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?
I can't believe it! That is crazy!
Chet, calm down.
I'm sorry.
Sulley, any freshman with the guts to pull off a stunt like that has got "Future Scarer" written all over him.
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.
Slow down, squirt. This party is for Scare students only.
Oh, sorry, killer, but you might want to hang out with someone a little more your speed.
Uh... They look fun!
Oh, hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa?
We have cake.
Go crazy.
Is that a joke?
Sulley, talk to your friend.
Oh, he's not really my friend, but sure.
You heard him. This is a party for Scare students.
I am a Scare student.
I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance.
Aw, snap!
My chances are just as good as yours.
You're not even in the same league with me.
Just wait, hotshot.
I'm going to scare circles around you this year.
Oh, okay.
I'd like to see that.
Oh, don't worry. You will.
Ready position.
Common crouch.
I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth.
Basic snarl.
Show me some slobber.
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.
Now here is a monster who looks like a Scarer.
You want a hope of passing this class, you better eat, breathe, and sleep Scaring.
Yeah!
Give me another one.
Fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia.
Fear of thunder.
Keraunophobia.
Fear of chopsticks!
Consecotaleophobia.
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.
Go Monsters University!
You know what to do!
The answer is C, fangs.
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.
A bowl of spiders!
Correct!
A clown running in the dark!
Right again.
Warts, boils, and moles, in that order.
Outstanding!
Ah! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ah!
Ogre slump.
Zombie snarl.
Dominant silverback gorilla.
That is some remarkable improvement, Michael.
One frightening face does not a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.
A Tauntaun grimace with extra slobber.
You got it!
That's what I'm saying.
I am going to wipe the floor with that little know-it-all.
Yes, you are, big blue.
Hey, wait.
What are you guys...
It's just a precaution.
RORs are the best Scarers on campus, Sullivan.
Can't have a member getting shown up by a beach ball.
Whoo-hoo!
I am on a roll.
I'm going to destroy that guy.
Well, then you'll get this back right away.
It's time to start delivering on that Sullivan name.
Today's final will judge your ability to assess a child's fear and perform the appropriate
Scare in the Scare Simulator.
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper, so give it everything you've got.
Dean Hardscrabble is with us this morning to see who will be moving on in the Scaring program and who will not.
Let's get started.
I am a five-year-old girl afraid of spiders and Santa Claus.
Which Scare do you use?
Uh...
That's a Seasonal
Creep and Crawl.
Demonstrate.
Results will be posted outside my office. Next.
Focus.
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!
Hey. Do you mind?
Don't mind at all.
Come on, Mike.
Let's just move.
Stay out of my way.
Unlike you, I had to work hard to get into the Scare program.
That's because you don't belong here.
That's what I thought.
Whoa! Whoa...
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.
What? This?
My one souvenir from a lifetime of Scaring?
Accidents happen, don't they.
The important thing is no one got hurt.
You're taking this remarkably well.
Now, let's continue the exams.
Mr. Wazowski,
I'm a five-year-old girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning.
Which Scare do you use?
Shouldn't I go up on the...
Which Scare do you use?
That is a Shadow Approach with a Crackle Holler.
Demonstrate.
Stop. Thank you.
But I didn't get to...
I've seen enough.
I'm a seven-year-old boy...
I wasn't finished.
I don't need to know any of that stuff to scare.
That "stuff" would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes.
So a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry, alerting his parents, exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course we can't have that.
So I'm afraid I cannot recommend that you continue in the Scaring program.
Good day.
Wait, what?
But I'm a Sullivan.
Well then, I'm sure your family will be very disappointed.
And, Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is something that cannot be taught.
You're not scary.
You will not be continuing in the Scaring program.
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.
Surprise me?
I doubt that very much.
Welcome back.
I hope everyone had a pleasant break.
Some say that a career as a scream-can designer is boring, unchallenging, a waste of a monster's potential.
Open your textbooks to chapter three.
We will now plunge into the rich history of scream-can design.
Out of my way!
Coming through!
Oh, sorry. Ha-ha!
Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.
The Scare Game! Yeah!
We have a special guest, the founder of the games,
Dean Hardscrabble.
Good afternoon.
As a student, I created these gas
as a friendly competition,
but be prepared.
To take home the trophy,
you must be the most fearsome monsters on campus.
So good luck, and may the best monsters win.
We're closing down sign-up, so we'll see you all...
Wait!
I'm signing up!
What?
Uh... You have to be in a fraternity to compete.
Behold the next winning fraternity of the Scare Games, the brothers, my brothers, of Oozma Kappa!
Hi.
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?
You just said the winners are the most fearsome monsters on campus.
If I win, it means you kicked out the best Scarer in the whole school.
That won't happen.
How about a little wager?
If I win, you let me back in the Scaring program.
And what would that prove?
That you were wrong.
Very well.
If you win, I will let your entire team into the Scare program.
But if you lose, you will leave
Monsters University.
Deal.
Now all you need to do is find enough members to compete.
We need six guys, right?
Sorry, chief.
We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm late.
Can I squeeze by you?
Randy!
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm already on a team.
Boggs.
I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike.
Don't blow this for me.
Do the thing.
Oh! Where did he go?
Please, anybody.
I need one more monster.
Just one more!
Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.
We have to move on. Your team doesn't qualify.
Yes, it does!
The star player has just arrived.
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.
We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?
Come on! Let's go!
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.
Good luck.
All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?
This is a fraternity house?
Hey there, teammates!
Come on aboard!
As the president of Oozma Kappa, it is my honor to welcome you to your new home.
We call this room
"Party Central."
Technically, we haven't actually had a party here yet.
But when we do, we'll be ready!
Whoo!
The hot cocoa train is coming through! Whoa!
Next stop... You!
I would like to start us off first by...
So, you guys are Scaring majors?
We were! None of us lasted very long.
I guess we just weren't what old
Hardscrabble was looking for.
Don Carlton, mature student.
Thirty years in the textile industry and then old dandy Don got downsized.
Figured I could throw myself a pity party, or go back to school and learn the computers.
Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"...
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!
And I'm not.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?
Because we never agreed to do this!
You said this was going to be cool!
No one said this was gonna be cool.
Now I'm embarrassed.
Now you're embarrassed?
Yes, because it's in front of people!
You should wake up embarrassed.
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm Art!
New Age philosophy major.
Excited to live with you and laugh with you, and cry with you.
Thought you might like to keep a dream journal.
Guess that leaves me.
Ah!
My name's Scott Squibbles.
My friends call me Squishy.
I'm undeclared, unattached, and unwelcome pretty much everywhere but here.
Now that we've all been introduced, as captain of our team...
So, basically, you guys have no Scaring experience?
Not a lot!
But now we've got you!
You're about the scariest fella I've ever seen.
Even with them pink polka dots.
Aw, thanks.
Actually, I think I bring the whole package.
Your hands are as big as my face!
He's like a mountain with fur!
Oh, come on.
I don't even work out.
Yeah, me neither. I don't want to get too big.
We thought our dreams were over, but Mike said if we win, they're letting us in the Scaring program.
We're going to be real Scarers!
The best!
You betcha!
Yeah!
Right.
And here's what you've been waiting for, fellas.
Your very own
Oozma Kappa bedroom.
Oh... Great!
We're sharing this room?
We'll let you guys get settled.
Anything you need, you just give a big holler-oonie!
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?
Look, they don't need to be good.
I'm going to carry the whole team.
Really? And who's going to carry you?
Hey, if you want to go back to can design, you know where the door is.
Great.
Guys?
Anybody home?
Um...
Hello?
Fellas?
Do you pledge your souls to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?
Ow!
Do you swear to keep secret...
...all that you learn here?
No matter how horrifying?
Hey!
Will you take the sacred oath of the...
For crying out loud.
Sweetie!
Turn the lights on while you're down here!
You're going to ruin your eyes!
Mom!
We're doing an initiation!
Oh, scary.
Well, carry on.
Just pretend I'm not here.
This is my mom's house.
Do you promise to look out for your brothers...
...no matter what the peril?
Will you defend Oozma Kappa no matter how dangerous?
No matter how insurmountable the odds may be?
From evils both great and small?
In the face of unending pain and...
Oh, forget it!
You're in.
Look, we know we're no one's first choice for a fraternity, so it means a lot to have you here with us.
Can't wait to start Scaring with you, brothers.
Time for a celebration!
Yeah!
Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen, because we're building a fort!
Mom, can we stay up late tonight?
Mmm, I know you're a princess and I'm just a stable boy.
Yuck!
Mom! What are you doing?
Your grubby paw was in my bed!
Were you kissing my hand?
No. And what about you with all your shedding?
I don't shed.
Really.
Uh...
Excuse me.
I just want to get my stuff.
Would you just...
Oh, hey. Come on!
...let me get my stuff!
My butt!
First morning in the house.
That's going in the album!
Guys!
We got a letter!
A letter?
We never get mail.
Oh! Sorry.
It's stuck.
Would you...
Give me that!
Tentacles.
They're sticky.
It's the first event of the Scare Games.
"A child's room is where you scare, but avoid the toxicity lurking there."
Wait a minute. Where do they want us to meet?
Of all the sewers on campus, this one has always been my favorite.
Art, you've been here before?
I have a life outside of the house, you know.
Welcome to your worst nightmare, the Scare Games!
Scare Games! Scare Games!
Yes!
Yes, I love it!
I love this energy!
Okay. Okay, everybody.
Let's hear it for the frats and sororities competing in this year's games...
Jaws Theta Chi!
Python Nu Kappa!
Slugma Slugma Kappa!
Roar Omega Roar!
Eta Hiss Hiss!
And finally, Oozma Kappa.
Yay! Whoo-hoo!
Hi, Mom!
Smile!
Let's begin the first competition, the Toxicity Challenge!
Human children are toxic!
And anything they touch is toxic.
We don't have any human toys, but thanks to MU's biology department, we found a close second, the stinging glow urchin!
Trust me when I say, you are not gonna want to touch this bad boy!
I want to touch it.
And you certainly don't want to touch any of its friends.
Yeah, I want to touch them.
This is the starting line.
The light at the end of the tunnel is the finish line.
And whoever comes in last is eliminated from the games.
Mike...
What is it?
Does that mean if we lose, we're out?
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!
Squishy.
We're not going to lose, because we have everything we need to win right here.
Heart.
No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us.
All right, all right.
That's very cute,
It's an obstacle course. What are you going to do? Roar at it?
I can get through faster than you, little guy.
Take your place at the starting line!
This is all about teamwork.
Everybody, stick together.
I'm going to beat you over that finish line.
Get ready to eat my dust.
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?
Attention, teams.
One last thing.
Scarers work in the dark.
I want to go home!
On your marks...
Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.
Thanks! We're going to rip you to pieces!
What?
...get set...
Go!
I'm going to touch them!
Ow!
Come on!
Uh, guys! We're falling behind a little! Fellas!
Cheese and crackers!
Son of a moustache!
Salisbury steak, that hurts!
Is that as fast as you can go?
Just getting started!
What the...
Whoa! Ah!
Oh... Ah!
That's got to hurt!
Ow, ow, ow...
Ooh!
Terry!
Don't worry, we'll be fi...
Ha-ha!
Oh...
Uh-oh. Yikes!
Ow! Ow, ow, ow...
Roar Omega Roar wins!
Take that, Wazowski!
Are you delirious?
I beat you!
Get your eye checked!
Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!
Hey! Second place ain't bad.
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!
What?
Your whole team has to cross the finish line.
Third place, EEKs!
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.
Fifth place, HSS!
No, no, no!
And in last place,
Oozma Kappa.
I can't feel my anything.
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa has been eliminated!
No.
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.
It would have taken a miracle for you to...
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.
Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified.
The use of illegal protective gel is cause for elimination.
What!
Which means Oozma Kappa is back in the games!
It's a miracle!
Your luck will run out, eventually.
This is going to be harder than I thought.
Okay!
Listen up, Oozmas.
Now, we're going to have to start winning these things together, so that means I'm going to need each of you guys to pull your own weight.
Mike?
What is it?
We've made a list of our strengths and weaknesses.
In high school, I was the master of the silent scare.
I could sneak up on a field mouse in a pillow factory.
Sorry! They get stickier when I'm sweaty.
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.
We're experts in the ancient craft of close-up magic.
It's all about misdirection.
Uh...
I have an extra toe.
Not with me, of course.
Guys, one slip-up on the next event, and we're goners.
So for this to work,
I'm gonna need you to take every instinct you have and bury it deep, deep down.
Done.
From now on, we are of one mind.
My mind.
Oh, please.
I will tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it.
Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.
All right.
Give me scary steps.
Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go!
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.
We can't just "get a new team"!
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.
What if we disguised a new team to look like the old team?
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know, leveling the playing field.
Okay, so it's kind of cheating, but what do you want me to do?
They're not exactly the scariest group in the world.
Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish!
Make a wish!
This is not going to work.
Where are you going?
We're training.
I'm a Sullivan.
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.
You're charging ahead when you...
Bup, bup, bup!
You tell them what to do but not me.
So long, Coach.
Okay, Oozmas...
Boy, we need to get you a bell.
Listen up."If a kid hears you coming, they'll call Mom or Dad",
"then you'd better run fast or things will get bad."
Huh?
In the next event, if even one of us gets caught, we're all out.
So remember, do exactly what I do.
We are at the halfway point of the second event, and things are getting interesting.
Got it.
Only two teams left.
Who will make it out with their flag, and who will be eliminated?
You do not want to get caught by a kid's parent.
And in this event, you do not want to get caught by the librarian.
Quiet.
What's so scary about a little old librarian?
I said, "Quiet."
Faster.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Hmm.
Whew!
Ooh!
No!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Look over here!
Is that legal? You better believe it, mop top!
The only rule is don't get caught.
Who!
- Ooh!
- Hey! Over here!
Come and get me! Come and get me!
Whoo-hoo!
Guys, what are you doing?
They said don't let her catch you.
But they didn't say how!
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Come on!
Whoa!
Whew!
We did it!
No, we didn't.
We forgot the flag!
Mike?
Way to go, Squishy!
Way to go, Squishy!
How?
Misdirection.
The EEKs have been eliminated and Oozma Kappa live to scare another day!
We're OK!
We're OK! We're OK!
I've never felt so alive!
We were awesome!
Okay, look.
That wasn't real Scaring.
It was better than what you did.
You should've stuck to my strategy.
Whatever.
Talk to me when we start the real Scaring.
Hey! You guys going to the party?
Oh, I think you've got the wrong guys.
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?
The mid-games mixer at the RORs'.
It's for the top Scare Teams.
See you there!
Did you hear that?
I can't believe it!
Uh-uh. Bad idea.
This is great.
They're finally seeing us as real Scarers.
We're going!
Do young people still dance?
Because my moves are a little rusty.
Oh, we forgot to bring a hostess gift.
We can't go in there without some scented candles.
Calm down.
We earned this.
What if there's a lull in the conversation?
I never know what to... You know...
Say?
How are you so good at this?
You just took on an angry 50-foot librarian, and you're afraid of a little party?
Take a deep breath...
...and in you go!
Hello.
It's Oozma Kappa!
These guys are crazy!
What you did today was insane!
That was awesome!
Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like Scarers!
I've never stayed up this late in my life!
Hey, quiet! Quiet!
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.
All right.
On behalf of the RORs, we'd like to congratulate all the teams that have made it this far.
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!
I love that trick!
Never gets old. HSS!
Very creepy.
And finally, the surprise team of the Scare Games,
Oozma Kappa!
Now, I got to admit, fellas,
I thought you were a bunch of nobodies.
But, boy, was I wrong.
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!
Oozma Kappa!
Oh!
What?
The most adorable monsters on campus.
Ooh! Oh!
Release the stuffed animals.
Faced!
Don't worry. Nobody reads the school paper.
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they read the quad.
Whoo-hoo!
Thank you very much.
Okay. Would you like that with two sleeves or four?
Thanks.
Tell your friends.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Raising a little money for charity.
Yeah? Well, stop it.
You want us to stop raising money for charity?
That's not cool.
This guy hates charity!
I want you to stop making us look like fools.
Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools.
Let's be honest, boys.
You're never going to be real Scarers, because real Scarers look like us.
But, hey, if you really want to work for a Scare company they're always hiring in the mailroom.
Guys, hold on!
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.
We just need to keep trying.
No, you need to stop trying!
You can train monsters like this all you want, but you can't change who they are.
Mike...
We appreciate everything you've done, but he's right.
No matter how much we train, we'll never look like them.
We're built for other things.
Sorry, squirt!
Some monsters just aren't cut out for the big leagues.
The big leagues.
Guys.
We're going on a little field trip.
My tentacle fell asleep.
Thanks, Mom.
Have fun, kids!
I'll just be here listening to my tunes.
Hey, uh, where are we?
The big leagues.
Holy roly-poly.
Wow.
Nice fence.
This is amazing, Mike.
We're not stopping here.
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!
Oh, wow.
Whoa...
Oh!
All Scare Floors now active.
West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.
Look at them.
They're going into the human world, and they don't even look scared!
Wow.
Take a good look, fellas.
See what they all have in common?
Uh... No, not really.
Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer.
The best Scarers use their differences to their advantage.
Wow.
Terri? Look.
Hey!
Look at that old feller racking up the big numbers!
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!
What? Where?
That's really him?
He held the Scare
Record for three years!
Oh! Third door from the end!
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!
Look! It's
"Screaming" Bob Gunderson!
I still have his rookie card.
Me, too!
Doesn't have the speed anymore, but his technique is flawless.
Technique is flawless.
You collected Scare Cards, huh?
Yep. 450 of them.
Impressive. I have 6,000 still in mint condition, but, you know,
450 is pretty good, too.
Hey, look at me! I'm Earl
"The Terror" Thompson!
Whoa!
Oh, that's great!
That's a pretty good one, Squish.
I've been a real jerk.
So have I.
But it's not too late.
We could be a great team.
We just need to start working together.
Hey!
What are you doing up there?
I can't go back to jail!
Come on!
They're right behind us!
Get back here!
Up there! Get them!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Thanks, brother!
Don't mention it.
I'm fine, really! It's just a little heart attack.
Aw... I want a piece of that action!
Mom! Start the car!
What?
Start the car!
Stop the bar?
The car! Start the car!
Oh! Okay.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Get in! Get in!
Mom, go!
Seatbelts.
Okay, go!
Does anyone want gum?
Just drive!
Okay. Here we go!
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!
Rise and shine!
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!
Wake up!
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!
Do I hear thirty-nine?
Come on!
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa, you're looking good.
"To frighten a child is the point of a Scare."
"If you frighten a teen, then Scarer beware."
Okay, scare the little kid.
Avoid the teenager!
I'm on the phone!
No one understands me!
Whatever.
But, Daddy, I love him!
First place, Roar Omega Roar!
Second place, Oozma Kappa!
Whoo!
Third place, HSS.
You're lame.
"Someone is coming, this could ruin your night."
"Stay hidden, take cover, and stay out of sight!"
You got 10 seconds.
Go!
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.
And there should be one more.
How did I do?
Oh! Not too shabby, Don!
Thanks!
I cannot get down.
Zombie snarl!
Angry poodle.
Jazz clown.
My Aunt Phyllis.
In the morning.
That's what I'm talking about!
Time to go to work.
You're out!
You're out.
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.
Thank you.
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're down to two remaining team,
Roar Omega Roar and Oozma Ka!
Which leads us to the final event!
"Every one of your skills will be put to the test."
"The Scare Simulator will prove who's the best!"
Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare in front of the whole school!
Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys.
After you lose, no one will remember you.
Maybe. But when you lose, no one will let you forget it.
Oh, boy. That is a good point.
Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome!
You've got to teach us your moves.
Well, then you're gonna want to talk to this guy.
Oh...
Sure, I can teach you.
All right. You want to hide behind the chair?
You have to become the chair.
Thanks for coming, Dean.
Dean Hardscrabble!
If we get back into the Scaring program,
I hope there's no hard feelings.
Tomorrow, each of you must prove that you are undeniably scary.
And I know for a fact that one of you is not.
No. He works harder than anyone.
Do you think he's scary?
He's the heart and soul of the team!
Do you think he's scary?
We're going to win this thing tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!
We'll finally have our lives back on track.
Hey, Mike?
You know, you've given me a lot of really great tips.
I'd love to return the favor sometime.
Oh. Yeah, sure.
Anytime.
We're doing this now?
Okay.
You've memorized every textbook, every Scare Theory, and that is great.
Hey!
But now it's time to forget all that.
Just reach deep down and let the scary out!
Huh. Just feel it.
Exactly. Go wild.
I don't know. I've kind of got my own technique.
Give it a try.
Good, but bigger!
Nope. You're thinking again.
From the gut!
Let the animal out!
Come on! Dig deep!
Boys!
It's a school night!
So, how was that?
Up top.
Ha-ha!
You know, it did feel different!
I feel like it's all coming together.
Yup, this time tomorrow the whole school is finally going to see what Mike Wazowski can do.
You're darn right.
♪ Monsters University ♪
♪ We give our heart to you ♪
♪ Wherever children are dreaming ♪

♪ Oh, Monsters University ♪
♪ Alma Mater hail to you ♪
Welcome to the final competition
of the Scare Games.
Whoo! Yeah!
All right!
It's time to see how terrifying
you really are,
in the Scare Simulators!
But be warne.
Each simulated Scare has been set
to the highest difficulty level.
First
Scarers to the starting line.
Okay, just like we planned. I'll go first.
Then, Don...
Hold on. Mike's the one who started all this and I think it's only right if he's the one who finishes it.
I think you should go last.
Yes!
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!
All right. Don, you okay going first?
I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
Oozma Kappa!
Go Oozmas!
I'm gonna do it. I'm going to beat this guy.
Hey, Bruiser! You take it easy on grandpa.
Unleash the beast, Don!
Okay, then.
Huh? Huh?
Thanks for taking it easy on grandpa.
Next group to the starting line.
Let's do this.
Yes! Yeah!
Come on, Art.
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.
Yes!
Aw!
Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!
You got this, Sull.
And it's all tied up!
Ah!
Tough break for the RORs.
Huh?
Hearts?
Huh?
Way to go, Boggs!
Yay!
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.
Worthington and Wazowski, to the starting line.
Hey.
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.
Don't worry about anyone else.
Just go out there and show them what Mike Wazowski can do.
Thanks.
Don't take the loss too hard.
You never belonged here anyway.
Amazing performance by Worthington!
- Johnny, you're my hero!
The Oozmas will need a record-breaking
Scare to win this.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.
You're not scary.
Come on! Dig deep!
Yeah!
They did it!
Yeah! Hey!
We're in the Scare program! Yeah!
Come here, you son of a gun!
Way to go!
Yeah!
Oh! A little stuck.
Pardon me there,
Ms. Squibbles.
It's Sherrie.
We did it!
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot.
You rule!
I have never ruled before.
You guys killed it out there!
Awesome!
Hey, Wazowski!
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.
Mike?
I did it.
I can't believe it.
I'm going to be a Scarer!
Yeah, yes, you are.
You hear that? Get plenty of rest, kiddo.
You haven't seen the last of Mike Wazowski. Boo!
I knew I was scary. I didn't know I was that scary.
Yeah, we're so scary I guess we broke it.
Come on.
It's been tampered with.
Uh, I don't think you should be messing with that.
Why are my settings different?
Mike, we should leave.
Did you do this?
Mike.
Did you do this?
I...
Yes, I did.
But you don't understand.
Why? Why did you do this?
You know, just in case.
In case of what?
You don't think I'm scary.
Mike...
You said you believed in me.
But you're just like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!
Look, you'll get better and better...
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!
I just wanted to help.
No.
You just wanted to help yourself.
Let the whole team fail because you don't have it?
So your calculations were a little off.
That door took me all semester.
It's too dangerous. The professor's just going to shred it.
There he is, the big guy.
The first of many trophies, I am sure.
Sullivan.
Nice work out there.
I look forward to having you back in class.
Hey, there he is!
Looks like I was wrong about you.
You're one of us after all.
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!
You are one of us now, okay?
Anytime you want to come hang out and do whatever, you got a crew.
You're a ROR, buddy!
Hey!
Where are you going?
You did what?
My team had nothing to do with it.
It was all me. I cheated.
I expect you off campus by tomorrow.
Yes, ma'am.
You're a disgrace to this university and your family name.
What's going on?
Someone broke into the door lab!
What?
Oh, no.
Open the door!
Don't go in there!
You look funny.
What?
I'm so tired.
What's going on?
It's the middle of the night.
A little funny green guy.
I want to touch it!
It's so cute!
James!
No one goes near that door until the authorities arrive.
You don't think that could be...
It's Mike.
But he could die out there!
James, wait!
We can help.
Leave it to the old master of sales.
We got a call in, but that's the best we can do.
Ahem!
Don Carlton, sales. Folks, today is your lucky day.
How many times have you asked yourself the following question...
Arrest him.
Pardon?
Spread them, pops!
Do you mind?
Don't move!
What? Sullivan!
Don't you dare!
Sullivan! Don't go in there!
Mike?
Mike!
The kids said they saw something in the cabin.
They're calling it an alien.
It was!
I saw a little green guy!
What's the problem, ma'am?
Mike?
Bear!
A bear in the camp!
Call this in to headquarters.
Down this way.
All right?
I heard something over here!
Mike!
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.
You were right. They weren't scared of me.
I did everything right.
I wanted it more than anyone.
And I thought... I thought if I wanted it enough,
That Mike Wazowski is something special.
And I'm just not.
Look, Mike,
I know how you feel.
Don't do that!
Please, don't do that!
You do not know how I feel.
Mike, calm down.
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.
You can mess up over and over again and the whole world loves you.
Mike...
You'll never know what it's like to fail because you were born a Sullivan!
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test.
The one who got kicked out of the program, the one who was so afraid to let everyone down that I cheated.
And I lied.
Mike, I'll never know how you feel, but you're not the only failure here.
I act scary, Mike, but most of the time
I'm terrified.
How come you never told me that before?
Because we weren't friends before.
Check the lake!
I heard something here!
This way!
I saw movement!
Over there!
Sulley!
He's cornered!
No!
They're still in there!
Until the authorities arrive, this door stays off!
No! You can't do that! No!
Enough! I want this room cleared now!
You can't do this!
We got to get out of here!
Let them come.
What?
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them, we could generate enough scream to power the door from this side!
What are you talking about?
I have read every book about Scaring ever written.
This could work!
They're adults.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
Just follow my lead.
Mama!
Mama!
Mama...
What the...
Now what?
Phase two.
Keep together.
Are you ready?
Mike, I can't.
Yes, you can.
Stop being a Sullivan and start being you.
Call for backup.
Assistance on the north side.
Repeat, we need assistance on the north side.
Ranger, answer me, what's your 20?
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...
Look! What was it?
Let's go.
Sulley, come on!
How?
How did you do this?
Don't ask me.
Move, move, move! This is a 54-23 in progress.
All right, everybody, clear out.
Secure the perimeter.
No child breach.
Repeat: no child breach.
You ruined our doors!
I've been working on my door all semester!
Let's go, you two.
You're alive!
We are so glad you're safe.
Hey, wait!
That's for the university president to decide.
But you can be sure we'll be watching these two.
Always watching.
Expelled?
So, you're leaving?
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.
Harsh, man.
I'm sorry, guys. You'd be in the Scaring program right now if it wasn't for us.
What?
Well, it is the gosh-darnedest thing.
Hardscrabble's letting us into the Scare program.
What?
She was impressed with our performance in the games.
She invited us to join next semester!
Congratulations, guys!
And that's not the only piece of good news.
Sherrie and I are engaged!
Oh. Who is Sherrie?
She's my mom.
Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas!
Come here.
Give me some sugar.
Oh!
Ugh! So uncomfortable.
Oh, come on, Scott.
I don't want you to think of me as your new dad.
After all, we're fraternity brothers first.
This is so weird.
Just think of me as your big brother that's marrying your mother.
Wait. Hold on.
We're brothers who share the same mom slash wife.
That's worse.
Well, I guess we should be going now.
Promise me you'll keep in touch.
You're the scariest bunch of monsters I have ever met.
Don't let anyone tell you different.
So, what now?
You know, for the first time in my life, I don't really have a plan.
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.
I think it's time I leave the greatness to other monsters.
I'm okay just being okay.
So long, Sull.
So long.
Wazowski!
Whoa!
Stop the bus!
Are you crazy?
Mike,
I don't know a single Scarer who can do what you do.
I know, everyone sees us together, they think I'm the one running the show, but the truth is,
I've been riding your coattails since day one!
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.
You took a hopeless team and made them champions.
All I did was catch a pig!
Technically, I caught the pig.
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?
You pulled off the biggest Scare this school has ever seen!
That wasn't me!
That was you!
You think I could have done that without you?
I didn't even bring a pencil on the first day of school.
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.
But you are fearless.
And if Hardscrabble can't see that, then she can just...
I can just what?
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.
Sorry.
Well, gentlemen, it seems you made the front page again.
The two of you did something together that no one has ever done before.
You surprised me.
Perhaps I should keep an eye out for more surprises like you in my program.
But as far as the two of you are concerned there is nothing
I can do for you now.
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.
And, Mr. Wazowski, keep surprising people.
You know, there is still one way we can work at a Scare company.
They're always hiring in the mailroom.
This is better than I ever imagined!
I bet we break the all-time record in our first year.
Mike, we're mail guys.
I know. I'm talking about the record for letters delivered!
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.
I'll have you know tampering with the mail is a crime punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.
We're right on it,
Mr. Snowman.
The team of
Wazowski and Sullivan are going to change the world starting today!
Say scream!
Scream!
Scream!
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!
Thanks, Merv.
Good luck, Mike!
You coming, Coach?
You better believe it.
I made it!
My first day of class!
Uh, the school year's over, son.
You missed it.
Great.

<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> Fee-ﬁ-fo-fum.
Ask not whence the thunder comes.
Ask not where the herds have gone.
Nor why the birds have ceased their song.
When coming home, don't take too long.
For monsters roam in Albion.
Jack, you're still up.
Sorry, Father.
The giants woke me.
- Jack, heh, it's a thunderstorm.
- Mother used to say...
...the giants made the thunder.
Look.
Where did you find that?
Along with her old things.
Will you read the rest to me?
All right.
Where're we up to?
The monks were trying to find God, so they made magic...
Magic seeds. Aye.
I remember now.
"With seeds they pulled from a magical pod...
...the monks grew a pathway to seek out their God.
When they came to what they thought...
...was heaven's gate...
...they met with a terrible, grisly fate.
<font color="#D900D9">(MONKS SCREAMING)</font>
For between heaven and earth was a...
...perilous place.
Gantua, home to a fierce giant race.
With a bridge now before them to the world of men...
...a plague of giants descends.
<font color="#D900D9">(ROARS)</font>
Taking a cue from the richest of kings...
...they acquired a taste...
...for acquiring things.
But the one taste that caused them to lose all control..."
<font color="#808080">WOMAN:</font> "Was a taste for the mankind...
...blood, bones and all."
<font color="#D900D9">(SCREAMS)</font>
Well, that's revolting.
<font color="#808080">ISABELLE'S MOTHER:</font> Too scary, Isabelle?
Giants aren't scary.
Not even their terrifying leader, a monstrous giant...
...with two heads?
Keep reading, Mother. It's just a story.
Is it?
"King Erik...
...bade the monks return to dark arts...
...to find some way...
...to rule giant hearts.
So they melted one down...
...mixed in magic and more...
...and they crafted a crown unlike any before."
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font> King Erik's magic crown.
This is my favorite part.
<font color="#808080">JACK'S FATHER:</font> "As soon as the king took the crown in hand...
...the giants were slave...
...to his every command.
He sent them back to the place of their birth.
Their home now a prison between heaven and earth.
<font color="#D900D9">(GRUNTING)</font>
Erik severed the link...
...between giants and men."
<font color="#808080">ISABELLE'S MOTHER:</font> "And peace returned to his kingdom again.
The mystical relics...
...were all that remained...
...safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.
And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep...
...he took crown and seed with him...
...for permanent keep."
<font color="#808080">JACK'S FATHER:</font> "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away...
...truth became legend."
Or so people say.
What will happen when the giants come back?
They won't, son.
- But what if they do?
- Jack.
Well, I guess the king's Guardians...
- ...will have to cut them down to size.
- I wanna be a Guardian.
You have the spirit.
No doubt about that.
The king's Guardians must be born...
...of noble blood. There's not much in ours but dirt and sweat.
It's only a story, Jack.
Giants aren't real.
<font color="#808080">ISABELLE:</font> But King Erik was real.
He was.
In some ways, he still is.
- You're of his blood.
- I've seen where he's buried.
In the royal catacombs?
Sounds like you've been having...
...some adventures of your own.
- Am I in trouble?
- Not at all.
I want you to have adventures.
- It'll make you a better queen.
- How?
Because you'll get to see how the world works.
And when you're queen, you'll have the power to make the world a better place.
Now off to sleep.
Sweet dreams...
...Isabelle.
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font>
Leave that one.
All right.
Now get some sleep, son.
We have to be out on the field before first light.
Father.
How do you know giants aren't real?
I don't.
"And jealous eyes are looking down...
...on peaceful fields in Albion.
An enemy vows will come a day...
...when giants return and giants stay.
To wage a war...
...and this time win...
And to eat the last...
...of Erik's kin."

...when you're back from selling the horse...
...get working on the weeds out back.
They're about to swallow the house.
I'll get to it, Uncle.
- And, Jack?
- Yes, Uncle?
Don't get distracted.
<font color="#808080">JACK:</font>
Come on, don't look at me like that.
I wouldn't sell you, but we haven't got much choice.
Horse and cart for sale.
Going for a price.
I'll be sad to see him go.
Horse and cart?

<font color="#D900D9">(English - US - SDH)</font>
Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, a baby girl was born.
Her skin was pure as snow.
Her hair was dark as night.
- (BABY CRYING)
- They called her Snow White.
Probably because that was
the most pretentious name
they could come up with.
As fate would have it,
Snow White's mother died in childbirth.
Left on his own...
- (GIRL GIGGLING)
- ... her father spoiled the young girl.
He could afford to, of course.
He was the king.
The king loved his daughter,
- and all his subjects loved him.
- (CROWD CHEERING)
The kingdom was a happy place,
where people danced
and sang day and night.
Apparently,
no one had a job back then.
Just singing and dancing
all day and all night.
But I digress.
The king raised
the little girl by himself,
grooming her to one day lead.
But over time, he realized
there were some things
he couldn't teach her.
So he sought out a new queen.
This queen was
the most beautiful woman in the world.
She was intelligent and strong.
And just to clarify, she was me.
And this is my story. Not hers.
Bewitched by my beauty,
the king begged me to marry him.
I was everything to him:
The stars, the moon.
But a dark magic invaded the land.
The brave king bid farewell
to Snow White,
leaving her his favorite dagger.
An interesting gift,
but more on that later.
He rode off into the dark woods
and, sadly, was never seen again.
Snow White searched and searched
for her father,
and when she realized
he was truly gone,
she was devastated.
The girl was now left under the care
of the beautiful queen.
Ten years passed, and Snow White
grew older and blossomed.
But the kingdom fell into an icy despair
as the queen realized,
if she wanted to remain
the most beautiful woman in all the land,
well, Snow would have to do
what snow does best.
Snow would have to fall.
Well, hello there.
Would you like a treat?
Here you go.
Oh, I think the party's started.
F to D-9.
To your left, Lord Waverly.
If someone would please teach Lord Waverly his left from his right,
I would be so very grateful.
Excuse me.
B to J-12.
My lady, I feel it is my duty to tell you of the rumors
- that I've been hearing.
- Rumors?
Well, there have been rumblings that the kingdom is close to destitute.
If we were to join our two houses in marriage...
- (SCOFFS)
...I feel the gentry would be reassured that the kingdom was stable once again.
Brighton, a word, please.
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Loose lips sink ships.
Yes, indeed,
Your Majesty, exactly.
Which ship would you like sunk?
It's an expression, Brighton.
A royal decree. Take it down.
- Ah, marvelous.
- Any busybodies...
...caught rumoring, gossiping, whispering, or even thinking shall be put to death.
- How does that sound?
- It's decisive.
Snow White.
Is there a fire?
I'm sorry?
Is your bedroom on fire?
Because I'm searching for an explanation as to why you would be out of your bedroom and in here, and my first guess was fire.
I thought maybe I could come to the gala, you know, because today is my 18th birthday.
Is it, now? Oh, my, oh, my.
E to F-3, please.
Snow White, maybe it is time I ease up on you. Hmm?
After all, you've done nothing to me, caused no problems.
And yet...
...there is something about you that's just so incredibly...
...irritating.
I don't know what it is.
The slumped shoulders.
The hair, that voice... Mm!
I know what it is.
- I think it is the hair.
- (GASPS)
I hate your hair.
I don't care if it's your 100th birthday.
Don't ever sneak into a party like this again.
B to F-6.
C to D-4.
Baron, you've been beaten for the last five minutes and didn't even know it.
Bravo, Your Majesty.
It's important to know when you've been beaten. Yes.
MAN: I certainly don't like the look of these woods, sire.
If you don't mind me saying, they seem very sinister.
They're trees, Renbock.
Trees are just wood.
It's not the trees
I'm afraid of, sire.
There are stories of a man-eating beast inabiting these parts.
It thrills my heart to no end thinking that my traveling companion still believes in fairy tales.
If you don't mind me asking, when does
Your Highness think we're going home?
We've been on the road for months.
I just thought perhaps we could take a break.
We didn't set out seeking a vacation.
We set out seeking an adventure.
- Adventure, yes.
- And we're going to find one.
- (DRY CHUCKLE)
- (RUSTLING)
I really don't think this is a good idea, sire. We should ride on.
Not until we find out what's in these woods.
- (HORSE NEIGHS)
- Go around. Go around.
- Giants! Renbock! Renbock!
- Giants!
- After him!
- (HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)

Yah!
Ha-ha!
- (WHINNYING)
- (GRUNTING)
- Give me that!
- Sit down!
- (GRUNTS)
- Stay down!

- Do you concede?
- Yeah, do ya?
- (ALL GROWLING)
- Sire.
MAN: What's so funny?
You're not a giant!
None of you are giants.
Your point is?
You can't expect me to fight you.
Ah! Then he concedes!
- MAN: Yeah!
- Of course he concedes.
I most certainly do not.
I'm simply stating that I will not fight a bunch of dwarfs!
- Why?
- You're miniscule!
- Miniscule?
- Diminutive?
- Runts?
- Thank you. Runts?
- Runts? That's the best you got?
- So uninspired.
- The village idiot used to call us that.
- (ALL MUTTERING)
Take you the whole day to come up with that?
It doesn't matter!
You're short, and it's funny.
Funny? Not as funny as my blade against your throat.
Ease back.
All we want is his gold.
- I've got his saddlebag.
- Now we're talking!
Let's look in there.
Come on, get it open.
- That is not your property!
- Eh, whatever.
- Get your hands off of that immediately!
- Give them what they want, sire.
Nonsense. Apparently somebody has to teach a lesson to these children!
No one is to know the details, Renbock.
Understood?
- Say it!
- (GRUNTS)
No one needs to know the details,
Your Royal Highness.
ALL: Happy birthday, Snow!
- You remembered.
- Of course we remembered.
A girl's 18th birthday is the most important birthday of them all.
Do you want to know what I wish for your birthday, Snow White?
You can't make a wish for me.
Do you know why I continue to work for that wretched queen year after year?
I do it because I know that one day you are going to take back your kingdom, and I want to be here when that happens.
- It is not my kingdom.
- Oh, but it is.
Your father meant for you to inerit his crown.
And that woman has the entire kingdom convinced that you're a pathetic shut-in, incapable of leaving the castle.
And the worst is, she has you thinking it.
Your father's dagger.
I had it cleaned up and polished.
What would I do with this?
Perhaps you need to see for yourself what goes on in your kingdom.
WOMAN: The people don't
sing and dance anymore.
They need to see who you really are.
And you need to believe.
- I'm going out.
- Is she allowed to go out?
I don't know. Is she?
- OK...
- She's going out!
I won't say anything if you don't.
- Pinky swear?
- Pinky swear.
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall.
Can you believe that baron?
I mean, honestly, did he really think
I would consider marrying him?
A woman has standards, after all, and an exalted woman like myself has very high standards.
- Interesting.
- What is?
Your response to his proposal.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Consider the options.
Well, this option has a receding hairline, smells like rotten eggs, and I wouldn't be caught dead with him.
You've spent so much supporting your vanity, you can't afford to say no.
Then why don't you snap your fingers and make me a chest of gold, hm?
Everyone has magic within them, but very few discover it and learn to spend it wisely.
Trust me. I am, after all, merely a reflection of you.
Well, not an exact reflection.
(WHISPERS) I have no wrinkles.
They're not wrinkles, just crinkles.
As you wish.
What do you suggest I do?
I suggest you marry someone rich. Quickly.
Because one day soon, you will ask me who the fairest of them all is,
- and you won't like the answer.
- (HUFFS)
RENBOCK: Hello?
Is anybody out there?
MAN: Shut up, Renbock.
Nobody can hear you in the woods.
- RENBOCK: On the off chance...
- MAN: That there's somebody else
- in these miserable woods?
- RENBOCK: Well, there could be.
- Is that tone?
- RENBOCK: No, it's not tone.
- I was repeating...
- MAN: You did it in a very smart way.
I did not! I don't like being this close to you. I've told you before.
I was warned what I might find in these woods, but...

We are in dire need of your help, ma'am.
- We were ambushed by seven dwarfs...
- Bloodthirsty giants.
- Giants?
- We were outnumbered, we fought bravely, but they cheated.

- Now, we order you to release us.
- Order me?
If you refuse, you shall suffer dire consequences.
Only if you say please.
Given the circumstances, sir,
I think a please is in order.
You're right.

- (GIGGLES)

Hm.

No. I don't think she's interested, sir.
- BRIGHTON: Your Highness?
- Yes.
Pardon, Your Majesty, but... you have a visitor.
I'm not in the mood, Brighton.
He's young, handsome...
...and semi-nude.
Your Highness, may I present to you the esteemed
Prince Alcott of Valencia.
Your Majesty.
Please pardon our dress.
I'm afraid my valet and I were robbed by bandits as we entered your kingdom.
Bandits? How awful.
How absolutely terrifying and smooth and hairy.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Nothing.
Could I trouble you for a covering?
Perhaps a shirt?
If you must.
Um...
- Um...
- (WHISPERS) Brighton.
- Brighton.
- Your Majesty.
The prince is bashful and requires, sadly, a covering.
- BRIGHTON: Of course, milady.
- I'm not bashful.
Sir, is there any particular style of shirt you'd like?
Brighton.
A simple covering.
A simple covering it is.
Valencia, you say.
I've never heard of it.
Is it a wee hamlet?
No, quite the contrary.
It's a bountiful province.
We have many natural resources.
Gold, silver, bustling silk trade.
You don't say.
Send out the invites.
Alert the caterer.
I want you to organize a ball like this kingdom has never seen before.
We are gonna sweep this kid right off his feet.
Uh... Forgive me, Your Majesty, but I don't understand.
Brighton, the prince is rich.
He's built like an ox.
I'm going to marry him, and then my financial problems will be... solved.
No, I understand that part.
What I don't understand is how you intend to pay for the party.
It pains me to say this, but you're broke, my Queen.
Then go collect more taxes.
Your Majesty, I don't know the last time you were in the town, but the people are starving.
Do you have no imagination?
Go tell the villagers that bread is meat, less is more, blah, blah, blah.
Commoners love a good metaphor.
Just go sell it.
"Bread is meat."
- (WHISPERS) OK, go.
- Excuse me.
Do you have anything to eat?
What happened here?
I visited once with my father.
It was a wonderful place.
People always seemed to be singing and dancing.
That must have been many years ago.
- BRIGHTON: Yah! Yah!
- (HORSE NEIGHS)
Whoa!
- More taxes?
- Good, you can read.
Make sure they are collected in a timely fashion.
What's she doing with all our money?
- Protecting you.
- From what?
Must I remind you of the brutal attacks we have suffered?
- He speaks of...
- The beast!
Yes. Evil lurks in the dark woods, more hideous than you could ever imagine.
The only reason it hasn't gorged itself on all of you...
...is because your tax dollars are hard at work.
I'll be back tomorrow for the money.
You will return as quickly as possible and you will bring with you a platoon of castle guards.
Just look how she's dressed me, sire.
Like a pink profiterole.
That reminds me. We need clothes.
And gold. An army.
Clothes? Why? Do you not like the queers taste in mers fashion?
Have you been listening to anything I've said?
Yes. Soldiers, gold, clothes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Good.
- Only if you say please.
Please, Renbock.
Sire, I implore you to come back with me now. This queen radiates crazy.
You know these women always get crazy when there's a prince around.
No. There's
"I'm in the same room as a prince" crazy, and then there's just good old-fashioned, plain, traditional psycho crazy.
I fear she's the latter.
Safe travels, Renbock. And when you return, I pray you're wearing your pants.
Well, I will pray the same for you, sire. I bid you adieu.
SNOW WHITE: Baker Margaret!
Baker Margaret!
Margaret, it's worse than you could ever imagine!
- You saw the town?
- Yes. It's awful.
The queen has destroyed everything my father believed in.
Oh... (WHISPERS) Go on.
She's taxing them more as we speak, even though they have nothing.
That's to pay for all her lavish parties.
She's throwing another one tonight.
For a prince.
- A prince is here?
- And, Snow, it's said he has an army.
Well, maybe he could help us.
If he truly has an army, maybe he could help us take back the kingdom.
My goodness.
Someone's had quite a day.
You're gonna have an even bigger night.
You're gonna crash that ball.
BRIGHTON: You look fabulous,
Your Majesty.
"Fabulous"? Brighton,
I haven't even begun to get ready yet.
Well, then, one can only imagine how fabulous...
- Shut up, Brighton.
- With pleasure.
The treatment is ready.
Treatment?
Isn't that a trifle excessive?
There's no such thing.
- (BIRD SQUAWKING)
- (FLATULENT SOUNDS)
Try not to enjoy this, baker lady.
I'll do my best.
(WHISPERS) Tightening, brightening.
Tightening and brightening.
Ahh.
- Happy place, happy place.
- (BUZZING)
Oh, that's always the worst part.
Hm.
I can feel you smiling.
MAN: Her Majesty the Queen!
His Royal Highness,
- the Prince of Valencia!
- (SCATTERED GASPS)
In folklore, the rabbit is known to use cunning and trickery to outwit his enemies.
Or perhaps you prefer your guests feel out of control and slightly uncomfortable.
Handsome and smart.
How confusing.
- Hey, kid. Scram.
- (WALTZ PLAYING)
- You.
- You!
- You're here.
- (STAMMERING) I am. I'm here.
But... you're the prince?
I'm sorry. Seeing you in this dress has caused me to lose my words.
Well, at least it doesn't cause you to lose your pants.
(SIGHS) I mean, when I met you first, you werert wearing pants.
Yes.
Well, at least now you're dressed... up...
...like a bunny.
- MAN: Sorry.
Apparently it's a rabbit.
Something about trickery and enemies and cunning.
Oh, OK.
- I look like an idiot.
- Yes, a little bit.
- So, what are you...
- Doing in the palace? Um...
I live here.
I have for a while, actually.
- I'm kind of the princess.
- What? You didn't tell me that.
- You never told me you're a prince.
- (MAN GASPING)
I feared I looked ridiculous.
- Said the prince in the bunny hat.
- (GIGGLES)
- Arert we supposed to be changing?
- Yes, I believe so.
- Oh! Sorry!
- (EXCLAIMING)
- I'm so sorry!
- No, no, no, it's OK.
- Forgive me.
- No, forgive me.
The truth is, I didn't just come here to dance tonight.
- I need your help.
- Anything. I'm at your disposal.
SNOW WHITE: It's the queen.
Ever since my father died, she's terrorized the people and ruined the land.
And I would hope that a good-hearted prince like yourself would...
I have to go.
- Brighton.
- Right away.
MAN: Sir...
- (MUSIC STOPS)
- (APPLAUSE)
You sneaky little tart.
What were you doing, talking to my prince?
- Your prince?
- And where did you get such a dress?
Do you want to talk about my dress or what you did to the village?
Good for you, Snow White!
Someone's been taking their confidence pills, hmm?
Do it again.
Say it again. Come on.
Oh, you're no fun!
Brighton, you do it.
Do you want to talk about my dress or about what you did to the village?
Not irritating enough.
Come on. Say it again.
Be more irritating, more infuriating. Hmm?
(HIGH VOICE) Do you want to talk about my dress or about what you did to the village?
Actually, you're both irritating.
I've been there.
I've seen what you did to the people.
You left the castle grounds?
Wow. Snow White breaking all the rules today, hmm?
- That's a punishable offense, you know.
- By whose law?
You have no right to rule the way you do.
- Hm.
- And technically,
I'm the rightful leader of this kingdom.
Mmm.
Probably not the best thing you could have said just there.
I want her killed.
Killed? Your Majesty, isn't that a bit rash?
She is a threat to everything.
Take her to the woods and feed her to the beast.
Is this about the dress?
- BRIGHTON: Keep moving.
- SNOW WHITE: Just let me go.
I swear you'll never see me again.
You think I want to be here?
You brought this on yourself.
You never should have upstaged the queen, and now we're both paying the price.
Stop.
- Brighton, please.
- Turn around.
- (RUSTLING)
- (GASPS)
Please. Brighton, I'm afraid.
I don't want to die like my father did.
Your father was a good man.
He was always very kind to me.
In return, I shall give you one small piece of advice.
Run. Run as fast as you can and as far away from here as possible.
- Just run.
- (BRANCHES CRACKLING)
Like this. Run!
- Brighton!
- Run!
(MUTTERS) What am I going to do?
I've got to figure some way out.
- She'll never believe me.
- QUEEN: Brighton.
- Brighton!
- Coming! Coming.
- Your Majesty?
- Is it done?
Oh! Just as you instructed.
That's her liver, her kidneys, her spleen...
- That's disgusting.
...and a few other assorted parts.
I'll admit... I'm impressed.
You're not as pathetic and wimpy as I have always believed.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Wow, I feel amazing!
Positively lightheaded.
I'm just glad to see you in such a good mood.
Yes! We must release the news of the tragedy, right?
The usual stuff. You know,
"struck down in her youth," "terrible loss."
We'll fly the flags at half-mast.
Flags throughout the kingdom, or just within the palace grounds?
That's too much trouble.
Forget the flags.
Her parts! Your dagger.
- Night-night.
- Night-night.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
Glory!
She's awake.
Who are you?
We ask the questions here.
Who are you?
My name is Snow White.
ALL: Snow White?
- That's not possible.
- Snow White's a defective troll.
Yeah. They keep her locked up in the tower.
Maybe this is a different Snow White.
- Huh?
- It's not such an uncommon name.
If you're Snow White, then...
...who's your father?
- The king.
- She is Snow White, see?
- Eh.
I say never trust anyone over four feet.
Yeah. Let's drag her back out to the woods and pretend like we didn't see nothing!
No, you fools! She's a princess.
- That means she's valuable.
- We should hold her for ransom.
- She's won'th gold.
- Maybe we should get to know her first.
You won't get any gold for me.
They want me dead.
The queen sent me out here to be killed by the beast.
Why would the queen want you dead?
Because she's wicked.
- She's evil.
- (MURMURS OF ASSENT)
- She's a witch.
- Do you remember that time?
Sorry, but we have an appointment to keep.
So it's time for girlie to shuffle along.
Oh, wait! You can't just kick me out.
I have nowhere else to go.
Look. If the queen finds you here, she'll kill us, too.
Mm-hmm.
All I'm asking is to spend one night. Please.
Huddle!
All right, you guys, let me hear it.
All those in favor of letting the girl stay, say "aye."
Aye.
- Opposed?
- Nay.
Tough luck, Your Highness.
Sorry, Snow White.
All votes need to be unanimous.
- One night.
- Thank you.
Come on, guys. Duty calls.
Wait! I don't even know your names.
I'm Butcher.
Will Grimm.
Half Pint.
Napoleon.
Grub.
Chuck.
But you can call him Chuckles.
Stay focused, and no more arguing.
Maybe I should stay back with her.
I think she might be uncomfortable.
- No.
- And I'm Wolf.
Boys...
...I like her.
- Yeah, me, too.
She'll bring a feminine touch.
If you ask me, she's just gonna bring the queers guards.
- You think she has a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Me.
Snow White is dead.
One of God's great mysteries is His plan for each and every one of us.
(MUTTERS) Speed it up.
Snow White lived, she died,
God rest her soul. Amen.
There will be a buffet lunch served at 2:00.
Magistrate, I've come for the taxes.
The people cannot bear this much longer.
Are you seriously going to argue about money on this day of grieving?
That's odd.
What do we have here?
Looks like a royal to me.
Are you a royal?
No, no. Not a royal, just a humble servant.
You're riding in the queers sled.
No. This is a rental.
Well, you're wearing royal garments.
These tired old rags?
You boys have got to get out of the woods more often.
What's in that pretty sack?
My lunch.
Good, I'm famished.
What are we eating?
Boys! The mother Iode!
Give me that!
That money belongs to the queen!
Don't spend it all in one place.
Nothing like an honest day's work.
Beats working down a mine.
Welcome home.
Lamb. Carrots. Gravy.
- I say she's a keeper.
- Sure she is.
Oh, man!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Why do you have palace guard uniforms?
- We got them at work.
- What kind of job do you have?
We're... renegades.
- Rebels.
- Thieves!
That's true.
We stole the queers gold!
You broke into the palace?
No, we nabbed it outside the village.
So you actually stole the people's gold.
- Not exactly.
- Yes, exactly!
That's the people's money!
Why, that's terrible. They need it.
- You must return it.
- We worked hard for that money.
Stealing isn't work.
- Sure it's work!
- It's hard!
I tore my shirt, had to sew it.
That's work.
I'm sorry you got a few scrapes, but the townspeople need that money.
They hate us.
- Well, that can't be true.
- It is. They despise us.
Years ago, when the queen expelled all the "undesirables"...
...no one stood up for us.
She said...
"Banish all the Uglies."
You've been mistreated by the queen.
No one understands that better than me.
It's unfair, but so is stealing from innocent families.
We werert always thieves.
- We were legitimate.
- With real trades.
- I was a teacher.
- I was a butcher.
And I ran the pub.
A good, honest job.
- Honest?
- It was almost honest.
- I stole a little.
- A little?
- It's a cash business!
- That's your excuse?
Hey, everybody does it, all right?
- I didn't.
- Neither did I.
Uh, you put your thumb on the scale!
- I did not!
- Did too! And you cheat at poker!
- I win at poker.
- You cheat at poker?
- (YELLS)
- (CHATTER STOPS)
Where's the gold?
- Whoa!
- Move it!
- Come on, let's get the stilts.
- Forget the stilts! Come on!
Good thing she's in that dress, otherwise we'd never catch her!
My friends, our money has been returned!
It was brought back to us by...
Come up here, young lady, and tell us your name.
- I'm...
- BUTCHER: That belongs to us!
Hold on a second!
- Those men there!
- Move!
SNOW WHITE: Those men...
They're the ones that brought back the gold.
The queen told you that they were undesirables, but she lied.
Huh?
These brave men are the true heroes.
They fearlessly raided the queers caravan and...
...and retrieved your gold.
They're the ones that really deserve your thanks.
- Yay!
- (APPLAUSE)
Yay!
- Yeah!
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
Are you enjoying the quail?
Mm. It looks delicious,
Your Highness. Thank you.
I could barely hear you all the way down there. (CHUCKLES)
You know, everyone has remarked what a wonderful dancer you were last night.
Thank you, Your Highness.
I do have one question about the evening.
There was a girl there.
She had black hair and was very beautiful.
Beautiful?
Yes, I'd say she was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Ever is a very long time.
No, no, no, I know this in my heart.
I think she's the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Agree to disagree.
Let's leave it at that.
But do you know her?
Ivory skin, black hair...
Her hair is not black, it's raven, and she's 18 years old, and her skin has never seen the sun, so of course it's good.
Meaning to say, the girl you refer to is called Snow White.
Snow White.
I admit, she's very suited to the name.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
Most unfortunate case, really.
The child...
(WHISPERING)... wasrt all there.
I'm sorry, Highness, you're speaking about her in past tense?
Oh, I am.
How indelicate of me. She's dead.
- Dead?
- Mm.
- How?
- Last night, in the woods.
Oh. Treacherous place, the woods.
- This is terrible.
- Do you need a second?
Yes, thank you,
I just need to process.
Prince Alcott,
I have a proposition for you.
We're both single adults, roughly the same age.
- I don't think we're the same...
- I said roughly.
The point is, the clock is ticking for both of us.
We are people of means.
Would you do me the honor and be my...
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- A moment, please!
What?
Pardon my appearance, Your Majesty, but there's been a development.
- The royal taxes have been stolen.
- Stolen? By whom?
- Bandits.
- Bandits.
Uh-huh, bandits.
- Very intimidating.
- I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore.
Enough of these cowardly muggers!
Justice must prevail.
Wait. Wait!
Well, thank you, Brighton.
(WHISPERS) This close!
- (WHISTLES) Huddle!
- The deal's off. She stole our money.
ALL: You can stay.
- (SIGHS)
- But we've got conditions.
If you're going to live with us, you have to be one of us.
I have to be a dwarf?
No. You have to be a thief.
I feel I've been clear about my thoughts on stealing.
What if you were stealing from the queen?
You said yourself she's wicked.
- Somebody has to stop her.
- Why not you?
Why not us?
I mean us.
But this time I have conditions.
Whatever we steal goes back to the people.
- Minus a small commission.
- Butcher!
Fine. But she doesn't know the first thing about thieving!
Then we'll teach her.
We'll teach her to believe.
People think you can't be tall if you're short.
That you can't be strong if you're not.
A weakness is only a weakness
if you think of it that way.
Never, under any circumstances, give up the high ground.
That one?
Before you even draw your sword, you must make an impression on your enemy.
If he is deceived by the way you look,
- the battle's half won.
- (GRUNTING)
People think of you as sweet.
They don't expect you to fight dirty.
- Use that to your advantage.
- Whoo! Yes!
Concentrate.
GRIMM: Your weapon
isn't your only friend.
Sorry.
The environment can be an ally, too.
Deception on the battlefield
isn't just an option.
You're so cute when you're mad.
Oftentimes it's the difference between victory and defeat.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Ow!
- (YELLING)
- (GRUNTS)
SNOW WHITE: I'm sorry.
But you deserved it.
This is where we were ambushed last time.
Keep your eyes open.
Oh! Oh, dear! (GASPING)
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
I'll be out of your way in a moment.
Oh, dear!
Ma'am, may I offer you any assistance?
Oh, no! Sorry, sir!
Everything's all right. I'll just be...
- It's you.
- It's you.
- I thought you were dead.
- I almost was.
- Give us your valuables!
- Stay behind me. You'll be safe.

Hi, it's Fred!
Today is Friday.
Oh my god, that sounds like Freday.
Friday, Freday. Friday, Freday.
Two days no school, pure happiness.
Oh my gosh, today is like this weekend to make the weekends the week and the week with the weekends.
That means we're gonna have five whole days off and only two days at school.
Oh, my gammit! I'm so excited!
And then there's really important holiday like Precident's Day,
We only have one day at school.
I think they might decide to do that this weekend. created by walterclozet from livedash for CFT team.
Hey, hi.
Hi, hi.
See you guys tomorrow, see you.
Yeah, hey.
You never said it before.
Judy...
Judy...
Judy...
You might not be able to tell, but...
That's Judy...
She's my girlfriend... obviously.
This weekend it's crucial on our realationship, because...
Wait for it.
Get ready.
It's coming, hold on.
I'm taking things to the next level with judy.
And she knows it too.
We've been inseparable lately.
- So I was thinking of having a party this weekend.
- Yeah, we've been thinking about it.
- But i--maybe i-- - yeah, we aren't really sure yet.
Ow!
- What do you guys think?
[Playing chaotic piano riff] - I'm thinking I might have judy over today.
I'm not really sure.
I mean, my mom won't mind.
I have friends over all the time, and she never cares.
My dad doesn't care either, ..
He's not here.
He's not with us.
He's not dead.
He's just not here.
Can see how you might have misunderstood that.
But, you know, it really doesn't even matter that I just have one parent, because my mom loves me twice as much, and I pay her back by filling the whole entire house with beautiful music.
?? Somebody call 911 ??
?? shorty fire burning on that dance floor ??
?? whoa ?? every room in my house was constructed for a specific purpose.
For instance, this room, my bedroom, was constructed to have a perfect view of judy's house.
[sighs] Hi, judy.
Fridays are usually my favorite day at school, but I need some food for my body because today was the worst friday ever!
[laughter] - Whoa!
- He likes it!
He likes it, mommy!
- Oh! - he likes it.
- Thank you!
- Oh!
You want some more?
- Kevin, just leave him alone.
- No.
[glass clattering] - If I don't get any food in my body, then there's gonna be no blood in my head, and then my head might fall off 'cause there's no blood in it.
Oh, my gammit!
I'm so upset about what happened at school that I almost ruined my snack.
Cheese.
I say "oh, my gammit" because I'm not allowed to say bad words ...
The "d" word.
Anyhow, the thing that happened happened in music class.
I love music class, because, well, I'm a great singer.
?? shorty fire burning on that dance floor ?? you know who else is a great singer?
- ?? Freddy ??
- judy.
She sings like an angel.
But like an angel who isn't dead, because she'll never die.
Until she dies.
Yum.
Blah!
Hot thing! hot thing! hot thing! hot thing!
I burned my tongue!
[screaming] Hot thing! hot thing! hot thing!
I'm drowning.
I've decided not to have a snack after all, because I want to stay trim for judy.
To be honest, me and judy have hit a minor bump in our relationship thanks to kevin.
Kevin is a big, fat nothing, and I could not believe what I saw her doing with him today.
[together] ?? YOU JUST GOT TO BE STRONG ??
?? Just stop ??
- ?? 'cause I really love you ??
- ?? stop ??
?? I'll be thinking of you ??
[together] ?? LOOK IN MY HEART ??
?? And let love ??
?? keep us together ??
- oh, my god, they sounded terrible.
It was like my mom trying to fit into her jeans.
Hmm.
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.
There we go.
It was horrible.
I mean, and she didn't even notice it.
You agree, right?
I mean, judy was up there, and she seemed happy.
I don't know if she was acting or what, but I have to tell her.
Maybe I'll invite her over for a pool party, and as we're lounging by the pool, I'll break it to her gently.
Judy, lover, you are a wonderful singer.
- Oh, thank you, fred.
That was a mistake.
- I need someone like you to be honest with me.
- Don't worry, darling.
I've just had a law passed that will have kevin arrested for the way he sang to you.
- That's such a relief.
[sirens blaring] - Stop!
Stop!
?? 'Cause I really love you ??
?? stop ??
?? I'll be thinking of you ??
- anyone ever sings to you like that again, just tell me, and I'll take care of it, darling.
- You're so romantic, fred.
- Judy!
- Just beyond that wall over there is judy's house.
She's only a few feet away, and I can't reach her.
They put up that wall to keep us apart.
- What you doing, fred?
- What does it look like I'm doing, bertha?
- Judy would think it's silly that you have a kiddie pool.
I don't care what judy thinks.
Why would I care what judy thinks.
What makes you think that?
I mean, it's just judy.
- Okay. you're not going swimming?
- No, I'm not going swimming.
I'm not--that's lame, really, really lame.
- Well, I think I might go swimming.
- Have fun. - ttfn.
- [screams] Oh, my god, that was almost so embarrassing.
Thank god I didn't invite judy over for the pool party.
Sometimes I don't think I know anything about women.
I need some advice.
I wish my dad was here.
Dad?
What do you think I should do?
- The secret is ruthless aggression.
- It is?
- You got to look at yourself and say, " show her what kind of man you really are.
Use those talents.
What are your talents, fred?
- I-i'm a good singer.
- No!
- Ow!
- You're a great singer.
You're the best!
It is you who take mere words and make them melodious love.
Are you with me?
- Yep.
- You got to fire up!
- I'm with you, dad.
- Well, good, just-- just remember, it's probably gonna get cold outside.
Bring a sweater, okay?
- Okay, dad. thanks.
That's it.
I've got to invite judy over so we can harmonize together.
And then she'll forget all about kevin, 'cause harmonizing with me will be so much smoother.
- ?? And soon both of us ??
?? learned to trust ??
?? not run away ??
- [smooth falsetto] ?? IT WAS NO TIME TO Play ??
- ?? we build it up ??
?? and build it up ??
- yow.
- ?? And now it's solid ?? both: ?? SOLID AS A ROCK ??
?? And nothing's changed it ??
- ?? the thrill is still ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hot ?? this is it!
I'm gonna go over to judy's house and invite her over to sing with me.
[singing in an operatic soprano] ?? ??
I'm so excited!
I smell beautiful.
Nothing is gonna come between our love, judy.
Nothing!
[aggressive hip-hop beat] Oh, my gammit, kevin!
I'm not going out there.
If I go out there and ask judy to come over in front of kevin, he's gonna undermine my self-confidence.
Maybe he won't notice.
I've got to try.
Here I come to harmonize with you, judy.
?? La ??
I'm gonna do it.
I can do it.
- Hey, figglehorn, where you going, huh?
- None of your business, kevin.
- Oh, okay.
What, are you going to judy's house for a little play date, huh?
You guys gonna do-- ehhh-ahhh-ehllll ahhll!
Huh?
You gonna do a little bit of that, huh?
- Kevin, that's not what I was gonna do, okay?
- Dude, she hates you, man.
Why can't you just get that through your head, dude.
She hates you. she tells me all the time.
I mean, like, she came over yesterday and like-- you know?
- She hates you, kevin.
I can see how you misunderstood it, because she hates you.
- She doesn't hate me.
We're on a-- we're on a first-name basis.
- Yeah, yeah?
She hates everybody who can't sing, kevin.
- I can sing.
This whole neighborhood knows.
[laughs] YOU KNOW?
You know?
The whole neighborhood knows I can sing.
I can sing, dude.
I mean, she hears me all the time, man.
I'm perfect; I got perfect pitch.
I've been told since day one I have perfect pitch.
I mean, I can reach-- I can reach all the notes.
- That--that's weird.
She thinks you suck at singing.
- Oh, you're gonna get it.
You're gonna get it, figglehorn.
You want some of this? - she said it; I didn't.
- Huh, you want it?
- [screaming] - This is my cul de sac.
It always has been.
It always will be, baby.
Whoo!

I was so close.
[door unlatching] [gasps] Oh, my gosh, kevin's trying to get inside the house.
- Fred. - go home, kevin!
- Figglehorn.
- Get away from my house.
I will call the police.
- Fred!
- I'm calling the police right now.
- Figglehorn.
- Already called the police, and they said that if you don't stop, you're gonna go to prison with the fattest people ever!
- Fred, open the door!
- Oh.
Mom, sorry.
You're strong.
- Fred, what's going on in here?
- Mom, I thought someone was going to attack me.
Although I don't know why anyone would want to.
- Maybe because of your voice.
- Mom.
Mom.
Mom! mom! - what, sweetie?
- I'm gonna have a friend over so we can sing, okay?
- Honey, no singing.
I'm taking a nap.
- Mom.
We'll be quiet.
- Can't hear you.
I'm taking a nap!
- Kevin!
I can't go over there and ask judy to my house with kevin out there.
He'll embarrass me.
Judy has such a beautiful southern accent.
I know it would harmonize perfectly with my normal human accent.
I don't know what to do.
- What's wrong with you?
Have I taught you nothing? - dad.
- No son of mine is gonna sit in here and ..
From kevin?
Yeah!
My house!
Sorry, son.
- I don't want kevin to make fun of me in front of judy.
[grunts] - Make fun of you.
Sometimes you don't use these muscles.
You use this muscle.
You got to out-think kevin.
You got to find another route.
- Dad, the only route is blocked by the wall.
- The wall is nothing.
It was put there to keep you and your true love apart.
- I knew it.
- I am taking a nap!
- [whispers] I KNEW IT.
- Huh?
- My time is now.
- Your time is now.
- My time is now.
- Your time is now.
- My time is now!
- Your time is now.
- Oh.
Sorry, dad.
- It's good.
You're ready.
- Thanks, dad.
- Before you go.
Little schmutz.
- Once I get over that wall, I can go up to judy's backdoor and ask her to come over.
I've never seen judy's backdoor, but I bet it's really nice.
I'm gonna use this to make a flying leap over the fence.
And then me and judy are gonna walk back over to my house really proudly, and then kevin's gonna be, like, all confused, so he won't even be able to do anything, and then we'll be back into my house before he even knows it.
Oh, and this is the trampoline.
I got it from my mom.
She uses it to train for work.
I bet you kevin never would've thought of this.
Stupid kevin!
Ha ha ha!
Kiss this, kevin!
Here I come, judy.
I'm coming, judy.
Just hold on.
Ow!
[screaming] - Freddie, you okay?
- I hurt myself while trying to get to judy's.
- Do you need to go to the hospital?
- No, I don't think so.
- Then I'm taking a nap.
- This is better.
Much less dangerous.
[grunting] Ow.
Digging's hard.
Ow!
[screams] I'm coming for you, judy.
Just hold on.
Don't give up.
Ow!
?? I've been digging in the tunnel ??
?? all hacking day ??
[panting] Okay.
Going back down.
It takes forever to get to judy's house underground.
Huh?
What's this?
[electricity crackling] - Oof!
Ow!
Mom!
- [deep voice] AWESOME.
Oh, my gammit, that was awesome!
I'm coming, judy.
I have butt loads of energy.
Here I come.
I'm here.
Oh, my gammit, I dug all the way to china!
[screaming] - [whistling] - I figured out what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna disguise myself.
Kevin will never recognize me.
He'll be totally fooled, and I'll walk up to judy's door and rip off my disguise, and she'll think it's a joke, and then she'll laugh, and then I'll laugh, and then we'll both be laughing.
[sniffing] Mm.
I'm gonna smell like green apples.
I have the perfect disguise.
I ordered it from the back of a comic book, and it is amazing.
It's an invisibility suit, and it's gonna make me completely invisible.
Here it is.
I've been waiting to use this.
Whoa.
See you guys later.
Wow!
That was totally worth $6.98.
Plus shipping and handling.
- Huh?
What's going on here?
- Where am i, kevin?
I'm here.
- Whoa! - no, I'm not.
I'm over here.
Think fast.
- What? - watch out!
- What are you gonna do, kevin?
- What are you?
- Behind you.
Oh, it's over here.
Oh, does baby want the ball?
Watch out. - stop!
- What, are you gonna cry?
[laughs] - Stop!
- Oh, does baby kevin need his mommy?
- [crying] - [laughing maniacally] Here goes nothing.
Oh, my gosh, that's such a weird feeling.
Floating shoe.
Who's doing it?
I don't know.
Must be someone invisible.
What the heck?
Okay, maybe I just didn't do it right.
One, two, three.
Pew!
Pew!
Gammit!
[growling] I guess I have to find a better disguise.
Ooh!
Boy, do I wish I could pull that one off.
- Wait, what?
What?
- [furiously ringing doorbell] - Judy, I'm here!
- Is that fred?
- [gasps] - Fred.
I'm gonna get you!
- [crying] Oh, my gammit, asian people have kidnapped judy!
What do I do?
I got to call the police and the cops and the fbi, the cia and the fbi and the army and the cops and the swat team and--and-- I never had an emergency before.
I don't know who to call.
I don't even know what number to call.
?? Somebody call 911 ?? that's who I have to call.
What's your emergency?
- Hello, this is fred, fred figglehorn, and I'm here to tell you that my girlfriend judy has been kidnapped by asian people.
Asian people have stolen my girlfriend and her stuff and her family. - sir?
- Although if you ask her if she's my girlfriend and she says no, it's cause we haven't told a lot of people yet, and we were kind of keeping it on the down-low, you know?
People will be jealous, you know?
Anyways, she's gone!
- Sir, you need to calm down.
- Calm down?
Hello?
[busy signal] That is really frustrating that the police won't even help me.
Her kidnappers could be anywhere by now.
She's gonna have such a horrible life!
- Fred, what is your problem?
- Mom!
Mom, wake up!
Wake up right now!
- I am up.
Judy's been kidnapped, and they took all her stuff.
She might be dead.
I don't even know.
- What are you talking about?
- Her house.
It's completely empty.
- Maybe that's because they moved.
- What?
- They sold their house to the tangs, and they moved.
I got their address right here.
They asked me to forward their mail.
- [gasps] Judy moved!
Where to?
- I don't know.
They asked me to forward the mail.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because, freddie, i-- I didn't know you'd be so upset.
I wrote the address-- - mom! she's my girlfriend.
Judy.
- Freddie.
I get any of their mail, I'm tossing it.
All right, honey, relax.
I'm going out.
Be a good boy.
You're a good boy.
- Judy, no!
[screaming] [loud animalistic roar] [moaning] ?? Judy moved away ??
?? I'm so alone ??
?? it hurts so much ??
?? oh whoa ??
?? whoa ??
- freddie, please go to sleep.
- ?? My heart is broken ??
?? and my mom doesn't even care ??
?? whoa oh oh oh ??
[snoring] - Fred!
It's go time!
- [crying] Dad, what's wrong?
- It's judy.
By kidnappers.
- Kidnappers?
Who are they?
- Her parents. - no!
- Luckily, in the final minutes, she sent us a transmission.
Check it out. it's right there.
- ?? Doo doo doo-doo-doo ??
?? dora ??
?? doo doo doo-doo-doo ??
?? dora ??
- that's classified.
Pay no attention to that.
Transmission. - oh, fred.
- Judy!
- There's so much that I wanted to say to you or sing to you or sing with you.
That's all I've ever wanted.
You've always known that to be true, right?
- Yes, judy, yes.
- I knew you did.
- Okay, judy, listen carefully.
- Yes, fred?
- You are under a bed right now.
- Ah!
- No!
Judy!
No!
- Relax.
We are going to rescue her.
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you have your seat belt on?
- Oh, sorry, dad.
I hope mom doesn't get worried if she notices I'm not home in the middle of the night.
- She knows exactly where you are.
- I've got your mail right here.
Take that!
Don't mess with my son!
- What a crazy dream.
But I think I know what it means.
I got it!
Judy wants me to come find her.
We have a psychic connection, and the dream is the only way she could possibly communicate with me.
I found judy's address on this map.
56 Meadow lane.
Sounds beautiful, doesn't it?
Meadow.
I wonder what judy's house looks like?
Oh, it's nice.
Jeez.
If I zoom in, I wonder if I can see her.
?? Zoom zoom ??
?? zoom ??
[gasps] Eww!
That must be the guy who lived there before her.
Oh, that is sick.
He pooped inside her bathroom.
The ghost of that guy's poops will be inside judy's bathroom forever.
What if they come back to life, huh?
I have got to get judy out of that house.
There's only one problem.
The woods.
[wolf howls] I have to avoid the woods.
[wolf howls] I have to.
I mean, I'd be way too scared to go back in there ..
Weiss.
- I'll get it.
[animal roaring] ..
He never came out of those woods, never.
Scary.
- 911. What's your emergency?
- I need to know what bus to take from my house to judy's house, avoiding the woods.
- Sir, I think you meant to dial 411.
This line is for emergencies only.
- This is an emergency!
Judy moved away, and I have to get to her house so I can invite her over to my house so we can sing together.
- Sir, please dial 411.
[hangs up] Rude.
Turns out that there's a bus that takes me exactly one block from judy's new address.
It's called the number seven bus.
I have no idea how long it's gonna take me to get to judy's house, so I'm just preparing for the worst.
Do I need ketchup?
Probably not.
But it could be dangerous out there.
I'm coming for you, judy!
[battle sounds] I'm coming!
[screaming] I'm coming, judy!
Wait for me!
Hate ketchup.
This'll be enough.
Ah! crash!
Ow!
[Baby coughing] - [snoring] I didn't know how much the bus cost, so i took $25.
Well, here I go.
Wish me luck.
What?
It might rain.
Judy.
I'm gonna do it.
Let's do this.
- Hey, figglehorn.
Where you going?
- None of your business, kevin.
- Oh, where are you going, to a butt face convention, huh?
- I'm just gonna ignore you.
- Well, you're not ignoring me, 'cause you just talked to me.
- What happened to your arm, kevin?
Did you make a fake cast so everyone would feel sorry for you?
- No, it's not fake.
Actually, some guys tried to steal my bike, and I beat 'em up.
But it doesn't even matter, ..
- Why'd they all use the same pen?
- Because girls like the color red.
- I bet god pushed him down 'cause he hates the way he sings.
- What did you say?
- I never said anything.
I'm igning you, kevin.
- Then why do you keep talking to me, figglehorn?
Where are you going, anyway?
- Why do you care?
I'm not gonna tell you.
- All right, then, I'll just follow you all the way there.
How'd you like that?
- Well, I'm here.
- You have to take the bus?
That is so lame, man.
I have girls take me where I want to go.
- I have a girl.
- Oh, yeah. who?
- My mom.
- Oh, my god, man.
Is anybody listening to this?
You're such a loser, dude.
Where are yog, huh?
Where are you going, huh?
Where you going, fred?
Where you going, figglehorn?
Huh? where you going?
Oh, oh, is that your bus, fred?
- I'm not talking to you, kevin.
- Is that your bus?
Gonna get on the bus?
- Ain't got all day here.
- [laughs] I know.
I know where you're going.
- Where am I going?
- Come on, kid, I got a schedule to keep here.
- Here's $5.
You can keep the change.
Hi.
[gasps] Think I'll sit back here.
Uh-oh.
I'm supposed to be on the number seven bus.
- This is the number six bus.
This is the number six bus.
- I know, but if kevin knew all the bus routes and where they were going and if I got on the right bus, he would know where I was actually going.
So by getting on the wrong bus, he would never know I was actually going to judy's house.
- Dude, please chill out.
- Sorry.
I'm just really excited.
I'm fred.
Fred figglehorn.
- Derf.
- [imitates explosion] - Dude, don't.
That's lame.
- Oh.
Oh, right. I knew that.
- So, who's judy?
She have a sister or something?
Girlfriend.
- No, she's not.
- What?
Judy is not your girlfriend.
- You're right.
How'd you know?
- Lie detectors.
- Cool.
It's just, judy's such a smokin' hot babe.
Every time I see her, I just tingle.
- She makes you pee?
" - dude, take a joke.
What are you doing here?
Wong-a-nong-tong.
- Yeah?
You're not wearing a swimsuit.
- This is my swimming suit.
I mean, sometimes I just don't like showing my body too much, because, you know, there's too much sex appeal.
- Cute.
- Uh, how come nobody's here?
You're, like, the only one.
- Some kid pooped in the pool.
- Eww!
- The good thing is, now there's no line for the slide.
- I-i have to go, anyway.
- Yeah, okay, sure.
Going to my friend's house.
Girlfriend.
- Before you go, do you want to try something cool?
Pretty fun, isn't it?
- It's really fun.
My neck is hot, but my feet are cold.
But what if I have to go to the bathroom?
- Don't be a wong-i-mong-pong.
Well, I'm going swimming.
Later.
- I'm not a wimp!
[fly buzzing] Mm.
Mm.
[voices overlapping] - Help! - somebody help her!
She's drowning.
- No!
No, judy!
I'm trapped.
Just wait one second, judy!
- Fred! - judy!
- Judy, I'll save you!
Hey, bro!
I got it!
Get out of the way! get out of the way!
Move it, pop!
Judy, I'll save you!
Whoo!
?? Love ??
- [screams] - ?? Love will keep us together ??
[together] ?? THINK OF ME BABE WHENEVER ??
- ?? Some sweet talking girl ??
- love won't keep you guys together.
You guys don't love each other.
[together] ?? DON'T MESS AROUND ??
?? You just got to be strong ??
- why are you guys singing together?
- ?? 'Cause I really love you ??
- judy.
Judy, I thought we were gonna take it to the next level?
No! no!
Ow!
Oh, my gammit.
Oh, my gammit, I got to get going.
I got to get to judy's house.
[screaming] [dramatic orchestral music] ?? ??
- so did you get the poop out of the pool yet?
No?
Hey, fred, you can't show up at judy's house looking like that.
She's gonna make fun of you.
- How did you know I was going to judy's house?
- I didn't until just now.
So long, dong-o-o-fong-u-song.
- what are you doing?
You can't be naked in here.
- I was going to leave my underwear on.
- Yeah, well, nobody wants to see you in your underwear.
- I beg to differ.
I've been told my body's pretty attractive.
?? Uh-huh ??
?? yeah ??
?? uh-huh ??

- Would you like a fragrance?
[sniffing] - Green apples.
- Green apples?
- [laughing] Can I get a green apples, please?
- Will you watch my bag for me?
[rings bell] - Where's your car?

[tires squeal] Oh, my god!
They sell squirrels!
I love squirrels.
[bell rings] - ?Cuomer ?? - squirrels.
- I'm busy. - and I'm grooming lancelot.
- And you're useless.
Yes, young man?
- Oh, hey, I was just looking at the squirrels.
- We don't have squirrels.
You might want to go to a park or outside.
We do have hamsters, though.
They're in the rodent family if you want to take a look at 'em.
- I saw the squirrels, and I just thought they'd be the perfect ..
- Look, I don't know her, and I don't care to know her.
We can't help you, but presents are nice.
I enjoy them.
- [whispers] GARY. GARY.
The young man believes the pomeranians are squirrels.
- I knew that.
- I don't think you did.
- Excuse me. - yeah?
- Come with me.
- Now, by squirrels, do you mean this?
- Yep, how much are they?
- 795. - Okay.
- Lorenzo, can you ring us up $795?
That's how much my mom makes a year.
That is ridiculous!
- Never mind, lorenzo.
He's broke.
- Okay, well, I'm just gonna be looking around, so don't even-- don't even mind me.
- I won't.
- I won't even be here.
I'll be leaving soon.
Get in there.
Yeah.
[laughs] I've been wanting one of these for a while now.
- What are you doing?

- Put the dog down.
- Dog? - squirrel.
- Hey, put the dog down.

- Oh, my god, gary, he's a gang banger.
This is mace!
I will spray you. - no!
- I will spray you in the eyes.
- Lorenzo, what are you doing with mace?
- Someone has to protect us.
- This is not the time for your drama, okay?
- Put the dog back.
- I would do what he-- - I don't have a dog.
- Lady, clear out!
Put the dog back.

- I'm sorry.
- Oh, hey, sir, do you know how to get to meadow lane from here?
What?
I can't understand you;i'm sorry.
Oh, my god.
There's something wrong with me.
Why is there a voice in my head that doesn't even make sense?
Are you a space man?
Is that what you are?
You're doing something to me,aren't you?
You're gonna ruin my brain!
Get away from me, space man!
I will not let you ruin my brain.

- Good for you. you should look.
Soak her in.
Soak in all the dam beauty.
I'll tell you what, she's the single greatest feat of engineering in the entire county.
Hey, you know what this dam is made out of, don't you?
- No.
- Sweat and ingenuity, friend.
Sweat and ingenuity.
Ha!
- Do you know how to get to the numbereven bus?
- Oh, the number seven bus.
Well, just a quick little jaunt through the woods right there.
- [gasps] THE WOODS?
- Oh, no, no, no. don't be scared.
Don't be scared of the woods.
You're not scared of the woods, are you?
- I have to walk through the woods?
- Nothing to be afraid of in the woods ..
- [gasps] - EVAN...
- [gasps] - WEISS.
- [screams] - Oh, but if you're scared, I tell you what you can do.
You can just turn around and just go home and be home with mama.

Yeah, that's a good idea.
Mama.
- Mama? - mama.
- Mama? - mama.
- Mama, save me.
I'm a big grown baby needs his mama.
What's wrong with you?

That's me.
Who are you?
- Man up, man.
Head into those woods.
Face your fears.
Do what I'd do.
Look at the-- respect the badge.
- You're right.
You're definitely right.
I should--i should go through the woods.

- It's just the woods.
- No big deal. - go on.

Mm-hmm.
You should thank someone for a compliment.
- [screams] - [screams] WHAT'S WRONG?
- You're talking!
You're talking, and you're a deer.
- Oh, for a minute there, I thought there was a wolf or something.
You scared me.
- Do all deers talk?
" do all deer talk.
Nobody says mooses or meese.
- Do you all talk?
- Some of us way too much.
- Hey, can I drop one with you?
- Drop what?

- that's me.
?? Whoa oh oh oh ??
?? whoa oh oh ??
- stop. hoofer time.
Mm.
- You know, I don't even know why I've always been so terrified of the woods.
I mean, now that I've actually came here, I realize it's not even that scary.
- I'm out of here.
- I mean, the woods has got trees, deer, birds.
I mean, there's just so much to it.
I mean, it's more than just-- - fred!
It's me, evan.
Evan weiss.
I got it.

I got the ball.

- Hey, figglehorn!
You need a ride?
You need a ride?
[laughs] What an idiot.
Mom, drive around the block.
- I'm not your chauffeur. - mom!
- [yawns] - Hey, nice lean-to.
[laughs] One more. - kevin, no.
I am drawing the line.
- I'm gonna tell dad.
- Don't tell him.
- What is that?
- Derf!
How'd you get here?
- Dude, my question needs to be answered first.
- Sardines.
- Lunch fail, man.
- I know. I don't actually like them.
But when I packed my food, I forgot to pack a can opener, and this is the only can that had a handy little opener on it, and I've been walking all over, so I'm really tired, and I just got so hungry.
- You got to chill out, man.
- I'm going to bed.
Will you wake me when the bus comes?
- Maybe.
But maybe not.
Bus, man.
- Thanks, derf.
You're like the best friend I've ever had.
Obviously.
I'm doing it!
Wish me luck.
I'm going to judy's house!
- You want it?
Do you want it?
Excuse me.
I found this poor little animal wandering around all by herself.
- A squirrel!
It's a squirrel.
I'll take it.
This is my lucky day.
Oh.
Me and judy will be your new parents, and we'll love you forever.
- Meadow lane.
- Oh, my gammit, we're here.
We're gonna see your mama.
Here we go.
Judy!
Yes!
Judy.
- Mom, I hate it here.
I want to move back to our old house.
- Oh, stop complaining.
- [sighs] [crying] - Hello, miss.
- Who are you?
Fred. - it's me.
- I knew you'd come for me.
You got my psychic message.
- I did.
I brought you a gift, judy.
- A squirrel.
I love squirrels.
Thank you.
- It's nothing.
- How ever did you get here?
It must have been so hard.
- It was.
I crossed the entire city to get to you, judy.
Even the woods.
[wolf howls] - You went through the woods?
[wolf howls] - That's so dangerous.
I'd have been worried about the wild animals.
- I wasn't afraid of the wild animals.
Weiss.
- He's alive.
- He's very alive.
- Oh, my god, I'm so impressed with you.
You came all this way.
- But why?

And to invite you over to my house.
To sing.

- Get it! get it!
- Judy, I'm here.
- Fred?
- Where's-- where's judy?
- Oh, my god.
Guys, it's fred!
[laughter] What are you doing here, fred?
- I think I could ask you the same question, kevin.
- No, you can't, 'cause I was invited, and you weren't.
So get out, dude.
- This isn't even your house, kevin.
You cant just tell me to leave.
What are all you guys doing in here anyway?
Just creeping around judy's house or something?
- What's it look like?
It's a party.
That you weren't invited to. all: OH!
- Well, for your guys' information.
Judy would be happy to have me here.
I call her every night.
- Oh, my god.
What a loser.
[laughter] - Judy.
- Fred.
- Please tell me you didn't invite figglehorn to this party.
- What are you doing here?
- Don't you want to hear about how I got here?
It's a crazy story.
- Fred, I'm kind of in the middle of my party.
- I think she just told you to leave, mate.
[laughter] - Maybe you shouldn't be here.
- Judy.
You're right.
Maybe--maybe I shouldn't be here, because no offense to you, judy, but this party is so lame.
[laughs] - This isn't lame.
This is a good party.
- Yeah, now it is.
Oh, my god.
- Now it is.
- This is so embarrassing, fred.
- Judy, why are you being like this?
- Oh, my god, I can't do this.
- Judy, who are you?
Where's the judy I know, huh?
Show me her. show me the old judy.
- Fred, I think it would be better if you just left.
I'm really sorry, fred.
- Judy, I came all this way just for you.
- This isn't a girl scout convention.
We don't want any of your cookies. all: OH!
[laughter] [all talking at once] - Kevin.
- Pizza shirt!
[laughter] [retches] all: OH!
Oh!
- Oh, my god!
- Figglehorn yakked it big time!
[all talking at once] - That is disgusting.
Oh, my gosh.
- [sobbing] - Fred!
Fred, wait!
- You need to send that to me.
- I got it. I got it.
[sad piano music] ?? ??
- hey, kid, you lost or something?
- Kind of.
- Where you going?
- Home.
- All right, my shift's over.
Get in. I'll take you.
- But I don't--i don't have another $5 bill.
- Get in.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It pays to tip.
- Take care, kid.
- Thanks.
- Don't.
That's lame.
- Oh.
[breathing heavily] [screaming] That was so humiliating!
I can't believe judy had a party and didn't even invite me.
She's not who I thought she was at all.
I bet you that southern accent of hers isn't even real.
She's probably never even been to the south.
- Fredd, honey, who are you talking to?
- Mom?
Mom.
I'm really upset right now.
- Well, one of your friends just sent me a video about you on the computer.
- About me?
- Yeah, you got to check it out. all: OH!
- Oh, my god!
[laughter] - [screams] all: OH!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh! oh! oh! oh!
- Oh, my gammit, this is so embarrassing.

Okay.

- Mom.
That's disgusting.
Come on.
What is this?
- Your dis-invitation.
I'm having a party, and you can't come.
- I'm--i'm trying to get it.
- I have to go right now, 'cause there's a lot of other people I have to dis-invite to my party.
Ha! ha!
- Oh, what a sweet kid.
Yeah, I'm glad you're friends.
- I'm not friends with him.
- Oh, well, you should be, 'cause he seems popular.
- Mom, I'm not even friends with him.
- I would be, 'cause he's popular.
- Mom, I'm not friends with him.
- stop touching my hat.
- Oh, gosh, right. don't touch the hat.
- Just wanted to make sure you knew you weren't invited.
Bye.
Oh, oh, it looks like you got my message ..
To my party!
Sucker!
- And I asked everyone, and they all specifically said you weren't cool, so here you go.
One for you.
And one for you.
Both not invited!
[laughs] Hey, guys.
Just wanted to let you guys know that I was having a party, but you're not invited!

What's up?
- Not much.
- No? - I'm just hangin'.

Everyone saw it.
I'm not stupid. I know.
I get it.
I'm over it.
Anyways, here.
You're not invited and I never was gonna invite you anyway.
See ya.
Gonna be fun without you.
- I didn't think that video was funny.
Are you serious?
[retches] And then kevin was like, " that's so funny.
Oh, but you weren't laughing, were you?
- No, I wasn't invited to judy's party.
- You weren't?
Well, I don't know.
I guess I just assumed.
Well, anyways, I'm gonna go get ready for my party.
So see you.
- Okay, have fun.
- Bertha.
Bertha?
Would you maybe want to-- like, you can just come to my party maybe just for a little bit.
You don't have to stay the whole time, but do you want to come, maybe.

A ton of clothes.

No, no, everyone will think you're a loser.

- I wanted to make it to fred's party, but my girl didn't want to go.
I like to party; she don't like to party.
I like to break it down.
[sighs] I will be at the next one.
- Oh, it was an epic fail of me not to go to fred's.
I mean, I wasn't invited, but I'm sure it's 'cause I wasn't around when he was inviting people.
A lot.
- I would totally go out with fred, but judy's, like, my best friend, and I would never do that to her.
- I was at fred's house, and, like-- [laughs] And we, like, hurled together.
I mean, we--we crossed-hurled.
[laughter] - I don't care that I wasn't invited to fred's party, you know?
I don't--i don't care at all.
I don't. I really don't.
I don't know why everyone's asking me that.
Like, you know?
Who--who was there?
- Best party ever, right?
Boys, quit staring.
- My friends, I don't-- where'd my friends go?
Hey, guys.
Guys.
- Hoo!
Hey-hey, that was some party.
Hey, mister.
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
- Hi, mom.
- You sure know how to throw a little party.
- It was over yesterday.
- Yeah?
Did your girlfriend judy show up?
- Mom, no, she didn't.
She's not my girlfriend anyway.
- Hey, listen, so what?
She's probably just playing hard to get.
There'll be others knocking your doorstep down.
She'd be lucky to have you as a boyfriend, 'cause you're good looking, 'cause you're a figglehorn.
- I am a figglehorn, mom, thanks.
- Anyway, I keep getting their family's mail.
Who's she think she is?
- I thought you said you were gonna toss all the mail, mom.
- Yeah, well, I'm a big talker.
What you look-- oh, nice house.
- Yeah, it's judy's house.
- Is that the house where you hurled?
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.
I know that guy.
That's danny genetti.
- Eww!
How do you know him?
- We had a date once.
- When was that?
- That was about, I don't know, 15 years ago.
- I'm 15.
- I'm taking a nap.
- You just got up, mom.
- Yeah, well, whatever.
I'm taking a nap.
- [gasps] Dad!
What are you doing here?
- Taking a nap!
[doorbell rings] - Judy.
- Hi, fred.
- You're tall.
- Oh, it's the shoes.
You weren't at school today.
I hope you're not sick.
- I-i'm not sick, not sick at all.
- Were you taking a nap, then?
- No.
- Why are you wearing your pajamas?
- These aren't pajamas.
They're loungewear.
- Oh.
What do you want?
- I wanted to see you, fred.
- Really?
- I really wanted to apologize.
I just felt like I've been really mean, and I should have invited you to my party.
I'm really sorry.
- Don't worry, I'm totally over it.
- Well, I totally deserved to be barfed all over.
[laughter] - Want me to do it again?
[retches] - Nice.
- Apology accepted. - thank you.
So, can I come in?
- Like, into my house?
- I just thought we could hang out.
- And--and do what?
- I don't know.
I thought we could sing together.
- [sobbing] - Sing?
Me and you, like, together?
Singing?
Just--just hold on one second, okay?
- Sure.
- [screaming] - Oh, yeah, dude, rock on.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

'My business is not with you.
You have not craved a council of war.'
Then she turned toward the king's privy council and continued.
'No, it is with you. A council of war.'
It is amazing.
Councils of war have no value...

But a council of war when there is only one course'?'"
Big G had a head of flaming red--
No, make that orange hair.
The G stood for ginger.
A derogatory term for redheads.
Big G was easily a foot taller than anyone else in the school.
Even so, his head was still too big for his body.
And his ears too big for his head.
One might think in order to compensate...
...Big G might have been blessed with a handsome face.
After all, Clark Gable had big ears.
Lucille Ball had orange hair, yet for them, there was compensation.
Not so for Big G.

Cowardice and treachery) said Joan scornfully."
That's where we'll finish today.
Okay, so the last few minutes of class,
I wanna talk to you about your final project.
You'll be working in teams of two.
To make it fair and so each of you won't be picking your friend to work with...
...I have decided to pair you up myself.
Each team will receive one grade.
So you must work together.
Discover each ether's strengths and capitalize on them.
All right? Here we go.
Miss Tyler will be working with Mr. Wiley.
Miss Archer will be working with Mr. Valero.
Miss Katzman will be working with Miss Franz.
Mr. Nichol will be working with Mr. Minor.
All right, class, I would like to have it absolutely quiet. Please.
There's no reason for that kind of behavior.
I'll put this list up on the board so the rest can see who you're teamed with.
The assignment will be due at the end of the semester.
And I will see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Mr. Nichol?
I want you to know
I paired you with Stanley for a reason.
You're very fortunate, so please don't disappoint me.
Andrew?
Your thoughts?
Well, Mr. Simon, I just don't think
I'm the right partner for Big--
-I mean, Stanley.
-And why is that?
Well, he's a lot smarter than I am.
And I'm not a very good writer.
I could screw him up.
Well, I beg to differ from you, Andrew.
I find your writing fascinating.
You're a keen observer with a colorful perspective.
In fact, underneath the poor grammar and the atrocious spelling...
...I believe there lies the heart and soul of a great writer.
-Really?
-Really.
Do you enjoy writing?
Sort of. Sometimes.
The making-up-the-story part at least.
Well, if you enjoy something and you're good at it...
...then first you must define yourself as what you wanna be.
-I don't--
-Repeat after me.
I am a writer, that's what I am.
I am a writer, that's what I am?
Let's try that again. Stand up straight.
Shoulders back.
Deep breath.
I am a writer, that's what I am.
I am a writer, that's what I am.
Excellent. Now go, Andrew.
-And write.
-Yeah. Yes, sir.
Despite all that was so painful and humiliating in his life...
...Big G seemed to command respect.
No matter what, he maintained a certain nobility about him.
At least in the eyes of those few sensitive enough to look.
Unfortunately,
I was not one of those few.
It looks like he wet his pants.
Freak.
Oh, my God.
Everybody, Big G wet his pants.
-I want a sandwich.
-Sam, look at me.
If I ask my mom for an extra sandwich, she's gonna know somethings up.
-She gives me two as it is.
-Sandwich and candy bar.
Candy bar? Candy bar. Are you nuts?
My mom won't give me a candy bar no matter how many times you beat me up.
Hello? My dad's a dentist, remember?
Why don't you just cut off my arm and snack on that, Sam?
Go ahead, cut it off.
What are you doing?
Please, Sam, easy.
You've gotta work with me here.
This is counter-productive.
I'll do your homework.
-Hinkle does my homework. I'll take cash.
-Okay. Okay.
Cash is not a problem. Cash will work.
There you go.
-Hey, Nichol.
-Hey, Sam.
-Can't believe you paid him money,
-What part didn't you believe?
Part where I handed him money?
Gr the part where he had my underwear around my neck?
Sam's all bluff.
I mean, he's not actually gonna hurt you.
-Not like Ricky Brown.
-Is that right?
So I guess you were sick that day...
...Sam shoved my head into a toilet and broke my tooth.
Wait. Norman, hold on.
-Do you know where Big G is?
-Why? A little low on cooties?
Or you just wanna see if he really did wet his pants?
We're partners on a project for Mr. Simon's fourth period English.
We've gotta work together.
-Bet your friends got a big kick out of that.
-Shut up.
You don't even know how lucky you are,
Nichol.
Stanley's the smartest in the school, next to me.
Do you know where he is or not?
He's down in the corner waiting for his crotch to dry.
Hey, Nichol.
Stanley's my best friend.
He's not like anyone else.
Don't ....
Never mind.
Geek Corner. No Man's Land.
The Grand Canyon of Cooties.
It was referred to by many names.
One step into this dreaded ground and there would be no going back.
Big G.
-What is that?
-What?
My God, they're talking.
-When do you wanna work on the report'?
-What is he doing?
I don't have much time.
I go home right after school.
-I have stuff I have to do.
-We've gotta get it done somehow.
I know you don't wanna work on the report with me.
I can do the work and you can turn it in.
-Your friends don't have to know.
-My God.
I have a strong feeling
Mr. Simon would know.
We have to do it together.
My father was a good man.
He just wasn't very user-friendly.
He worked in computers and everything had to be done a certain way.
He was very good at computers.
But then again, computers came with a handbook.
Yo, hey. Andy, shut it off. Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Come here. A little quicker please?
I don't have all day.
Come here. Come here.
Look at this. Look at this.
You telling me you can't see this?
-I was gonna go back over it.
-You know what you are?
Know what you are? You're a jughead.
You know what a jughead is?
-Someone who's really stupid?
-No, buddy. You're not stupid.
A jughead is someone who just doesn't pay attention.
-Oh, okay.
-Now you can concentrate.
Do it right the first time, you don't have to again. Does that make sense to you?
-Yeah, but I was gonna--
-No. There's no but.
Either makes sense or doesn't make sense.
-There's no buts about it.
-Okay.
You watch me. I'll mow the lawn.
I'll show you what a lawn's supposed to look like.
Unbelievable.
He won't study after school, in the library, he works for his dad on the weekends.
The only place he'll study is in Geek Corner at lunch hour.
Geek Corner?
Yeah, that's where they hang out.
Who are they exactly?
You know, Big G and his friends.
Norman Grunmeyer, Karen Connor,
Stuart Hoffstetter.
Geek Corner?
Yeah, that's what they call it.
"They" again, Andy? isn't that what you just called it?
Yeah, but I didn't mean-- I didn't--
Did it occur to you that Stanley studies there...
...because that's the only place he feels comfortable?
How would you feel if everywhere people made fun of you and played tricks on you?
Ricky Brown makes fun of him every day.
He was squirting him with a water pistol so it made him look like he wet his pants.
Ricky Brown is a very cruel boy.
Stanley has suffered his whole life.
Why would God do that, Mom?
Make someone look like Big G?
So that everyone makes fun of him?
Maybe because God didn't see anything wrong with him in the first place.
And, Andy...
...his name is Stanley.
So how are you gonna get around the Big G thing?
There is no way around it.
There's always a way. Quit school.
Yeah, I could also kill myself.
Any other brilliant ideas?
-Could be worse, you know?
-How is that?
Ricky Brown could wanna kick your butt or something.
-True.
-Oh, hey.
Did you hear about Simon winning that car?
-What? No. A car?
-Yeah, there was a contest in the paper.
He had to write in 25 words how to save the world, or make peace, or whatever.
-Simon won.
-Cool.
Mr. Simon's a genius.
-What kind of car?
-Pontiac GTO.
Most bitching car ever made.
There she is.
Give it up, Nichol.
Hey, I can dream.
Mary Clear was e legend in her own time.
She had established herself as the make-out artist in the eighth-grade class.
Everybody who was anybody had made out with Mary Clear.
Everybody, that is, except me.
If Mary Clear was the most attractive girl in the school...
...then Karen Connor, one could argue, was the homeliest.
And the homeliest girl always had it worse than her male counterpart.
It's like, if the Elephant Man had an identical twin sister...
...somehow she would seem homelier.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
It's Cootie Connor.
Cootie Connor. I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Cootie Connor.
There was one and only one kid you would go to...
...if you contracted the dreaded cooties.
And that kid was Myron Stort.
The Stort was the resident expert on all things concerning cooties.
-Stort.
-Jason Freel needed Stort in a bad way.
Stort, you gotta help me, man.
I just ran right into Cootie Connor in the hallway. Full body contact.
Keep your distance.
Everybody out of here.
For your own protection.
Freel was like a leper crashing a hot tub party.
The only one who stood his ground was the Stort.
Knowing full well, he was the only one that could save Freel now.
-I need you, man. You gotta help me.
-Shut up, man.
This isn't gonna be easy, man.
Here's what you gotta do.
-You gotta touch her again.
-No, man. No way. I won't. I can't.
-There's gotta be another way.
-Shut up. Shut up.
There's only one way.
Touch her again and say the words:
From this, the cooties came
With this, the cooties shall remain
Freel, I'm losing you, man.
Stay focused.
Okay, okay.
-With this, the cooties came--
-From this.
From this, the cooties came
With this, the cooties shall remain
Okay, okay.
From this. From this. From this ....
-All right, I got it. Thanks. I owe you one.
-Hey, Freel. One last thing.
You gotta do it on her territory.
-Geek Corner?
-Yeah, Geek Corner.
Why don't you give Ricky Brown your lunch? Or do his homework?
-Cut some deal with him.
-Because it's not right.
Right? What does that have to do with getting our asses kicked?
Damn it, Stanley.
Why do you have to make things tough?
You shouldn't swear, Norman.
Do you mind? I'd like to get going.
Right, sorry. Didn't wanna keep you here any longer than you have to be.
I mean, it's pretty courageous of you risking terminal cooties.
-What are your buddies gonna think?
-I got news for you, Normie.
Even if you weren't a complete geek, people would beat the crap out of you.
Stanley, Jason Freel's got Karen.
From this, the cooties--
Freel recited the absolving incantation as he whipped Karen with his jacket.
He could not bring himself to actually touch hen but then who would know?
He could always say he did.
With this, they shall remain
With his feet dangling a foot off the ground, Jason Freel found religion.
-And prayed to the Lord Big G.
-Break his neck. No, no, wait.
Let me get some of his friends to watch, then break his neck.
No.
No.
Are you completely insane?
You had him.
You could have broken him in two.
I mean, you could have at least held him and I hit him with a brick or something.
Do you wanna work some more on the project?
Norman's right. I don't get it.
Why do you let guys like Freel and Ricky always make fun of you all the time?
I can't make them be nice people.
And even if I did, there'd be others that take their place.
If I had Big G's body,
I'd have kicked Freel's ass.
Then I'd have kicked Ricky Brown's ass just to cool down.
You probably thought it was funny.
No.
I didn't.
Screw it. So Freel beats me up.
He was probably gonna do that anyway.
I'm telling Mr. Simon.
Karen?
Karen, it's Mr. Simon.
Karen, I'm coming in, honey.
Please go away, Mr. Simon.
I'll be okay.
I'm gonna open the door, sweetheart.
Please go away.
No, I'm gonna open the door. it's okay.
Here. Give me your hand, sweetheart.
Come on.
Don't let them see you like this.
It's okay.
What happened to you?
Who did this to you?
The word had spread quickly that Mr. Simon was extremely upset.
And that it was quite possible
Jason Freel...
...would receive his final report card in federal prison.
Some of the cuts on Karen's arms and neck...
...made by the zipper from Mr. Freel's jacket...
...are deeper than first thought.
And she has been...
...sent to the doctors.
For anyone interested...
...this is how I won the car.
The newspaper contest to win the new car...
...asked contestants to find a solution to world peace...
...using 25 words or less.
Mr. Simon won it with just four.
I really don't feel much like teaching today.
It's a rather strange feeling.
I suggest if you have a book...
...now would be a good time to read.
And if you don't, well ....
Well, you should always have a book with you.
Can I help you with something, bud?
Sir, sorry. I kind of missed your porch.
-And I was just gonna put it on--
-You know, it's funny.
I've been watching you deliver your papers there.
-You've got a hell of an arm, by the way.
-Thank you.
But somehow you just seem to hit everybody's porch but mine.
You got any theories on that?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just a little tired by the time I get here or--
Daddy, dinner's ready.
Even in eighth grade, there was a lot more woman in Mary Clear...
...than any eighth grade boy could possibly know what to do with.
And I'm convinced she knew it.
Maybe that was part of the fun.
Hi, Mary. I just threw the paper and your dad was just ....
Well, I'll just give it ....
You know, there you go. Look ....
I promise I won't miss next time,
Mr. Clear.
-You gotta pace yourself, bud.
-Yeah.
Every Friday, I worked in the office during study hall.
I'd run copies of flyers to parents announcing an open house...
...or reminders about the up-coming car wash to raise money for the library.
Generally, whatever annoying little job
Mrs. Cranby, the assistant principal...
...affectionately known as Old Tuna Breath...
-. . . didn't feel like doing herself
-Andrew.
Wait till you see the talent show program
I've designed.
I've never had so much fun in my life.
If you could just run off 600 copies, we'll be all set.
We certainly have an interesting turnout this year.
It looks really nice, Mrs. Cranby.
Doris Gebben plays the upright bass?
Isn't that the huge one?
She's like 3 feet tall.
Yes, indeed. Tiny, but top notch.
I understand she's very good.
Wait. Mrs. Cranby, this can't be right.
What? Is something misspelled?
Big G is gonna...?
-He's gonna sing?
-Yes.
I don't get it.
Your life isn't miserable enough as it is?
You're gonna get up in front of the whole student body and sing?
-I love to sing.
-I've known you my whole life.
Never heard you sing. Not once.
-Since when do you love to sing?
-Ever since I can remember.
Look, maybe--
I don't know. Maybe Norman's right.
I have a right to sing, just like anybody else.
Don't you ever watch cop shows?
You have the right to remain silent.
You wanna sing? Do it in the shower.
Why don't you sing with a band?
Why sing by yourself?
I sing a cappella.
My voice is my instrument.
Oh, my God.
Why not just buy a gun and let Ricky Brown shoot you in the eye?
I knew you wouldn't understand.
That's why I didn't tell you.
What about us?
You sing in that stupid show...
...and it's gonna make it worse for the rest of us.
It doesn't matter what they do to us.
You said it yourself, Norman.
They'll probably just do it anyway.
I think you should sing if you want to.
I'm sorry, Norman, but I'm going to sing.
Damn it. Why do you have to make everything harder than it is?
-You shouldn't swear, Norman.
-Go to hell.
You deserve whatever you get.
I think he's just worried about you.
Come on. There's a few more minutes before the bell rings.
Hey, Andy.
Mary Clear likes you.
Mary Clear likes me?
That's what I said.
-Why?
-Why?
I don't know. She's pretty much gone steady with everybody else, so ....
She told you that she wanted to go steady with me?
Of course. She's my best friend.
She said she thinks you're cute and don't ask me why.
Let's just say that selection by process of elimination...
...lacked a certain romance...
...one might otherwise have found exciting...
...even at the age of 13.
At the end of every month,
I had to collect money...
...from all the customers on my route.
It was a task I relished for its simplicity...
...in what was becoming an increasingly complicated world.
Hit the porch and the customer was satisfied.
And a satisfied customer meant payoffs.
Ranging anywhere from cash tips to assorted snack foods.
Next stop, Mary Clear's house.
Regardless of her sudden and mysterious interest in me...
...coupled by the fact that I had yet to hit her porch...
...I wasn't expecting much.
Oh, hi, Andy. How's it going?
-Good. How's it going with you?
-Great.
Good.
So how's it going?
You asked me that already.
Oh, yeah.
-You said great, right?
-Yeah.
Okay, so is your mom or dad home?
I'm collecting for the paper.
Oh, yeah, here you go.
Okay, thanks.
Well ....
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
-All right, well, I gotta get going.
-Yeah, I'll see you at school.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'll see you.
Hey, Nichol.
You're collecting for the paper.
Why'd you have to do that, Ricky?
I didn't have to.
It was my treat. What's in the bag?
Don't get up. I'll just have to knock you back down again.
Chocolate chip.
My favorite. See you in school, Nichol.
So she paid you the money?
Yeah, which means Mary had to ask for the money in advance. It was a setup.
Barbara Foss wasn't blowing smoke.
Mary likes me.
And this is a bad thing?
I don't know. it's weird.
I'm no different than I was at the beginning of the year and--
I just--
I mean, I've never even talked to her.
What does that have to do with anything?
I don't know.
It just seems like it should.
You gonna kiss her?
Yeah. Of course, I'm gonna kiss her.
-Idiot.
-You know, she's a real good kisser.
How would you know? You're the only guy in the school that hasn't kissed her.
Yeah, right.
Like she made out with Big G.
I doubt it.
-He's probably up before you are.
-Shut up, Andy.
You and Big G are real bosom buddies now, huh?
You shut up.
I bet you never kissed a girl in your life, have you, Nichol?
Hey, Freel's back from suspension.
-I ran out, though.
-We'll find something.
Hey, Nichol.
How's that paper coming in Simon's class?
Okay.
Remember you told me Mr. Simon was your favorite teacher?
-Yeah.
-Still think so?
After he stuck you with Big G?
I don't know. I guess so.
I don't get you, Andy.
You know, my dad says Simon's a homo.
I had no idea what Modak meant.
But I sensed from his tone that this homo thing...
...was not something Mr. Simon should include on his résumé.
-Tell me something I don't know.
-So you're saying you like homos?
Yeah, right.
Take it easy, Andy.
Another thing you never do is believe a guy like Bruce Modak.
I decided to investigate the allegation myself
-Hey, Dyer.
-Yeah.
You knew Mr. Simon was a homo, right?
Where you been, Nichol?
I hear Simon's a homo?
Nichol, seriously? What's it like to go around with your head up your butt?
-Good afternoon, everyone.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Simon.
I have an announcement to make.
The car I won in the newspaper contest has arrived.
And I've asked Principal Kelner if I could give each of you a ride.
And she said yes.
The world I dream where black and white
Whatever race you be
Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free
Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy, like a pearl
Attends the needs of all mankind
Of such a world, I dream
So the poem's about not being prejudiced?
Well, Mr. Simon says we can pick only one word.
-It has to mean the same to us.
-What's wrong with prejudice?
-The poem's about being prejudiced.
-Yeah...
...but prejudice can mean different things to people.
-No, it can't.
-Sure, it can.
It would change depending if you ....
No one's prejudiced against you, so it's different for you than others.
So you're saying I'd have to be a Negro to understand it?
No, people are prejudiced for all kinds of reasons.
Negroes just happen to be one of the majors.
Okay, so you got a better word?
How about tolerance?
Tolerance?
Okay. Now, why does that work?
I looked it up.
"Sympathy or indulgence...
...for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one's own.
Gr the act of allowing something to be different."
So the guy in the poem dreams of a world...
...where people let each other be different?
Yeah, that's why tolerance is such a great word.
It's not even saying you have to like the other person.
It's just saying leave them alone.
Okay. So now we write a short story about being tolerant?
Yeah.
I told you never to come in my room again, you little freak.
No, no, no.
No, no, no. I forgot. I swear.
I swear I forgot.
I wanna ask a question.
I'll clean your room for a week.
What?
Could a teacher get fired if he's a homo?
Definitely. Now get out.
-One more question.
-One more week, freak.
Okay.
What exactly is a homo?
The whole house smells like a glue factory.
You're using too much glue again, aren't you?
Well, I want it to stick.
It'll stick with less glue.
Come here, I'll do it. You watch.
Come on, move over. Move.
I almost had it, Dad.
You did not. You did not have it.
Just watch and learn.
-Where are the directions? Right here?
-Yeah.
Have you read these?
-Beginning to end before you started?
-Yeah.
See, look at that.
You were using too much glue.
The directions say you can take off extra glue with a razor blade.
Gr you could just do it right the first time then you don't have that trouble.
Come on, pal.
You'll end up cutting your finger off.
That'd be bad, right?
Look, you got a mess here.
I have some homework to finish.
If you have homework to finish, you shouldn't even be doing this.
You know better.
The holiday was tapped a Lunar New Year.
For the first time, the Vietcong invaded the cities in force...
-. . .including Saigon. . ..
-Did you finish homework?
-Yeah.
-A suicide attack into the grounds...
-...of the American Embassy.
-Mom?
Did kids go steady when you were in the eighth grade?
Yeah, Andy.
Even in the old days.
What was it like?
It's pretty much always been the same.
I think the only things that really change are the clothes and the music.
American Marines were surrounded and under siege.
Why?
-Are you thinking about going steady?
-No.
No, I'm just, you know, wondering if it ever comes up.
So was it fun or did it make you nervous?
I seem to remember it as being pretty fun.
I mean, and a little nerve-racking.
It doesn't last long, though.
At least not in eighth grade.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
I'm gonna go see if Dad's finished my model yet.
Andy?
Make sure you wear that deodorant
I bought you everyday, okay?
-Why? Do I smell?
-Oh, no, no. I just ....
You never know when it's gonna start.
And you just don't want it to start at the wrong time, right?
Yeah. Sure, Mom.
One more question.
What's a homo?
The other kids know about this?
Yeah, they do.
I was afraid to talk about it at first.
Then I heard other kids talking about it, and I thought I better say something.
You did right telling me this.
-Hey, you didn't tell him, did you?
-Of course.
Did you want him to find out from the other kids?
That's how everyone else finds out.
Why should our kid be different?
He asked me.
What else was I supposed to do?
You could tell him he's not old enough to know.
The kids at school are talking about it.
Hey, do we know if it's true?
No.
You know how kids start these rumors.
Well, do we know if it's not true?
I don't know that we want someone like that teaching our kid.
He's the best teacher that school has.
People talk about it like it's a contagious disease.
Stop it, you don't know how someone becomes something like that.
The whole country is going to hell in a handbasket.
Hippies protesting the Vietnam War.
And now, what now?
Now we got homosexuals teaching our kids.
Teachers are role models, Sherri.
They look up to him.
Have you thought about that?
They look up to him because he's a wonderful teacher.
Not because of what he does in his bedroom at night.
Why do you even gotta talk like that?
Oh, the whole thing is absurd.
Fine, fine. Okay, it's absurd.
I tell you, I, for one, am gonna monitor the situation...
...until I know exactly what the hell is going on.
May I have the pillow please?
Thank you.
Good night.
When my mother explained to me what a homosexual was...
...she thankfully spared me the technicalities.
My father was right.
I wasn't ready.
The more conventional male-female approach was still relatively new to me.
She said a homosexual was capable of a deeper love...
...for another man than a woman.
And she assured me that it had absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Simon 's character.
And insisted he was still the best teacher
I would probably ever have.
And that was all that mattered.
Count is now one and one with two outs.
Runner at first.
Swings at the first pitch, and fouls it deep back into the stands behind ....
Turn the game off, Ed. We need to talk.
-How about later?
-No.
NOW, Ed.
Okay, kids. Once around the block.
Mr. Simon?
This is the coolest car ever made.
-Yeah, it is pretty cool, isn't it?
-Yes.
Hey, Nichol. Where have you been?
-Sorry.
-The car is unbelievable.
Yeah. Maybe you can get in line with your pal pumpkin head over there.
Looks like you two just can't get enough of each other.
Good Simon has a convertible.
-I don't think freako's head would fit.
-Shut up, Ricky.
Maybe you wanna ride with them, Mary.
You, Nichol, Cro-Magnon man.
-Maybe I will.
-Look, Dan...
...I can't go anyway.
That's what I came to tell you.
Old Tuna Breath's got me doing work in the office...
...so I'll see you later.
With all due respect, Mr. Freel, that is a very dangerous accusation.
A man's reputation is at stake.
I hope you have some proof.
I've got my boy's word.
He says it's all over school.
You've got a real problem with a teacher.
You need to do something about that.
You are talking about a man who was voted...
...the California Teacher of the Year last year...
...and nominated many years before that.
Just because he's won some awards doesn't mean that he's not some pervert.
That thing is a sickness...
...and sooner or later, it's gonna take over other parts of his life.
It's human nature.
That assumption is completely unfounded.
Mr. Freel, sir.
I have known Mr. Simon for 12 years now...
...and there has never been so much as a hint of an impropriety.
Sometimes these things take a while to fester.
Mr. Simon is a widower.
His wife passed away many years ago.
Now, I heard that they can sometimes get married to cover their tracks.
It might explain why he never remarried.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you.
I am gonna talk to Mr. Simon...
...and see if there was some kind of misunderstanding...
...that can make sense of Jason's claims.
And I can guaran-damn-tee that if this guy isn't dealt with in a hurry...
...there will not be a parent in this school that doesn't know about what's going on.
-I'll go to the papers if I have to.
-Please, sir.
Please don't do anything until I have had a chance to look into it myself.
You've got 48 hours.
And excuse me if my son...
...isn't in this guy Simon's class in the meanwhile.
That's your prerogative, Mr. Freel.
Meanwhile, back on my march...
...toward understanding the mysteries of impending manhood...
...it occurred to me going steady with Mary Clear...
...could provide some much-needed insight.
Hey, anybody seen Modak?
That's if I could bluff my way through it without totally humiliating myself
I needed an ID bracelet.
And I needed it fast.
Among his many other talents, Modak was also known as the school hustler.
Every school and prisoner of war camp has one.
A guy who knows the angles and can get anything you want.
For the right price, of course.
-Modak?
-Nichol.
-I need an ID bracelet.
-I can help you with that.
Look, I don't have anything with Andy on it, but I got a couple blanks.
Get your name on it at Sears for five bucks.
Blank's okay. it's the thought that counts.
I don't have the money anyway.
-Then why am I talking to you?
-I thought maybe you'd trade.
-That can work. What you thinking?
-Baseball cards?
-Vintage?
-'52 Mantle rookie card.
-Condition?
-Excellent. Still smells like bubblegum.
I'll take three and we're done.
What? Modak, that's ridiculous.
Three's all I got.
-That's way too many. Are you kidding?
-Hey, relax. I don't make the rules.
Actually, I guess I do make the rules.
So take it or leave it.
Okay. I'll bring them tomorrow.
I trust you.
So who's the lucky girl?
Mary Clear.
You might have a problem with that.
Because that's the one I gave her when we went steady.
I'll have to take my chances.
-Pleasure doing business.
-That was maybe a 10-dollar bracelet.
Hey, give Mary my best.
She's a good kid.
And today, those Mantle rookie cards are worth about $100,000.
The trip through that dark tunnel from boy to man...
...does not come without great expense.
-Stephen?
-Evelyn, hi. What's up?
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt your free period, but something came up...
...and I thought we should deal with it as soon as possible.
PTA drive fall short again for the 12th year?
No, it's ....
It is awkward.
Frankly, I'm embarrassed to come to you with this, but I don't have any choice.
Ev? What are we talking about here?
Well...
...Jason Freel.
Yeah?
You know how children are.
And, actually, he insists--
Apparently, there's a rumor...
...that's going around the school that you're...
...a homosexual.
This is so embarrassing for me to come to a man of your ....
Well, you know how much I respect you.
-A homosexual?
-Yes.
This whole misunderstanding stems from the Karen Connor incident.
Some active revenge on Jason's part.
But, unfortunately, he's already gone to his mother and father.
Ev, it's okay. Just take a breath.
Mr. Freel insists, unless something is done...
...he is going to tell the other parents and the papers.
According to him, this is a fact.
It's funny.
Suddenly I feel a great deal of empathy for young Jason.
As soon as I can say that you deny it, well, that's good enough for me.
And when you do deny it, if that's not enough for him...
...then I will stand right beside you and fight.
They see a man like you.
Unmarried, single all these years.
You know how people are...
...and they just take a situation and they blow it up for no reason.
I guess ....
I guess I just don't know how my private life has any bearing...
...on my ability as a teacher.
Shouldn't the work just stand for itself?
Yes, of course.
But this isn't about that.
I think it is.
No.
No, it isn't.
This would be so much easier...
...if you would just deny it and we could move forward.
Are you denying that you're a homosexual?
I'm not going to justify that question with an answer.
I am 57 years old, Ev.
I have been a teacher most of my life.
I will not compromise who or what I am...
...for the likes of Jason Freel.
Gr his parents.
I'm sorry.
It took maybe 30 seconds for word of Mary Clear and my impending union...
...to cover the school grounds like a suffocating fog.
If only our fire drills were that organized.
Andy Nichol is gonna ask Mary Clear to go steady.
Even the Blue Angels don't fly with that kind of precision anymore.
There would be no turning back now.
Hey, Nichol.
Come here.
I'll be back in a second.
-Hey. You a geek now?
-Back off, Taylor.
Make me.
-What?
-it's all over school, man.
-What?
-What do you mean "what'?"
You and Mary Clear.
Ricky Brown's looking for you, man.
He's pissed. He still likes her.
-Then why did he break up with her?
-You didn't know?
She actually broke up with him.
Did I neglect to mention
Mary's last and longest relationship...
...was with Ricky Brown?
Of course, I had assumed he broke up with her.
Nobody would be crazy enough to stand up to Ricky Brown.
I did not know that.
-Mrs. Freel?
-If you're selling something...
-...we're not interested.
-Oh, no.
I'm the principal from Jason's school,
Evelyn Kelner.
-You wanna talk to my husband?
-Yes, please.
He's out back. Come on in.
Thank you.
I'm just not sure that you understand the kind of man that Stephen Simon is.
I mean, I have never ever worked with a better person...
...or a better teacher in my entire career.
Did he deny it?
Well, he felt--
And actually, I support him on this.
He couldn't understand...
...why his record as a teacher wouldn't stand on its own.
Fancy way of saying he didn't deny it.
What did you expect him to do? Admit it?
This isn't about his teaching ability.
We'll give him that.
It's about kids looking up to him like he's some kind of example...
...on how to live.
We have a moral obligation. it's in the Bible.
You know he was taking kids for rides in his car?
I gave him permission.
He had won a new car.
He was just treating the children.
I guess we'll know who to point the finger at on that one, won't we?
Now, you listen to me.
Your son brutally whipped a defenseless young girl...
...because he thought that she was ugly.
He thought by touching her, it would rub off on him.
Now you're afraid he might look up to a kind, wonderful man like Stephen Simon?
I'm not saying what my boy did to that girl was right.
I whipped his ass real good for what he did.
But that's all he is. He is just a boy.
He doesn't know any better.
I am not sure what I have accomplished coming here.
But I am begging you, please, reconsider.
You would be doing the children of this community a great disservice.
You know better, don't you?
You know he's a homo.
No. I don't know if he's homosexual or not.
And frankly, I don't care.
My guess is this community will care...
...and they won't appreciate you condoning it.
I'll see myself out.
Thank you, Mrs. Freel.
What if they don't let Mr. Simon teach anymore?
Oh, I certainly hope that doesn't happen.
Listen, I don't think we should get wound up over this...
...until we know exactly what's going on.
Your father's right, Andy.
They had a thing in the old days called Salem witch hunt...
...where people got all wound up before they knew what the facts were.
Oh, and let's not forget Joe McCarthy.
He got so wound up he's still spinning.
What about you, Andy?
You ever see Mr. Simon do anything weird?
-What do you mean by weird?
-Look, Jim, he's a little young.
No. Sure he's gonna hear this stuff, just like you said.
Better we deal with it here and now.
Andy...
...did you ever see Mr. Simon...
...touch a boy...
...in a place...
...that he should not?
Jim, what are you doing?
Just answer the question, son.
No. Never.
Okay.
Good.
Dinner was good.
I'm gonna go to the garage.
He is not gonna let go of this.
They feel they have a moral obligation.
Fascinating.
He even went so far as to threaten me.
To think this man can ruin reputations...
...that we have spent years building with absolutely no evidence.
My God.
I'm the first woman principal in the county.
I'm trying to put two kids through college.
-I just don't think that--
-Evelyn. Evelyn, please.
I won't let this happen.
Please, Stephen. Just deny it.
For the children's sake.
I don't care if it's true or not.
Please, just deny it.
It's for the sake of the children that I won't deny it.
True or not.
Mr. Nichol.
You missed your chance for a ride.
Mr. Simon, you're gonna sell it?
-I'm afraid so.
-Why?
-This is the coolest car I've ever seen.
-Unfortunately, teaching's a labor of love...
...not of economic reward.
Couldn't you, like, rent it out or something when you're not using it?
Very entrepreneurial of you, Andrew.
But, you know,
I don't really think this car is my style.
It would be better if I sold it to someone a little hipper, perhaps.
Here, let me help you.
What are the boxes for?
It's not long before summer vacation.
Thought I'd get a head start.
Don't you keep most of the stuff in the classroom?
Normally, yeah. But as it turns out,
I won't be here next year.
-Why?
-Well, I have a sister in Florida...
...and I haven't been able to spend time with her.
I thought I might enjoy the change.
You better hurry up.
Don't wanna be late for homeroom.
Thanks.
Mr. Simon 's not coming back next year.
So? We won't be here anyway.
It seems weird that somebody like
.Jason Freel could get Mr. Simon to quit.
They're both freaks if you ask me.
There's no proof Mr. Simon's a homo.
Then why is he leaving?
Maybe the class could pitch in and get him a present or something.
Like what?
I don't know. I don't know what he likes.
My dad says they're like women.
They like flowers and crap like that.
We should've known Simon was a homo when he told us about that ballet.
He might as well just stamp a big homo sign on his forehead.
All I know is, homo or not...
...if you ask anyone in class who their favorite teacher is...
...it would be Mr. Simon.
Except Freel, maybe.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
At least he was until this homo thing.
Get up, Nichol. Take a walk, Rains.
See you after school, Andy.
-Look, Ricky, whatever--
-You're gonna ask Mary Clear...
...to go steady with you?
Not if you don't want me to.
I don't want you to.
After I pound your face in,
Mary's gonna think you're too ugly...
-...to go steady with.
-Hey, leave him alone.
Who's gonna make me, freak?
No one can see us, Ricky.
Just walk away and nobody will know.
Nobody will believe it.
-What about you, Nichol?
-Nothing. It never happened.
You tell anybody about this or go near Mary, I'll kill you.
Yeah.
I'm gonna get you real bad for this.
With the clock ticking down to the end of school year...
...I figured if I could just keep a low profile,
I could get out with my dignity intact.
But Mary Clear would not be denied.
It had begun.
And as far as I knew, nothing, short of running for your life, could stop it.
Mary was in the preliminary phase of what was referred to as the hover ritual.
This was e technique in which the female...
...would travel in ever tightening circles around her prey, enticing him to strike...
...so that he would actually think that he was the aggressor...
...thereby insuring his delicate male ego would remain intact.
I wasn't fooled.
I had to get out and get out fast.
Hi, Andy. I didn't see you.
Yeah. Sorry.
I instantly started to sweat like a pig.
She noticed, but mercifully pretended not to.
So...
-...how you doing?
-Good.
So how are you doing?
She noticed I was making an idiot out of myself again...
...but, forgiving beyond all reason, pretended not to.
-Barbara said you wanted to see me.
-She did?
She said you wanted to ask me something.
It was at that moment that I realized just how bad I wanted to kiss Mary Clear.
So bad, in fact, that I forgot about Ricky Brown...
...and the cruel ways he might kill me if I did.
-You wanna go steady?
-You got an ID bracelet?
Yeah.
She studied the bracelet as if trying to estimate its fair market value.
You bought this from Bruce Modak, didn't you?
Yeah.
-It cost me three Mantle rookie cards.
-She wasn't impressed then.
But I 'll bet she's reeling now.
How many women possess a $100,000 ID bracelet...
-. . .in their junk drawer?
-Okay.
Meet me at the end of the tunnel at 3.
Don't be late. My bus leaves at 3:15.
"When only the dwarf and the paladin were left, they would not give up...
...but stood their ground stoutly.
A pair of steel towers streaked and splashed with blood...
...and where the axe of one fell, and the sword of the other...
...an enemy gasped and died.
And so fighting, loyal to their duty to Joan, good simple souls..."
As Mr. Simon read from Joan of Arc,
I, unfortunately, could not enjoy it.
Instead, I spent the time trying desperately to remember...
...all the great kissing scenes
I had watched in movies.
Focusing on fundamentals, I imagined how Cary Grant might kiss Mary Clear.
That turned out to be discouraging...
...because Cary Grant and Mary Clear looked really good together.
And I suddenly felt more inadequate than I did before.
"'The Maid of Orleans taken.
Joan of Arc a prisoner.
The savior of France lost to us.'
And would keep saying that over as if they couldn't understand how it could be.
Gr how God could permit it, poor creatures."
Perfect. We'll finish the last chapter on the last day of class. Class dismissed.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I will need all of the final team projects on my desk before you leave.
And remember, tonight is the talent show.
I want complete attendance.
No excuses to the contrary.
Thank you.
Mr. Nichol.
I look forward to your and Stanley's report.
Yes, sir.
I spent sixth period P. E. class trying desperately not to sweat...
-...for Mary's sake.
-Come on, Nichol, hustle up, would you?
This whole body odor issue had begun to consume me.
It occurred to me if God created man in his own image...
...did that mean that he too used deodorant?
Or did he simply add sweat and body odor to us...
...so he'd be the only guy without sweat rings...
...when the world was coming to an end.
It was time.
I moved with purpose and yet it was clear that my mind was not in control.
My body, governed by some force, previously unknown to me...
...was calling the shots.
This, despite the fact that it was my body and not my mind...
...that Ricky Brown would ultimately beat unmercifully.
Hey, Nichol.
We running workups after school today?
-No.
-We've been planning this for a week.
Seriously? Nichol.
I walked quickly.
Not because I was anxious so much as I was extremely intimidated by Mary...
...and didn't went to upset her.
She commended respect.
After all, at a time when every move a young boy makes...
...breaks some personal sexual boundary,
Mary Clear was like a beacon of light.
Even the other girls respected her.
After a boy made out with Mary they could rest easy...
...in that boy's firm embrace, knowing one of them knew what he was doing.
Andy.
Where you going?
Bike rack's the other way.
Thanks for all the help today, Dan.
Now I know who my friends are.
I'm your friend, Andy, but I'm not a moron.
What was I supposed to do?
Get beat up with you?
That makes no sense at all.
Would you be friends with a moron?
Forget it. I'll see you later.
Where are you going?
To meet Mary Clear.
Are you insane?
Ricky Brown will kill you.
I know. But I can't stop myself.
Finally, up ahead,
I approached the tunnel.
Mary would be waiting on the other side.
You lost, Nichol?
They say your life flashes before your eyes prior to death...
...but that didn't happen to me.
I took it as a good sign.
All I could think was how painful it felt when Ricky punched me in the stomach.
And that was just a warning.
-Let him go, Ricky.
-Shut up, Mary. This ain't your business.
You let him go or I'll tell Principal Kelner who stole $32 in quarters...
...out of the Pepsi machine.
You're the luckiest butt wipe, Nichol.
First, a freak bails you out. Now a girl?
Am I gonna have to fight your mother next?
I bet the house on my mother, Ricky.
You'll be alone next time, Nichol.
I promise.
Having cheated death once more,
I marched on.
At this point, I wasn't sure who I feared most...
...Ricky Brown or Mary Clear.
Whoever chose this particular spot to make out...
...knew a lot more about symbolism than most eighth graders.
Although no one knew the origin of said tradition...
...my guess is that it was Mary Clear herself
She alone would understand its meaning.
Hi.
We're gonna have to do this after the talent show. Bus is leaving in one minute.
Meet me back here.
Doris, have you seen Big G?
Yeah, I passed him sitting out in the parking lot.
Thank you.
Stanley?
Hello.
You know that time Ricky Brown was squirting you with a water pistol?
Yeah.
I should have done something.
I should have tried to help you...
...and I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Are you scared?
Yes.
I think you may be the bravest guy I know.
Gr the craziest.
Yeah.
Did Norman come?
I don't know, but I'm sure he will.
Yeah. it's funny.
The smallest kid in school protecting the biggest.
Yeah.
I'll see you after the show.
Yeah.
See you after the show.
I wanna thank everyone for this marvelous turnout.
The children have worked very hard.
And I think you'll be surprised at the wonderful variety...
...of different acts that we have for you tonight.
Our first act is Doris Gebben...
...who will play a lovely Beethoven piece on the standup bass.
Doris?
Wait, wait. Sorry.
As Doris droned on...
...I searched the crowd for Norman, but he was nowhere to be found.
I knew how much it meant to Stanley for him to be there, so ....
Let's hurry.
-Collecting for the paper?
-How come you're not at the show?
-Why aren't you?
-He wanted to know if you were there.
When I didn't see you, I just came here.
You know those western movies where bad guys are gonna hang the good guy?
But the posse shows up to save the good guy just in time?
-Yeah.
-Well, I guarantee you...
...there's no posse out looking to save Stanley.
He'll feel bad if you're not there.
I don't know why he does it.
He just won't give in, no matter what they do to him.
He'll be on soon.
I just don't wanna see their faces.
I don't wanna hear them laugh.
Look, If he's brave enough to do it...
...you should be brave enough to be there for him.
I mean, maybe ....
-Maybe we're the posse.
-You don't know what it's like.
No, but I do know you and Stanley are best friends.
-Besides, maybe he can really sing.
-Yeah, sure.
And maybe they'll vote me king of the prom.
You know, you were right about him.
He's not like anyone else.
My mom says Stanley has something most people will never have.
Stanley has dignity.
Yeah.
Well, I gotta get back.
Next up is Janet Piccolo who will twirl her baton...
...to the stirring
"Stars and Stripes Forever."
Janet
There you go.
Hey.
Hello, Norman.
Good luck.
Thanks for coming.
You okay?
Yeah, I think so.
-I'll see you after the show.
-Okay.
Just-- Can you tell me why you think you have to do all this?
Because, Norman, I'm a singer.
That's what I am.
Okay.
Well, that was certainly interesting.
For our next act...
...please welcome Tommy Kenner and his swinging drum solo.
He's after Kenner.
I didn't know he played drums. Gotta be doing something in his spare time.
-He doesn't study.
-The guy can hardly walk and chew gum.
Maybe he'll stink and Stanley won't seem so bad in comparison.
Holy crap. If Kenner could read as well as he plays drums, he'd be president.
He doesn't stink nearly enough.
Let the hanging begin.
My goodness gracious.
That certainly was something.
All right. All right. All right, folks.
Calm down.
Our show isn't over yet.
For our last act of the show...
...Stanley Minor will sing a composition, which he wrote himself.
He wrote his own song?
"Go Ahead and Dream."
If I was really his friend,
I would've killed him by now.
Despite Norman 's passionate prayers,
Big G walked out on the stage.
Tall, straight and proud.
Like a man who had every right to be there.
Excuse me, everyone.
Excuse me.
If we could all give Stanley our undivided attention, please?
He will be singing without accompaniment.
And we need it to be absolutely quiet.
You try and throw that tomato, Ricky,
I'm gonna stop you.
You don't have the balls, Nichol.
Now you don't have the balls.
Have you had a bowel movement today?
Obviously, you're suffering from gas pains.
Tomatoes will do that to you.
Boys, would you help Ricky out of the gym?
He's not feeling well and, you know, the show must go on.
Everything's fine, folks.
Let us all keep quiet, please...
...and give Mr. Minor our undivided attention.
Thank you.
Good job.
Stanley, go.
He's not bad.
He's no Tommy Kenner, but he's not bad.
No, he's just--
Brave.
Big G had a very nice voice.
If his voice had been great, it would have made it all so easy.
The crowd would have stood and cheered him, a thundering ovation.
But such was not Stanley Minor's lot in life.
Look at his face. Look how happy he is.
But, oh, did he sing with passion.
The joy freedom brings.
Damn, he's got guts.
You shouldn't swear, Norman.
With all the excitement, I had almost forgotten about my date with Mary.
Postponing destiny had only managed to drive my anxiety even higher.
There was one distinct advantage, however.
This time, I would enter the tunnel, not under the protection of Mary Clear...
...but after having dealt with Ricky Brown on my own.
Hi, Andy.
Hi, Mary.
She stood still, allowing me the first advance.
She held the faint wisps of my tender male ego in her hand...
...and I could only hope that she would caress them gently.
So how are you doing?
No, no.
Let's forget that.
So can I kiss you?
Sure.
Finally. I leaned in and kissed.
Oh, no. The last moment, I chickened out and kissed her on the cheek.
Appalling display of cowardice, she would've been right...
...to run around the school laughing her head off
You've never made out before, have you?
Male ego being what it is,
I might have lied to save face...
...but Mary seemed all-knowing somehow.
-Besides, who was I kidding?
-No.
Would you like me to teach you?
Yes. I'd like that very much.
And so she did.
Slowly, carefully...
...handling me as if I were a mound of clay...
...molded by the artist's tender touch.
She turned what might have been a scarring boyhood memory...
...into the sweetest of recollections.
And for that, I would always be grateful.
What's with the stopwatch?
Oh, I like to time each kiss.
The record is one minute and 16 seconds.
-Can I ask who holds the record?
-Ricky Brown.
Figures.
Well, if it helps, I can hold my breath underwater for a minute and a half.
That should help.
"l have finished my story of Joan of Arc...
...that wonderful child, that sublime personality...
...that spirit which, in one regard, has had no peer and will have none.
With Joan of Arc, love of country was more than a sentiment.
It was a passion.
She was the genius of patriotism.
Love, mercy, charity, fortitude, war, peace, poetry, music.
These may be symbolized as any shall prefer.
By figures of either sex and of any age...
...but a slender girl in her first young bloom...
...with the martyr's crown upon her head...
...and in her hand the sword that severed her country's bonds.
Shall not this, and no other, stand for patriotism...
...through all the ages until time shall end?"
Okay.
It really is a beautiful book, isn't it?
I hope you've all enjoyed it.
All right, I have your papers here.
Your final team papers.
And I would like to say, all in all...
...that each team did a marvelous job.
Congratulations to all of you.
I would like each team to pick up your paper on the way out.
But before that, I just wanna tell you...
...I have very much enjoyed our time together this year.
And I wish each and every one of you all the best of luck...
...as you enter high school next fall.
Class dismissed.
Here you go.
-Very nice.
-Thank you.
In case you're wondering...
...Mary Clear and I went steady for five weeks.
Her longest relationship to that point.
It was a torrid affair.
Kissing became even more enjoyable...
. . . when I discovered it was all right to breathe.
This was just wonderful.
Boys, you did a good job.
-Thank you, Mr. Simon.
-Thank you.
And as for Mr. Simon ....
Wow, thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I am as proud of you two boys as any students I've ever had.
And I mean that.
And I wish you both a wonderful summer...
...and a wonderful life.
What are you gonna do now,
Mr. Simon?
Well, I'll find someplace to teach, of course.
I am a teacher.
That's what I am.
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye, Stanley.
-Goodbye, Andrew.
-Goodbye, sir. Thank you.
Stanley and I lost touch...
...when he moved away in our sophomore year in high school.
I can assure you, his suffering did not end in the eighth grade.
Nevertheless, I know whatever hardships were thrust upon him...
...he handled them with dignity.
He's coming.
As for me, well, I am a writer.
That's what I am.
Against the wall. Against the wall.
And with my pen, I can create a world where brave men like Stanley Minor...
...are exalted as the standard by which we all measure ourselves.
A world where Karen Connor will Ht the glass slipper.
And Norman Grunmeyer is voted King of the Prom.
A world where the equation human dignity plus compassion...
...equals peace.
All right, all right, one, two, three.
Goodbye, Mr. Simon.
Thank you.
Thank you. Yeah.
Best teacher ever. Yeah.
Thank you.
Mr. Simon, you're the best. The best.
Hey, Stanley.
See you around.
See you around, Andy.
The last week of eighth grade was memorable for many reasons...
...not the least of which were those glorious make-out sessions with Mary.
But knowing
I would never see Mr. Simon again...
...haunted me.
There was still one question that had to be answered.
Mr. Simon?
Hello? Mr. Simon?
Can I help you, Mr. Nichol?
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-it's okay.
I'm glad you dropped by.
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-No, sir, thank you.
I just wanted to ask you a question.
My wife, yes.
Mystery solved?
Oh, no, sir.
Well, yeah, I guess that too.
Here, have a seat.
So where is she?
She passed away.
Nineteen years ago today, in fact.
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, well, a little sappy, I'm afraid.
As a writer, it would do you well to avoid melodrama in your work.
I suppose I loved her too much.
-Does that help you, Andrew?
-No.
Well, I mean, I don't care about that.
That's not why I came.
Oh, really?
Well, you've got me intrigued.
What is it?
I just wanted to know.
When you assigned me to work with Stanley, why'd you pick me?
You said there was a reason.
Well...
...I believe that life is about timing, opportunity, and choices.
It was an opportunity at the right time...
...for a wonderful young man like you to make the right choice.
And I knew you weren't ready to do that.
But I didn't want you to miss it.
But how did you know it would work?
How did you know that I could do it?
I didn't.
But sometimes, you just need someone to tell you that you can.
I'm not sure that I fully understood it then, but it did occur to me...
...that somewhere in that marvelous pile of books Mr. Simon cherished...
...there was a manual called How to Be a Teacher...
...written by Mr. Simon.
Andy, Andy. Shut it off. Come on.
Shut it Off. Shut it Off.
Come on.
Now, how many times have I told you?
You have to use the wheel grooves as a guide to show where you left off.
-Here, I'll show you.
-No, no, no.
What do you mean no?
I'm mean,
I'm gonna finish the lawn, Dad.
I'll go over it again and catch anything I missed.
That's just the way I do it.
Once one way and another against the grain.
Like at the ballpark or like a Checkerboard.
Look, I like to do it, Dad.
I like to mow the lawn.
I like the way it looks and smells.
And I'm gonna finish it, my way.
Then once I'm done, if I've still left a spot you can call me a jughead.
But, please, just let me finish.
Okay.
Fair enough.
LEGO The Adventure of Clutch Powers biarcool- thx-to-phan1978
KJELD: Clutch, you can't go after the power crystals by yourself
It's too dangerous.
We, re sending reinforcements.
No thanks, Kjeld.
I work alone.
Glad nobody saw that.
Power crystals.
Whoa!
That's big enough to power LEGO City for a whole year.
Whoa.
Rock Monsters.
Why does it have to be Rock Monsters?
Oh, no.
The Mine Mech.
(NERVOUSLY) Come on, come on.
Whoa.
Time to get creative. Hmm.
Okay. Oh?
Uh-oh.
Perfect.
Uh-oh.
A baby?
Oh, no. This changes everything.
Shh. You'll be okay.
Good baby Rock Monster.
Is this your baby?
Looks just like you.
I'm sorry. l didn't know.
I just wanted one of your crystals.
Thisis Air 7 with a Clutch Powers sighting.
Hey, Clutch, thanks for helping us catch the crook.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Hey, look, it's Clutch Powers.
BOY 2: Hey, Clutch.
BOY 3: Looking good, Clutch.
Hey, Clutch Powers, can we go with you?
We're on our way to a four-alarm fire.
Come on!
Clutch Powers.
Watch out, Clutch!
Watch out!
Clutch Powers.
What's going on, Clutch?
Hey, Clutch.
Clutch, over here.
Welcome to LEGO headquarters.
You'll make great explorers one day.
Clutch.
Kjeld. l got the crystal.
You're late.
You're welcome.
I came as soon as
I got your signal.
Mmm-hmm.
The others made it on time.
What others?
Brick Masterson. Firefighter.
Weapons specialist. Demolitions expert.
S'up?
G'day.
Peg Mooring.
Biologist.
Single-handedly discovered 12 new species of marine life.
Thirteen, actually.
Ever so pleased to meet you.
Yours, love?
Bernie Von Beam.
The LEGO team's most brilliant engineer.
Hallo.
Hi, everyone. l'm...
Well, you're
Clutch Powers, of course.
Possibly the greatest
LEGO explorer ever.
They know who you are, Clutch.
Everyone knows who you are.
What about me?
Does everyone know me?
So, that's your team.
Wow. Pretty impressive.
But I work alone.
As do l.
Yep. Alone.
I work well with others.
Why does he get to be team leader, anyway?
Because.
Because why?
Because he didn't blow up a whole city block on his last mission.
Okay. I'm just asking.
What's gotten into all of you?
Have you all lost sight of the LEGO mission?
Have you forgotten what this organization represents?
Well, it's about helping others.
Fighting the good fight.
Engineering better solutions.
Doing whatever it takes, wherever it takes us.
And how do we do all that?
We build on each other.
It's something l learned from your father.
Yeah, that sounds like him.
He always talked a good game.
I brought you here because we've got a problem on Planet X-4.
The prison planet?
The Space Police lnterstellar Supermax
Correctional Facility, to be more specific.
It holds just three prisoners, the three most vicious criminals in the entire galaxy.
Two days ago, we received a garbled distress call from the Watch Commander.
WATCH COMMANDER:
The prisoners are escaping.
We need help.
KJELD: Then we lost communication with them entirely.
WATCH COMMANDER: Hurry.
What happened?
Prison break?
That's what l need you to find out.
Come on. We have a spaceship ready for you.
Oh. Hey, hey! Hey!
Yes, Brick?
Do l get to blow something up?
It's possible.
I guess it depends on what we find.
It's a bit of a mystery.
Yuck!
I hate mysteries.
I like mysteries.
Clutch Powers?
The Clutch Powers?
And you are?
Your biggest fan.
"A. Fol"?
Arthur. My friends call me Artie.
You can, too.
Call me Artie.
Or be my friend.
Right, Artie, like the great Clutch Powers would ever be friends with somebody like you.
Artie?
He knows my name.
There's no need to bow.
Of course. Of course.
You only bow to royalty, and you're not a king.
More like a god.
Arthur.
Artie.
Kjeld says you have a ship ready for us.
Oh, my golly goodness.
It's gotta be here somewhere.
I know l put it in...
Yes, the other pile.
Yes. No? Right!
This pile is the pile it was in.
I know I've got it.
Just came off the assembly line.
It's a Space Police
Lighthouse Massive Cruiser with modified crew quarters,
X-over-M thrusters and an ion-burst relativity jump drive for intergalactic travel.
And it's got a spinner.
Any questions?
Yeah, how are we all supposed to fit in this little thing?
BRICK: (CHUCKLES) Wow!
Well, why didn't you say so?
You're bringing extra hair?
A girl's gotta be prepared.
Whatever. Back up.
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?
Never send a girl to do a man's job.
Here. Let me give you a hand.
Yes!
MALEVOICE:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
Seat belts, everyone?
... three, two...
Brick?
Seat belts?
We don't need no stinking...
... one, zero. Blast off!
...seat belts!
ALIENVOICE: Pizza delivery.
What idiot ordered pizza on the way to a mission?
BRICK: Where's my pizza?
Are we there yet?
How much longer?
Can't this thing go any faster?
I'll have you know we're going 1 .6 million kilometers per hour.
Actually, 1 .64 if you factor in the gravity slingshot effect.
You know, I'm quite the diarist myself.
I... What?
Isn't that your journal?
What journal?
The one you're sitting on.
Oh, that journal.
It's not mine.
It's my father's.
Your father?
Powers. Of course.
You're the son of Rock Powers, the legendary explorer.
I found this symbol in his notes.
It's just like the symbol from the prison distress call.
What did he make of it?
He didn't. lt was his last entry before he up and disappeared.
He was always missing.
Off on some crazy adventure or expedition.
But, hey, at least it taught me to fend for myself.
Yet here you are, still looking to him for guidance.
He was the best.
He never needed anybody or to be a part of a team.
BRICK: Practicing your secret handshake?
No, no, no, it's just... We were...
It's none of my business. l thought you should know.
We're there.
Ready for final approach.
You'll take it nice and easy, ja? l get motion sick.
Nice and easy.
Have you done this before?
It's like driving a fire truck, in space.
PEG: Didn't you crash that fire truck?
Whoa!
Slow down.
You're crazy!
Give me the controls.
Relax, I got it.
CLUTCH: You killed the engines.
BRICK: Oops!
Let go of the wheel.
This is why I work alone.
There you go, nice and easy.
Maybe l should guard the spaceship.
Let's go.
BRICK: This is the first time anyone had to break into a prison.
Okay. The air is good.
Smells like old gym socks.
Shh.
Well, it does.
Oh! And garlic, wow.
Oh, and a burrito platter.
That was tasty.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.
Keep an eye out behind us.
PEG: We should have left old stinky in the spaceship.
BERNIE: Nobody told me there was a burrito platter.
CLUTCH: Guys, come on.
It's empty.
The coast is clear.
Brick, watch our backs.
Keep an eye out for the Watch Commander.
Something bad happened here.
Brilliant deduction.
(THUDDING) Aah!
Help! Let me out of here!
What is that thing?
Let me out of here!
I got this one.
Put that thing down, you fool. Clutch.
Get her off of me.
What are you doing?
My job.
CLUTCH: l told you to stay back.
BRICK: Says you.
Hello?
This is my call.
Says you.
Come on.
Over here.
Please acknowledge me!
ALL: What?
Take cover.
Give me that.
PEG: It's the
Watch Commander.
I thought you'd never get here.
Come on, they're getting away.
You know, by the book.
So, there's absolutely no way they can escape from this planet.
It's just a matter of time before we capture them.
BERNIE: That sounds like our spaceship.
Who left the spaceship unlocked?
Um, that would be me.
But Brick's the one who left the keys in the ignition.
Yeah, but l didn't leave the operator's manual on the dashboard.
I wanted to guard the spaceship.
What kind of rescue team are you supposed to be?
Thanks to your bickering and squabbling, the three most vicious criminals in the galaxy are on the loose.
Do you have any idea what a disaster this is?
By now, they're already in hiding, plotting their next move and stuff.
Which is?
To unite all the forces of evil in the entire known universe.
Duh!
Would this be the right time to say we're sorry?
How are we gonna get back now?
CLUTCH: Guys, let's focus.
It's time to get creative.
Brick, you're on engines.
Bernie, flight control.
Peg, landing gear.
How am l gonna build a team out of a bunch of strangers?
It's not like we chose each other.
You can say that again.
Who does he think he is bossing me around, just because he's the boss and I'm around?
What are you doing?
You're making a mess.
I'll take that, thank you.
Who put that there?
Hey, watch it!
Pull it this way.
No, it doesn't.
No, you're wrong.
No, it goes like this.
Come on, it's just rocket science.
Can't get anyone to do anything around here.
What a mess this is.
These guys don't know what they're doing.
There. All done.
This is why I work alone.
If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.
There. All done.
Now that's how you build a spaceship.
Would somebody pleaseexplain to me whatjust happened?
Well, we built a new ship out of spare parts.
It was really quite ingenious. First...
At. The. Prison.
What happened at the prison?
Uh, can l take this one? l just want to say, this is all her fault!
My fault?
You were supposed to be watching our backs.
Can't hear you.
La-la-la-la-la.
Stop it. This is my fault and mine alone.
I was in charge of this mission.
So, if you want to blame anyone, blame me.
I allowed myself to be distracted from the mission.
By what?
I found a clue about what happened to my father.
Yourfather?
My father vanished three years ago on a top-secret expedition.
After all this time.
We thought his creation spark had been extinguished.
But then l saw this symbol on one of the prison cells.
What does it mean?
Omega.
It's the name of one of the three prisoners who escaped.
Kjeld, we've gotta go after him.
We don't know where he is.
But we've got a lock on the wizard who led the escape, and the situation is urgent.
He's putting an entire planet in jeopardy.
I'm sorry, Clutch.
Omega will have to wait.
Then let's get to work.
Say hello to prisoner number one,
MallockThe Malign, the EvilWizard of Ashlar.
Hello.
What's Ashlar?
A medieval world forgedfrom might and magic.
Mallock once ruled
Ashlar with an ironfist.
The only thing that could defeat him was the golden sword of the rightful king, the great King Revet.
He vanquished the dark wizard, but he paid the ultimate price.
His creation spark was extinguished.
Now Mallock has returned to Ashlar and reunited with his Skeleton Army to continue his quest for evil dominion.
Our only hopeis that the skill and courage of the great king have passed to his son,
Prince Varen.
Why doesn't the Prince fight back?
Heis young and untrained and something of a disappointment.
He needs someone to show him the way.
Is there a problem, Bernie?
(GROANS) Got it!
So, what's the mission?
Your missionis tofly to Ashlar, find PrinceVaren, and help him recapture the evil wizard Mallock.
Preparing to engage ion-burst relativity jump drive.
BERNIE: Be gentle.
Look! It's LEGO Hindge, the oldest and most mysterious minifig-made structure in all the universe.
No one knows what it was built for.
Oh! They're still studying it to this very day.
PEG: You're going too fast.
BRICK: No problemo.
I've always wanted to see it.
It's so incredible, ja?
You try and parallel park this thing.
What... Wait...
VILLAGER: Help us!
It's the dark magic.
None of our high-tech weapons will work.
Oh, no fair.
He must have cast a spell on this place.
He? He who?
He, him.
Holy hovercraft!
If l were wearing boots, l'd be shaking in them.
Let's go find Prince Varen.
I got a bad feeling about this.
I am getting so tired of your constant negativity.
Well, I'm not the one who lost the castle.
I didn't lose it.
It's just missing.
VILLAGER 1 : Somebody help us! Please!
Where is the Prince?
VILLAGERS: Have mercy.
Lock them away until they tell us where to find the Prince.
VILLAGER 1 : Please, let us go.
See, l think he's happy.
You two!
I am not happy.
Did you find the Prince?
I'll ask you once more and once more only.
Where is the Prince?
Well, not to tell you how to do your job, but a better question might be,
"Where is the castle?"
Good idea.
We know that one.
Well? Where is it?
It's missing.
Vanished.
Disappeared without a trace.
Gone with the wind.
Hogar.
And the Prince?
Well, we couldn't find him.
See, we went looking for him at the castle, but the castle was missing.
Course you already know that.
And then we were attacked by a bunch of knights.
A knight, actually.
There was only one.
But he was very effective.
Unpleasant.
Mean, l'd have to say.
Mean? Would you go that far?
Yeah. When he did the thing with the thing...
Right, right. Mean.
I'm good with mean.
This knight had a voice like thunder.
A sword as fast as lightning.
He came at us like a whirlwind.
All in all, we'd have to say...
BOTH: lt was a dark and stormy knight.
Find me the Prince, or else!
Nothing here but a bunch of junk.
We've got everything we need for a battle cart.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
LEGO!
Hey! Save your fight for Mallock.
Apologies, all.
You're right.
Good. It's time we start acting like a team.
Bernie, you're in charge of the build.
Just make it strong.
Strong. My neck.
And we're gonna need weapons.
Over here.
Over here. Pick me.
Pick me, me, me.
Brick, would like to be in charge of weapons?
Uh, what else you got?
Sure, no problem.
You want me to do weapons, I'll do weapons.
Peg, you see these tracks?
You spotted them, too?
Something with wings, l think.
A griffin perhaps.
Find out what it is and whose side they're on.
All right, team.
You've got your assignments.
I'll be back soon.
Where are you going?
To find Prince Varen.
MALLOCK: What do you think you're doing?
I told you to bring me a minifig.
This is a real fig.
Find me the Prince, now!
This whole place is going to pieces.
Hmm.
(CHUCKLES) Skelly! Bones!
Where are those ninnies?
Hey, look at this.
What are you doing?
Follow him!
And he'll lead us right to the Prince.
I don't get it.
Ah!
Alley-oop.
Sneaking, hiding, sneaking, hiding...
(CHUCKLES) We got him.
Hello, are we still hiding? Look what l found.
What are you doing?
Same thing as you.
Oh! Don't forget...
I'll just put this on here.
And right on here.
Give me that.
That's not funny.
Perfect.
Get down!
What part of hiding don't you understand?
Mmm.
Okay.
It's adorable.
I gotta touch it.
What are you doing, man?
No! Don't do that.
You're beautiful.
I'm so in love with you.
We could get married and build a house and build some kids.
None shall pass.
What are you doing in my forest?
My name is Clutch Powers.
I must find Prince Varen, the rightful heir to the throne of Ashlar.
Nobody crosses this bridge unless they pass three tests.
If you succeed, l will take you to Prince Varen.
And if l fail?
Then, l will eat you.
Bring it on.
You say you're
Clutch Powers, then prove it.
The real Clutch Powers would know how to build his own...bridge.
Next?
Using nothing but standard eight-stud bricks, how many bricks would it take to build a spiral staircase as tall as three minifigs?
There are more than 91 5 million ways to combine standard LEGO bricks.
But they will never connect on the diagonal.
So, it's a trick question.
It can't be done.
Not so fast.
For your final test, you must answer a riddle.
A riddle?
Yes, a riddle.
Trolls ask riddles.
It's what we do.
Fine. Ask away.
You hold my hand, though we cannot touch.
You hear my voice, though I do not speak.
You see my face, though I am not here.
Who am l?
You hold my hand, you hear my voice, you see...
You see my face.
The answer is my father.
Oh! You're good.
Now answer me.
Where can l find Prince Varen?
Yes, do tell.
We're dying to know.
Hand him over.
Mallock's orders.
This is not the man you are looking for.
Yeah, it is.
Darn! That never works for me.
Well, hate to eat and run, but...
SKELLY: Man, that hurts.
I hate when this happens.
Come on.
Let's get him.
Hey, where'd he go?
There he is, over there.
SKELLY: I can see where he is, man.
BONES: Okay, wait, can you remind me?
SKELLY: He went this way.
Which way?
SKELLY: Wait, it might have been that way.
BONES: Okay.
SKELLY: No, this way.
Let's go.
BONES: We got him now.
Okay. All right.
SKELLY: He's right there.
This way, this way. l thought there was a thing over here...
Wait, wait.
Where did he go?
Great. First you lose the castle, now this.
I didn't lose the castle.
You lost the castle.
Oh, no, you lost the castle.
No, you lost the castle.
You lost the castle.
No backs.
No fair.
Besides, we didn't lose it.
We just can't find it.
SKELLY: Yeah, yeah, and it's not that we weren't looking,
'cause we were always looking, it just wasn't around.
BONES: Exactly.
We just play stupid.
You think we can do that?
SKELLY: Well, you know,
I think you're probably
CLUTCH: Hey!
Let me out of here.
Did everyone have the burrito platter?
(BURPS) With extra garlic.
Now let's go.
Not so fast.
Who are you?
I am Hogar The Troll.
And you can take me to Prince Varen?
Open the gates.
Whoa!
Shall we?
Yeah, where do you want these doohickeys?
Those are called
Rack Winder Axles.
Stack them over there.
In a neat pile.
Technically, there's no such thing as a neat pile.
How about these whatchamacallits?
That's a 40-tooth spur gear.
Yeah, I'll put them over here with these other gizmos.
You need anymore of these thingies here?
Those are called "hinge rods."
Not "thingies" or
"doohickeys" or
"whatchamacallits." Okay?
Can l have one of those thingies?
It's not a...
Would you like a blue thingy or a red thingy?
(SIGHS) Brilliant.
Well, I'm off.
Cheers, all.
Good luck with your thingy.
Hey, I got that jazzamabob unstuck.
Oh, you poor dear.
That's a nasty cold, isn't it?
I built that wall to keep us hidden from
Mallock's prying eyes.
You built it?
But you're a...
I mean, aren't you a...
I mean, why?
Why is a disgusting, horrible, nasty-looking troll fighting for the good guys?
I wouldn't say disgusting.
I fight for the memory of King Revet because King Revet fought for me.
Despite my outward appearance, he saw that we were the same on the inside.
He took me in and embraced me.
He trusted me.
I will do everything in my power to keep this kingdom from falling to the forces of darkness.
But what does Mallock want?
This.
This is no ordinary sword.
In the hands of the rightful king, it has power over the mightiest evil.
Alas, we have no king.
If this sword falls into Mallock's hands, his villainy will be unstoppable.
But what about Prince Varen?
I do what l can to protect him, just as his father once protected me.
But he's young and inexperienced.
But...
There is no but.
His heart is in it, but l fear the rest of him isn't up to the challenge.
I can work with heart.
Where is he?
Clutch Powers, meet Prince Varen.
I got distracted, that's all.
Happens to the best of us.
Happens to me all the time.
I can show you what you're doing wrong.
It's pretty simple.
I doubt it.
I'm no good with a sword.
No, it's a broadsword, not an épée.
Hold it high above your head and swing from the shoulder. l told you I'm no good with a sword.
Who said you could bring strangers in here anyway?
Mallock's army of skeletons is amassing even as we speak.
We have to move now.
Not until I'm ready.
I'm here to help you defeat the evil wizard.
Trust me. I can help.
Like you helped me just now?
I don't need you.
I've got an army.
But do you know how to use it?
A sword is only as good as the knight who wields it.
I don't need your help.
Oh! What is wrong with him?
Why won't he listen to me?
Remember, he's not here for you.
You have to be here for him.
Hmm.
Wait! Where are you going?
Are we ready yet?
There. All done.
Sweet meteors, it's about time.
Everything is properly organized and sorted by function.
First, we arrange the parts in ascending order of size. Then...
Done. What do you think?
Well, extraordinary.
Except for this piece, which was in the instruction manual you didn't follow.
Nah!
But I'm sure it's not important.
I'll just hold on to it for safekeeping.
Just in case.
Hey, now you've got extra hair, just like Peg.
Me, like Peg?
And l quite like you, too, Bernie.
No, that's not what I said.
I mean, it is what I said, but it's not what I meant.
I didn't mean I like you.
I do like you, but what l was trying to say was...
Jumping jellybeans!
What happened to you?
It's just a little flesh wound.
And while I was gone, l see you were all playing dress up.
Everything went perfectly according to plan.
No surprises here.
Oh! Are you okay?
Oh, l'm...
You poor dear.
Don't mind me.
It's just my head.
I'll give you a pain in the head! Coming here to steal me gold for that evil wizard.
We thought this mine was abandoned.
Abandoned? She's beautiful, she is.
I'll give you abandoned, you little...
Who are you calling little?
Wait! You don't understand.
We're not here to help the evil wizard.
We're here to defeat him.
My heroes!
Lofar, at your service.
Good. We'll need all the help we can get.
Clutch, you're back.
Did you find the Prince?
Yup.
And?
We'll have to defeat
Mallock on our own.
We can do this.
He may have a thousand-strong army of skeleton warriors, but we've got...
Backbone?
Pluck?
Guts?
Me lucky socks.
Each other.
Peg, Bernie,
Lofar, you create a diversion out front while we drop behind the tower.
Once we're inside, load the cannons and let her rip.
Okay. Everyone know their assignment?
VAREN: l don't.
I've decided to allow you to help me.
And I've brought a few friends.
CLUTCH: The knights will attack the front with the others while l join Prince Varen in the back to face off with Mallock.
But it's my duty to lead the royal knights into battle.
But we need you inside to go after Mallock.
You can't be in two place at once.
Who says?
Your hair.
Give us your hair.
What's going on?
You're Prince Varen now.
Get up there and lead your knights into battle.
I look like a girl.
But a very pretty girl.
Prince Varen?
Mallock The...
Mallock The Malign, it is l, Prince Varen, rightful heir to the throne of Ashlar.
Come out with your hands up.
I can't believe l have to wear girl hair.
Shh.
(SOFTLY) Well, it's stupid.
No, come on. Come on.
Well done, lads.
Well done.
The last person who made it past my enchanted armor was your father.
Leave him alone, Mallock.
Can't you fend for yourself, boy?
After all, you are the king.
I said, leave him alone.
Too bad there's no one to save you now.
I'm warning you for the last time.
ROCK: Clutch?
Is that you? Clutch?
Dad?
He's right here.
Clutch! No!
Don't look at the crystal ball!
Dad! Dad, is that you?
VAREN: Clutch, don't look at the crystal ball.
It's a trick.
Clutch! Clutch!
What?
No!
Skeleton warriors, army of the night, l summon you!
Arise and attack!
These guys look bad to the bone.
Attack! Run them down and run them through.
Charge!
SOLDIERS: Yeah!
Take that!
SKELLY: Oh, yeah!
Hey, isn't that
Uncle Morty?
Hey, Morty!
Oh, Morty!
Get your head in the game.
He should've boned up on his fighting skills.
How about this one?
He always was a bonehead.
You out?
Bone dry.
LOFAR: Retreat!
Slow down!
Speed up! Speed up!
Turn around.
(SIGHS) l told you.
I'm no good with a sword.
This was my fault, not yours.
Why did he let us live?
He wants to display us like trophies.
Break his enemy's spirit.
Show them their worst fear.
What do you think you're doing?
I was driving.
You call that driving?
It's not her fault we crashed.
The wheels came loose because you left out a part.
If we stuck to your plan, we'd still be building it.
Well, at least it would be done right. Dummkopf
At least we got away.
That makes you happy, running away?
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Well, we know we can trust you to wreck everything.
Peg, may l speak to...
What is it, Bernie?
Oh?
Yes. Well, thank you.
Peg, l have something
I've been meaning to tell you. l love you. l just...
Bernie, look!
Bring me the golden sword of King Revet, or this is the last time you'll ever see them.
Hogar. Hogar!
Where are you going?
I must do as Mallock demands.
No! l must. l have no choice.
Yes, you do.
Don't give it to him.
I promised his father
I would protect his son.
I gave my word no harm would come to Prince Varen.
I'm sorry.
You'll pay for this trick, Hogar.
Wait, wait, where's the sword?
I dropped it.
What?
I couldn't even get it out of my scabbard.
I guess it's still in the hall, by the armor.
That means he doesn't know where it is.
We're going to get out of here, and I'm going to get you that sword before Mallock finds it.
How? There's nothing but a bunch of bones.
What are you doing?
If you wanna send a message, nothing beats hand delivery.
Brick, can you show me how to load the weapons?
What are you talking about?
They're shattered.
Then I'll help you rebuild them.
What's gotten into you?
Look!
BRICK: "LEGO."
Don't you see what he's trying to tell us?
Uh-uh.
We build on each other.
Give me five minutes,
I'll give you an arsenal.
That's the spirit.
Bernie, can you fix this rust bucket?
There's no way.
The frame is shattered, two wheels are gone, and we're missing half the parts.
I can't do it!
I tell you, I can't!
Okay. I'll do it.
Lock and load.
We're going in.
Huh?
Huzzah!
Tally-ho!
Thanks for letting me drive.
How's it handle?
Like a three-legged hippo.
I did the best with what l had.
It's an engineering marvel, Bernie.
I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but I do have one teensy question.
How exactly are we gonna get to Clutch?
Good boy!
You do have a way with animals.
Hey, Clutch!
Skelly? Bones?
Where are those nincompoops?
Snake eyes!
Roll them bones.
Here we go.
That's right, put it down.
Roll them high.
Come on, baby.
Good stuff.
Good stuff.
Load me up, Bernie.
I'm going in.
What? Wait a minute.
Whoa! Mommy!
Seven, again!
This is my lucky day.
Don't be jealous.
The wheel's jammed.
It won't turn.
We have to jump.
On three.
One, two...
I can't. I'm stuck.
Jump! What are you waiting for?
Hold me tight. l will go get your legs.
Oh! I'm not half the man l used to be.
Hurrah!
This sword, in your hands, gives you the power over the greatest evil.
But I'm no good with a sword.
You saw.
No. I'll tell you what I saw.
I saw a brave warrior tackle an enchanted knight with nothing but bare hands and courage.
I don't know.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
No! My father had this power, but l'm not my father.
He's always with you.
His strength lives in you.
MALLOCK: This is the end,
Prince Varen.
I'm going to snuff your creation spark just like l took your father's.
All your friends will be defeated and this kingdom will be mine, forever.
Huh?
BRICK: Take this, take that...
Back off!
Here's a little bit more for you to take. l told you it might come in handy.
No! You'll never take my kingdom.
Give me the sword,
Clutch Powers.
Give me the sword, and l will take you to your father.
You can see him again.
Just give me the sword.
No, Clutch.
Give me the sword.
I can take you to him.
Give me the sword, or you'll never see your father again.
He's alive?
Clutch, he's right here.
He's always with you.
I already found him.
Don't worry, this is my battle.
Hey, Mallock, over here!
Get him. Yeah!
That's the spirit.
You can do it.
Come on, Varen! Yeah.
This is the end, Prince Varen.
That's King Varen.
And you're under arrest.
Yeah! We did it!
Long live the King!
ALL: Long live King Varen!
Oh, my hip is killing me.
Hey, nice toss back there, gear-head.
You weren't so bad yourself.
Sorry.
Just kidding.
Thanks, Bernie.
But I think it looks better on you.
Clutch, I know what you gave up back there.
And I know it wasn't easy.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
I'll find my dad someday.
For now, it's enough to know he's alive.
Great work, Clutch.
Uh, don't thank me.
Thank the team.
Tens and 20s would be fine.
Oh?
We've located your next target, on the other side of the galaxy.
I think you know what this means.
I'm driving!
I call shotgun.
Here we go again.
Preparing to engage ion-burst relativity jump drive.
We are gathered here today to immortalize in song the life and untimely death of a great legend.
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn and assorted confections while we tell you the strange and bewildering tale of a hero who has yet to enter his own story.
Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake.
Okay, everybody, let's take it from the top.
The stage is set, the night moist with apprehension.
Alone in her chamber, the princess prepares to take her own life.
"It is far better to nourish worms than to live without love."
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio plots his ascension to the throne while her aging father lies gravely ill.
"Yes, I am gravely ill."
"Hark, who goes there?"
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero, returning to rescue his emotionally unstable maiden!
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue, or taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!
The sting of my...
Dr. Marx?
Dr. Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you.
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.
Mr. Timms? You were good.
Perhaps a little too good.
What's that, Victor? My character's undefined? That's absurd.
I know who I am.
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.
Every story needs a hero.
I mean, who else is better qualified to bask in the adulation of his numerous companions?
The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.
Who am I?
I could be anyone.
I could be the sea cap'n returning from a mighty voyage to reclaim his mechanical arm!
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist, battling pythons down in the Congo!
Down, Chongo, down!
And if you desire romance,
I will become the greatest lover the world has ever known!
I couldn't help but notice you noticing me noticing you.
You know, the womens find me uncomfortably good looking.
But you seem remarkably at ease.
Stop it. No, really.
Well, if you must. What are you doing?
That tickles. Are those real?
That's it! Conflict.
Victor, you were right.
I have been undefined.
People, I've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!
What our story needs is an ironic, unexpected event that will propel the hero into conflict!
Mr. Timms?
That's right! You!
Don't be shy. Come on.
It's okay.
That's it, a little closer.
Good.
I won't bite you.
I need a little help here.
Are you okay?
I must get to the other side.
The other side? You mean, just now, that was you crossing the road?
That's why the...
Why'd you do that?
This is my quest. He waits for me.
What? Who?
The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.
They say he rides an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.
What are you talking about?
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.
Nothing? Your delusional quest just ruined my life!
I had an incredibly complex social network going!
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!
Friends? I don't see no friends.
You are a very lonely lizard.
Look, I need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.
I need lotion.
I'm down to one layer of skin already.
Pretty soon,
I'm going to start seeing my insides.
Not unlike what you've got going there.
Listen, I can't survive in the desert, okay?
I... I don't belong here.
That may be true, but here you are.
Now help me up and I will help you find what you seek.
- You will?
- And perhaps more.
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.
The Spirit is waiting for me.
Okay, okay.
Okay. That's not going to work.
I must get to the other side.
Why don't you just wait until there are no cars coming?
It's not so easy as it looks.
What?
Is a metaphor.
There's another one!
I knew it.
You need a little help, amigo?
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.
The path to knowledge is fraught with consequence.
I'm just looking for the path to water.
If you want to find water, you must first find Dirt.
Dirt.
Destiny, she is kind to you.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.
At noon, the townspeople gather for a mysterious ritual.
A town? You mean, with real people and everything? Where?
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.
You want me to just walk out into the desert?
That's the way.
Okay. So you're saying there's a town, a real town, not a metaphor town.
Go on. It's okay.
Okay.
Well, then, I'm going.
I am leaving the road now!
I'm walking into the desert!
Alone!
We all have our journeys to make!
I will see you on the other side.
Welcome, amigo
To the land without end
The desert and death
Are the closest of friends
We sing of his courage
In magnificent song
But pay close attention
He won't be here long
As the birds pluck his eyes
The sun bleaches his bones
See his entrails get scattered
Watch him lose his cojones
Here in the Mojave Desert, animals have had millions of years to adapt to the harsh environment.
But the lizard? He is going to die.
"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers..."
- Don't move.
- What?
- Don't move!
- Not moving.
Not moving.
Try to blend in.
Blend in? What do you mean?
Blend in.
What are you saying?
- Too late.
- No, no. It's not too late!
I'm blending! I'm a blender!
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?
Stop moving!
Try not to look conspicuous.
- What are you doing?
- I'm blending.
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.
- No room at the inn.
- It's an art, not a science.
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.
Oh, hey. Proboscis.
Testy.
Please, no, please. I have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!
Please, no.
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!
Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your huevos!
Big bird! Big bird!
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- I don't know you!
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!
I'll let you kiss my sister!
You son of a...
Where are your friends now, amigo?
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges off my boots!
Sorry.
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow lessen you want to spend the better part of the afternoon putting your face back together!
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
- I'm asking the questions here!
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.
Now someone's dumping water in the desert!
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size and dimension, but I intend to find out what role you playing in all this.
- Role?
- What are you involved in?
Well, I'm glad you asked.
I've got two one-acts, a mystery and a musical I've been gestating.
I got the words, I'm just working on the melody right now. It's like a...
I think it's gonna be a western.
A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a slapper
She'll be coming 'round the mountain in the rain
You ain't from around here, are you?
I'm still working on it.
So, what's your name?
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.
What can I say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.
Well, you're lucky he didn't plumb love asparagus.
What are you saying?
I mean,
I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself, but I'm not sure that a child would appreciate the moniker.
My daddy was a great man, even if he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!
You carry his remains?
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month!
And for you to insinuate that he would abandon his parental responsibilities at a delicate time in my personal development is an affront to my sense...
Miss Beans?
Miss Beans? Hello?
Hello?
And until the people of Andromeda Five return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?
- You're cuddling me.
- You were frozen.
- I was not.
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.
It's a defense mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.
You're making that up.
So, you gonna die out here, or you want a ride into town?
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.
So who are you, really?
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.
There's my stage name, my pen name, my avatar.
I had a pseudonym once, but I had it legally changed.
And so the stranger, seeking companionship, finds the woman, much like the sirens of ancient times luring him to his certain demise.
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.
I'm actually one of the few men with a maiden name.
Whoa! Well, here we are.
Right.
Well, I sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,
- and if there's ever anything that I...
- Get on up!
Okay, then!
See you, Beans.
You heading out, Jim?
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.
Can't grow no crops without no water.
Bye, now!
What is it?
What was that for?
You're funny looking.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.
Here's your beans, Beans.
I'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts already. I can't give you more credit.
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrimack down at the bank. He cut off all credit.
Hey, Beans! Beans!
You know that there fella?
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!
Nope.
Hey, Beans!
Hey.
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.
I'd like a glass of water.
He wants a glass of water!
Make it a double!
Give him the spittoon!
Cactus juice. That's what we got.
Hey, there, fruit cup.
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?
Who exactly are you?
Who am I?
I could be anyone.
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?
As a matter of fact, I am.
But not as much as your daddy's cooking!
Exactly where did you say you were from?
Me? I'm from the West.
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.
The Far West.
Yeah, that's right, hombres.
The place I come from, we kill a man before breakfast just to work up an appetite.
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!
Hell, I seen things make a grown man lose control of his glandular functions!
You spend three days in a horse carcass, living off your own juices.
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.
Had a few extra aces in this deck, gents. Just the way I like it.
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
I am not from around these parts.
You might say I'm from everywhere there's trouble brewing and hell waiting to be raised.
You might say
I'm what hell's already raised up.
Name's
Rango.
Are you the fella that killed them Jenkins brothers?
Killed them with one bullet.
Don't get no deader.
All seven of them?
That's right.
All seven of them.
Exactly how you do that, Mr. Rango?
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.
And I will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!
Because this is where it gets complicated.
That'll close out your account,
Mrs. Oats, two gulps and a swig.
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left of your college education!
I don't rightly have no other choice, Beans.
Times being so hard, we just can't give no more credit.
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.
Beans, you've been like a niece to me ever since your daddy did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.
I've tried to protect you and others from certain realities.
But that... Well...
- Mr. Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.
Mr. Merrimack!
Are you all right?
Beans, I need to show you something.
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just ain't making deposits on a Wednesday no more!
Mr. Merrimack, if I don't get some water,
I'm gonna lose my ranch and you're telling me that's all that's left in the whole town?
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.
Someone is dumping water in the desert.
I seen it with my own eyes.
Water in the desert?
Was this during one of your special times?
No.
Well, we can all dream, but this is the reality.
Why do you think so many people are selling out? They just can't make it.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.
I hear he's been helping people out in this time of crisis.
The Mayor?
He may be our only hope.
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back towards number three, and that's when the roof caved in, igniting the thermos of pure grain alcohol instantly vaporizing his bodily form, leaving nothing but a charcoal statue and a high-pitched squeal.
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?
Number seven?
Hell, he died of infection.
- Seven men!
- One bullet!
Drinks all around!
Dance for me, Sod Buster!
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!
You got corn in your ears, mate?
You don't pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!
If I see your face in this town again,
I'm gonna slice it off and use it to wipe my unmentionables.
Mind the beak.
And don't come back!
What are you all gawping at?
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something I got to tell you!
What is this?
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!
Is that right?
Let me get that before you...
No. Oh, I know. Here.
Just take care of that for you.
There. All better.
T.O. T.O. Just a second.
All right, now listen!
I'm going to give you fellas one last chance to reconsider!
And if you don't want to reconsider
I might consider reconsidering myself.
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.
All right, now listen up!
Things are going to be different around here now that Rango's in town.
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning, my coffee hot, Danish on the side.
Whatever you do, don't look me in the eye.
Stay out of my peripheral vision!
- It's Rango.
- What's he up to?
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!
And when you see me coming, stand aside.
I take large steps and I don't want none of you hayseeds getting your bodily fluids on my boots!
Of course, there is no need for violence, as long as we stick together, work as a team.
So I want you all to come outside now and line up single file while I take a brief intermission!
What's he doing now?
I think it's a number two.
Never mind.
Take a look-see over here!
Well, look at him now!
He's chasing after that hawk!
Give him hell, Rango!
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!
What do you think, Doc?
This hawk is dead!
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.
He did it with one bullet!
Just like he said!
It's about time we had a hero around here.
One who ain't in a pine box.
I think it's time he met the Mayor.
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!
Let's hear it for Rango!
And so the stranger basks in the adulation of his new friends, sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception.
When is he going to die?
Soon, compadre. Soon.
My land is not for sale!
I came here to save my land, not sell it!
I'm sure there's something reasonable we can work out if you just talk to him!
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?
The Mayor will see you now.
Water, Mr. Rango, water.
Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.
But with water there's life.
Look at them, so desperate to live, they'll follow it anywhere.
That's the immutable law of the desert.
Control the water and you control everything.
But I don't have to tell you that being a true man of the West, as you are.
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rainwater from the Great Deluge.
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.
I guess power has its privileges.
You make a good point, son.
But with privilege comes responsibility.
Hell, I was mayor here before there was a Dirt!
And I may be just a sentimental old turtle but I think there's a future for this town.
And I hope you'll be part of it.
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbors?
It's a hard life here. Very hard.
Do you know how they make it through each and every day?
They believe.
They believe it's going to be better.
They believe that the water will come.
They believe against all odds and all evidence that tomorrow will be better than today.
People have to believe in something.
Right now, they believe in you.
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.
Your destiny awaits.
People have to believe in something.
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?
Yeah. But he might be a problem.
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.
It just don't make no sense.
This whole town is drying up, and the Mayor is the only one who don't seem to be affected.
Doesn't that make you just a wee bit suspicious?
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.
But if you really feel there's some conspiracy occurring,
I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff.
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!
That's good.
Oh, easy there, tiger.
- A little up and back?
- I don't think so.
Have you got French cuffs with that?
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.
Hey, Beans, what do you think of the new duds?
I got a 1 0-gallon hat marked down from 15.
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.
- Tart.
- Floozy.
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr. Rango.
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
I was just thinking that...
You want the old John Hancock, do you?
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.
There's a bullet in there.
I know about the shindig this afternoon.
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, I'd like to file a...
- Mr. Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.
- Here, let me just...
- I need you to investigate...
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up real nice, you put a little effort into it.
- What?
- Now, remember, son, stay in school, eat your veggies, burn everything but Shakespeare.
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango, if that is your real name.
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch, which is on the verge of an agricultural meltdown while you're playing patty-cake with this here trollop!
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.
Why does she do that?
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.
Well, that's an inconvenience.
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!
I did it again, didn't I?
Did what?
Let me ask you something.
Did anybody here mention what happened to our last sheriff?
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?
What exactly happened to the...
All day
I've faced the barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
With throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water
Cool
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Clear water
This is a heck of a hoedown you got going.
Still working out those steps.
So, is this considered normal civic behavior?
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.
You kill bird.
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.
Bird dead. Snake come.
Snake?
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr. Rango.
He never comes to town 'cause he's scared of that hawk.
But he might come now.
Can I have your boots when you're dead?
No!
And I ain't got no problem with this Rattlesnake Jake.
That's just what Amos said.
Amos?
You got any gold fillings?
My fellow Dirtonians.
I welcome you to our great day of deliverance. Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!
We have a newcomer amongst us today, my friends.
A man I think needs little introduction to you so bold has been his entry into our fair society.
Mr. Rango, would you step forward?
The time has come, my friends.
The time that was foretold!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
It is the time of hydration!
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!
I get his boots!
My friends, my friends!
Temper your frustrations.
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices will have to be made.
But if I can help in any way, please know that my door is always...
Hold it, hold it!
Now, this whole thing stinks three ways to Sunday.
First the bank's run dry and now this here spigot?
The bank's run dry?
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!
That was my rehydration account!
None of that civil disobedience in my town, thank you very much.
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.
Come right in.
Let me have a gander at the source of the societal discontentment here.
Mercy.
All right, listen up! I've been thinking and I believe I've figured something out.
You folks have a water problem!
Now just pay attention, everybody.
I'm trying to make a point here.
Let's say this fella here were to take a drink of water.
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?
And you!
You're just as dried up and parched as a jackrabbit in July.
So you belly on up and take you a double shot!
Stay with me.
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!
And before you know it, there wouldn't be any more water.
And then where would we be?
We'd be thirsty.
Real thirsty.
We'd turn on each other like a bunch of animals!
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.
We have got five days...
As long as we've got water, we've got ourselves a town.
Sheriff Rango is right.
As long as we have this water, we have some hope.
And you can all take it from me.
My 100% full-time employment from this moment on will be to protect our precious natural resource.
Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango.
Evening, ladies.
Evening, Sheriff.
And don't you come back!
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back in there and you assert yourself, and I think you'll find the people of this here town to be surprisingly hospitable.
Thank you, Sheriff.
What? Not you again!
I stand corrected.
- This ain't the bank.
- I told you, Jedidiah!
Hold it right there!
- Who's that?
- It's the Sheriff!
Get them hands up where I can see them!
Just as I suspected.
Prospecting without the authorized equipment. Don't move a muscle.
Prospecting?
Now, you got your shovel, pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah, assorted snacks, some puzzle books and you're gonna need a permit.
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?
I've had polyps removed smarter than the two of you!
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here, helping us out.
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds, keeping an eagle eye out for mayhem and malfeasance.
Does he look like he sounds?
Well, Sheriff, if we was to hit the mother lode, being prospectors and such, where would we deposit said annuity?
Here in the town of Dirt, we happen to have the finest financial institution this side of the Missouri.
Protected morning, noon and night by yours truly.
Much obliged.
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!
What's going on?
- It's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?
He said the bank's been robbed!
Dr. Marx! I'm on fire! Embrace me!
The bank's been robbed, the town is dry
"We'll die of thirst," the people cry
He promised to protect the vault
The water's gone, it's all his fault
All right, folks, stand back, clear the area.
This is a crime scene now.
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints, check for fibers, scan for DNA.
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.
And don't mix up the two.
What's this?
"Prospecting Permit."
I'll take that. Material evidence.
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!
My friends, we all know what we have to do now.
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.
Form a possum!
A posse.
Now, we're gonna be doing this in an orderly fashion.
First off, does anybody here know how to use a firearm of any kind?
All right, then.
What do we do now, Sheriff?
Now we ride!
Where are we going?
What?
Where are we going?
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge of all tracking and finding of villains, utilizing your well-developed
Injun-uity, no offense taken.
So which way do you think they went?
You want to sniff the air or commune with a buffalo or something?
Oh, you're good.
I'm depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobaccy in the beard there.
Always good to have a medical man along, Doc.
Reptiles got to stick together, right, my brother?
I'm an amphibian.
Ain't no shame in that.
You sure you're fit for duty there, soldier?
Well, you got a little something in your eye there.
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.
Well, I'm glad to hear it's not contagious.
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...
Never mind.
Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look after the town while I'm gone.
Can I gut-shoot someone?
Let's put a pin in that.
Sheriff, you're going to bring that water back, aren't you?
Count on it, little sister.
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.
Whole town's perforated with them.
She got more holes in her than a painted lady on a porcupine.
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.
Not what I expected.
How'd them fellers find the bank, anyway?
Gentlemen, if we can just stay on task here.
Sheriff! Over here!
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.
Amen, brother.
I remember when it used to flow every Wednesday.
Those were the halcyon days.
Must be a reason she quit on us.
Whatever the reason, something is controlling this here water.
What do you say, Sheriff?
Clearly, the robbers came from this direction.
I say we track this pipe back to its hydraulic origin and apprehend the culprits behind this aquatic conundrum.
- What'd he say?
- I think he said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.
Sure is humid down here.
Yeah, it's activating my piles.
I had a goitre removed once.
Looked like Tony Bennett stepping out of the shower.
Shoot, I put that on a tortilla.
Whatever you do, do not look down.
- What is this place?
- It's an aquifer.
What's an aquifer?
Well, it's for aqua.
Well, it's empty now.
That's a big one.
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.
Well, now that there is a pipe.
It's got to be connected to something.
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.
Your mama did.
I'll cook her right up.
You two just don't get it, do you?
Someone or something is messing with our hydration and that pipe has got something to do with it.
I thought we was following bank robbers!
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.
I'm gonna shift the features on your face if you don't shut up!
Go ahead and try!
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.
Sure enough.
Smart thinking there, feller.
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!
Not bad, huh, Beans?
You keep thinking like that, your hat's gonna catch on fire.
Well, you know, you get on a roll, you just...
Hot, hot! Burn.
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.
- Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?
- I saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!
Give me that!
It's empty anyway.
I knew that.
Where'd you find that?
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!
It's Mr. Merrimack from the bank.
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.
Looks like them varmints shot him in the back.
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?
What a way to go.
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.
I suppose we should bury him.
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.
Circle of life!
Sheriff.
Will you say a few words?
Yeah. Yeah.
Dearly beloved.
We are gathered here today to honor this man.
Mr. Merrimack, you have the right to remain silent.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?
I see you're consulting with the spirits.
No, I'm moulting.
Means I'm ready to mate.
I'll keep that in mind.
Cactus fruit.
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.
I believe your people use it as seasoning when preparing your native dishes.
Also natural laxative.
Pick up trail.
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?
Someone's got a bad valve.
All right, which one of you fellers needs a check-up?
Awkward.
What exactly are we going to do now?
Now we ride!
That means we're riding now!
This moment.
Marshmallows remind me of going camping with my daddy.
I could eat them all night long.
Of course he did make me cough them back up again for breakfast.
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.
They started looking at me weird.
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.
I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter once.
You might want to get that looked at.
Pass the beans, Beans.
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.
Mr. Rango? Can you tell us about the Spirit of the West?
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- Is it true what they say?
Yes, the Spirit of the West!
The eternally unattainable ideal.
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.
But he only appears to those who have undertaken an epic quest!
And have made it to the other side.
The other side of what?
It's a metaphor.
My eye!
That's gonna heal right up.
Sheriff? What are you going to do about Rattlesnake Jake?
What? Where?
Sorry about that. Word is you come against him once or twice.
Yeah.
Jake. You mean my brother.
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.
Well, Momma had an active social life.
Did he ever bite you?
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.
Put some in my coffee just to give it a little tang.
Is it true he's only scared of them hawks?
Them's what we call his natural predator.
All this talk of that serpentine devil is putting my quills on edge!
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water and return to a hero's welcome.
Friends, before we bunk down
I'd like us all to join hands for a moment, say a few words to the Spirit of the West.
That's a good idea.
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.
But tonight I want to thank you for bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.
It's a hard life we got.
Sometimes I don't know how we're gonna make it.
But somehow, Sheriff Rango makes me think we will.
We needed a brave man and you sent us one.
Nice to have someone to believe in again.
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Just checking.
- It's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.
You ever feel like those things are looking at you?
That's a Spanish dagger.
But around here, we just call them the Walking Cactus.
Walking?
There's an old legend they actually walk across the desert to find water.
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late watching them, to see if they'd move.
I thought if I could follow them, they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.
Someplace with enough water for everyone.
Night after night, I watched them.
I never saw them move.
But you're still watching.
Who doesn't want to find someplace wonderful?
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.
That's such a lonely sound.
You ever get lonely?
Sometimes.
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer and everyone likes you so much.
- I never made friends easy like that.
- No?
No, we're pretty isolated out there on the ranch, sort of like being sealed up in a little box.
Don't really see a lot of folks.
I wouldn't know what that's like.
There someone special in your life, Rango?
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.
Besides, my life's too dangerous for that kind of thing.
You know, it's an awful solitary existence out there on the prairie.
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.
Beans?
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna whup you like a red-headed stepchild!
Choleric varmints, ain't they?
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.
What's that coming?
It's the water.
I have a plan, and each and every one of you has a part to play.
What do I do?
Spoons, you got the most important job of all.
You stay up here on the ridge, and if anything goes wrong, you give the signal.
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.
Well, actually...
Why can't you be all brainy like your brother?
Pappy, about that water.
There's something I gots to tell you.
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon to thee and thee and thee.
May I present Madame Lupone's
Terpsichorean Troupe of Traveling Thespians!
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians.
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!
The stage is set. The princess prepares to take her own life.
I yearn for love.
Meanwhile, the lone sentry stands watch at the castle gate.
Stands watch at the castle gate...
Hark! Who goes there?
This plot is highly predictable.
Quiet! This is my favorite part.
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father, strucketh by Cupid.
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter and reach for the...
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"
What was that?
Must be that immersive theater.
We got you surrounded!
You and your entire family get your hands up where I can see them.
My entire family?
Grits and spit and collard greens
Waffle chitlins, monkey brains
Refried bones and booger blood
Pickled eggs and flaps of mud
It's a full house.
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves a good old-fashioned standoff.
I'll have you know, you're not looking at our entire contingent.
What's that supposed to be?
That's the signal.
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!
So something's supposed to happen?
I am open to suggestions.
Run!
Get on the wagon!
Should we have ourselves some sport, chill'ens?
I likes it when they run.
Maybelle, give the holler!
Looks like we made it!
That audience was quite responsive.
Yeah, well, I think that chromosome pool is about dried up.
We got bats!
Here! You drive.
Looks like there's gonna be soup tonight!
Come on, let's get some!
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!
Jedidiah! It's time for the Alabama squeeze box!
Okay, Pa!
I am sensing hostility.
Incoming!
Hello!
Goodbye!
Lasso that swine!
I suggest we take evasive action!
I suggest you shut up and shoot!
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!
What was that? Go check it out!
What is it? Is there a problem?
You could call it that.
Headache.
Is that all you got?
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!
Eat lead!
Here, hold these.
Get your hands off me!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jump!
It's impossible.
It can't be. It's empty.
There's no water!
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated the very sustenance of our livelihood!
I think that there fella in the purty dress is the Sheriff.
That's the same fellow what give us a prospecting permit?
- A what?
- Irrelevant! Obfuscation.
You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery and the murder of our beloved financial advisor
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.
We done tunneled into that vault, but there weren't nothing in it.
Somebody done robbed that bank before we robbed it.
Then where'd you get this here jug?
That's what I been trying to tell you, Pappy.
I found it in the desert.
Then why in tarnation did you bring it here?
Hold on! You're saying this here jug was empty when you found it?
That's right.
I don't believe a word of it.
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!
Who'd dump water in the desert?
Wouldn't be the first time.
It's a puzzle!
It's like a big old mammogram!
What's going on, Sheriff?
I don't know.
But I'm going to strip away this mystery and expose its private parts.
You and your kin are coming with me.
They're coming!
Here they come!
Looks like they got them robbers.
Where's the water?
There weren't no water.
Where is he going?
He's going to see the Mayor.
He's got to be pleased with that.
That's a good one, boss!
That's interesting.
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr. Rango, but there's a certain protocol to this game, you understand.
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.
Well, that's good, 'cause you got a few questions to answer and I've got my own protocol.
But why would anyone dump water in the blooming desert?
It does seem a bit naive, taking the word of admitted bank robbers.
Besides, once they hang, your job is done.
- Bravo!
- Job well done.
But what if somebody did rob the bank before they got there?
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
I was hoping you could tell me.
That sounds marginally near to an accusation.
Take it any way you like.
Something you said keeps rattling around in my frontal lobe.
What's that?
"Control the water and you control everything."
Come now, Mr. Rango.
You attribute divine power to me.
How on earth could I possibly control the water?
You've obviously mastered this game.
Well, I've been playing it for many years, sir.
I was here before the highway split this great valley.
I watched the march of progress, and I learned a thing or two.
Perhaps it's time you started to take the long view, begin to appreciate the broad sweep of history.
Look out there, son.
You can almost see time passing.
What are you building out here?
The future, Mr. Rango, the future.
One day soon, all this is going to fade into myth, the frontier town, the lawman, the gunslinger.
There's just no place for them any more.
- We're civilized now.
- That's right, civilized.
That's what the future holds.
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.
Is that what happened to
Mr. Merrimack? Did he get left behind?
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to forget you're just one little lizard.
You seem to forget
I'm the law around these parts.
Our new sheriff has been playing the hero for so long, he's actually starting to believe it.
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.
He never leaves without taking a blooming soul.
Do it!
Now be still. You gotta look presentable to meet your maker.
Death has arrived
How will the hero survive?
The Mayor has bought up all the land in the valley, except for your ranch, Miss Beans.
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.
Unless he controls the water.
Like a monkey's bladder!
Then he could bring it back once he's bought up all the land.
But how does he control the water?
Well, you gotta spend some time and train them.
'Cause you know monkeys, when they do go, you rub their nose in it.
Sheriff, we got a problem.
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.
Get them out here so we can cut off their giblets!
You, too, Spoons?
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.
But this is all his fault!
You said you's gonna bring the water back.
It's just, we got no hope without that water.
We got nothing left to believe in.
You see that sign up there?
As long as that sign says "Sheriff," you can believe that there's law and order in this town.
But without law and order, ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.
Starts out slow, like a fungus.
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.
Neighbor turns on neighbor.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!
And then dogs and cats are getting together to create all sorts of unnatural mutant aberrations!
So, you want something to believe in, Spoons?
Believe in me.
Believe in that there sign.
For as long as it hangs there, we got hope.
Hello, brother.
Thirsty?
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?
Well, you know...
I hear you been telling about how you killed all them Jenkins brothers.
With one bullet, wasn't it?
Isn't that right?
All these good folks here believe your little stories, don't they?
Why, they believe you're just a stone killer, don't they?
Seems these folks trust you.
They think you're gonna save their little town.
They think you're gonna save their little souls!
But we know better, don't we?
So why don't you show your friends here what you're made of?
Show them who you really are.
Why don't you just pull your gun and shoot me?
But, of course, you won't need all these.
Just one, right?
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.
You got killer in your eyes, son?
I don't see it.
You didn't do any of them things you said, did you?
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!
Are you?
- Say it!
- No.
Speak up.
I don't think your friends here heard you.
No.
All you've done is lie to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a fake and a coward. Isn't that right?
Yes.
- Louder!
- Yes.
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.
This is my town now.
If I ever see you again, I will take your soul straight down to hell!
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm nobody.
Golden guardians.
The alabaster carriage.
The Spirit of the West.
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to dig deep to find what you're looking for.
So you made it.
Is this heaven?
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.
Yeah.
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?
Searching, same as you.
I don't even know what I'm looking for any more.
I don't even know who I am.
They used to call you the Man with No Name.
These days they got a name for just about everything.
Doesn't matter what they call you.
It's the deeds make the man.
Yeah, but my deeds just made things worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phony!
My friends believed in me, but they need some kind of hero.
Then be a hero.
No. No, no, you don't understand.
I'm not even supposed to be here.
That's right. You came a long way to find something that isn't out here.
Don't you see? It's not about you.
It's about them.
But I can't go back.
Don't know that you got a choice, son.
No man can walk out on his own story.
So you made it.
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.
Did you just see that?
We each see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
It is.
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.
Many years ago, this entire valley was covered in agua.
Now only one question remains.
Where did it go?
They follow the water.
They follow the water! Come on!
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.
What are you building out here?
The future, Mr. Rango.
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.
I was here before the highway split this great valley.
I watched the march of progress and I learned a thing or two.
Control the water and you control everything.
Come now, Mr. Rango.
You attribute divine power to me.
How on earth could I possibly control the water?
What now, amigo?
No man can walk out on his own story.
I'm going back.
But why?
Because that's who I am.
You got a lot of nerve showing up here, lawman. What is it you want?
Your pappy and them boys are about to hang for something they didn't do.
But I've got a plan.
I appreciate how difficult this is for you, Beans.
But you're making a practical decision.
Decisions, decisions.
There's no need for any more suffering.
Your family's ranch is nothing but a wasteland now.
Sign the deed and relieve yourself of your father's burden.
My daddy was not a burden!
Keep your blood money and I'll keep my land!
Do what he says or, by all the fires of the black pit,
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes out of your skull!
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...
Let me do my job! You brought me in.
Now we're gonna play this thing out to the end!
Sign the damn paper, woman!
Go to hell!
Where do you think I come from?
Look into my eyes.
I want to see you die.
Jake!
I'm calling you out!
Jake!
This day just got a little more interesting.
Put her down.
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?
That's just about the size of it.
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!
All right, Sheriff, make your move.
Now amigos!
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!
That was a bad idea.
Thirsty, brother?
Here it comes!
No. No!
It's a miracle!
Look out!
- Lookee there!
- What is that?
It's our salvation, Pa!
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you, your guts'll be leaking lead!
Well, then it's a good thing I brought some backup.
What?
Ain't no hawk.
Ain't nothing but bats!
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!
It only takes one bullet.
You ain't got the nerve.
Try me.
Oh, Mr. Rango.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.
Now, Mr. Rango.
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.
Help!
Open the door!
Okay, plan B.
Beans, you're mumbling.
All my problems taken care of except for one.
It's a new West, Jake.
There's no room for gunslingers any more. We're businessmen now.
Yeah, we got new hats.
Where I come from, we call this improvisation.
You came back.
What was that?
No need to panic, but I think you just swallowed plan B.
What?
Okay, panic time.
You and the Sheriff are more alike than you think.
You're nothing but legends.
Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed.
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.
How fitting.
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together, we can reach a mutually beneficial solution to our current situation.
You better take it up with him.
One bullet.
I tip my hat to you, one legend to another.
What was that you said?
"Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed."
No, Jake! No!
Rango!
You brought the water back, just like you promised.
You really are a hero.
Well, the thing about heroes is, whenever you...
Don't spoil it.
Right.
Well, I don't know about you all, but I could sure go for a dip.
And so the lizard completes his journey from humble beginnings to the legend we sing of today.
And although he is certain to die, perhaps from a household accident, which account for 65% of all unnatural deaths, the people of the village will honor his memory even as they abandon their dignity.
- I'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?
Water ain't money. Money is money.
- Well, I ain't got no...
- We're talking hard cash.
We have a problem.
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?
I really think you complete me.
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can you keep missing your mark?
What's my motivation?
Oh, you kids.
What did you do that for?
I was just checking.
I hear if you get too sunburnt, you can peel a man's face right off.
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.
Don't touch it.
That's the second time that's happened to me.
This water thing's great.
I'm urinating right now.
Adult swim, next five minutes.
Stay between the buoys.
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there and I picked the raisins out just the way you like it.
Don't forget, your nasal spray is in your saddle-bag...
- Beans!
- ...and your moisturizing lotion...
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.
Sheriff, where are you headed?
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.
Now, honey, you come back with all your digits.
And don't go trying to be a hero.
Beans, you are missing the point.
I got an image to protect now.
Where's my Tic Tacs?
- I found them.
- What's going on?
Well, in order to satisfy the needs of the collective, the hero must abandon the self and solidify his image as an icon that will forever be remembered.
So, this is the sunset shot.
Give them a good one, amigo.
Ready, Excelsior?
My fellow comrades.
There will be times when you doubt yourself.
When you feel pummeled by the cataclysms of life, remember this moment.
Remember me.
Know that I will be there watching you, sometimes at inappropriate moments.
That's part of the deal.
And remember, within all of us resides the true Spirit of the...
Let's take it from the top.
{ Bridgit Mendler:
This Is My Paradise}
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to celebrate the union of two very special individuals.
Two souls that shall become one and shine only more brightly together.
- I can't believe this day is here.
- Won't you please join me in bringing together in marriage a much beloved couple...
Chloe and Papi.
- Oh, Papi.
- Ay, Chihuahua.
Oh, I'm just so happy for them.
{sighs} Me, too.
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
You may all be seated.
{dogs whining}
Sit.
Chloe and Papi, do you take each other to love and honor in good times and bad, in wet nose and dry nose, as long as you both shall live?
{gulps}
- I do.
- I do.
{Papi barks}
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may lick the bride.
{guests applaud}
{Spanish music plays}
{cork pops}
A toast to the newlyweds.
They're perfect together, like Romeo and Juliet.
- Or Dolce & Gabbana.
- Or me and this cake.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
{man} Hey, guys. How you doing?
{hiccups}
Oh. Thank you so much.
{indistinct conversation}
Aunt Viv, you outdid yourself.
This is the most spectacular wedding
I've ever been to.
{sighs} Rachel, isn't it just perfection?
Sam, I love the bougainvillea arches.
And the rosebush topiaries, they're flawless.
You are a landscaping genius.
Thanks, Viv. You know, I really wanted to do something special for your Chloe and my Papi on their big day.
- Only the best for my little girl.
- Oh, cheers.
Besides, I wanna spoil her rotten before
I have to leave her for so long.
I can't believe you and Rachel are gonna be spending six months in the rainforest.
I mean, that's pretty intense.
Are you kidding?
We are gonna have so much fun.
We're gonna be looking for rare plants that could cure diseases.
And you know I love an adventure.
Well, I promise to take good care of the dogs while you guys are away.
{both} Thank you.
Speaking of which, today is about Chloe and Papi.
So, come on. It's time to celebrate.
Let's dance!
Let's dance.
Oh, there goes my diet.
{Spanish music plays}
{sings in Spanish}
I love this song.
{howling to song}
I never thought my dog would get married before me.
Well, maybe it'll be me and you walking down that aisle one day.
I'd like that very much, Rachel.
Some day.
- Some day?
- Some day.
I call this move the Chihuahua Waltz.
You are so light on your paws, mi corazon.
You're not so bad yourself, my love.
Tonight my heart is bursting.
I am the happiest dog alive!
And I'm the luckiest girl ever.
- Oh, look!
- What is it?
A shooting star!
Quick, make a wish.
What more could I ask for, mi corazon?
What do you wish for?
- Well, what about a family?
- Family?
Ay, Chihuahua.
{Papi} Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi!
{up-tempo music}
Geronimo!
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Watch and see how it's done, everyone.
Whee!
{giggles}
I'm next, I'm next!
- Me, me, me, me, me!
- Do it! Do it!
Look out below! Yeah!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Hoo-hoo!
- Oh, no. What are you kids doing?
- Look out, Lala. Here I come!
Don't you dare, Papi, Jr.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
- Gee... I must've slipped.
- Oh! You kids are a mess.
I told you I wanted you clean for the dog park.
I don't know where your father is, but when he hears about this,
- he is gonna be so mad.
- lncoming!
Let me show you how the big dogs do it!
Whoo, hoo-hoo!
Oh!
{growls}
Oh, my love. I didn't see you there.
Come on in. It's really fun.
Oh! Look at me. I'm covered in mud.
Don't you usually pay for a mud mask?
This one's free!
{sighs} You kids get right into the bath.
- But Mom, do we have to?
- I don't wanna take a bath.
Bath now. Or no bacon-wrapped filet mignon for dessert.
- OK.
- OK.
Papi, why do I always have to be the bad guy?
Because you're so good at it?
I had a litter of five puppies, not six.
You need to start being their father, not their playmate.
{groans} I better go get washed up. lf I didn't know any better,
I would think I was in the doghouse.
{whistling}
All right, everyone.
Who's up for the dog park?
{barking}
- We are!
- Hey, Sam.
We're all waiting on you.
Let's go, fool!
Come on, puppies!
{Papi} Rosa, Lala,
Pep, Ali, you're all as beautiful as your mother.
- {girls} Thanks, Daddy.
- Where's Papi, Jr.?
- Papi, Jr.?
- {Papi, Jr.} I'm not coming out.
- Come on, buddy. Let's see your outfit.
- {Papi, Jr.} This is so embarrassing.
I'm sure you look great. Let's see.
I look ridiculous.
Ay! You're right.
You do look ridiculous.
{girls giggle}
{Papi} No son of mine is gonna wear clothes like that.
{Chloe} Oh, Papi.
But he looks so handsome.
- {growls}
- {all laughing}
- There. It's dead now. Let's go.
- Thanks, Dad.
{Chloe} Come on, puppies.
Off to the dog park.
{mid-tempo music}
{chatter}
{barking}
Yay! We're here!
Here we are. You guys are gonna love this place.
But be on your best behavior.
{Chloe} That's right.
This place is very exclusive.
{woman} Your bone, sir.
Ah, a vintage '03.
A most excellent year.
{man} Ready to launch.
- And... paw!
- {beeping}
Fetch, boy. Fetch.
{man} Bow wow. Bow wow.
So I said, ''Honey, I only chase imported cars.'' Zing!
{man} Lunch is served.
- Hi, everyone!
- Chloe!
You have to join us.
This sushi is faboo!
Looks delish!
Not as delish as that retriever over there. Growl.
Where're the kids? I thought you brought the little ones.
- Oh, Papi's watching them.
- {laughs} But who's watching Papi?
{puppies laughing}
Go, Dad!
OK, kids. Today we practice the time-honored tradition of digging.
It is a skill that every dog must know.
We dig in order to stay grounded.
I love dirt!
OK. Ready? Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.
- Left, right. Left, right.
- {Rosa} Look at me! This is fun.
- {Papi} Left, right.
- {Ali} I'm pretty good.
I love digging!
{speaks Spanish}
Dig, my puppies.
Dig with passion. Dig with love.
Dig as if you were burying your favorite bone.
- Ahh!
- {speaks French}
Oh, you idiots. You got me dirty!
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
Pardon me, senorita. My kids got a little carried away with their digging.
- And who said you could speak to me?
- Uh-oh. It's her again.
I'll be right back.
Well, you look like a stray.
How did you even get in here?
- Papi, what's going on?
- {dog speaks French}
As if there weren't enough of you peasants.
Oh, enough with that fake accent.
Everyone knows you're from the Valley.
{scoffs} Your little fluff balls ruined my perm. lf there's a problem here, you say it to me, but leave my kids out of it.
Easy, mama bear.
She's just all mad 'cause she looks like a big, angry Q-tip.
- Oh!
- {woman} No, no, no, no, no!
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo, shoo!
Leave my dog alone.
Scoundrels!
Excuse me, I think we all just got off on the wrong paw.
- Whoa. Is there a problem here?
- {sighs}
You know, this park is for Beverly Hills residents only.
Don't you have dog parks where you live?
- Hey, we have a right to be here.
- Really?
Well then keep your little animals away from Mademoiselle
Marie Appoline Bouvier.
{speaks French}
She is a prizewinning show dog.
Aren't you, baby?
And a three-time champion of the Beverly Hills Dog Show.
{techno music plays}
She can't handle stress.
Then how does she handle you?
Ha-ha! Somebody get some ice for that burn. Whoop!
Come, Appoline. We're done here.
{speaking French}
Friendly.
Hey, Mademoiselle, don't look now, but somebody shaved your heinie!
- {Appoline} Oh!
- {laughing}
Oh, Papi, you're terrible.
Well, my little bandidos, you've had a very full day.
{speaks Spanish}
Can't we stay up ten more minutes, Papa?
- {all} Please?
- Tell us a story!
- {Ali} Come on.
- OK. Settle down now.
I promised your mother
I would put you to bed.
She is the love of my life, and I would do anything to make her happy.
- Gross. No more love talk.
- Your mother is everything to me.
I remember the first time we rubbed noses.
- Eww! Yuck.
- Eww. Grody.
Dad, who wants to hear about love?
What? Love is the most important thing in the world.
Let me tell you a story about your great ancestors.
Now listen to this.
Long ago in ancient times...
...inside the huge temples there were hidden tunnels built just for Chihuahuas to carry messages for their humans.
{Spanish music plays}
{dog barks}
{Papi} The Chihuahuas were trusted to carry the most precious secrets to their kingdoms.
Sometimes, they were messages of love.
The Chihuahuas faced great danger to deliver these messages and did so proudly.
They knew true love is worth any risk.
Now, my little Chihuahua Warriors, love fearlessly, and help others share their hearts as well.
- Good night.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.
Good night, Papa.
{pop music plays}
Mi amor, you can soak as long as you want.
The children are asleep, like angels.
Oh. That sounds wonderful.
Oh, yes. Just go ahead and relax all night. Papi has done the deed.
{whistling}
{sighs} You want me to look at them sleeping, don't you?
Yes. Very much.
- {puppies shouting}
- {cloth tearing}
Oh! What is going on in here?
{glass shattering}
We're digging tunnels to carry our messages of love.
- Yep. We sure are.
- It's so romantic.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
I wonder where the kids could get an idea like that, Papi?
- I have no idea. Right, kids?
- {Pep} Look at me!
We got them from your story, silly.
- Yeah. Dad told us all about it.
- Thanks, rats. I mean ''kids.''
Papi, I sent you up here to put them to bed, not to rile them up.
But I didn't wanna ruin their fun.
Besides, they're just puppies.
They don't know any better.
{Chloe} So, it's up to us to teach them.
You can't be afraid to discipline them.
Afraid? I'm not afraid.
I just don't like that part.
OK, I want everyone in bed this minute.
- OK.
- OK.
I'm digging fast. Try and beat me.
Don't make me put you back in that sailor outfit, Papi, Jr.
Oh, look at the time. Good night.
{Chloe} Come on.
Everyone off to bed. Let's go.
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry, Mama.
Sorry, Mama.
This dad business is harder than I thought.
I shoulda read the manual.
What is...
Hey, I...
OK, OK. I'm up.
- {dogs barking}
- I'm up.
I know you guys are excited about meeting my side of the family today, but at least let me get dressed first.
{pop music plays}
So, what do you guys think of where your dad and I grew up?
{barking}
- Ah. So many great memories.
- Oh, Papi. It's so colorful.
- Wow, Dad.
- This is so cool.
Oh, look, kids. Over there.
That's Dad's first fire hydrant.
{all} Wow!
Ooh! I got a bone hidden right there.
{puppies exclaiming}
{Papi} Hey, Junior!
What's going on? It's Papi!
{Papi, Jr.} Hi!
{Ali} lce cream!
Can we get some ice cream, Dad?
- {girls} Yeah, ice cream!
- {Chloe} Now, kids...
All in good time, kids.
First, you must meet my family.
- Hey, guys. We're here.
- Wow. Home sweet home.
Come on, kids! Vamanos!
- Yay! We're here!
- {Sam} Hey, Ma!
- Ha-ha! Papi's home.
- Hey, Dad!
Come meet your grandpuppies!
- {speaks Spanish}
- Hey.
{Sam} Here you guys go.
- {speaks Spanish}
- Hey.
Pedro! Come here, boy!
Come, come, come!
Meet your nieces and nephew, eh?
- Hi, there.
- Hello.
- Hi, there.
- {puppies screaming}
It's a Chupacabra!
- He's gonna eat us!
- Help us!
- Run for your lives!
- It's Dogzilla!
- Run!
- Help!
Huh?
- Bro, you gotta work on that smile.
- That was a smile?
Chloe, kids, I'd like you to meet, mi hermano, Pedro.
- Give me some paw.
- Up high.
What?
Huh?
- Hi, everyone.
- Hmm?
Oh, Pedro. It's so good to finally meet you.
Chloe, you are even lovelier than I imagined.
I'm sorry I was not here to greet you.
I saw a butterfly in the yard whose wing was caught in a blade of grass, and I had to blow on it to set it free.
How can you and Dad be brothers?
You don't look anything alike.
They're not real brothers, silly.
They grew up on the streets together.
That doesn't make our brotherhood any less real, kids.
Family is about who you love, not just who you're born to.
Well said, mi hermano.
- {water running}
- Dad, what are these?
- {water shuts off}
- {guitar playing}
What are all these bills?
We should tell him, Fernando.
Tell me what?
You kids go in the backyard and play.
It's time for the adults to talk.
Ma!
- Do we have to?
- Now. Off you go.
- {Pep} Oh, man.
- No fair.
{Lala} Yeah, what's the big secret, anyway?
{puppies} Yeah?
Why don't the adults go outside?
- Not us.
- Wait for me!
I haven't been able to make the mortgage payments, mijo.
I mean, an eviction letter?
Dad, why didn't you tell me?
I thought I could catch up with the payments.
The man came from the bank.
- What are they saying, Papi, Jr.?
- {grunts}
I can't see. Wait. I got an idea.
What about all the money from the landscaping jobs?
Ever since I threw my back out,
I haven't been able to work.
We've lost a lot of jobs with the company down to just you, hijo.
{faint bark}
There's gotta be somebody we can ask to borrow the money from.
Hold still! {grunting}
Pee-yew! Your paws smell.
Can you hurry, Papi, Jr.?
I have to tinkle.
- Don't even think about it, Ali.
- Guys, shh. I'm trying to listen.
- What about Viv?
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.
We will not burden anyone with our problems.
This is a family affair.
Uh-oh.
I can't hold you guys much longer.
{all} Whoa!
Oh, no!
- We're going down!
- {all shouting}
{grunts}
What did you find out, Papi, Jr.?
Not much. But, I did find out where Pedro likes to poop.
Pee-yew!
The Cortezes have always pulled themselves up.
- What if we can't?
- We will lose the house.
What?
Well, your mother and I will have to go live with my sister and her family
- in Arizona.
- It's so far.
I'll never see you guys.
And they live in that tiny little apartment. I mean, what about Pedro?
{whines}
Oh, my heart is breaking.
It's only until we can save some money.
We'll go to the bank first thing in the morning. It's gonna be OK.
- Good.
- They can't lose this place.
This was my first home.
Before this house, we were on the streets.
Find anything in there, Papi?
Just this stylish hat.
Hey, Pedro, I'm hungry.
- {man} Hey, you mutts, get out of here!
- It's him again! Run!
{Papi} Yep.
Life on the streets was no picnic.
But then one day, all that changed...
...when Sam and his parents adopted us.
Suddenly, we had a family.
Papi, I know how much this home means to you.
- To all of us.
- They gave us a home.
Now we gotta do everything we can to help them keep it.
Oh, yes, Cortez.
Gentlemen, I'd really like to help you out, but my hands are tied.
You're just too far behind on your payments.
- What are we gonna do? I don't...
- {Papi barks}
Try begging, Sam.
It works when I want your burrito.
{groans} Didn't realize you brought your dog.
Fun. I'm really more of a cat person myself.
Huh? Hmm?
- Little Prince Albert.
- Oh, now I know what's wrong with you. lsn't he a cutie?
Look, sir, this is our home.
Our life is there.
- Our memories.
- Our squeaky toys.
Well, memories don't pay the bills.
Now, you've received your final notice and once that happens the bank can only give you till the end of the month.
Now, that's... for you, let's see, that means you have three weeks to come up with...
...wow, $40,000.
Now, if you don't get us the money by then, the house is ours.
Do you accept Mexican Express?
There's no way we can come up with all that money in three weeks.
Look, gentlemen, I am really sorry
I couldn't help you out.
You know what? Please, take one of these free pens for your troubles, huh?
Here you go.
Oop! Not that one. They have to qualify you for a loan for that.
Just one each.
Just one. Fine. OK.
{clears throat}
Ahh.
A pen. They take your house and they give you a pen.
OK, mis ninos, everyone to bed.
Are you scared about losing this house, Daddy?
Well, yes. I am.
But, you're not supposed to get scared.
- Yeah. You're the dad.
- Right. Well...
- Oh! You know who was always brave?
- Chihuahua Warriors!
Yes! Now let me tell you a story that will make you feel better.
{girls} Yeah!
Long ago, tribes would all work together as one family and the young would be nurtured and cared for by the entire tribe.
But the whole village would be watched over by the brave and mighty Chihuahua...
...which is lucky, because on this day a vicious snake was looking for an easy victim.
{hissing}
And the mighty Chihuahua swung into action, grabbing the snake with its jaws and wrestling it to the ground.
- {screams}
- {growls, barks}
{Papi} And even the mightiest human warriors were impressed with this brave little dog.
He was the hero to the whole village, but most of all, he was a hero to his own family.
- {puppies} Wow!
- Wow. I'm afraid of snakes.
- Me, too.
- Not the Chihuahua Warriors.
They weren't afraid of anything.
Right, Dad?
Of course they were afraid.
Everyone has fears.
The difference is, a Chihuahua Warrior has the courage to face their fears.
- Even of snakes?
- {chuckles} Yes. Even of snakes.
Buenas noches, my brave little
Chihuahua Warriors! Sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.
Hey! You guys see that? That vine looks like a snake.
That's a branch, silly.
{hissing}
No, look! It's a ferocious beast.
- {Pep} Yeah, let's get it.
- {Lala} Yeah.
So? Are they asleep this time?
Go ahead, check. I assure you, they are peacefully asleep.
- {puppies barking}
- {nervous chuckle}
On second thought, I'll be right back!
Get it, Papi, Jr.!
- Get over here now, you evil beast.
- {Ali} Get the snake!
I got you right where I want you.
- {girls} Yeah! You can do it!
- Kids! Kids!
You need to tone it down before your mom...
Oh, let me guess, you told them another story.
Papi, Jr. is a brave
Chihuahua Warrior. See?
What on earth are you doing?
- {creaking}
- Whoa!
- Get down from there!
- No!
{screaming}
- {dog growls}
- {crashing}
{Chloe} Delgado!
{girls whimpering}
Oh, I've never been so happy to see someone in my whole life!
Hello, princesa. I believe this little one belongs to you.
Thank goodness you were here.
I'm forever in your debt, Delgado.
Papi, Jr., you go back to bed this instant and never do that again.
I was just trying to be a brave
Chihuahua Warrior,
- like in Dad's stories.
- {girls laughing}
Papi!
Well, I guess he didn't read the fine print where I said,
- ''Don't try this at home.''
- Thanks, Delgado.
- And nice catch.
- {dogs barking}
- What's going on out here?
- Sam?
- Delgado?
- Papi, I see you still have your human.
- I don't believe it.
- Don't get all mushy on me now.
How did you get here all the way from Mexico?
I better call your partner, Detective
Ramirez, and find out what's up.
- Delgado, how did you find us?
- The scent.
Chloe's the only dog I know who wears Chanel No. 5.
Pedro, this is the amigo
I told you about, the one that kept mi corazon safe when she was lost in Mexico.
It's a true honor to meet you.
Maybe don't flash that grill, bro.
What are you doing in Los Angeles, Delgado?
I'm here on assignment. Police business.
I know. It's a jewel heist, isn't it?
Or counterfeiters.
Or kidnappers...
I can see you haven't changed a bit, kid.
I bet you're tracking a cat burglar, right?
I can't tell you, but I can use your help.
Will you come with me on a special assignment tomorrow?
Delgado, I would do anything for you.
Wow.
All right, Detective Ramirez, will do.
So you met this dog in Mexico, and now he found you here in Los Angeles?
{Sam} Yeah,
I don't know why he came here.
But Detective Ramirez said that they're wrapping up a big case down there and that, they won't be able to pick him up for a few weeks.
I said we'd look after him until they come.
- Come on, guys. Let's get back to bed.
- We're so glad you're here, my friend.
{Delgado} Glad to be here, amigo.
{Chloe} Come on, Delgado.
I'll show you where you can stay.
You OK, bro?
No, I think I messed up tonight, Pedro.
Papi, Jr. could have gotten very hurt.
I just hope I can be the father that
Chloe wants me to be.
Any mutt can have puppies, but it takes a real dog to be a father.
Just follow your heart.
{Papi chuckles} My heart is what keeps getting me in trouble.
{sirens blaring}
{Chloe} What are we doing at the police station?
What's so secret?
Am I some sort of lookout?
- No. No.
- Do we need disguises?
- Are we here to meet our contacts?
- No!
Maybe...
Maybe we should have code names.
Mine's gonna be ''White Fox.'' Yeah!
And yours should be... Ohh, I know,
''Jellybean''!
No. Chloe, I just need you to be here, OK? Because...
{dogs barking}
This is a bad idea.
Maybe we should go.
Look. Those two dogs are coming this way.
- What are you doing here?
- We're here on the big case with you.
Delgado, I mean,
- ''Jellybean'' and I are old partners.
- Chloe!
I came all the way from Mexico.
I have something to tell you.
- It's important.
- Look, we're kind of busy right now.
- We're working on a bank robbery case.
- Bank robbery!
You can totally count on White Fox and Jellybean to have your back.
Not if one of them happens to be your father. He's never had our back.
{whistles} Let's go.
- We have to go now.
- Bye.
- ''Father''? Is that a code word?
- No. Those are my sons.
''Sons''? I had no idea you had sons.
I thought with you by my side, I'd have the strength to tell them the truth.
Forget it. I can't change the past now.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Chloe.
{mid-tempo music}
Oh, Sam, there must be something we can do. I'm gonna ask Aunt Viv.
{Sam} No, no, no.
My father's very proud.
Borrowing money is something he just can't do.
- I'm gonna come home.
- No, it's OK.
I think I found it. I think this is it!
Rachel, you and Aunt Viv are doing important research down there.
We'll figure something out.
I love you, Sam.
I'm here for you if you need me.
You know, I should go.
I'm not making very good company right now. So... talk to you soon.
OK. Bye.
{phone beeps off}
Was that Rachel on the phone?
- Hmm?
- Yep.
So, when am I gonna start planning the wedding?
I've already picked out my dress.
Ma, come on.
I love Rachel.
You know, I think she's great.
- So?
- I'm just... I'm you know, I'm worried.
{mother} What are you worried about?
I'm worried I won't be able to give her the life she deserves.
Huh.
You just don't get it, do you?
You both love each other, and that's what's important.
The rest will work itself out.
{sighs} Man, Papi.
What am I gonna do?
I'm scared I won't be...
- ...won't be enough.
- Won't be enough.
I feel you, man. I feel you.
{door knocker banging}
- Were you expecting anyone?
- No.
- Oh! I hope it's pizza.
- For breakfast?
- {Papi} What? Any time is pizza time!
- {knocker continues}
Hello? Hello?
Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry.
Did we wake you up?
You know what? Good for you.
To be in this much debt and still be able to sleep like a baby?
That's a gift. I'm Mr. Kroop.
We met the other day at the bank.
How could I forget? You gave me a pen.
Yes, I did. And now,
I'm giving you a notice.
I'm here to inspect the house since the bank will be...
...selling it once you're out.
Let's move, people. Could we get some coffee? That'd be great.
{stammers}
{dogs barking}
{groans} More dogs.
Lovely. Morning!
- Samuel, what's going on?
- They can't just come in like this.
There's nothing we can do.
They have the right.
Come on, everyone. They're not taking this house so easily.
- {puppies} Yeah!
- Let's go.
{barking}
Hi, there! Can we all just get along?
- {barks}
- {shouting}
Adios.
Ooh. Good thing that table was there to break his fall.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come on. That's not yours.
Give it to me. Put it down.
Come on.
- Let go.
- You let go.
Bad lady. Very bad lady!
- Give it to me!
- Be careful what you wish for.
{shouting, grunting}
- {crashing}
- {puppies laugh}
Good one.
OK. Now, I need you to sign some documents.
I need you to sign here, here and...
{grunting}
I probably wouldn't use...
These almost never work.
So why don't we use mine.
- {barks}
- {groans}
{stammers} I'm not really a dog person.
I just...
I... Could you just...
Could you just step off the papers?
They're kind of important.
Put the pen down.
- You wouldn't dare.
- Just try me, cat man.
- {urinating}
- Ohh...
Whoo!
- I feel better now.
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- Hey!
Bad dog! Bad dog!
Come back here!
Where you going? Drop it! Leave it!
Bad dog!
Whoa! {grunts}
{gasping}
Looking for this?
{panting}
This is a madhouse!
I am officially evicting you from this property.
- What? We have three weeks!
- You can't do this to us.
{laughs} Yes, I can.
Your dogs have ruined this house, and this house is about to belong to the bank.
You know I could have the sheriff here?
Hmm? Would you like that?
I want you out of here by tonight, before your little rats can do any more damage.
I'll take this back.
Thank you very much.
What do we do now? Sleep in the streets?
{Sam} Don't worry. You guys are gonna be comfortable here.
{puppies barking}
- How many people live here?
- One.
Must be a giant.
Aunt Viv said you could stay as long as you need.
Oh. I'm too depressed to eat.
{sighs}
This is some place, huh, Ma?
Even the doghouse is bigger than our place.
{sobs} Excuse me.
I'm just trying to cheer her up.
I know.
I'll go talk to her.
Hey.
''Beverly Hills Dog Show''?
$50,000 prize? That's it!
We should enter the dog show.
- Papi, look!
- My love, you're a genius. lf we win, the money would save the house.
{Appoline laughing}
You think you could win the dog show? lmpossible. It is always moi.
Do not make me laugh. Chihuahua?
More like ''chi-ha-ha.''
Oh, ho, ho.
That's it. You're going down, Frenchy!
We're gonna do this. Let's tell Sam.
{both barking}
What's gotten into you two?
Hello! I wanna do the dog show.
Look at you posing.
Dog show.
Wait a second. Oh, my gosh.
You guys could be in the dog show.
That $50,000 prize could save the house.
- Good idea, Chloe.
- Finally. Guys are so slow.
{owl hooting}
{Papi} Is he nervous about the dog show?
{Chloe} No, it's not that.
Looks like he could use a friend.
- You OK, amigo?
- Yeah. Sure.
I know you're worried about your sons.
Please tell us what happened, Delgado.
We're your friends. You can trust us.
{sighs}
About three years ago, when I was on the force in Mexico, we apprehended some really bad guys.
{gunshots}
We also got their dogs.
Those dogs said they'd get their revenge by hurting my pups.
{pups whimpering}
{doorbell rings}
So I took my boys out of the country and brought 'em to Los Angeles.
Thought they'd be safer away from me.
It was the hardest thing I've ever done.
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
I went into hiding and I lost contact with my sons.
And as time went by,
I knew I had to find them again.
But now they think
I abandoned them for no reason.
But if you tell them what happened, they'll understand.
Hmm...
My sons won't listen to me. After the dog show, I'm going back to Mexico.
Poor Delgado.
We gotta do something to help him.
{Papi sighs}
- Dad?
- Oh, sorry to wake you, son.
- Go back to sleep.
- We can't sleep.
Yeah. We're too worried about our family splitting up.
- I know, ninos.
- {Lala} Tell us another story, Daddy.
Yeah. Another one about the Chihuahua Warriors.
No, I really shouldn't.
Remember what happened last time?
- Oh, Daddy.
- Come on, Daddy.
- Yeah, Dad. Please?
- {chuckles} OK. All right.
You see, the Chihuahua Warriors, they were not just brave and passionate.
They were also fiercely loyal to their fellow Chihuahuas and to their humans.
- They were?
- Oh, yes. ln ancient times, they used to follow their humans into battle.
Fighting for their kingdom was often very fierce.
But they knew that even in times of great danger, they must stand by their friends and warn them of their attacking enemies.
{shouts}
Even at the risk of their own lives.
{battle music}
- {shouts}
- {all shouting}
That Chihuahua saved the king's life?
Yes. Stick by your loved ones, even in hard times.
We are stronger together than we are alone.
From now on, we'll be the most loyal Chihuahuas ever, and we'll never let our family split up.
{chuckling} I know you won't.
Sleep tight.
{Papi, Jr.} Good night, Dad.
- {Ali, Lala} Good night, Daddy.
- {Rosa} Good night, Papa.
...was the best in breed.
Think like a winner, be a winner!
Think like a winner, be a winner!
- Top of the morning to you.
- Likewise.
{barking}
- Yes, thank you.
- Oh, yes. Sure. Very nice.
That is one big check. Sam, you're gonna need a bigger wallet.
Pretty. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
How ya doing, buddy?
Is it me, or is it hard to tell the dogs from their owners?
Hey, man, don't flatter yourself.
{indistinct chatter}
May I help you?
I hope so.
We're here to enter the dog show.
Oh.
- Buenos dias.
- With these dogs?
This is a very prestigious dog show.
Dogs train for years to be prepared.
I am not sure you or your dogs have what it takes.
Well, I think we just might surprise you.
I doubt it.
But in the meantime, you could fill out these forms.
- Oh, hello!
- Hi.
Good to see you.
- Let me get your paperwork.
- Yes, thank you.
Beautiful, darling, beautiful.
Look this way.
Little higher. There you go.
Thank you. Appoline, right here.
{groans} Do I smell garbage?
Oh, oh, no.
It is just the peasant dogs.
{all laughing}
Oh, we're the ones that smell, huh?
Well, there's a reason ''poodle'' starts with the word ''poo''!
Good one.
{groans}
{man on TV} And now, live from
Beverly Hills, California...
Yay! It's starting!
{all cheering}
Oh! They just have to win!
I've got all my paws crossed.
This is more nerve racking than a trip to the vet!
Oh, will you Chatty Cathys shush!
And the 25th Annual Beverly Hills
Dog Show is now underway.
And, Polly, we have got dogs from all over the world competing in three different categories:
Beauty, style, talent.
Gonna see who the top dog is, winning that $50,000 grand prize.

- Oh, look!
Here comes our panel of judges, led by the esteemed Judge McKible.
All right, people, two minutes to show time.

And we are off with the first round:
Beauty.

Fantastic!

- Yeah, look at that.
{whines}
I wouldn't put money on that one.
{groans}

Uncle Delgado looks so sad.
And he's gonna lose his sons, too.
It is time for the second round: Style.
And only ten contestants remain in the competition.
{pop music plays}
Fashion.
I'm gonna get stung.
I'm just so happy to be here.
I just can't help but...
Wait! Don't do a Pedro! Don't...
{music ends abruptly}
- {all gasping}
- {groans}
...smile.
Disqualified!
{pop music plays}
Look at that.
Yikes! Looks like a cupcake exploded.
Bravissimo!
There's my ride.
{man wolf whistles}
Ay, Chihuahua!
Now, I like this one.
This one I really do like.
- It's like a little angel. Right?
- Yes, exactly.
- {Spanish music plays}
- {Polly} Whoa!
Chihuahua Aztec Warrior!
Fantastic!
- {Papi, Jr.} There's Dad! There's Dad!
- Oh, he's bursting with pizzazz!
- Go, Dad!

- Whoo-hoo!
Well, we are on to Round Three: Talent!
And with only five dogs left, this competition is really heating up! Yowza!
{techno music plays}
Oh! Faboo!
- Oh!
- Ooh! That one was faboo, too.
- Faboo. I'm gonna start saying that.
- Oh.
Faboo!
No, no.
Snooty. Snooty puss. Got a snooty puss.
- {clears throat}
- {song ends}
{classical music}
- Wow. She's good.
- That is amazing.
And voila!
- {music ends}
- {audience gasps}
Look at that. Oh, marvelous.
- Clever! Clever!
- {Polly} My gosh. That's so impressive.
- {man} That's clever.
- It's an homage. It is an homage!
Wow. That Appoline is a regular Pet-casso.
- You get that?
- I got it.
- Yes, yes. Very clever.
- Pet-casso.
{orchestra tuning instruments}
{flashbulbs}
{plays classical piece}
- Oh. Mmm.
- Hmm. Ahh.
- {hits wrong note}
- Oops!
No! No, no, no! Dismissed!
What? Oh, you have gotta be kidding!
- {Polly} Not fair.
- It's a dog! Playing a piano. lf you can't play it right, you shouldn't play it at all.
{audience boos}
Playing the piano with paws.
Not even fingers.
- Boo! Not faboo.
- Sorry.
What is going on?
How dare you!
My Chloe is the most beautiful, the most stylish and the most talented dog in the entire world!
She has a coat like the whitest of snow, and eyes that sparkle like diamonds, and a heart as big as...
Well, as big as...
Why don't I just show you?
{Spanish music}
Papi, what are you doing?
{Papi speaks Spanish}
She has a heart as big as this one.
{audience cheers, applauds}
My Chloe will live in my heart forever.
Now that's talent.
- {groans}
- Humph!
{man whistles}
{crowd} Papi! Papi! Papi!
Papi! Papi! Papi!
Papi! Papi! Papi!
I'll tell you, Appoline has some serious competition this year,
- and his name is Papi!
- Papi. I love you, Papi!
Oh, Papi, te adoro.
{crowd} Awww!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have chosen this year's finalists, and they are... Papi Cortez...
Yes!
- ...and Appoline Bouvier.
- Yes!
{clears throat} Judge McKible.
What's this?
I don't know, but Judge McKible looks very concerned.
Mr. Cortez, you do realize the Beverly Hills Dog Show is for purebreds only.
Do you have Papi's birth papers showing his pedigree?
No, we rescued him from the street.
He was a stray.
I knew it.
He might not have breeding papers or a pedigree, but you'll never meet a dog that shows more pure Chihuahua heart...
...than Papi.
Fight the tears. I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna do it. Not gonna cry.
{audience applauds}
- Bravo.
- {woman} So important.
{man} Hear, hear.
- {woman 2} Well said.
- I'm sorry, rules are rules.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Papi Cortez has been disqualified for lack of breeding papers.
{all groaning}
- I'm so upset.
- Oh, no.
The winner of the 25th annual
Beverly Hills Dog Show
- for the fourth year in a row is...
- Mademoiselle Marie Appoline Bouvier!
These dogs aren't the only thing fixed about this competition.
We won! {squeals, laughs}
Thank you.
We won.
Au revoir. {laughs}
{Sam} Let's go, guys.
{emcee} That's it for the Beverly Hills Dog Show.
This is loco. I can't even watch.
- Oh, no.
- It's not fair.
Hmm...
I know something we can do.
{birds calling}
{satellite phone rings}
- Hello?
- {Sam} Rach?
Sam, how'd it go?
- Not so good.
- {Rachel} Oh, no.
{Sam} Yeah, now we have two days to pack up the house and move on.
- Oh, Sam.
- I'm going to Arizona for a little while to get them set up.
I already contacted Viv's housekeeper about watching the dogs.
- I can come too, if you want.
- Nah, that's OK.
- This is a family thing.
- I... thought we were family.
You know, that we would get married and have kids someday.
Rach, I can't take care of you and a family when I can hardly take care of the one I already have.
Oh, I see.
I should go, they need me here.
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Rach.
{Papi} Oh, Sam, love is like chasing your tail, spinning and spinning...
And trust me, it hurts when you catch it.
Papi, come quick! The puppies are gone!
I can't find them anywhere!
- What? Gone?
- Oh, no.
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe they're hiding somewhere.
- {Papi} Ninos! Hey, this isn't funny.
- {Chloe} Kids! Where are you?
The scent's old.
They're not in the house. lf anything happens to them,
I don't know what I'll do.
Don't worry, mi amor,
I will not let that happen.
Oh! Where could they be?
This is scary. We've never been out by ourselves before.
Don't you want to be real Chihuahua Warriors,
- like the ones in Dad's stories?
- {girls} Yeah.
Then we have to help Uncle Delgado.
'Cause families stick together and Delgado is family.
Now, this is where Delgado said his sons work.
We'll just tell them the truth and they'll forgive him.
{man on radio} Attention, all units.
Attention all units.
We have a robbery in progress at Southcoast Bank. All units respond.
We got a situation, everybody.
Round up the dogs and move out!
- Quick time, double time, let's go!
- {officer} Come on.
{Papi, Jr.} Hey, those dogs look just like Uncle Delgado.
That must be them. Let's go!
{officer 2} Let's get 'em in.
Close 'er up!
Go! Go! Go!
{man on radio} K-9 unit, what's your status?
Yes, this is the K-9 unit, is mobile and on the move.
Hey, what are you doing in here?
This is police property.
We're friends with your dad, and we've got something to tell you.
{indistinct shouting}
{siren blares}
{all} Whoa!
Move it, move it! Move, move, move!
- {officer 1} Copy that. Go, go!
- {officer 2} Keep going!
- {officer 3} Second unit, in. Go!
- Come on. Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
{officer 4} Let's go. Right there!
{indistinct shouting}
Come on, boys!
Come on, boys! Catch the scent!
We'll talk more about this after.
Stay here, we don't want you getting hurt.
Come on, boys. Let's go.
Oh, no. We didn't tell them Uncle
Delgado's leaving LA soon. Come on!
{Sam} Uh-huh. Yes, five puppies. Yeah.
Well, if you see them, please give us a call.
- Any news?
- I feel terrible.
I put those stories in their heads.
When will I ever learn?
{man on TV}...where a bank robbery is in progress.
Hey, isn't that our bank?
- Turn it up.
- It is our bank.
Police have informed us that the robbers are still inside.
At this time, there are no hostages.
- Did I just see what I think I saw?
- Yes! It's them!
We will keep you updated on this breaking story as events unfold.
- Guacamole's going on here?
- I'm going to the bank.
Mom, Dad, you guys stay here in case anyone calls and gets them first.
- Of course.
- Please hurry, Sam.
- They're my puppies. I'm going too.
- Not without me.
Delgado, Pedro, let's roll.
I don't see Delgado's sons.
Where'd they go?
I bet they went that way.
Follow me.
Oh, no. What if we never find them?
Oh, I mean, of course we'll find them.
We're Warriors.
Antonio! Alberto! Where are you?
- {puppies shout}
- This is scary.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Oh, presents! Oh, boy, is it Christmas?
Hey, look. This is what everyone's been saying we need.
We can save the house with this.
Everyone, get as much of it as you can.
{Ali} Yeah! Come on, guys.
- {Lala} I'm next. I'm next. Me me, me.
- {Pep} Wow. Look at all this.
{man} Come on, the coast is clear.
Come on, come on. Come on.
{Papi, Jr.} Hey, what's going on here?
- {Pep} Who turned out the lights?
- Hurry up.
- {Ali} What's going on?
- {Lala} Get us out of here.
- {Papi, Jr.} What's the big idea?
- {Ali} What's happening?
- {Papi, Jr.} It's dark in here.
- Go!
{engine revs}
{tires squeal}
{officer} What?
Gone? Are you sure?
Please, stand back here.
I'm sorry, folks. You're just gonna have to stay back.
- You guys, wait here.
- No way, those are my kids you're talking about.
Come on, let's go.
{Kroop} Yeah, I can't say anything right now, ma'am.
- Sorry about that, but I can't.
- {woman} What exactly happened?
There were at least 1 5 or 20 of them.
They were ninja fast, and they all were very, very large, but I fought four or five of them off myself.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a crime scene, sir. I need you to step back.
Right, sorry. Did you happen to see five
Chihuahua puppies around here?
Puppies?
I got their scent. Come on.
They were just here.
Search for clues.
Hey. Look at this.
Look what I found.
Great, a clue!
A ski mask? You think it has something to do with the kids?
- Yeah?
- I know who can help us. Come on.
You can do this, Delgado. Go talk to them. I'll be right behind you.
Dad? What are you doing here?
Look, I know you don't want to see me right now, but I got some missing puppies.
And I think this may be a clue as to where they went. Any ideas?
Smells like flour. Eggs. Butter.
- Bread. It's bread.
- Any bakeries around here?
Oh, of course. The Hoffman
Bread factory! It's right near here.
Good job, kid. Let's go get your pups.
We'll grab the humans and meet you there.
Thanks, boys.
Come on, everyone. Vamonos.
Oh, no.
Oh, where are they going?
Where are they going?
- Whoa!
- {Papi imitates siren}
Police business, look out!
Coming through.
{horns honking}
{Papi} Watch out, dog crossing!
Whoo-whoo!
- {buzzer sounds}
- {machines starting up}
Hey, better hurry up before the foreman shows up.
Yeah, like he'd ever notice.
How many of these jobs we pulled off in the last few months?
Yeah, we just hit the on button and the machines do all the work.
It's a perfect cover.
{sniffs} This smells like the place.
- {all sniffing}
- Ooh!
- Pumpernickel.
- Let's go.
Those guys in there can be real meanies.
You got some kind of a plan?
{Papi} Don't I always, hermano?
- {Ali} Help!
- {pep} Somebody help us!
- {Lala} Let us out!
- {thieves laughing}
- Let's see how much we got.
- {barking}
- Whoa.
- {growls}
- Who brought the dog?
- I didn't bring the dog.
Back off, mister. You can't kidnap us and get away with it.
- {all exclaiming}
- Sounds like a rubber duck.
- That guy is tough.
- Bring it on, ese.
- I'm a Chihuahua Warrior.
- What are you gonna do, bite my toe?
Wow, look how tough he thinks he is.
Wow. I'm really good.
- {Pedro snarling}
- {all murmuring}
- Nice doggy.
- Back away from the puppies!
And in case you're wondering, this isn't a smile.
Easy. Nice doggy.
- Who you callin' ''nice''?
- I'm outta here.
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
Split up! Split up!
Uncle Pedro. You found us!
I mean, not that I needed your help or anything. But they're getting away!
Don't worry. They won't get far.
{barking}
- There's the signal.
- Ready?
Ready.
{Ali} Help! I wanna go home!
Ah! {grunts}
- Gee, that was kinda fun.
- Oh, whoa.
Whew!
Oh! Thank goodness you're OK.
- Mom?
- Delgado!
Looks like we still make a pretty good team, Jellybean.
- I mean, Delgado.
- Yeah, we still got it, kid.
But let's not make a habit of this rescuing thing.
{panting} We lost 'em.
{puppies whining}
{Papi} lncoming!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
No one messes with my kids.
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right.
- What's going on?
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right!
You think that's gonna stop us?
No, but this will.
{buzzer sounds}
- {machine starts}
- {gasps}
{both gasp, shout}
{muffled voices}
Now you guys are really rollin' in the dough.
Whoop! {laughs}
{both grunting}
- Daddy, that was awesome!
- Wow, Dad, that was amazing!
- That was awesome.
- We showed them, huh?
Your mother and I were worried sick.
What you kids did, leavin' home without tellin' us, was off-leash.
Way off-leash!
- Sorry, Dad.
- We're sorry, Dad.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry isn't good enough.
You kids are grounded for the...
- ...rest of your lives!
- {puppies gasp}
- {Ali} What?
- No way!
Papi, their intentions were in the right place and, if it wasn't for them,
- the bank robbers would've gotten away.
- True.
So, what, two weeks?
Don't you think they've shown that they are good Chihuahua Warriors?
OK, you're grounded for one week.
And no bacon-wrapped filet mignon.
{puppies groaning}
- No.
- Come on, Dad.
OK, OK, you can have 'em.
But act like you don't like 'em.
- OK, Dad.
- Promise.
Papi, I'm so proud of you.
You're really becoming the father
I always knew you could be.
Thank you, mi corazon.
- {sirens}
- {indistinct radio chatter}
- OK, our bus is ready.
- You got the wrong guy.
- Yeah, yeah. We're bread makers.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
- I hope you got a good lawyer.
- I hate dogs.
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
Come on, Delgado. Turn around.
{dog} Dad, wait.
I think we owe you an apology.
Chloe and the puppies told us why you left.
We didn't know that you did it to protect us. Thank you, Dad.
I'm just glad I got a chance to see you boys again. Make things right.
{sighs}
Come on, guys.
Quite the police dog, fella.
Let's see who you belong to.
''Mexican Police Force'', huh?
I wonder if they'd let us borrow you for a little while.
We sure could use your nose on a couple of cases. What do you boys think?
OK, OK. Let me give 'em a call.
You want me to stay?
Yeah, I think we have a lot of catching up to do.
- {officer} Come on, guys.
- It's great to have you back, Dad.
It looks like you're gonna be a Beverly Hills dog, Delgado.
Thanks for everything, princesa.
You have a beautiful family.
And thanks to them,
I have my family back, too.
I'm sure I'll see you around.
And I can't wait for next year's dog show. What do you say, Delgado?
{laughs} ln your dreams, kid. Adios.
Load up.
And you, too.
{Sam} There you guys are.
I know. I missed you, too.
{whines}
{Kroop clears throat}
Don't worry, we're leaving.
You didn't have to bring the police.
We're not going to cause you guys any trouble.
Can you give us one second of your time, please?
Hey! You know, your dogs are pretty special.
They solved the case that stumped an entire task force.
We been trackin' these criminals for three months.
They got over 1 5 million dollars from banks in the area.
{mutters}
And there is a $250,000 reward for their capture.
Which is yours. It'll probably pay off the loan on your house and then some.
- Hey, guys! Come quick! Check this out.
- {Pedro} What's going on?
Is this a joke?
'Cause I'm not laughing.
I can assure you, Mr. Cortez, this is not a joke. ln fact, you can come down to the bank this week and sign the papers.
And... here's your pen back.
Sorry about that.
You know what, those never work.
Take this one. OK.
Holy guacamole! We did it!
We saved the house!
Gracias. Oh, my goodness.
{speaks Spanish}
No, I'm fine. Really, that's...
You don't really have...
OK, we're hugging it out.
I'm having a hard time breathing.
That's great. Please let go.
- Yes.
- What are we waiting for? Let's unpack.
- Unpack.
- I'm gonna stay out here.
Ah.
Come on, guys!
Let's show him some love!
- {puppies cheering}
- Oh, no-no-no. No, no, no.
No-no-no. Good dogs!
- Good dogs...
- Dogpile!
{groaning} Bad dogs. Bad dogs.
I'm really not a dog person.
Oh... {laughing}
My kitty's going to be very jealous.
{doorbell rings}
- Come in, Rachel.
- Hi.
I called her. A mother wants to see her son happy.
{both whisper in Spanish}
- I'm so sorry, Rachel.
- {Rachel} No, I'm sorry.
I hated the way we left things.
I wanna be with you, whether we're married or not.
And I want to be with you... forever.
I wanna have a family with you.
I wanna depend on each other for the rest of our lives.
Go for it, Sam.
Rachel, will you marry me?
Yes. Yes, of course!
{all dogs barking}
And I'm throwing the wedding!
{Sam} Viv!
Oh, congratulations.
{whines}
Let's celebrate!
{pop music plays}
OK, kids, ready to play?
Marco!
{puppies} Polo!
- Marco!
- {puppies} Polo!
- Marco!
- Polo!
You can't catch me.
Come on, let's join in the fun.
Mi corazon, be careful, the mud.
Wait here.
Oh, Papi, you're so romantic.
But of course.
After all, I am a Chihuahua.
Don't I know it.
Ahh...
Papi likes.
Every pet deserves a loving and permanent home.
So if you're adopting a pet, please be sure you are ready for a lifetime commitment, and please adopt responsibly.
Gracias and thank you.
{ Bridgit Mendler: This Is My Paradise}
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back here at home there's nothing to do
Hey, Yeah, yeah
Now that I'm away
I wish I'd stayed
Tomorrow's a day of mine that you want be in
Oh, oh, ah
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Okay. All right, one, two, three...
Guys! One...
Hold on. Guys, freeze!
Aw!
- Where's Alvin?
- Hey, Dave.
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?
Trying to board the ship.
Already done that.
Also, checked out our room, dibbed the side of the bed closest to the window, ordered us a round of virgin piña coladas and signed us up for parasailing.
Alvin, you're too young for parasailing.
I thought we were going on vacation to have fun.
Don't worry, family vacations are all about fun.
But first we're gonna need to set some rules.
Let's start with you can't call dibs on a bed until everyone's in the room.
- Good rule.
- That's right.
That's a good one, Simon.
All right, so that's our first rule.
Should we go over the rest of them?
Dave, come on. "Rules" is my middle name.
No attorneys to plead my case
Illa racket ships to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
- Hey, Dave.
- Alvin!
- Ha ha! Whoo!
- Whoa. Ahhh! Ahhh! Ow!
This is your captain speaking.
All kids are now allowed to play an the adults-only Serenity Deck.
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
You think you're right, but you were wrong
You tried to take me, baby
But you knew all along
You can't take me for a ride
I'm not a fool now
So you better run and hide
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
Alvin!
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
Yo! I'm the T to the R to the O-U-bull
Rock it non-stop till the mic gets dull
Take what! want when I want, no holding back
When I kick a ﬂow
I'm all up an the track
A to the L to the V-I-N
When I'm in town, me and all of my friends
Gonna come through like a hurricane
Tearing down everything in my way
Alvin!
- We talked about setting rules, Alvin.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't know the agreement meant no fun.
You're allowed to have fun.
When are you going to stop acting like a child?
When are you going to stop treating me like a child?
I'll stop treating you like a child when you start acting like a grown-up!
I'll start acting like a grown-up when you start...
I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tail back and forth
I whip my tail back and forth
- Hey, girls, not now, please, okay?
- Aw.
- Lame!
- Sorry, Dave.
I need to get ready for dinner with the captain.
We're having dinner with the captain?
No, I am. You're staying here.
I have to go apologize for everything Alvin did.
This is so not fair.
Not to us, not to Dave, and certainly not to the captain, who I'm sure was really looking forward to dining with me.
Why don't I go speak with Dave?
See if I can smooth things over.
Knock-knock.
- What is it, Simon?
- Well, I would never say this to Alvin.
Goodness knows he can be totally irresponsible, but I actually have a suggestion.
You have a suggestion for me?
He's been driving me crazy a lot longer than he's been driving you crazy.
All right. So what is it?
Imagine Alvin is a spirited racehorse.
That's your advice?
No. I'm not done yet, Dave.
All right, so Alvin is a racehorse...
And you, Dave, are his incredibly helpful jockey who's there to guide him down the racetrack of life.
But if you hold the reins too tight, that racehorse is going to fight and buck, which is no fun for anyone.
But if you loosen the reins just a little...
He'll fly right off the track and crash into the fence.
I know you want to protect Alvin, but, Dave, sometimes kids will rise to the occasion if you just show them a little trust.
All right, guys, room service is on its way.
Lights out by 9:00.
Dave, question.
If we're going to be held captive in this room...
Because of Alvin!
Can we at least watch a movie?
All right, let's see what's on.
You know what, why don't you guys pick a movie?
You're old enough to make your own decision.
For real, Dave?
Absolutely.
- Ooh! Dave looks so elegant.
- Have fun!
Wait, Dave, before you go,
I made something for you.
Wow, it's really... it's soft so you can sleep in it and I made it with all the colors, so it will go with everything!
Great. I'll put it on after dinner.
You could put it on now, so everyone at the captain's table could see it.
Nice.
A real chick magnet.
All right, guys, have fun.
But not too much fun, because I'm still very upset.
Goodbye, Dave.
And, hello, ladies!
I like my tail shaken, not stirred.
- Where are you going?
- To the casino. I'm feeling lucky.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Dave said...
Dave said, and I quote,
"We're old enough to make our own decisions."
He meant we were old enough to choose a film!
Well, we're clearly not.
Check out what Theodore just picked.
What's wrong with this movie?
It's for babies!
Which is probably why
Dave treats us like babies.
Munk up, Theodore.
There. That's more like it.
Alvin, please!
I say we go to Salsa Night!
In our pajamas?
Oh, I know!
Party rack is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We/ust wanna see ya shake that
Alvin!
Alvin! Alvin!
And we have a winner.
Ellie, I love these dresses!
You're so crafty.
Thanks. it's what I do.
- Ow!
- Oh! sorry!
Ew! What are you?
We are the Chipettes.
- Hi, I'm Eleanor!
My sister was just trying to apologize.
What's she sorry for?
Stepping on my friend's foot?
Or her busted, tired little dance moves?
Oh, no, you didn't!
Oh, yes, she did!
You better get those Lee Press-Ons out of my face unless you want to meet my claws.
And, yeah, baby, they're real.
- Do you wanna go?
- Hit it!
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
Oh, whoa!
Ugh!
Let the music move your feet
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come an!
Captain, I'm really sorry about what happened.
Alvin, he's a kid.
He's just trying to have some fun.
There's nothing wrong with fun.
Our pelican makes sure that everybody on the ship has fun.
In fact, in port, he circles the ship on a hang glider.
It's really quite amusing.
However, my number one priority is the passengers' safety.
Sol simply cannot have Alvin put himself, or anyone else, at risk again.
Believe me, I understand.
If Alvin breaks any more of our rules, there will be consequences.
The last thing we want is anyone getting hurt.
Excuse me.
- Hot!
- Sorry.
Hot!
Unbelievable. Gravy pants.
Hey, he?!
- Do you have a problem with me?
- You bet I have a problem with you.
- Why?
- As if you didn't know.
I don't know.
Ian? What are you doing here?
I'm working, Dave.
This is your job?
Yeah, not too many record labels are interested in hiring the guy who blew it with the Chipmunks, blew it with the Chipettes and passed on Justin Bieber.
Twice.
Look, Ian, I'm sorry you lost your job and your dignity.
But spilling things, hot things, on me isn't going to bring any of that stuff back.
You're right, Dave.
It's too late for me to get my old life back.
But it's not too late to ruin yours.
You want to ruin my life?
Why don't we just start with this vacation?
If I see those chipmunks break so much as one rule,
I'm going straight to Captain Correlli.
You're in my house now!
Although, technically it's not a house, it's a ship.
The point is, I'll be watching you.
Like a hawk!
- Theodore?
- Please don't eat my brain!
Why are you watching Jungle Monster 4.7
Alvin, how could you...
Alvin?
Simon?
Girls?
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- I'll be right back!
- it's dark.
You're up for an International Music Award.
That's fantastic!
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I guess. If you like a lot of adulation.
We fly there right after the cruise.
Hoping to take home Record of the Year.
That would make you the youngest winner ever.
I'm not that young.
I mean, I'm hanging out in a casino way past my bedtime.
Not that I have a bedtime!
No one tells me what to do.
Alvin!
Who's Alan, I wonder?
Anyway
I'd love to chat more, but I've gotta run.
You're in a lot of trouble, young man!
You can follow me on Critter!
Alvin! Alvin!
Simon?
I wasn't betting. Honest.
Your winnings, sir.
Oh, busted!
I didn't sneak out. I mean, I did.
But only to stop Alvin.
- Right.
- There they are, Captain.
Captain.
What's he going to do, make us walk the plank?
There's a plank?
No, there's no plank, but if you guys disobey me one more time, you will be off the ship.
And you'll miss the International
Music Awards. Do you understand?
- Yes, Dave.
- Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
What if we need to disobey you?
And why would you need to do that?
Well, let's say that you tell me to stay put.
"Alvin, if you move from that chair, you're grounded!"
But then I happen to see pirates climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy, from the side of the ship.
Now, it would be easy for me to take my trusty old Swiss Army knife and cut the ropes.
But I have to stay put. Or do I?
Yes, Alvin, you do.
And what are you doing with a pocket knife?
What pocket knife are you referring to?
Come on, give it to me.
You could cut yourself.
So, I could have saved the whole ship from robbage and pilgering and you'd still ground me?
Alvin, there's no such word as robbage.
And it's "pillaging."
But he does have a point, Dave.
There's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our own hands.
I trusted you tonight and look where that got me!
That's probably just the hot gravy talking.
You're all lucky Captain Correlli has allowed you one more activity.
Is it hang gliding, wakeboarding or bungee jumping?
No. Shuffleboard.
Man!
By my calculations, it appears to be 10% shuffle, 90% bored.
That's funny!
Oh, thanks. You really think so?
You know, Dave, I think
I'd prefer the plank.
Sorry, Alvin, but this is what you get to do.
And I get to do something
I haven't done in a long time.
Absolutely nothing.
Brittany approaches her puck, adjusts her stance, looks over at me, quite annoyed, wonders to herself if I'm ever going to shut my mouth, realizes I'm not, and makes her move.
And... Oh!
Oh, it's short!
A costly error, ladies and gentlemen, that's going to haunt her the rest of her career.
You can make all the jokes you want, Alvin, but not even you can make this interesting.
Oh, really? Well, care to make it interesting that I can make this interesting?
Alvin, what are you up to?
Need I remind you Dave is watching us.
Simon, the poor guy hasn't had a moment's peace since he met us.
He's exhausted.
Check this out. In three, two, one.
Lights out.
- Nap time!
Time to turn punishment into funishment.
You get it?
I took the "pun" in punishment, and turned it into "fun," but kept the "ishment." it's word play!
- Uh-huh.
- What?
Hey, kid!
Wanna make a trade?
That's a nice-looking kite.
Yeah!
I can see Russia from here!
Come on, Simon, grab on.
Forget it. All I ever do is try to save him and it only gets me in trouble!
This won't end well.
Simon, do something!
Oh, seriously?
Simon, help!
Alvin's gotten himself in a bind.
Looks like it's Simon saving him again!
Whoa!
Thanks, bro.
- Huh?
- Thank you!
Hack-a-bye, Davey
On the lounge chair
If you awake, you'll pull out your hair
Whoa! Hey!
- Dave! Dave!
- Ow!
- Dave!
- Help us!
Guys! Guys!
No! No! No, no, no! No! No!
Dave! Help us!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You want to go hang gliding, sign up at the Excursion Desk like everyone else.
- Ian, you don't understand!
- Oh, I think I do.
Dave Seville is so special that the rules don't apply to him.
- Let go!
- No, you let go.
Hey! Come on! Great!
Oh, my God!
I need my pelican head!
Help!
- Ian!
- You idiot!
Oh, no. No, no.
Great. Way to go, Seville.
- Me?
- You!
Hey!
Save your breath, Dave.
They'll come back for me.
In retrospect, this was a bad idea.
We're losing altitude!
I don't think I can make it much longer.
I'm so hungry. Just one bite.
No.
- A nibble?
- No nibbles.
Maybe I can just lick the glaze?
The glaze is what's keeping you alive, Theodore!
Its high fat content is creating a waterproof barrier.
I'm gonna starve to death!
Actually, there are many other things that will kill you before starvation.
Dehydration, sunstroke...
An island.
No, an island would probably be helpful.
So if you see one, you should definitely say something.
Uh, Jeanette?
Oh!
We're alive! We're alive!
Good. Because now
I'm going to kill you!
Guys, guys, guys!
Nobody is killing anyone, okay?
No matter how much he deserves it.
Thank you, Si. Though I could have done without the passive aggression.
Look, we've got nothing to worry about.
Dave knows we're gone by now.
He probably has the whole coast guard looking for us.
Meantime, why don't we all just relax and have some donut?
Did you guys want some?
Theodore! Alvin! Simon!
Can't you kick any faster?
It's been two hours, Dave.
Thanks to biannual Pilates classes,
I have legs that won't quit, but they do slow down.
Take those feet off, let me kick.
No quality mascot suit has removable feet.
Take the suit off, then.
- I can't.
- Why not?
I'm not wearing anything underneath.
Look!
No, no, it's okay, I believe you.
No, look!
Look, an island!
Maybe the chipmunks washed up there.
Kick!
Faster! Come on.
Okay, there we go.
It won't belong before a rescue plane sees our SOS and flies us back to civilization.
I don't hear any planes.
Or helicopters.
Maybe Dave is coming in a hot-air balloon.
Because those things are really quiet.
I don't think Dave is gonna be in a hot-air balloon.
But he is coming, right?
Of course he is.
Just maybe not today.
Alvin's right.
We should prepare to stay the night.
What? You guys expect me to sleep outside?
Last I checked, Brit, we're chipmunks.
We're used to living in the wild.
No, we used to be used to living in the wild.
Come on, Brit, it's just one night.
One cold night.
So we'll make a fire. We're always setting things on fire accidentally.
How hard can it be when we put our minds to it?
And how are you intending to do that?
I will create a spark by striking this rock with my Swiss Army knife, which Dave took from me.
I suppose you have a better idea, smart guy?
As a matter of fact, I do, smart guy.
As you can see, the lens concentrates the energy of the sun, thus creating fire!
Whoa. Impressive.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks for thinking that.
Hot, hot, hot!
We have made fire!
So, what do we do now?
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Oh, lord, Kumbaya
Alvin! Brittany!
We've gotta head inland.
If we climb to the top of that mountain, we'll be able to get a better view of the island, see if they're here.
All right, got it.
What are you doing?
- Building a fire.
- What?
You know, one time in the studio,
Snoop ran out of matches, got a blaze going with just two carrot sticks.
Figure, how hard can it be?
Forget the fire. We have to start hiking.
Yeah, okay, Dave.
Look, it's getting dark-ish.
It's gonna be cold. I'm gonna build a fire.
We'll go in the morning.
- No, we'll go now.
Don't take that tone of voice with me, Dave.
I'm not one of your chipmunks that you can just boss around and stuff into a cage whenever you feel like it.
That was you, Ian!
Calm down.
Jeez, no wonder those furballs would rather fly off the ship than spend another day with you.
They didn't do it on purpose.
It was an accident. They're just kids.
I don't know how long they can survive out there.
And you guys were worried.
 Look at us!
We're warm, we got a great fire going, beautiful night sky and if a rescue helicopter comes by, they'll see us!
Everything's gonna be fine.
Good night, guys.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Night.
Theodore!
What? Dave always turns off the light after saying good night.
That fire was sort of the only thing keeping us from freezing to death.
- Yeah!
- Can't you just relight it?
- How?
- With your glasses. And the sun?
Oh.
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
All right!
Way to keep the spirits up, guys.
Doing it, yeah!
- And what is this supposed to be?
- Breakfast!
No, it's bark.
Yeah, for breakfast!
I bet it's very good. it's not.
It's been forever since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.
Crazy suggestion, guys.
Let's get off this beach and let's find some real food.
If I know my horticulture, and I do, this is a grove of mango trees.
Then where are all the mangoes?
Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!
You were planning on sharing that, right?
Of course.
Oh, well, good.
'Cause it kind of looked like you were gonna eat it all by yourself.
What? I would never do that.
I don't believe you!
Hey!
Yeah! Winning!
What?
Well, I'm just out of school
A sting real, real coal
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message that
I've gotta be a wild one
I'll make sure to save you the pit!
Oh, my acorns!
Way to go, Theodore!
Come on, we'll split it.
Don't listen to him, Theo.
He's gonna eat it all by himself.
I'll share it with you.
No. She's trying to trick you.
No, you're trying to trick him.
No, you're trying to trick him by saying I'm trying to trick him.
He's lying, Theo!
- What?
Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have ourselves a ball
Gonna tell all my friends
Gonna tell 'em all that I'm a wild one
Oh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Theodore, I am so sorry!
Gonna keep 'em moving wild
Gotta keep a-s winging, baby
I'm a real wild child
Oh, no!
My precious! My precious!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look at us.
One day on this island and we've become animals!
Did you hear that?
What was that?
- Jungle Monster.
Positions, everybody.
Hold.
Hold.
Fire!
No! Why?
Please don't eat us, Mr. Jungle Monster!
I'm not a monster, I'm Zoe.
And I'm clearly a girl who has been on this island for so long that now she's imagining that squirrels can talk.
We are chipmunks.
Yeah, Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Who and the what now?
I'm sure you've heard of the Chipettes.
We're kind of world famous.
Who?
Maybe this will help.
Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Caught in a bad romance
- Okay. Stop.
- Lame!
I don't know who you are.
Awkward!
Exactly how long have you been here?
Well, I got here on a Monday, so...
Yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?
Nine years? Wait.
You've been here nine years?
Well, it could be eight.
What if we're here nine years?
What if we're here forever?
I told you, Dave's coming.
I used to think that Dave was coming, too.
And he never did.
Huh?
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.
I used to fly cargo planes for them, until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.
- We crash-landed, too.
- Really?
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.
Right, Alvin?
Absolutely.
You mean I'm finally gonna get out of here?
I can't wait to go tell the others!
There are others?
I mean, can you guys imagine being stuck here for all these years without anybody to talk to?
I think I'd lose my mind!
Chipmunks,
I'm pleased to introduce my friends.
This is Rawlings, Spalding, Callaway,
Dunlop, and, right there, that's Nerf.
Hey, girlfriend, you look good.
They survived the crash with me.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Okay.
I'm Theodore.
Guys, Dave is coming to get us!
No, not Dave Henderson. I saw your face!
It's another Dave.
But, you guys, just get excited.
We're finally gonna get off this island.
She's funny.
In a crazy sort of way.
This totally calls for a party.
Who's hungry?
- Yeah!
- Yes, please!
- I'm hungry.
- We are famished.
Yeah? Let's go to my place.
Is it far?
I don't think I could walk another step.
Who said anything about walking?
We're gonna die!
Oh, man! That was so cool!
I know, I know!
Come on. Come on in, guys! Bring it in.
Come on down!
Yeah! Wasn't that awesome?
No, it was not awesome.
It's a miracle we got here safely.
In fact, the odds of a chipmunk getting hurt on a zip-line are one out of six.
Why do I always have to be right?
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ellie, Ellie! Are you okay?
I think I sprained my ankle!
Ooh, you know what, you should put some ice on that.
Oh, no, guys, I don't have any ice.
I live there in that tree.
I thought that maybe you did, though.
No, we don't have any ice.
Just like we don't have any shelter.
Wow, that's a major bummer for you.
- Do you guys like bungee jumping?
- Yes!
No. We do not.
Listen, lady, maybe you should just leave us alone so we can focus more on surviving and less on killing ourselves.
Whoa, that is a lot of uptight in a very little package.
I'm not uptight. I just don't wanna see anyone else getting hurt. Ow!
Criminy. What was that?
You know what, that was just a spider and they live here because this is nature.
It is not just a spider, it's a Phoneutria bahiensis.
Its bite contains a neurotoxin.
Ooh! Mr. Fancy Words. So what?
Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?
Oh. That's not good.
Side effects include changes in personality, loss of inhibition, dry mouth.
Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably twice a day by these little fellows and I am still completely normal.
Yes, normal.
Oh, no.
Alvin? Simon!
Chubby one!
Girl chubby one!
Brittany? Jeanette?
I hope they're okay.
Who cares if they're okay?
I just need them to be here.
And here I am thinking you've changed and don't only care about yourself.
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.
Because right now the rage I'm feeling for you and those chipmunks is the only thing keeping me going.
Shall we keep going?
Ian, just keep an eye out for something to eat or drink, all right?
All right. Right there!
- Where?
- That thing around your neck.
You're not gonna eat this.
This was a gift from Theodore.
That explains it.
I was gonna say, it's really ugly.
Like, really... Wow.
- Ugly.
- It's not ugly.
It goes with everything and it's soft enough to sleep in.
Yeah, and it's edible.
You will not eat my son's necklace.
He's not your son, Dave.
He's just a chipmunk.
Oh, Dave. Where are you?
Where are you, Alvin?
All right.
I'm gonna crash.
Simon. Where are you going?
Who is this Simon you speak of?
Um. you?
No, my name is not Simon. It is
Simone!
That's pretty close to Simon.
And yet completely different.
Would you care to join me on my adventure?
What adventure?
The adventure called life!
Okay.
But just until Dave shows up.
Alvin, Alvin!
Simon and Theodore are gone.
They probably just went to get stuff for the shelter.
It's all the guy can talk about.
Still, it's not like them to wander off like that.
Could you please go look for them?
Why can't you?
I have a situation of my own to deal with, Alvin.
Oh, right. How is Eleanor doing?
Huh? She's fine. I'm talking about me.
It's been two days since my last bath and I am a mess.
I can't get rescued looking like this.
Oy.
Theo! Simon! Simon!
Theodore! Theo!
Si! Theo!
Bonjour, my friend
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?
- His name is not Simon.
- It is Simone.
That's pretty close to Simon.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he's acting totally different.
The spider bite! That's it!
Remember the side effects?
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?
Lies! Who are you?
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.
Au revoir, Alfred.
Alvin. it's Alvin!
Whoo! C'est magnifique, Simone!
Okay, Theo, it's all you.
Really? I've never done anything like this.
And you never will.
How can you let him do this?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking, "When did my dad wash up on this island?"
- What?
- We were having the best time.
Why do you have to show up and be so uptight?
Me? Uptight?
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!
The cool one. Ask anybody.
- Who should I ask?
Come on.
Theodore, you can't bungee jump.
You get scared just watching a movie.
Munk up, Alvin.
A little help?
Ah! Much better.
Jeanette, these dresses are, like, totally adorbs. I die.
Thank you.
And I also made these for you, Eleanor.
Oh, look how handy you are all of a sudden.
And in case you get tired,
I made you a wheelchair.
Oh, super.
J'arrive.
Enchanté, mademoiselles. A kiss.
A kiss. And a...
A kiss.
- What's gotten into him?
- Spider venom.
Yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some sort of fun-loving French dude.
- Really?
- Now he thinks he's...
The most interesting munk in the world.
Simon? Simon.
- Simone?
- Oui?
I think we should get to work on that shelter.
Pourquoi? I cannot imagine a better roof over our heads than the stars in the sky.
What about the kind of roof over our head that's actually a roof?
It's going to rain!
What is a little rain? Hmm?
We cherish the water, for it is the water that nurtures the flower.
- Okay. This is crazy!
Building a shelter was your idea. Yours!
Oh, great. Great!
All right, guys, we're gonna build a shelter.
I need everyone's help. Let's go.
I'll try. But I feel so useless.
- What are you doing?
- What I've wanted to do since the moment I laid my eyes all over on you.
- What?
- Huh?
Hey, you guys are going to catch pneumonia dancing in the rain like that.
I say, hey, I be gone today
But I'll be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing, that I love you
You ought to be careful kicking mud around like that.
Hello?
Someone could lose an eye!
I've been a lot of places all around the way
But I don't want to write a lave sang for the world
No, I just want to write a song
That looks like fun.
Hocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
I say, hey, I'll be gone today
- Eleanor? Would you care to dance?
- I'd love to.
- With me?
 Yes, Theodore!
I can't believe
Jeanette's getting all the attention.
I'm the pretty one.
Jeanette's the smart one.
You don't see me running around trying to be all smart, do you?
I know! I'm the fun one,
- You're the pretty one.
- Yeah!
Do you know how slippery that dirt is?
This is ridiculous.
Are you even listening to me?
Simon!
Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.
No!
Hmm.
What are you doing?
Ugh. Building a shelter.
Since I'm not the fun one any more
I figure I may as well be... the responsible one.
Ew. Really?
Well, since I'm not the pretty one any more, maybe I should build a shelter, too.
Yeah, good luck with that.
What, you don't think I could do it?
Hey, I didn't say that, Brit.
I thought it, but I didn't say it.
So you wanna play it this way.
Alfons-y!
He's so French.
Oh! Be careful, Simone!
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
Now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?
Good thing we don't wear pants.
Okay, you guys, come on, come over.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Of course it's safe.
I do this thing every day.
Oh! Oh!
- Jeanette!
- Jeanette!
Hold on, Jeanette.
- Viens, ma chére.
No, no. Look into my eyes.
You have nothing to fear.
Yes, yes. Very good.
Voila!You are safe. Bravo!
- You made it!
- You're so brave.
Aw!
- Wow.
- Ooh la la!
Pretty.
Whoa.
Double rainbow. What does it mean?
Alive they're superstars, sure. But dead?
They're legends.
I'm talking about tribute albums, pay-per-view funerals.
Wait a second. You actually think
I'm in this for the money?
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks, you're doing a lousy job.
I'm doing this because I love them, okay?
Look, if you wanna spend the rest of your life running around after a bunch of spoiled brats, be my guest.
- They're not brats.
- Really? Even Alvin?
You never even bothered to get to know them, Ian.
I mean, sure, Alvin can be kind of a handful, but he means well.
He's sometimes just a little irresponsible, that's all.
But, come on, Simon?
He's probably the most level-headed kid I know.
If anything, he's a little too uptight.
And then there's little Theodore.
Dave, I barely cared about what you had to say about the first two.
I can't imagine the big-boned one is gonna be any more interesting.
Forget it, let's just keep going.
Yee-haw!
UP, poisson, up!
Ooh la la!
Oh, no. This is terrible.
Shouldn't he have come up by now?
Uh-oh. Simone! Where are you?
Zoe, you've gotta do something.
All right.
Callaway, I need you to go in there and find Simone.
I know you can do it, little buddy.
You're kidding, right?
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.
Simone!
Told you.
I'm sorry if I caused you any worry, mademaiselle.
But I have something for you.
Maybe this will be a way to make it up.
Oh! it's beautiful!
Where did you find it?
Yeah, it is beautiful.
Where did you find it?
In a cave behind the waterfall.
I thought it would look nice on you.
But now I realize even the most precious gem cannot compare to your beauty.
Aw!
Yeah. Were there any other jewels or gems or diamonds or anything else in there?
By the time I found the gold,
I had already been gone from my Jeanette far too long.
Aw!
What?
You guys, they found it. They found it!
And the best part is, they don't even know what they found.
They think that it's just one bracelet.
Which means that the rest of the treasure is mine.
All mine!
What the...
Whoa! What are you?
Hey! Oh!
Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.
You just take what you want.
Drop it. Drop it!
You mess with me, ése,
I'll go loco on you.
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa!
Give it back!
You can sting like a bee or strike like a cobra, but this honey munk don't care!
Okay, Brit, I'm all done.
If you want, I can help you get started...
Whoa!
This tree house is awesome.
Maybe you are kind of the smart one.
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is...
Well, you did your best.
Anyhoo, no reason we can't be comfortable and stylish while we wait for Dave to show up, right?
Brit, I...
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.
You do? Why?
'Cause he's not even looking.
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?
Because I drive him crazy.
You know, the way Simon's been driving me crazy?
I mean, that's what I've been doing to Dave.
For years.
No wonder he hates me.
Oh!
Don't worry, Alvin.
I'm sure Dave will come.
I mean, he certainly loves
Simon and Theodore.
Un, deux, trois
Simon? ls Dave ever gonna find us?
Simon? I mean, Simone?
I'm so sorry, were you speaking to moi?
Yes! About Dave!
Are we ever going to find him?
I see you are sad, man ami.
And I hate to see you sad.
I will help you find your friend Dave.
You really think you can find him?
I know I can!
And then I will find this Simon you keep speaking of!
As Dave and I have never met,
I will need you to describe him for me.
Well, he's very kind and a good storyteller.
Mmm-hmm. Very helpful.
Oh! And he's about this tall.
Mmm-hmm.
Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?
I don't think so.
Then these footprints must not be his.
Jungle Monster!
Do you hear that?
Yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.
No, no, maybe it's a helicopter! Listen!
Face it, Dave, no one is coming to rescue us, okay?
And my stomach noises are gonna get louder and louder and louder until one day they just stop.
Because I will have eaten you.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe no one's coming.
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
Maybe they're gone.
I really messed up.
Dave, it kills me to say this, kills me, but...
Look, man, you're really good with those kids, really good.
They love you.
And I should know because I was really bad with those kids and they hate me.
But, look, you should know that whatever happens, you did nothing wrong. Nothing.
Thanks, Ian.
Come here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Ian?
Ian?
Ian!
Mon dieu!
The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!
Or hungry. Alfons-y!
That means let's go.
Oh.
Ow!
Great, a volcano.
Of course!
That's why the water was so hot!
It's being heated by the underground magma chamber!
- How do you know that?
- I have no idea!
Maybe I accidentally paid attention.
Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike?
Like, I don't know, maybe to the waterfall or whatever?
Not now, Zoe!
The whole island is going to explode!
What?
Guys, we've got to get off this island.
We have to build a raft, now.
"Right now" like, right now?
Or "right now" like, after a hike to the waterfall now?
I've been hit!
By Dave's necklace?
Tell Jeanette I will watch over her with angel wings.
Dave?
Theodore!
Dave? Ha ha!
Told you we'd find him!
Simon!
It is Simone, but I am often confused for this Simon fellow.
Perhaps we look alike?
- Simone?
- Ian!
Hey, you found the chubby one.
Don't worry, Theodore.
Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?
What was that?
That's an active volcano.
Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck.
Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes.
Jeanette, find as many coconuts and mangoes as you can.
Who knows how long we'll be out there.
Who knows how long we'll be out there.
What can I do to help?
- Dave!
- Dave!
Dave!
- You found us!
Hey.
We missed you so much.
I knew you would find us.
Ow.
Eleanor! What happened?
You know, just a zip-line accident.
- A what?
- I'm fine.
It only hurts when I try to explain it.
Okay, you know what, never mind.
The important thing is you guys are safe.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hey, what is it?
I thought you'd never find us.
That you weren't even looking.
Why wouldn't I look for you?
Because I'm such a pain in the...
Alvin.
I know, you don't think I'm a pain.
No, you're a pain.
But I'd come, no matter what.
Arc de Triomphe, mayonnaise, Napoleon.
I get it, Frenchie, you come from a rich history.
Well, guess what, we're all gonna be history if we don't get out of here.
Uncle Ian!
What's he doing here?
It's kind of a long story.
Don't worry, he's cool.
Yes, for a pelican man.
Oh, yeah, nothing cooler than a grown man in a pelican suit.
So, Dave, how are we gonna get out of here?
I don't know, Alvin,
I think you've got this under control.
Theodore, you and Eleanor are on rope duty.
Dave and Ian, we need oars.
Simone, you and Jeanette are in charge of food.
- And, Zoe...
- No, I know, I know.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pack up my balls!
Who's that?
Another long story.
Yeah! Good work, guys!
Let's get off this island.
This raft won't build itself.
Whoa!
Go! Go! Go!
- Heave!
- Ho!
- Heave!
- Ho!
- Heave!
- Ho!
It's incredible, you guys.
Very impressive.
Just seeing everyone come together to build it...
- I just want to say...
It can wait.
Wait, where are Jeanette and Simone?
I hope this is going to be enough.
Did you hear something?
Who can say?
When I am with you, all I can hear is the beating of my own heart.
Oh, Simone!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Somebody! Help!
Jeanette?
Guys! Guys!
Over here! Come quick, hurry!
- Simone, are you okay?
- Simone!
Why are you calling me Simone?
- Simon?
- Yeah.
You're back! It finally wore off!
What wore off?
You were bitten by a spider.
It, like, messed up your brain.
Ah. Is that why I think I see Dave and a half-Ian, half-bird?
No, it's really me. And really Ian.
'Sup?
Simon, where's Jeanette?
She was out here with you.
Jeanette? I don't know...
I do.
It's Zoe. She took her.
Simon, I need to know where you found that gold bracelet.
What gold bracelet?
The one you gave to Jeanette.
What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?
On your date.
Jeanette and I are dating?
Okay, he's useless.
Theodore, Eleanor, you're gonna have to lead the way.
I don't remember exactly how to get there.
I do!
Which way, Eleanor?
Make a left. No, right. No, left!
I thought you said you knew where you were going.
I do! Sometimes I just forget my left from my right.
That way!
Okay, we just have to cross here.
Are you kidding me?
Guys, I can't do that.
But, Simon, you already did.
No, I didn't.
That was Simone, that was not me.
But Simone is you.
He's in there somewhere.
You just have to find him, taut de suite.
Because Jeanette needs you, Simon.
No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft.
If the volcano blows before I make it out of here, you have to promise me you'll...
Leave without you. Got it.
Okay.
Dave.
I'm coming with you.
Absolutely not, it's too dangerous.
Remember I said someday I may need to disobey you?
Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you.
Let's go.
You're not coming up until you have every last bit of that treasure.
But the volcano is about to explode!
Well, then I guess you better hurry, huh?
Run, go, go. In you go.
Get down there. That's right.
Keep going!
S.0.S.
Please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y. O. U. are
Making it hard
I can't help it
See, it don't feel right
Keep moving!
This time, please
Someone come and rescue me
Okay! Pull me up. I can't hold any more.
If you can still talk, it means you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!
Yes! That sounds very good.
Jeanette!
Dave!
They're supposed to be behind that waterfall!
That's right.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Zoe!
- No, no. Not another step.
Don't come any closer.
Are you all right, Jeanette?
I'm pretty freaked out, and those earrings tasted awful.
Zoe, you don't have to do this.
Oh, I don't?
I spent 10 years looking for this treasure.
It's the whole reason why I came to this stinking island!
You mean you didn't crash-land?
They said that I was crazy and they said that this map was a fake.
And now the treasure is mine!
Run!
Jeanette, come on, come on.
Run!
Jeanette!
Oh, no!
Help, help!
Oh, no, help!
You're going back in that cave, and you are going to get me more treasure.
Jeanette!
- Simone!
- It's Simon!
Alvin!
No!
- Hurry!
- Come on, guys, go!
Go. go!
Come on, come on.
Ow!
Look!
Come on!
Run!
But where's Dave?
- Help me UP!
- Oh, help you UP?
Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave?
All I had was my treasure, and now it's gone.
Do you get that? My life is ruined.
And now you're gonna know how that feels.
No, no! it's tempting to blame Dave.
I know. I've been there.
I wish I could get back all those years
I spent plotting my revenge.
All that time and energy, wasted.
All those pizzas
I had delivered to his house, wasted.
That was you?
Not now, Dave! All right?
You could let Dave fall to his death and I could go back to the raft with the chipmunks, become their manager again and make tons of money.
So, really, I'm good either way.
But let me tell you something.
Hate, anger, regret, those aren't just members of a girl group I once signed.
They're what consumed me.
And they're consuming you.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Or not. Again,
I'm good either way, so...
I don't want to sway you.
What are you guys doing? Help me.
Please. Help me save my dad!
Hurry!
I got you, Dave.
Come on! Help me, guys.
Wow!
There they are!
Come on!
Faster!
Hurry! Hurry!
Let's go, go. 90!
Oh, no!
- Get up!
- Hurry!
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!
Run!
Grab the oar!
Come on! Come on, guys!
Paddle!
Come on! Paddle!
Faster! Come on, hurry!
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Now we'll never get to perform at the International Music Awards.
I guess now we're the losers.
Jeanette, I don't know what to say.
I guess I was just so obsessed with finding that treasure that I kind of... I lost it.
And I'm...
I'm really sorry.
We both are.
Well, apology accepted.
Oh.
Really?
Look, Dunlop, this is a new beginning for both of us.
I hope you don't mind.
Simone gave it to me.
Oh, I don't mind.
You know, Jeanette, even the most perfect gem cannot compare to your beauty.
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?
I just wanted to say now that we're not all, you know, dead, sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry I was acting like a child on the ship.
And kind of maybe ruined our family vacation.
Sometimes a racehorse needs a little room to run.
Yes. Yeah. I like where your head's at.
That is very wise, David.
'Sup?
What, no love for Uncle Ian?
- You put us in cages!
- You put us in cages!
Seriously? Are we still talking about that?
New subject, I saved Dave's life.
Okay, but I'll be watching you, mister.
Alvin, you still have that pocket knife I gave you?
Knife? Oh, right, sorry,
I meant to give it back.
I want you to keep it.
Really?
Maybe you can use it to signal that helicopter.
What?
- Hey!
- Down here!
Hello!
It's me, Ian Hawke! Jet Records!
Guys, circle around!
Everything's aka y. We got you, guys!

English - US - SDH
That's me, Walter.
Where... Where'd you go?
Oh, there you are!
I have the best life in the whole world.
That's my brother, Gary.
He's the best friend you could ever have.
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
We could be twins.
Here's where we live: Smalltown...
...the best town you could ever grow up in.
Gary and I did everything together.
And, as the years passed, my brother was always there for me.
I got it! Gary, throw me! Throw me!
Aaah!
We were a great team.
- Nice job, Walter.
- Thanks, Gary.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
It's not perfect.
- That was so fun!
- Nothing is.
Sorry, kid.
- I wanna do that again!
- Come on. I'll ride with ya!
Hurry up!
Even the sunniest days can have a few clouds in them.
Ride's bogus, anyway.
Hey, wanna rent a video?
Yeah. Race you home!
And, well, that night sorta changed everything.
It's The Muppet Show, with our very special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin!
I found them...
... The Muppets.
I guess you could say
I was their number one fan.
Oh, Gary, it's an entire map of The Muppet Studios.
And they made all the difference.
- Trick or treat!
- Because from then on...
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Gary.
- Hey.
- Hi-ho, guys. Yay!
Is that Kermit the Frog?
What is this, 1978?
...even on the worst days,
I knew...
...that as the years passed...
Cancel that last remark.
...as long as there are singing frogs and joking bears...
...Swedish chefs and boomerang fish, the world can't be such a bad place after all.
All right, good night, buddy.
Oh, good night, Gary.
And as long as there are Muppets...
- ...for me...
- ...hair-growing tonic.
...there's still...
...hope.
Aaah. Bye-bye!
Somebody get him!
Animal. Hey, Animal, come on.
The show's about to start.
Show! Show!
Hey, Walter, why don't you join us?
Come on!
No! Wait! I want to be with you guys! Please let me in!
Kermit!
Whoa!
Walter, are you OK, buddy?
You're drenched in sweat.
Did you have the dream again?
Ummm. No. Hey, so when are you guys leaving today?
Oh, um, just a couple hours now.
Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool you're taking Mary to Los Angeles.
I can't believe you guys have been dating for ten years.
I know. Yeah, she wanted to do something special for this anniversary, and she's always wanted to see Los Angeles, so...
Hey, don't forget to send me a postcard from The Muppet Studios.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
- I can't do that, Walter.
- But, Gary...
Because... you're coming with us!
Oh, Gary!
- But what about Mary?
- She's fine.
- She said the more the merrier.
- I... I don't know what to say!
The Muppet Studios are there, Gary.
I can't believe this!
Better get a move on.
We don't want to miss that bus!
No way! Who knows?
Maybe Kermit will be there.
I wouldn't get your hopes up, buddy.
The Muppets haven't put on a show together in years.
I don't think they use the studios for anything but tours anymore.
Nah, I think that's just an Internet rumor.
Like there's a country called Turkey.
Walter, how many times do we have to go over this?
- Turkey is a very real country.
- Wow, Muppet Studios.
I can't believe it!
# Everything is great
Everything is grand
# I got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
# Everything is perfect
It's falling into place
# I can't seem to wipe this smile off my face

Sorry. I was super excited.
All right, Carlos. Flip the ignition.
And that is how you fix a 12-volt starter.
Oh!
You know what that means.
Spring break.
It's OK. We'll be back to studying in two weeks.
Yay!
- Have a nice vacation.
- Bye. Have fun.
- Bye, Mr. Gary.
- Have a good break, guys.
- Hey, great job, Carlos.
- Thanks.
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.
- Hi.
- I got you these.
Oh. Sorry. It's probably from the dance number I was doing.
It's OK. They're really sweet.
You excited for our big trip to LA?
I have our list.
Me, too.
Oh, this is the most romantic thing ever.
I've always dreamt of seeing Los Angeles.
I know. Walter can't wait either.
You don't mind that he's coming, right?
No. No, of course not.
As long as we can spend our anniversary dinner together. That's all I ask.
Totally. It's gonna be the most romantic anniversary dinner ever.
I love you so much.
Oh.
- I love you, too.
- I'm gonna go check on Walter.
# Everything's great
Everything's grand
# Except Gary's always off with his friend
# It's never me and him
It's always me and him and him
# I wonder when it's going to end
# But I guess that's OK
'cause maybe someday
# I know just how it's going to be
# He'll ride up on a steed
Get down on one knee
# And say "Mary, will you marry me?"
# Please #
Oh...
# I've got everything that I need
# Right in front of me
# Nothing's stoppin' me
Nothin' that I can't be

Nothing's stopping you
# Nothing that you can't do that the world can throw at you
# Life's a happy song
# When there's someone by your side to sing
# Life's a happy song
# When there's someone by your side to sing

OK, they're gone!
Hey, Gary, what should we do first at Muppet Studio?
'Cause I was thinking that maybe we could start at Fozzie's Joke Room...
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
The lines might be shorter at Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun, so maybe we should start there instead.
I just... I just can't wait!
Oh, Walter, don't be nervous.
Oh, I know.
I just can't believe I'm here.
The home of the Muppets!
What... What happened to this place?
Where...?
- Where is everyone, Gary?
- I don't know, buddy. It's so...
OK, well, I guess you guys are it for today.
Anyway, welcome to the original Muppet Studio, where dreams can come true.
- Is this the Universal Studios?
- Yes, it is.
OK, now if you'll just follow me, please.
OK. This used to be Kermit's office.
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.
It's really the highlight of the tour.
You should see it sometime.
OK, this next building is where they kept the rope and the medium-gauge wire for the productions. Let's go take a look.
Come on, buddy.
Wow!
Oh, boy.
Oh.
Whoa.
There. Now this here is
Kermit the Frog's old office.
Or so we've been "toad."
Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've loved the Muppets since I was a boy.
And what better way to honor the Muppets than to make this beautiful studio a Muppet museum.
I think I'll call this room the "Kermit the Frog's
Old Office Room."
- Oh, that is lovely.
- Oh, good one, Mr. Richman.
Now, this here is the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract
Kermit signed 30 years ago, that contains...
- The deed to this property.
- Exactly.
Now, this contract is 100 percent ironclad, with one minor exception.
If the Muppets can raise the ten million dollars it would cost to buy the building before this contract expires,
- then they get their studio back.
- You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you were reciting some sort of an important plot point.
Well, I hope so. Otherwise,
I just bored the audience half to death.
You mean half the audience is still alive?
It's nice doing business with you.
- Yes, sir. Come on.
- Goodbye.
I love geriatric humor.
Gentlemen, there's oil under this studio.
Yeah, I can smell it.
And more importantly, the geological survey says there definitely is.
In two weeks, we tear this place to the ground and start drilling. Ah, those Muppets.
They think they're so funny.
Well, it looks like the joke's about to be on them.
Maniacal laugh.
Maniacal laugh.
Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh.
Maniacal laugh.
- Walter!
- Walter?
- Walter!
- Walter!
Yeah, so then, when he thought they were alone, he said,
"There's oil under this studio, see.
I'm gonna tear it to the ground, see.
- Sweet, sweet oil, see!"
- People still talk like that?
Maybe that's just how he sounded in my head.
Either way, we've got to find Kermit!
He'll know what to do.
How do we find Kermit?
Nobody's seen him in years.
Stop the car!
I've got an idea!
Mmm.
These are delicious!
- Great idea, Walter.
- Mm-hmm.
We've been doing this for a long time.
I think maybe we should call it a night.
- Guys!
- We can't give up, Gary.
But it's getting really late. Maybe we should just go back to the motel.
- Guys!
- It...
- What?
- What?
- Maybe he lives there.
- Oh. That's it.
So, what do we do now?
I don't see a doorbell, and the house looks empty.
- Gary, throw me over.
- What?
- Gary, just throw me over already!
- OK.
- OK, here we go. OK...
- One, two, three.
- That's good.
- Sorry.
- No, it's good.
- Guys?
I think that's an electric fence.
Mary, it's Kermit the Frog.
- OK, buddy, head down.
- One, two, three!
- It's an electric fence.
- Yep.
Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy?
Walter, can you hear me?
- Throw me again.
- No, I don't...
I don't think that's a good idea.
- What kind of throw was that?
- I think there's somebody coming.
Excuse me...
You OK? That was quite a tumble.
Oh. Look, look. I think...
Hey. Hey, Walter?
- Walter, you all right, buddy?
- Where am I?
OK, this is awesome.
We're at Kermit's house.
- Oh, jeez. Walter.
- No, no, no, no, no. You OK?
This... This is Kermit's house?
Anyhow, how can I help you guys?
Let me just say, this is an honor for all of us to meet you, sir, but my brother, Walter, has some really disturbing news for you.
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Not now, 80's Robot.
Might I offer you a drink? Tab?
- Good grief.
- New Coke?
Listen. Not right now,
80's Robot, please!
Bummer.
- Watch out for the...
- Gag me with a spoon.
- Yeah, head for the door.
- Grody to the max.
Ow.
Ow.
I'm really sorry about that...
...Walter. What were you saying?
- Yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, is...
- Yes, yes, yes.
Oil baron Tex Richman, the wealthy philanthropist.
You know, he's about to buy our old Muppet Show theater and turn it into a Muppet museum.
Isn't that great?
- No! I mean...
- What Walter's trying to tell you is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to tear down the theater and drill for oil.
- What?
- The only way to save the studio is to raise ten million dollars.
Ten million dollars? That's impossible.
- But...
- The only way to raise that kind of money would be to...
...would be to put on a show.
And I haven't seen the old gang in a long, long time.
I guess people sort of forgot about us.
Hm?
# Is there more I could've said?
# Now they're only pictures in my head
# That's why my green is feeling gray
# Sometimes even frogs have rainy days
# Remember when the stage caved in while you were rocking out?
# Who'd have thought your smorgasbord would be hard to live without?
# If we could do it all again
# Just another chance to entertain
# Would anybody watch or even care?
# Or did something break we can't repair?
# Your cannonball trajectory
It always gave me hope
# They may have been unbearable but I still loved your jokes
# Is there more I could've said?
# Now they're only pictures in my head
I didn't do it. I've been framed!
Ahh. Wocka wocka!
Gonzo the Great will ride this baby again!
Muah!
This legato tune is posolutely, most transparently bringing me down.
- For sure.
- One, two, and a half...
# Can we do it all again?
# Make'em laugh like we did then
# We can harmonize for one more song
# But I'm standing here instead
# Now they're only pictures in my head #
Well, it sounds like you guys aren't getting back together anytime soon.
Mmm...
This is going to be a really short movie.
But, Kermit, you have to try.
I... The Muppets are amazing.
You give people the greatest gift that can ever be given.
- Children?
- No, the other gift.
- Ice cream?
- No, no. After that.
- Laughter?
- Yes!
The third greatest gift ever!
Kermit, your fans never left you, the world hasn't forgotten.
All you need to do is show'em again!
Hmm.
I don't think so, guys.
Don't you see, Kermit?
It's time to play the music.
# It's time to light the lights
# It's time to meet the Muppets... #
Please, Kermit.
You're my hero.
You're on my watch.
Well, I... I guess...
...we could try.
- We?
- Well, yeah, listen.
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need some moral support.
Well, that's perfect.
We're experts at moral support.
- Yeah!
- Good. I guess if we're gonna go, we better get going.
We got a lot of people to find.
Oh, great! But wait, how do we find'em?
Didn't you see our first movie?
We drive.
- So where do we go first?
- I shall take the liberty of using my modem to locate the Muppets.
- OK.
- Great.
Oh, stop it!
In the name of all that's sacred, let it end!
R-E-N-O. That spells "Reno."
You have reached your destination.
My guidance ends here.
Well, I guess this is the place.
Good evening, folks, and welcome to Pechoolo Casino!
# Why are there such great deals
# On our hotel rooms?
# Free parking for cars
- # Not RVs
- # Not RVs
# Our wedding chapel is 24 hours
- # No marriage certificate is needed
- # No marriage certificate is needed
# We're glad you found it
# Pechoolo Casino
# The owners, the Moopets and me #
Cha-cha-cha!
Thank you, thank you.
We'll be back in six minutes.
Hmm.
- Hi-ho, Fozzie.
- Hi-ho, Kermit.
Kermit?
What are you doing here?
Well, I... I just want to tell you that was a great show.
It was... very informative.
I do my best to keep it fresh each night.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, I'm Fozzie, by the way.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Gary and Mary.
And this here is Walter.
He's a personal friend.
- Yeah.
- So I said, "What are you looking at?"
So I punched him in the face! I mean...
- Let's talk in my dressing room.
- Sure.
- OK.
- Here we are.
Make yourselves at home.
Wow.
This is not quite what I expected,
- based on your Christmas cards.
- Oh, yeah. About that...
Oh, but it's nice, and... and airy.
Maybe we should give them some space.
I know, but I wanna hear what they're gonna say. OK.
Sixty-four shows nightly can get pretty grueling.
Fozzie, an evil oil baron wants to tear down our old Muppet studio.
What? Oh, no!
I mean, that's a shame.
Step out of the vehicle!
Hey, Fozzie...
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch more.
It's fine, Kermit. Look at me!
Living the dream!
Uh-oh.
Oh, no! Not this again!
- Quick, save the cushions!
- The cushions?
I'm sorry, Fozzie.
If I'd known you were here in this place...
That's all right, Kermit.
It's not your fault.
- We had a good run.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's just that...
Well, we haven't seen each other in a really long time, and I...
I just thought maybe we could raise the money to buy the theater back if we all got together and put on one last show.
A show? But I've spent years building a solo career.
I have a whole new show-biz family that loves me.
Fozzie! What the heck are you doing, hibernating?
Next show starts in 30 seconds.
We hired you, and we can fire you, so get your butt in here now!
- They terrify me. Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Watch out for the forklift, Fozzie.
- Oh, thanks.
Wow! Gonzo's doing really well!
According to 80's Robot, he's the richest plumbing magnate in the Rust Belt.
You! Order 28,000 tons of plumber's putty from Beijing.
- Right away, sir.
- And, you, send the 28,000 tons of Silly Putty back to Beijing.
- You bet.
- Oh, and you?
A memo to the waterless toilet department.
I don't care about the mess, just keep trying.
- Hi, Gonzo.
- Kermit? Fozzie? This is a surprise.
- We need to speak to you.
- All right. Have a seat.
Ah. Thank you!
- I think I'll stand.
- No, really, you should try one! Comfy.
It's our executive line of used toilets.
Anyway, I'm very busy.
I've got 30 seconds. Go.
Uh... Gonzo, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...
Don't forget to mention the evil oil baron.
Yes, Fozzie, I was about to.
Just give me a moment, OK?
Gonzo, it would appear...
Remember, evil oil baron.
Fozzie, I'm going to get to that. Please!
- As I was trying to say...
- Evil oil baron.
OK, time's up. Thank you, guys.
Gonzo, we're trying to get the old gang back together again.
- We really need you.
- My answer is no. Good day!
Come on, guys. We should go.
I just want to say, when I was a kid,
I saw you recite Hamlet while jumping your motorbike through a flaming hoop, and...
...it made me feel like I could do anything.
Thank you. Yeah.
- Good try, Walter.
- Hey, guys, up here!
- Ya-haa!
- Huh?
I've been wearing this under my suit every single day for years!
Look out below!
Whoa, where you going?
You threw me off-balance!
I can't see! Apollo 13!
Citizens of Earth, the Great Gonzo is back.
I pledge never to hold a plunger again!
Run! Run! Run for your lives!
Run, run, run!
- Run, guys!
- Run!
Oh, my gosh, run everybody!
It's gonna be big!
It's gonna be a big one!
Wow! That was an expensive looking explosion!
I can't believe we had that in the budget.
So maybe if you look inside yourself, the person you should be most angry at is you.
Is you.
How have you been feeling?
Any more control issues?
In control.
- Good.
- Psst. Animal!
- Excellent.
- It's me, Kermit.
Hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
You're being really rude, frog!
Pardon us, please. Animal,
I need to talk to you for a second.
We're getting the Muppets back together.
We need you to drum again.
- Animal drum?
- Yes!
- Please, sir.
- Drum! Drum, drum!
- Drum, drum, drum!
- OK, OK.
- In control.
- Good.
I'm Animal's court-appointed sponsor.
We don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.
- It's his trigger word.
- His trigger word?
Excuse me, Mr. Black.
I'm so sorry to interrupt, but it's very important to these guys that they get their drummer...
Gary!
It's my trigger word, too.
Jack, we talked about this on Tuesday.
Tuesday's another one of my trigger words!
Oh, I don't think so!
Sorry.
- Let's go, Animal.
- Bye-bye!
- Animal, heel.
- Go, Animal! Be free, man!
But remember! No drumming!
Mr. Kermit, may I suggest we save time and pick up the rest of the Muppets using a montage?
Great idea, 80's Robot.
We greatly appreciate your financial support.
Eighty-seven point three miles to go. Eighty-seven point two...
80's Robot, do you have to do that?
...the secrets of the universe...
I guess we're in.
Welcome to this week's edition of "Everything Stinks."
Whoa!
Bye, Lisa.
Off to the TED Conference.
Three, two, one.
Think we should've rented a bigger car?
Hey, wait for me!
I wanna help save the studio!
I wanna go with you! Oh, not again.
Wow. I can't believe we're all back together.
Even all you guys who weren't in the montage!
Yeah, how come you didn't use me in the montage?
I thought my story was pretty interesting.
Rowlf? Wanna get back together?
- OK.
- Good.
Classic.
Anyhow, looks like we got everybody, so we can plan our telethon and raise that ten million dollars.
- Well, not everybody.
- No, I think everybody's here.
- Where's...?
- All good!
- Miss...
- All done here!
Piggy?
Kermit, we're going to get Miss Piggy, right?
OK, OK, OK, you're right.
We'll go get Piggy!
My Minitel tells me she is in Paris, France.
Oh! Well, then we drive to France.
- You can't drive to France, Walter.
- Yeah. It's way too far.
Then maybe we should travel by map!
- Good idea, Fozzie.
- Yeah!
To Paris!
Paris! Paris!
Look at these ceilings!
Yeah. They must be very tall here.
Yeah, very nice.
Uh... Hi there. Excuse me.
Miss? Pardon me, ma'am?
Hi there! We're here to see
Miss Piggy, and it's urgent.
Urgent! Urgent!
- Is it urgent?
- Very. Yes.
Let's have a look then, shall we?
She has an opening in...
- ...early September.
- Early September?
That's like six months from now!
That's nothing. Once I waited a whole year for September.
She is the plus-size editor.
She's a huge deal and extremely busy.
You can't just pop in without an appointment.
- OK, then.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- Mean lady.
- Close the door on your way out.
- Thanks a lot.
- She wasn't very nice.
- Yeah.
Guys! Muppet Man!
- Yeah!
- That could work!
Hello.
I have an appointment.
Oh, OK.
Um...
Will you wait here a moment?
Decisions, decisions.
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo. I choose you.
Mademoiselle Cochonnet?
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Of course.
There's a... man here to see you.
He does have an appointment.
An appointment? That's weird.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Send him in!
Right away. Sorry.
- Ahahaha.
- Remember, left foot, right foot.
Hello.
Whoa.
- What the...?
- Sorry.
That looked expensive.
- You look familiar.
- So do you!
Please, have a seat.
Yes, we're going to have a seat now.
- No, no, no, don't sit down!
- Oh, sorry! Whoa!
Uh-oh.
Message to head. Left leg in trouble!
Going down. Left leg going down!
What?
Ohh!
I can't believe I fell for Muppet Man.
- You guys OK?
- Is anyone hurt?
Kermit?
- Hello, Piggy.
- Kermie!
Oh, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie,
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!
Mm, mm, mm. Kissy-kissy.
Mm, mm, mm!
Wait! What am I doing?
I promised myself I'd never go back!
I am woman! I am strong!
You must leave at once!
- OK.
- No, no, wait, wait!
Miss Piggy!
The Muppet Studios are in danger.
In danger? Our studios? Kermit!
It's true, Piggy. And we need to do The Muppet Show again.
We need you.
Oh.
Before I decide anything,
I need to talk with you, frog.
Alone.
Piggy? Last time we were together,
I said some things I regret.
No. No, Kermit.
You were just being honest.
You never intended to marry me.
Not even after I built us a house where we could raise tadpoles and grow old together.
Well, who do you think's been looking after that house all these years, huh?
Piggy, why do you have to always be so overdramatic about things?
You know, it leaves me no choice but to do things that hurt you.
I am who I am. Why can't you accept that about me?
Look, this is not about you and me.
It's never about you and me, is it?
It's always we. We this, we that.
"We" need you. You can't even say,
"I need you," can you?
Piggy...
I'm sorry, Kermit, but I have a life here.
A life I've made for myself.
Piggy!
Just remember, Kermit,
I cannot be replaced.
Kermit? What happened?
Where's Miss Piggy?
She's not coming, Fozzie.
But, Kermit, we always worked together.
We can't do this without Miss Piggy.
No one will give us a show without her.
We'll be fine, Fozzie.
We'll be fine.
We just...
We'll just have to come up with something else.
Kermie.
OK, I've got an idea.
We need a pig that can sing.
But, Kermit, who could possibly replace Miss Piggy?
Hey, what's everybody so quiet about, huh?
- Well, she's sorta like Miss Piggy.
- Come on, everybody.
Let's go pitch our telethon and get the Muppets back on TV, OK?
- No.
- No.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, that's wonderful!
That means no.
- Come on, guys.
- Awkward.
Listen, Kermit, I like you.
I remember you guys from when I was a kid.
So I'm gonna shoot straight.
You guys aren't famous anymore.
I wish she'd shot a little more curvy.
Take a look at this diagram the research department drew up.
This circle represents everything that's currently popular.
And this tiny speck is you guys.
So the answer's no.
It's not gonna happen.
Take a look at the shows that are popular now. Punch Teacher.
- Oh! I love that show.
- It's time to punch teacher!
- Finish him!
- It's my favorite.
I just thought
I could make a difference.
I'm sorry, but in this market, you guys are no longer relevant. Have a good day.
Before I go,
I'd just like to say something.
I think kids are smarter and better than all this junk, and if you...
Veronica, bad news. Punch Teacher has stopped production.
It's being sued by the
Teachers Society of America.
- What's their problem?
- No idea. I just found out.
What are we supposed to do with that 120-minute black hole in the schedule coming up in two days?
OK, Muppets.
You've got yourselves a show.
- All right!
- Oh, yes!
Thank you so much. You will not be sorry, I promise, I promise!
OK, enough! One, no more going nuts in my office. These are new carpets.
- Yes, ma'am.
- And two, you need a celebrity host.
OK. Whatever, whatever.
Come on, guys, let's go. Yeah!
- Let me wipe that.
- You've missed a spot.
- I don't see it.
- Just a little lower!
- Oh, I am so sorry. Did I get you...
- Yes.
Well, gentlemen. It appears we have some competition on the Muppet property.
The Economist says they've gotten back together again.
- The Muppets got back together?
- Remember?
# Together again
Gee, it's good to be... #
Gentlemen, please!
No singing in my office!
- Yes, sir.
- But, of course, it was all his fault.
- Mostly his fault.
- No matter.
Point is, that studio and that oil belong to me.
Yeah, those Muppets are gonna be running home with their tails between their legs.
Some of'em literally.
Because those ones have tails.
Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh.
That's a maniacal laugh moment.
OK, this is it. 80's Robot, let's park around back.
It's The Muppet Show, with our special guest star,
Mr. Bob Hope!
Time once again for Veterinarian's Hospital, the continuing story of...
And now, Pigs in Space!
Gary. Can you believe it?
- The Muppet theater.
- Yeah.
- Welcome back, everyone.
- Thanks.
Well, I know the old place is not quite at its best right now.
Yeah! Who cancelled the maid service?
But don't worry. We'll be fine.
Kermit, there's no way we can rehearse with the place like this.
Wait. Kermit, don't say another word.
Mary, Walter and I, well, we would be happy to help you rebuild the theater.
Honestly, it would be an honor for all three of us.
- So would.
- OK. Well, let's clean this place up!
Yeah!
- This is boring.
- But don't you guys remember?
You're the Muppets!
You do this to music!
Well, all right!
- Hey, Animal!
- Yeah?
Look what I found!
- Beauregard!
- Scooter! Good to see you!
Where's everybody been?
Celebrity... celebrity!
Hello! Yes. Could I speak with President Carter, please?
He moved? Well, you don't happen to have a number where I could reach... Hello?
Walter, I thought we were gonna clean the balcony.
- Doing a great job, pal.
- You're doing a great job.
- Wocka wocka.
- Hey, guys!
Look at these old photos I just found.
Oooh.
Can you believe that 80's haircut I used to have?
I looked totally ridiculous!
Yes, it's Kermit. The frog.
Could you come to our celebrity telethon this weekend?
Sure. Sure, I understand.
- Hey, shut the door!
- What is that?
Say hello to the little friend.
There goes dinner.
Wow! Great job, everybody!
Oh, hey, Kermit.
Listen, have a great night, and I just want you to know,
Walter and I are really good sewers, so we'll have those costumes ready for you in no time.
- Good. You two have a great night.
- OK. Thank you!
- Bye.
- Kermit?
Gary, I was kind of hoping that we could go to the beach tomorrow
- or see the Hollywood Sign.
- We'll have plenty of time to do that stuff. It's just, right now,
I don't wanna leave Walter.
You know, he needs me.
I don't know, sweetheart, he seems pretty happy.
- Like that.
- Oh, OK.
Now you.
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, yeah, good job!
Well, just one more day, OK?
And then I'm all yours.
Tell you what. Why don't you get a head start on sightseeing tomorrow, and then I'll be waiting for you when you get back.
OK. Just... don't forget about me.
Never.
Well, we're still on for dinner Friday, right?
Yeah, of course.
- Oh, Walter!
- Oh, yes, Kermit.
Hey, listen, Walter,
I just wanna tell you that none of this would have happened without you, so thank you.
- Oh, well...
- And welcome aboard.
Night, everybody. Just sleep anywhere you can find a spot.
"Welcome aboard"?
Hey, Kermit. You awake?
- Yep.
- What's the weather
- supposed to be like tonight?
- I don't know. Why?
I just don't want it to rain through the hole in the ceiling.
Stars sure are pretty, though.
We're gonna be OK, right?
We haven't done this in a long time, and I really don't wanna go back to Reno.
Don't worry, Fozzie. We'll be fine.
Look how we cleaned this place up today, you know?
Same old team, all pulling together.
I guess you're right.
Night-night, Kermit.
Good night, Fozzie.
OK, gather round, troops! Everybody, time to get this rehearsal going.
- Scooter, is everybody here?
- Almost everyone, chief.
- Yeah...
- Hey, anybody got any kerosene?
I wanna take these old pig dresses out back and burn'em.
Hold it right there, sausage snout!
- Piggy?
- Huh?
Well, look what the cat dragged in.
Come on. Keep it up, Maurice.
Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've been replaced... permanently.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
I don't think so... sister?
Who you calling sister, sister?
- Oh, look, an omelet station!
- Oh, where?
Hiya!
There's only one Miss Piggy, and she is moi.
Yeah, well, you ain't seen the last of me! I'll be back!
Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash?
Welcome back, Miss Piggy.
All right, all right, don't crowd me!
Wow, she sure hasn't changed.
Piggy? You came back.
I'm not here for you, Kermit.
I'm here for them.
And, besides, when this show's done,
I'm catching the next plane back to my life in Paris.
OK, Piggy, OK. Places for the opening number, everybody!
Oh, good morning, Veronica.
- Morning, Frog.
- OK, everybody, take it from the top.
Oooh!
- You missed your cue.
- I know!
There's kind of a rhythm to this, you know?
Uh... Oh, and if you like that one, what's the bear capital of the world?
Mos-cow!
Ha.
# It's time to play the music
- # It's time to light the lights
- Two, three, four.
# It's time to put on makeup
# It's time to dress up right #
Hey guys, stop. Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. What's the problem?
We can't keep time without the drums, man! We need drums!
- Sorry, Animal.
- No drums! No drums!
- Jack Black said no drums!
- Animal, heel! Sit!
- Who's next? Oh.
- In control.
- Hey, Walter?
- Oh. Yes, Kermit?
You think you might wanna help us out here?
Maybe do something in the show?
Kermit, you know, you've been so nice to me, but I have to face the facts.
See, the Muppets are so talented...
Hey, guys, check it out! Fart shoes!
- Patent pending!
- And...
...I don't have any talent at all.
The truth is...
I can't perform with you guys.
I feel like a phony just being here.
Walter, just because you haven't found your talent yet, doesn't mean you don't have one.
If you look inside yourself,
I'm sure you'll find something that you're really good at.
OK, Kermit. I'll try.
Take my picture!
Welcome.
How many in your party? Two?
Uh... No, just the one.
All right, party of one, follow me.
# I look around, and once again I'm on my own
# My man ain't here
He's gone and done me wrong
# No one's gonna stop this girl from having fun
# I throw my hands up high and have a party for one
# I'm having a me party
A party by myself
# A me party
I don't need nobody else
# A me party
I'm the first and last to show
# There's no one at this party that I don't already know
# I'm not gonna sit around by myself and wait for you
# Haven't you heard?
One is the new two
# I'm gonna make a scene
I'm gonna make a fuss
# Tonight I'm gonna celebrate with just the one of us
# I'm having a me party
# Haven't I seen me here before?
# A me party
# I'm the last one on the dance floor
- # Me party
- # A party just for moi
- # Me party
- # It's a solo Mardi Gras
# I'm having a me party
I'm such good company
- # A me party
- # I saved the last dance for me
# What happens at a me party stays at a me party #
Excuse me, miss, are you expecting anyone else?
Oh... no.
No, it's just me. Party of one.
Order up!
- OK, cue 17 is Fozzie's intro.
- Hey, Scooter? What's left?
Oh, uh, it's you, chief!
- Hm?
- Your duet. With Piggy.
- Miss Piggy?
- Hm?
We're all out front practicing our acts and seems that everybody expects you and I to do a duet, so...
Oh, that's so lovely, but I'm afraid I can't.
No, no, you see, I'm already doing a duet with my new dance partner.
Hola.
OK, come on, rehearsing, let's go. We gotta break it up.
- Excuse us.
- 'Scuse us.
Let's try that lift again, shall we?
The lift again.
OK, on my count this time, OK?
In three, two... Wait for me!
Good grief.
Kermit! There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere!
So nice to see you, Veronica.
Who's hosting?
Did you find a celebrity?
Yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to you about that, you see, because...
Well, actually, I'm kind of a celebrity.
You?
No. Kermit, listen.
I will not air the show unless you find a real celebrity host.
I will rerun Benson if I have to.
Yeah, you see, the thing is, Veronica, that's kind of impossible because the show's in 12 hours!
Twelve hours!
I might as well just go and ask Tex
Richman to give us the studio back!
And the Muppets are like a big family.
Well... And for us, that theater is... is like our home.
Which is why, in conclusion...
...we humbly ask that you give us back our studio.
It would certainly mean a lot to us.
Hmmm.
Well, Mr. The Frog, let me see.
Correct!
The answer is no.
Well, you could've just said that.
- Contract.
- Contract.
Contract.
- Nicely done, sir.
- You see, Muppets, according to this contract, it's not just this studio you lose the rights to tonight,
- it's the Muppet name itself.
- What?
And all characters under the Muppet name.
Wait a second. What possible use could you have for our names?
Told ya I'd be back.
Well, now I am...
...back.
And I see you've met Mr. Richman, our new business partner.
The Moopets are a hard, cynical act for a hard, cynical world.
Hey, Fozzie! I want you to meet a friend of mine.
- Wocka wocka.
- You're relics, Muppets!
The world has moved on, and no one cares about your goody-goody, hippy-dippy,
Julie Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin', singin'-and-dancin' act anymore!
You're dead!
And I just come to bury you.
Now, get out of my office.
- What?
- What is that supposed to mean?
You said you were gonna talk to the man!
Guys! OK, so maybe
Kermit signed away the theater and the Muppet name, but as long as we have a celebrity host, we can still pull off a heart-warming, last-minute triumph, right, Kermit?
Well, actually I don't see how we can, Fozzie.
- Huh?
- What?
Guys, the show's in six hours, and we're barely rehearsed, and, well, I...
I couldn't get us a celebrity host.
- Oh, no!
- What?
I'm afraid Tex Richman's right.
The world's moved on.
I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this mess.
Kermit?
All right, listen up, you freaks!
I didn't come 5,000 miles to not be on TV.
All we need is one stinkin' celebrity, and by any means necessary.
Now, the frog's gone.
We're doing things my way from now on.
Let's move!
- Hey!
- Hi.
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was great.
I went to Guinness Book of World Records... alone.
Then Ripley's Believe It or Not... solo.
And then I ate lunch unaccompanied, and then I walked back here... independently.
Listen, I got you these.
You know, to make up for the other ones. The broken ones.
Thanks, sweetie.
Listen, Gary.
I was just wondering what the plan was for dinner tonight.
Oh, I don't care.
What do you feel like?
OK. That's fine.
That's just fine.
That's... that's perfect.
I'm going to go for a walk.
Individually.
- Walter, hey.
- Gary.
Oh, where have you been? I need you to help me figure out a talent.
A talent for what?
For the show. Kermit asked me to do an act in the show.
I... I could be a Muppet.
Wow. Wow, Walter, that's amazing.
Yeah, but I need to figure out if I have a talent.
Well, you know what?
I'm sure you'll think of something, but right now I actually...
I need your help.
I'm starting to get the feeling that
Mary's upset with me about something, and I don't know what, and I was hoping maybe you would talk to her for me.
Gary, I'd love to help you out, but I can't leave the theater now.
This is important.
Well, hold on a second.
I mean, my life is important, too.
Yeah, but the whole reason we came here was to see the Muppets.
No, it wasn't!
The whole reason we came here was to take a vacation where
I took Mary out to a fancy dinner because it's our tenth anniversary, and then...
- Walter, what day is today?
- Friday.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
This is bad.
Walter, this is really bad. I have to...
- Mary? Mary!
- Wait.
Gary, I need you.
OK, is everybody ready?
Commence Operation
Celebri-nap. Masks on!
- Masks on!
- Except for moi.
Nothing covers this beautiful face.
- No maskin'?
- No maskin'.
Check the door on Stage 28.
- I'm going over there now.
- She's done in makeup...
I told you, I'm not done putting on my balls!
Oh, hey, Animal.
What are you doin' here?
Acting. Natural.
Now!
Whoa!
Hiya!
Hiya!
Mary, surprise! I figured out why you're mad... at me.
Gary, I've gone home.
I love you, but you need to decide, are you a man or a Muppet?
# I reflect on my reflection
# And I ask myself the question
# What's the right direction to go?
# I don't know
# Am I a man
- # Or am I a Muppet?
- # Am I a Muppet?
# If I'm a Muppet
Then I'm a very manly Muppet
- # Very manly Muppet
- # Am I a Muppet?
- # Muppet
- # Or am I a man?
# Am I a man?
# If I'm a man that makes me a Muppet of a man
# A Muppet of a man
# I look into these eyes
# And I don't recognize
# The one I see inside
# It's time for me to decide
# Am I a man
# Or am I a Muppet?
# Am I a Muppet?
# If I'm a Muppet
Well, I'm a very manly Muppet
- # Very manly Muppet
- # Am I a Muppet?
- # Muppet
- # Or am I a man?
# Am I a man?
# If I'm a man that makes me a Muppet of a man
# A Muppet of a man
# Here I go again
# I'm always running out of time
# I think I made up my mind
# Now I understand who I am
# I'm a man
# I'm a Muppet
- # I'm a Muppet of a man
- # I'm a very manly Muppet
# I'm a Muppet-y man
I'm so sorry.
- Oh, Gary.
- Mary.
# That's what I am #
Kermit. We have our celebrity!
Mr. Jack Black has graciously agreed to do the telethon!
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
Where is he?
- In the trunk.
- Get me outta here!
You kidnapped Jack Black?
That's illegal!
But, Kermit, what's more illegal, briefly inconveniencing Jack Black,
- or destroying the Muppets?
- Kidnapping Jack Black, Fozzie!
Kermit, listen. Whatever
I may think of you right now, these guys are counting on you.
You inspire them.
- What, to kidnap people?
- To work together.
- To kidnap people?
- Mr. The Frog, we all agreed a celebrity is not a people.
And now that we have a celebrity, the show's back on.
Come on, Kermit.
Don't let these guys down now.
All right. Well, what are you guys still doing here, huh?
- It's showtime!
- All right!
That's it!
- Nicely done, sir. As usual.
- En garde.
Ow! Ow.
OK, very nice.
Halt! Point left!
Well done, sir. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
And coming up next on CDE,
The Muppet Telethon.
Kermit and friends host a celebrity-studded gala,
- with special guest, Jack Black.
- Oh! He's pretty good.
- We're going to phase two.
- Yes, Mr. Richman.
So do you think we're working for the bad guy?
Hurry! The show starts in ten minutes!
Where did you learn to drive?
Hang on, everyone!
Come on, guys. OK, listen up, everybody!
This is it! Five minutes to curtain!
- Kermit?
- Get ready for the opening number.
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you about my act.
Listen, Walter,
I know you're gonna be fine.
In fact, I'm sure you'll be great.
Scooter, who's up first?
- Come on, come on, come on!
- No...
Fly in the arches!
- OK, first we have the opening theme.
- Of course. Yeah.
- You come out and introduce Fozzie.
- Right.
Then we have...
TV executive at six o'clock!
- What?
- The show is a disaster, Frog!
- Veronica...
- Where's the audience?
I knew you guys weren't popular anymore.
I should have trusted that chart.
There's no one here!
- What about Hobo Joe?
- Who?
Why does everybody forget about Hobo Joe?
- Just a second. Scooter!
- Yeah, chief?
- Did you hand out all those flyers?
- Of course. Every last one!
Don't worry.
We'll think of something!
You better.
Yoo-hoo! You've got audience.
It's me! What am I, invisible?
Jack Black.
Fifteen seconds to curtain, Mr. Black.
- Hi!
- Ah! Where am I?
Why am I so fancy? What are you doing?
You're ruining my look!
- We'll see you out there! Good luck!
- Stop cleaning me!
- You sure got nice teeth, Jack Black.
- Yeah.
We're here!
- Start the show!
- Ready for some kind of entertainment!
All right, good luck, everyone, and cue Scooter.
OK, we go live in three, two...
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your host, Kermit the Frog.
It's The Muppet Telethon, with our very special guest,
Mr. Jack Black! Yay!
# It's time to play the music
# It's time to light the lights
# It's time to meet the Muppets on The Muppet Show tonight
# It's time to put on makeup
# It's time to dress up right
# It's time to get things started
# Why don't you get things started?
I always dreamed we'd be back here.
Dreams? Those were nightmares!
# It's time to get things started
# On the most sensational inspirational, celebrational
# Muppetational
This is what we call The Muppet Show #
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Muppet Telethon!
We have Muppets standing by to take your calls.
- Yes, we are.
- Hi. Hello.
Could I have a large pizza with ham and...?
Yes, and, boy, do we have a wonderful show for you, with our special guest, Mr. Jack Black!
I'm being held captive by these weirdos!
Now you know how we've felt for the past 40 years!
Somebody, anybody, please call the police. This is real rope!
- Man, this 3-D is incredible!
- This is real!
Oh, and by the way, folks, we have plenty of room here in the audience, so if you'd like to come down and see the show live...
There's no audience in the theater.
Look, it's totally empty.
Poor Walter.
Maybe we should go back.
No way, Mary.
I've made my choice already.
I just sang a whole song about it.
I wanna stay here with you.
So thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves for the Great Gonzo's most amazing feat ever.
- Head bowling.
- What? No!
I have not signed off on this!
Drumroll, please.
And a one and a two and a three!
Uh-oh. Uh... My fingers got stuck.
All part of the act, folks. Stay tuned.
Please, make this end! Please!
This is great. Call'em.
Hello?
You wanna give us some money?!
Uhhh...
- Say yes!
- Yes! We will take that money!
Hey, guys, we got us some money!
Oh, yeah, tickets. Here we are.
Tickets. Thank you.
Five dollars to show you your seat.
It's up there somewhere.
- Help!
- OK, thank you, Gonzo.
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will see what happens with head bowling a little later in the show.
Up next is our furry funny man,
Mr. Fozzie Bear! Yay!
Thank you, thank you, and thank you.
Boy, did I go to a bad seafood place last night.
The catch of the day was salmonella.
Wocka wocka!
- OK.
- Ah! That joke's like 50 years old!
So how'bout those shopping centers?
You seen one, you seen a mall! Take it.
Make it stop!
- Wocka wocka wocka wocka!
- Make it stop! No!
- We're not a team! I'm not with him!
- What is happening?
People are actually watching this?
Deadly! Bring the car!
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Walter? Sixty seconds till you're on, Walter.
You ready?
No. Yes, yes, yes...
Whoopi Goldberg?
Selena Gomez? And... hi there.
Yeah, look, somebody said there might be a career opportunity here,
- something about saving a theater.
- Yes, yes, of course.
I don't really know who you guys are.
My agent just told me to show up.
- That's great.
- Are you one of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
Yes, I am, and let me show you how you can help.
And don't worry. It's just your one shot to go on live TV before millions of people to prove you have what it takes to become one of the Muppets.
Good luck.
Up next, folks, I am proud to present a brand-new act to the show. Introducing Walter.
That's not good.
It appears that
Walter has stepped out, so it's...
Well, it's back to the days of yore down at the old barbershop.
Oh, no! It's a barbershop quartet!
Get me out of here!
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
Is that Nirvana? Stop it! No!
You're ruining one of the greatest songs of all time!
Ow!
Careful around the ears!
Ah! That was hot!
Hey! What's going on here?
Why is my body so big?
What'd you do to my voice?
I sound like a chipmunk!
Wait a second.
Did you guys shrink my head?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Black!
Nice work, everybody.
Chickens, you're up next!
It's going rather nicely.
We might just make this.
And now I am pleased and proud to present those princesses of poultry,
Camilla and friends!
Let's hear it for Camilla and her farmyard friends!
No, I... I don't know why I'm not hosting this.
So remember, folks, keep on calling and you'll help us reach our goal of ten million dollars by midnight.
And if...
Oh, dear.
Ladies and gentlemen, don't be alarmed.
We will get this sorted out just as soon as we can. Scooter!
Well, that's that. Nice try, Muppets!
Kermit, how are we going to raise the rest of the money with no electricity?
All right, calm down, everybody.
- Is everybody OK?
- Yeah.
Well, we can't do the show without power.
- Anybody got any bright ideas?
- Not now, Fozzie.
Ten-gauge gator grip.
I love it when you talk shop.
Oh!
- # La la la la la la la
- # Mee mee mee mee
What? How'd they get the power back?
We're gonna have to get up on that roof and shut'em down for good!
Bolt cutters!
Bolt cutters.
Deadly! You come with me.
That's it.
Hm.
To the end of the Muppets!
Deadly! What are you doing?
Enough!
Just because I have a terrifying name and an evil English accent, does not preclude the fact that, in my heart,
I am a Muppet, not a Moopet!
Looks like it's I who will have the last laugh!
- What does that mean?
- It's an idiom, you idiot, because you cannot laugh!
Ha ha!
Oopsie.
Deadly.
Now that's a maniacal laugh for you!
Hey, Gary, Mary, how'd you guys get here so fast?
We travelled by map.
We thought it'd be quicker.
Hey, I'm sorry I bailed. I just...
I realized you don't let the most important person in your world slip away.
- Hey, Scooter?
- Yeah?
Could you do me a favor and take over hosting duty?
But, chief, I don't go onstage.
Well, just do what I do.
Pretend that the audience is naked.
Yeah, but, I...
Ha... ha... ha...
Uh, Miss Piggy?
You are all naked.
Well, sorta.
OK. Great!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, a real hero...
You saved it?
After all this time?
Oh, Kermie.
I guess I'm not that good at saying this kind of stuff.
- Yes, Kermie?
- Well...
...over the last week,
I realized that...
...I... I miss you.
And I need you.
And maybe you don't need the, the whole world to love you.
Maybe you just need one person.
It's time for our song, and if we don't raise the money tonight, it might be the last time we sing together.
And... Well, are you ready?
Oh, Kermie.
# Why are there so many
# Songs about rainbows?
# And what's on the other side?
# Rainbows are visions
# But only illusions
# And rainbows have nothing to hide
# So we've been told
# And some choose to believe it
# I know they're wrong
Wait and see
# Someday we'll find it
# The rainbow connection
# The lovers, the dreamers and me
# All of us under its spell
# We know that it's
# Probably magic
# Have you been half asleep
# And have you heard voices?
# I've heard them calling my name
Hey, these are yours, man.
I kept'em for ya.
- Drum.
- No drum.
- Drum!
- No drum!
- Drum! Drum!
- No drum! No drum!
You know what to do.
# I've heard it too many times to ignore it
# It's something that
I'm supposed to be
- Aaah!
- # Someday we'll find it
# The rainbow connection
# The lovers, the dreamers and me #
Drum! Drum, drum! Drum!
Ah ha ha ha ha.
You still got it, man!
Piggy? Will you stay... for me?
- For you, Kermie?
- Yeah.
Of course!
Woo hoo!
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, all.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost midnight and we haven't quite reached our target yet, but if you'll all just stick around, we'll be right back with our final act.
The Muppet Telethon will return after these messages.
Walter? Walter, where are you, buddy?
Listen, everybody, the show ran short, and we don't have anything else planned.
We need one last act to bring us home.
I'm gonna go check on Jack Black and see if he has any ideas.
You guys see if you can come up with something.
We have two minutes! Two minutes!
- Think, think, think!
- What am I thinking?
Walter. Walt!
- Walter!
- Gary?
- Wha... You came back.
- Walter.
What are you doing down here?
They just need one more act. You gotta get out there and help those guys.
I can't. What if people laugh at me? I...
I'd rather go back home to Smalltown.
With you.
Look, Walter, you're my brother, and I'm always gonna love you, but you belong here, with these guys.
Hey, you're the one who got Kermit to do this.
You're the one who brought everyone here together.
You always believe in other people, but that's easy.
Sooner or later, you gotta believe in yourself, too, because that's what growing up is.
It's becoming who you want to be.
You have to try. Please, Walter.
You're my hero.
OK, Jack Black's got nothing.
What did you guys come up with?
- Bunsen can set Beaker on fire.
- No, no, no, we can't do that.
- I could break out the fart shoes.
- No, no, no, that will never work!
We're back in three, two...
Oh, no!
It's Walter.
Thank you.
- He's all grown up.
- Oh, that was wonderful!
Ladies and gentlemen, Walter!
It looks like we're going to get our studio back! the Muppets are about to take back their studio.
Help! I've been mugged.
Alerting authorities.
- We're sorry...
- What happened? Hello?
- Hello?
- Guys, my phone is dead.
News flash: My phone is also dead.
Repeat, my phone is also dead.
Ooh...
I did it. I beat you.
Game over, Kermit. You lost.
Chicky!
Too late, Muppets. I won!
Turn that thing off!
The show is over!
But we were so close!
Or not.
It kinda makes me feel better, honestly.
I mean, we were nowhere close at all.
You artists formerly known as the Muppets are standing on private property.
My private property.
And I'm telling you to leave. Now!
He's right, everybody.
He won. We gotta go.
Not now, Fozzie.
- I can't believe this.
- I know.
Well, that's that.
This isn't right.
It can't end like this.
But what can we do?
Listen, everybody, we've got nothing to be ashamed of. And you know why?
Well, because thanks to Walter here, we tried.
And if we failed, we failed together, and to me, that's not failing at all.
And I don't care what anybody says.
And I don't care if no one believes in us, because I believe.
- I believe in you.
- Huh?
- And you.
- Me?
And you.
You know, what's important isn't this building or a name.
It's each other. So I say, fine, let's just start at the bottom and work our way back up to the top.
- Yeah.
- Let's all walk out through these doors with our heads held high. As a family.
- Because that's what we are.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Muppets, Muppets, Muppets!
Wow.
Muppets, Muppets, Muppets!
All right.
- Wow.
- Wow.
Hey, where's Walter?
See? Your fans, they love you guys!
Hey, Walter.
Aren't you gonna join us?
- Yeah! Come on!
- Come on, Walter!
- Come on, Walter!
- Yes. Come!
What're you waiting for, buddy?
Get over there.
Yeah, go ahead.
Muppets! Muppets!
Muppets! Muppets! Muppets!
Hm? Oh.
How charming. A finale.

Hello.
- Hello.
- Man: I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Hi.
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.
Mockingbird Trail, right?
That is right.
I don't suppose you know how to get out there.
No, I don't.
Well, listen up.
It's a bit tricky.
- Keys.
- Thank you.
These arrows will get you through town.
Over here there are more dirt roads and woods.
Your cabin's a real beaut.
But heck, there ain't another for a good country mile.
I am looking forward to the peace and quiet.
I'm actually a novelist and I'm starting my next book here.
If that's what you're aiming for.
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.
Howdy, ma'am.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
No, that is okay.
You know what?
I am actually lost.
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.
It's about 10 miles back.
It's gonna be on your left-hand side.
Gonna make a left after a big red mailbox.
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.
You staying over in that cabin on Mockingbird?
- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!
So you know you're running a little hot.
Maybe I should check up under your hood for you.
How's that line working for you?
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?
- I got that.
- No, I got it.
No, I got it.
Oh shit.
I'm sorry, my bad.
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.
- Okay.
- All right?
Keep the change.
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.
Bye-bye.
Woman:
How's the writing coming?
You kidding me?
I should have come out here on my first book.
You gonna come back for Hertz's party?
Jen? Did I lose you?
Oh, sorry.
Something just-
Hey.
- You still there?
- Barb, hold on a second.
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.
You've got to be kidding me.
Way to go, Jennifer.
Ugh.
Ew!
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.
Man: Did you check the seal on the flapper?
I did that already.
- You did?
- Yes.
Look, I'm really in a spot here.
- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- You'll be there?
- I'm not going anywhere.
Man:
All right, I'll send someone.
Aggh!
So is this gonna take much longer?
Not much.
What's wrong with it?
Yes!
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.
Sorry. You saved me from having to bathe in the lake.
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.
Wait, I didn't-
Ground rule double.
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.
Fine, maybe a triple.
But you gotta knock its guts clean out its mouth if you wanna score a run.
Man, would you turn that shit off?
You're gonna get us in trouble with that human society.
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.
I told you, Andy, this thing's gonna make me a fortune.
So you two retards gonna go fishing or what?
Hey, speaking of retards...
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!
Well, Stanley, got us all here now.
What's the big show?
The big show is this.
What did you do this time, film yourself lighting a fart?
I don't know why I bother with you dipshits.
I got Matthew's girlfriend here in a very private moment.
Andy:
Girlfriend?
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since he was sucking on his mama's titties.
He had that city girl all alone and he didn't even try to nail her.
What city girl?
You know what girl.
The one from the gas station the other day.
The one that had you on your ass.
She had Matt here fixing her pipes.
She even gave him a kiss for servicing her.
Bullshit.
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.
Hey, Matthew, don't you lie to me.
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.
Oh shit.
Andy: Hey, that's some good camerawork, man.
You dirty dog, man.
How the fuck did you get that?
I've been working nights.
She sure is something to look at.
Yeah yeah.
And she likes me.
Come on, Matthew.
That girl wouldn't even give Johnny the time of day.
What?
Shit.
I can tame that ass if I want to.
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.
Stuck-up city bitch.
City bitch like that is ungettable.
Bullshit. I'll get it.
Let me tell you something:
I had that bitch creaming her panties.
Yeah, and she had you shitting in yours.
You don't think I can have that anytime I want to?
Hmm?
Let me tell you something:
Bitch like that, she come out here for one reason and one reason only.
Titties flopping in the window like that for everyone to see.
Come on, you know.
No no.
She's not like that, Johnny.
They're all like that.
Big city cock-teasing whore is all she is.
Fuckin' A.
Shit, Matthew.
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass like that if you got it.
No shit.
But you're lucky
'cause I'm your friend.
I'll show you the way.
Hello.
Nice shot, huh?
Evening.
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!
Well now.
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?
Smile real pretty for the camera, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.
You all better get out of here right now.
I called the cops.
Oh, she called the cops.
You called the police or you will call the police?
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.
What phone did you do that with?
Matthew told us you dropped yours in the drain.
Bloop!
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.
It's all right.
Come on now.
Come on, boy.
Come here.
Matthew here says that you didn't pay him for fixing your sink.
That's not true.
He ran out.
I'll take care of it.
Andy:
He's shy, huh?
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.
Hold up, wait a minute.
Let's not worry about any of that right now.
What's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone?
I'm writing.
I'm a writer.
She's a writer.
My boyfriend will be here soon.
He's coming up to the cabin.
Is that right?
Oh!
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Boys, now we better blow on out of here.
We don't wanna interrupt your date night.
Date night!
Let me tell you something, sweetheart:
There ain't no man in his right mind that leaves a pretty little thing like you out here all alone.
He's coming.
Night's almost over.
Oh wow.
Johnny:
Come here.
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.
Come here, pretty little thing.
Come here, have a drink with me.
No.
Oh, there you go.
I don't want to.
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?
- See?
- Mm-hmm.
Please, I just don't want to have a drink.
What is this shit right here?
'Cause that's already been opened.
Well shit, boys.
You were right.
She's too good to have a drink with us.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
What are we to you?
A bunch of dirt?
I didn't say that.
Fuckin' A, this bitch is a writer.
"No one wants a phone call at 2:00 in the morning.
When you're 15, it's a prank call.
When you're 21, it's a drunk boyfriend call.
But after 25, it's usually really bad news.
That's how I found out my father died. "
Whose daddy died?
Can't you all just please leave me alone?
Johnny: No!
Just tell me what you want.
What do you want?
I offered you my money.
Mm-hmm.
Whoa!
Here. Here.
Fine. I'll have a drink.
Then you have to leave.
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.
That ain't shit.
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.
Now see, I-
I know you can do better than that.
I'm sure that when you're out there in the city with all your hoity-toity rich friends,
I bet you can throw 'em back with the best of 'em.
Now can't you?
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.
All right, shit.
See, that's not so bad now, is it?
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.
But we're even now, right?
Okay?
Just please leave.
Please leave.
Well, that's just not what this is about no more.
What is it about?
I wanna see your teeth.
What?
You heard me, pretty little show horse.
I want to see your teeth.
That-
I don't want to- no.
Now you're gonna show them teeth.
You have beautiful teeth.
There.
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.
Let's see more.
Put your fingers on the inside of your mouth right there.
Now take the other two, stick 'em on the other side.
There you go.
Now pull.
Okay, please, I'm begging you, just go.
No.
Again.
Come here.
There it is.
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.
Shh!
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.
You know why I know you ain't got no boyfriend?
You know why?
'Cause all them city boys are faggots.
Fuckin' A.
Since you ain't got no boyfriend, well, shit, I figured that... this would be your man tonight.
Yeah.
No?
Come here.
Come on, give him a little kiss.
Give him a little kiss, come on.
Give him a little kiss here.
Give him a little kiss here. Kiss him.
Oh shit, come on now.
Come on now. I ain't talking about no fucking peck like you gave Matthew.
I want you to give him a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.
Get up on your knees.
If I don't like your enthusiasm,
I may come bad.
Open up.
Open up.
There it is. There it is.
There it is.
All right, all right.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.
Just like it's your first time again.
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
All right, all right.
Shit!
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.
I d-don't want to.
I don't.
What?
What the fuck did you say?
What the hell you mean you d-d-don't want to?
I don't want to, Johnny.
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.
Listen to me.
Fuck that, man.
I ain't fucking waiting.
Aw shit!
Matthew:
She-she likes me.
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?
Go ahead.
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.
Go prove it to me.
Uh-huh.
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!
Johnny:
Come on, boys!
Whoa there.
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.
I was assaulted.
He came into my cabin and he had a gun.
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.
It was in my mouth.
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.
I know this one.
She rented the place down on Mockingbird Trail.
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.
I'm a sheriff.
You're safe.
Now tell me what happened.
These four men- there were four men and they broke into my cabin.
And they had a gun and they assaulted me.
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?
Yes, I'd seen them.
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.
Sounds like them boys have been up to no good again.
All right, Earl, you head on back.
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on over to the cabin and straighten things out.
Miller!
Miller, this is the sheriff.
You and your boys are still here, you come on out right now.
Miller, if you're up there, you'll be leaving by the window.
Ma'am, stay here.
You here alone?
Yes.
With all this?
I didn't plan on drinking it all right away.
I was gonna be here for a couple months.
You drink some this evening?
Yes.
One of them went upstairs and he went through everything.
They do this too?
Please, I really don't care about any of that.
How long you been here?
Just a couple days.
Anything strange happen before this?
You have a run-in with any of these guys?
No, not really.
Just stopped for gas and directions.
Ma'am, is this your marijuana cigarette?
Um, no.
One of the boys must have left it.
You mean to tell me one of them guys is wearing lipstick?
This ain't the big city.
Please, I may have smoked a joint, but that doesn't mean that I made any of this up.
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?
What could you possibly need backup for? I'm the victim.
Ma'am, you've been drinking, smoking marijuana cigarettes.
You got enough booze in here to put the whole town three sheets to the wind.
You're running around in your sleeping garments at the crack of dawn.
You gotta see this from my point of view.
What? They came in here and they assaulted me.
You have to believe me.
Ma'am, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.
You're making serious accusations about boys I've known since they was kids.
And you haven't been altogether truthful now, have you?
Now please, step up against the wall.
Shoulder width apart.
Ma'am, please.
Look right ahead.
Now...
I want the whole story.
You tell me the whole thing.
You start by telling me what those boys did.
Tell the sheriff the truth, show horse.
Better yet, why don't you show him?
Show him how that pretty little mouth of yours couldn't get enough
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?
They do this?
Nice little tits.
I asked you a question.
Please.
Johnny: You show the sheriff your teeth there, show horse.
Come on.
- Come on, move.
- Andy: Get!
Move!
Now whinny.
I said whinny!
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!
Huh. Huh.
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.
Johnny:
Keep whinnying, show horse.
Stanley:
Here we go.
Get on your knees.
Keep whinnying!
Oh-ho-ho!
You oughta tame that little mare of yours.
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.
On your feet or you're not gonna get your sugar cube.
Matthew, get your clothes off, boy.
We're gonna get your cherry popped.
Huh-uh.
Matthew, I ain't asking you a question.
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.
You wanna talk the talk, you better walk the walk.
I'm walking.
- Jennifer: Stop, stop.
- Virgin.
Please stop.
You get your clothes off or I'm gonna slice her from the chin
- to cunt.
- Oh!
Oh yeah!
- Johnny: There's Matthew.
- Stanley: Now he gets it.
Johnny:
Pants off, boy.
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.
Well, it's not totally his fault.
She ain't done much to get his motor running now, has she?
Dance.
Dance.
Come on.
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!
Johnny: Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!
Prance for us now. Come on, like you do when you wanna get laid.
Whoo! Come on!
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.
You dance like that in them city clubs?
- Ho!
- Come on now!
You watching this, boy?
Johnny: What?
Okay, I'll- I'll- I'll-
I'll do it.
Okay? Okay.
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah!
Okay, here we go.
Get up, get up.
This is for you, Matthew.
This is for you, boy.
Oh yeah!
Oh shit!
Get her up here.
Shut her up.
No! No! No!
Hold her legs!
Oh my God.
I'll bash your fucking face in, bitch.
- Andy: Shut up.
- No no no!
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.
- God damn it.
- Okay.
- Johnny: Here. Here.
- Storch: Get her panties off.
- I'll rip 'em off.
- No!
Yeah, get her.
- Johnny: Damn it, hold her still.
- Come on, retard.
- No! No!
- Hold her down!
- Stick your pee-pee in her.
- Okay!
Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.
Johnny: Yeah!
Storch:
Get in there!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
- Jennifer: Oh no!
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.
Johnny: Feels good, don't it, Matthew, pumping away on her? Get her legs.
Storch: Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!
Deep. Get in deep.
Get in deep.
Deep deep deep deep!
- Deep!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew.
Get over here.
Hey, put that thing down and get over here.
- Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
- Shut your fucking mouth!
Storch:
Gag her!
Johnny: Shut her up!
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!
Keep her quiet now!
Hello, angel.
Daddy's on a call.
Girl:
Daddy, it's Sunday.
You always make breakfast before church.
I know, I know, sweetheart.
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.
Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
Yeah, Matthew!
He fill her up yet?
Johnny: Damn it. Oh shit!
You're the shit, Matthew.
You're getting your ass beat by a woman.
Johnny: Matthew, you better control that bitch.
Hold her down. Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, boy.
Over there.
Over there.
Ain't that romantic?
You clean that shit up.
Make her do it.
Andy:
You heard him. Clean it up.
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?
Stanley:
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.
You can thank me later.
Andy: You calm down, boy.
You did all right, Matthew.
Jennifer: No no.
Please.
No.
No no.
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?
Why don't you have a drink?
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.
All right, boys, that filly's got a few more races to run.
You like that, girl?
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.
You got some fight left in you, Miss Hills.
I like things rough.
Please. Please.
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.
Please.
I'm sore.
Don't worry now, sweetheart.
I'm an ass man.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Whoo!
Andy:
God damn, Stanley.
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.
That bitch was too tight.
Don't you know you're supposed to wait for the lady?
Stanley:
Shit, man, like she cares.
She's laying there like a dead fish.
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna be the pussy today, huh?
Johnny: Don't know what you're bragging about, Andy.
Clocked you just over two minutes.
Andy:
It's been a while, man.
I'm out of practice.
It's been, I don't know, maybe 10 years.
Where you going?
God damn, she's got some fight in her.
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Miss Hills.
Johnny: Shit!
Johnny:
Where is she?
Hell, she's gotta come up for air sometime.
Shit.
Stanley: Gators must have got her by now. Right, Sheriff?
Listen up.
Creek ends about six miles downstream in Watson.
Between here and there, we're gonna find her.
We split up.
We check the banks, in the timber, under rocks.
Hell, you see a hole big enough for her, I want you in there.
And do not stop till y'all find me a dead city whore.
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.
Now what?
Her body will show up one way or another.
Every day we're gonna check the ravine, from the bridge straight down through here and back.
Two shifts a day till we find something.
For how long?
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?
Yes sir.
You get her wheels down the shop.
Strip it down to its last goddamn nut.
That's gonna take two weeks.
All right, Sheriff, yeah.
I'll have Andy torch it out and I'll rub the numbers out.
Asshole!
The fuck you saving that for, you moron?
It's fucking evidence!
I shit you not!
I need you all on point for this.
And I mean goddamn fucking point.
We clear?
Now pony up.
We got shit to do.
Burn that effing tape.
Andy:
Well, that's all of it, right down to her little titty sling.
Man, this fire's making me hungry.
Well, there's a headline.
We gotta finish this shit.
We gotta get that car in the garage.
Then you can stuff your face till you puke.
Where the hell's Matthew at?
He ain't one to stay behind.
He was looking around the water like some crazed dog after a bone, man.
You keep an eye on him.
We gotta make sure he keeps it together, you hear me?
Just at least until this shit's over.
Gone all day,
I got nervous.
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.
The mess they got on Highway 1 took forever.
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?
Daddy.
Got anything on the stove?
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.
Proud of what?
I was accepted to the honors program, Daddy.
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.
I expect nothing less from my angel.
Mommy and I are proud of you.
I'm gonna shower up.
Every time I come in here this place gets worse.
Yeah, and business keeps getting better and better.
Mockingbird Trail.
Miss Hills.
She left?
She did indeed.
I couldn't make head nor tail of it.
I found empty cases of booze, marijuana cigarettes.
Crazy wild one.
She'd have made a preacher cuss.
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?
No refund policy.
Christmas come early.
Enjoy it.
Speaking of early, next month's quail season.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of shooting squirrels.
Me too.
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.
Did you just come here to see me?
Happy hour, boys.
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.
I just want all this bullshit to be over.
No!
Woman: He's the big black guy in the red drawstring.
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.
It's Earl.
- Earl.
- Yeah.
This woman leaves a message on the machine.
Barbara something or other.
Yeah, so?
She was asking about that Miss Hills.
Says no one's seen her in over a month.
Ain't that about the time she split?
Yeah.
Yeah, and you know the story.
I don't know.
I wasn't there.
I think you should call her back.
I mean, heck, Sheriff, you may have been the last one to see her.
Sheriff?
Okay, I'll call her.
Good.
You want the number?
No, it's late.
I'll get it from you in the AM.
We're still on for tomorrow, right?
Yeah, of course.
Everything all right?
Yeah, just fine.
It's gone!
Look at that.
Looks like someone spooked the cattle.
It's gone!
It's fucking gone!
Jesus, Stanley, calm the fuck down.
What's got your nuts in a sling?
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.
Maybe you accidentally ate it.
Fuck off, man, this is serious!
It had the tape in it.
What are you talking about?
The tape.
The fucking tape.
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.
I replaced it with a new one.
The Sheriff stomped on the one that had nothing on it.
You kept that tape, huh?
You kept that tape, you stupid piece of shit?
Come here.
You kept that tape?
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.
Come on.
Gotta stick together on this one.
You're too dumb to know how dumb you are.
You know that?
Uh-huh.
Is that right?
Is that right?
I better not find you, you little fucker.
All right.
All right, let's go.
Come on out, fucker.
Come on!
You think this shit's funny?
Andy?
Stanley?
Fucking pussies.
All right. All right.
That's it, God damn it.
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!
Come on out, fucker.
Oh shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Sweetheart.
They're beautiful.
I've been so busy.
No need to explain.
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.
I guess.
Maybe you can help me with something while I put these in water.
Help with what?
I got this tape delivered, but it don't fit our machine.
What tape?
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.
Chastity see this?
No. Like I said, we couldn't get it to play.
Where is she?
She's sleeping. Why?
I'm gonna be back.
Where the hell you been?
Beauty queen over here doing his hair for two hours.
What's this all about, man?
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?
Right there.
That's where I got that.
Somebody left me a present last night on my doorstep.
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.
No one knows where he's at.
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.
What?
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.
You wanna tell me why this was dropped off to my house?
To my wife!
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?
I smashed the damn thing myself!
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.
The one you smashed ain't got nothing on it.
You knew about this?
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.
Eat that tape, fat boy!
Fucking tape!
You think it's funny?
You screwed up, fat boy.
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.
I mean, dipshit there, he kept the tape as a souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it, Sheriff.
Look at this. Silly bastard left me a present last night.
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.
I think he even feels guilty.
You dipshits bring him to me.
I'm gonna cut his retard pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.
That's before I'm done shoving it up your dirt hole.
Shit, we've been looking for him, Sheriff.
Trust me, we've been everywhere looking for him.
I want him found tonight.
Or I swear to Christ,
I'll bring the wrath of God down on you.
Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail?
Goddamn things are like locusts now.
Much to our good fortune.
I gotta take a break.
My dogs are barking something fierce.
I remember when you and my old man chased that buck out from the hollows on Stickler Farm before bagging it.
Aww. Them were the good old days.
To the good old days.
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?
You just enjoy it.
This is some fine whiskey.
Usually you don't get something like this except at baptisms and weddings.
And funerals.
Loose ends, Earl.
Loose ends.
Jennifer: Matthew.
I'm over here.
Jennifer:
Matthew.
Matthew.
I- I knew- knew you were alive.
I knew it.
How did you know, Matthew?
Huh?
How did you know
I was alive?
Are you sure you're not dreaming?
Am I?
Am I dreaming?
Come here.
Sit with me.
I need to tell you-
Shh!
I know, Matthew.
I know this wasn't your fault.
You tried to help me.
I did.
I really really did.
And- and- and you're okay.
You're- you're okay.
Yes, Matthew.
Now come.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.
I'm so sorry.
Oh God!
I'm so sorry.
Matthew.
- Matthew.
- Yeah.
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.
Tell me again how sorry you are.
I'm- I'm- I'm sorry.
It's just not good enough!
Stanley:
Matthew!
Matthew!
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
Matthew!
Come on out, Matthew.
Matthew!
Matthew?
You're only making it harder on yourself, Matt.
Boo!
Stupid fuck, what the hell's wrong with you?
Whoo!
Fucker's playing your song.
Andy:
Your ass is grass, Matthew.
Stanley:
Matthew, you're a dead man.
Whoo!
- Come on, man.
- I'm gonna kill him.
Don't you pass out on me.
I'm too tired to drag your ass back.
What the hell?
Matthew?
Stanley:
Matthew!
God damn it, Matthew, where are you?
Where are you, you little fucker?
Andy, he ain't out here.
You little bitch.
Andy! Andy!
Andy, help me!
What the fuck, man?
- My leg!
- Ahem.
Andy!
Stanley!
Stanley, help me!
Matthew?
Help me!
Please!
Somebody!
Andy:
Stanley!
Come on, Stanley.
Matthew, this shit ain't funny, boy.
Somebody help me!
Jennifer: Smile real pretty for the camera, boy.
Andy: Please!
I know you like to watch, don't you?
Don't you, you sick fuck?
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
- Here you go.
- Stanley!
You remember this?
Stanley, help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Can't talk, can you?
Maybe it's because you're hungry.
You know, you gotta eat a lot of nasty shit out here to stay alive.
Are you hungry?
You hungry?
What's wrong?
You don't like it?
What are you doing?
Some fishing.
I know how you guys like to fish.
Don't blink.
Andy:
You okay, Stan?
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Please!
Please is what I said to you.
You said...
"Suck it, bitch. "
Does that ring any bells?
Suck... it... bitch!
Be right back.
Wait, come back.
Come back here.
Come back here.
Andy: Stanley!
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you bitch.
Hi.
You like the show so far?
Andy:
Let me out of here!
Wait.
It gets better.
Please, my eyes.
I can't take it anymore.
Oh, let me help you.
Let me out!
Stanley!
Please.
Please.
Please. Please.
That might feel better.
Andy:
Help!
Huh-uh-uh, now don't drown too soon.
Fuck you.
Now is that any way to talk to a lady?
I'm impressed.
You got a lot of fight in you.
Let's see how you do now.
What's that?
It's just some lye
I found laying around.
No!
Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours.
Fuck you!
You already did that.
I didn't enjoy it much.
Now it's my turn to fuck you.
- Please. Please.
- Oh.
Please.
Pain in the ass.
Good morning.
Whoo.
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?
It's date night.
Your mouth doesn't look so good.
Maybe you should show me your teeth.
I'll kill you.
Ornery stallion.
Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.
I'm gonna have to take care of that.
Huh? Huh?
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races left to run, show horse.
That is disgusting.
Even your boys didn't piss themselves.
Look who's here.
It's my boyfriend.
Remember him?
Why don't you give him a little kiss?
Hmm? Hmm?
Let's go, come on.
I don't take orders from no fucking woman.
No?
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.
Just like it was your first time, remember?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Let me tell you something:
You know, you weren't even a good blowjob.
No.
You know what they do to horses that can't be tamed, Johnny?
You geld them.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Bitch!
Hey, sweetheart.
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: Mrs. Novick?
No, from the honors program.
- Do you remember anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- I'm real busy, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.
Hello, angel.
Daddy's real busy working.
But I really want you to meet my new teacher.
She's way cool.
Here. Just say hi.
Howdy, Sheriff.
It's truly an honor to speak with you, Miss...
Hills, Jennifer Hills.
Excuse me?
I have to tell you it's been a pleasure meeting your family.
You have a wonderful daughter with a bright and promising future.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.
No, wait!
Shit!
Chastity, where is she?
She went to Hanson Park with Miss Hills.
She wanted to get to know her students in the program before the year st-
God damn it!
Who is she?
Who is this woman?
Chastity!
Chastity!
Where are you, angel?
Chastity!
Oh no! No!
Please!
No.
Help me, Jesus.
Does that hurt, Sheriff?
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.
Where is she, you bitch?
I'd be real careful how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.
What have you done to her?
By her, I assume you mean your daughter?
She really is lovely, Sheriff.
So young.
So sweet.
So innocent.
I mean, can you imagine?
Imagine what?
Imagine that somebody had done something like this to her.
Someone like Andy.
Or Stanley or Johnny.
Or more likely you, you sick, perverted rapist!
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!
Deep! Deep!
Deep! Deep! Deep!
Jesus fucking Jesus.
Please.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
She's just an innocent girl.
So was I.
What are you doing? What?
Matthew.
You won't get a- fucking-way with this.
You won't get away with this!
He'll be waking up soon.
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm a God-fearing person.
I got-
I've got a baby coming, please.
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.
Sorry, Sheriff.
It was fun while it lasted.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.
I'm begging you to help me.
Please help me.
I've got a wife and family.
Ma'am, please!
You fuck!
You fuck!
You fuck!
Where are you going, you fuck?
I'll see you in hell!
I'll rape you in hell!
You're just a piece of meat.
I'll find you.
I'll hunt you down in hell, you bitch!
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.
Matthew!
WHEN WE LEAVE
Are you ready?
Mommy!
Does it hurt?
I'm fine.
Mommy where were you?
Thank you.
Enjoy your meal.
So, how is Melek?
Much better.
Now eat properly, son.
Melek will get better, God willing.
I'm sure she was happy to see you.
We didn't go to Aunt Melek's.
Be quiet and eat.
We waited really long for Mommy.
I told you to eat!
Open your mouth.
Are you deaf?
Stop it, Kemal!
Eat your food!
Come back here!
Don't, Kemal!
What are you doing?
Leave him alone!
Get out of my way!
Don't hurt him!
Get in there!
Zeynep, come on! We're late.
Umay!
My child...
Mom!
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?
Cem!
Look how tall you've grown!
- Hello!
Hello, my darling!
You're so big.
Come in! Come!
Where's Kemal?
So what do we do now?
I missed you so much.
It's so nice to have you here.
Father!
Welcome.
Let me take that.
Let me kiss your hand, Father.
Umay! What a surprise!
Cem, come here.
Hurry up!
Where's Kemal?
In Istanbul.
Have a seat.
Come.
Ifyou'd let us know, we would have picked you up.
You're so much bigger than you were in the pictures.
Show me your hands.
My Lord! Look at that...
They're so big.
When's Kemal coming?
In a few days, for sure.
He's got a lot ofwork.
Are you ticklish?
Catch me, Grandpa!
- You bet I'll catch you.
Stop that!
Your father has high blood pressure.
He shouldn't get too excited.
How's the café doing?
Good. Kemal fixed it up.
Why don't you open another one?
You could even open one here.
That would be nice.
He's not coming.
He's not coming?
What's that supposed to mean?
Umay!
What are you doing here?
Sit down.
Sit down!
What took you so long?
I was doing stuff.
When did you get here?
She's not staying long.
Mind your own business.
Did you say something?
You heard me.
What did you say?
Are you deaf or something?
- What did you say?
Are you deaf?
Sit down!
Finish your meal!
He didn't meant it like that.
It's exactly what he meant.
Mehmet says you'll make Cem a bastard ifyou take him away from Kemal.
You've grown up.
He looks like you.
I was a lot fatter.
She was homesick...
I know... I know...
But you know how young women can be.
It's only for a few days.
She's very sad.
She doesn't want to upset you.
Please, tell Kemal.
Alright.
God bless you.
Where's Cem?
Don't get upset, my child.
Your father took him to Friday prayers.
Why didn't you wake me?
I wanted to let you sleep in.
Eat something, my child.
You're so skinny.
Remember, how you fought your brother for this seat?
Now you're back in your favorite chair.
If only you talked to Kemal...
We just don't get along.
It will never work.
Things aren't always exactly how we'd like them to be, my child.
No matter what, you cannot separate your son from his father.
I'm miserable, Mom.
Is that what you want?
I can't do it anymore.
I'm exhausted.
You told me you'd be here for me, no matter what.
Let's make a ball.
Going out?
Yes, Mother.
I'll be back at five.
I've got to go.
I'll be back in three hours.
You can't do that.
- Wait for me.
Hey, wait!
No!
Holy Shit! I don't believe it!
Do you wish you'd have kept the baby?
He'll never change.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
A lot.
Is this how a man behaves?
I'm sorry. We were in the park.
I lost track oftime.
Act like a man! Understood?
- Yes.
A real man acts like one!
Yes.
So?
What?
You're in love!
He's got such beautiful hands.
Beautiful hands?
Look.
We're getting married.
You're too young, Rana.
Look at me.
Please...
Leave me alone.
I know what I'm doing.
I love him, Umay.
Will you be with me at my wedding?
Of course.
It's been a week.
What are you going to do?
Have you made a decision?
I'm staying here.
Find work, go to school.
It's notjust about you, you know.
You have a son.
And what about us?
Everyone's talking about us.
You want too much.
Better than too little.
You're a twenty-five year old mother.
You're too old!
Stop dreaming!
I gave up a lot for you kids too.
Do you want me to end up like you?
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Ifyou worked here, where would your child stay?
It's taken care of.
Really?
Yes, my family will help me.
Ok. You've got the job.
Thank you.
Do you watch this at home, too?
I am home, Father.
Umay, my child, we love you.
You're our oldest daughter.
But you belong to Kemal.
You are a married woman.
He beats me.
He's your husband.
The hand that strikes is also the hand that soothes.
A slap or two is no reason to run.
I'm not going back.
I'm going to live here.
How do you intend to do that?
You are not alone.
Did we raise you to bring shame upon us?
You will return to Kemal.
You always praised Uncle Bekir for choosing his own path in life.
I still do.
But you don't compare to him.
Why not?
Father, why not?
Because that's the way it is!
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?
Get a hold ofyourself!
I'm not going anywhere!
- Then do as you please!
What are you going to do?
What will you tell Kemal?
He should come and get her.
She is his wife.
I wish she'd been born a boy!
Was that good?
Kemal, I didn't say you were wrong.
Calm down. What?
I understand. May God be with you.
Whore!
Kemal's not coming.
He doesn't want you back.
He called you a German whore.
Do you realize what you've done to us?
How are we supposed to look people in the eye?
We have to take Cem back.
He wants his son.
Cem is staying here.
You heard me.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Answer my father!
Stay out ofthis.
Look at him!
- Silence!
Are you alright?
Get up.
Leave me alone!
He's his son! He has a right to him.
You leave him no choice.
It's best for Cem.
Cem isn't going anywhere.
He belongs with me.
Umay, you're losing it.
Get a hold ofyourself!
Get out of my way!
Put down the knife!
Let me pass!
Over my dead body!
You stupid girl!
May God protect you from the evil eye.
How did Kemal meet him?
They became friends back in the army.
Kemal trusts him.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
Don't worry, father.
It'll work out fine.
I'll leave with Cem tomorrow morning.
It'll be alright.
What's going on?
Good evening.
Is Umay Aslan here?
What do you want from her?
- May we come in?
We received an emergency call.
- Not from us.
Please stay.
Are you Umay Aslan?
- Yes.
Do you even have a warrant?
We don't need one.
Calm down.
What is going on?
What do you want from us?
What is this all about?
May God curse your soul!
You shouldn't have done this, Umay!
Beat it! You too!
I'll be next door.
Knock ifyou need me.
Thank you.
Good night, Cem.
Good night.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Father?
Leave me alone. Go away.
Sign here please.
And here.
Okay. I'll take care ofthe rest.
- Thank you.
That's what we're here for.
Any more questions?
Avoid all contact with your family, for now.
And no meetings within the secure area, ok?
Yes.
You can play with the other kids here.
Isn't that great?
No.
Where are you going?
To work.
Why?
So you and I will have some money.
Can't you stay here?
Come here.
I have an idea.
You're a very strong boy now.
Don't be afraid of anything, ok?
I'm always with you!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
That's it.
Relax your grip, nice and easy...
That's not bad at all.
Nice and easy...
That's it.
A quick flip, front to back. Right?
Good! Atife took longer than that.
Nothing I do is ever good enough for her!
Yes, it is.
But give her an inch and she takes a mile. Now back to work!
So, what's the answer?
Acar!
You coming or not?
I'll catch up with you.
Could you give this to mom?
Please.
Come back. I'll help you.
What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I just...
Get out of my way.
What is this?
- Nothing.
Where did you get this?
She gave it to me.
- Where is she?
She just stood there.
- What do you mean?
You won't see her again, you hear me?
I can see her if I want to!
No, you can't.
Acar, where is she?
I have no idea.
She didn't say. I don't know, man!
Am I doing something wrong?
No, you're doing everything right.
Hi. My name is Stipe.
Umay.
Nice name.
See you later.
Sit down.
They've broken offthe engagement.
All because of Umay, right?
She's ruining my life!
I'm not like her. I love Duran.
My child, calm down.
Duran's father will change his mind.
Wait and see. There's no hurry.
You're both still young.
Mother, you don't understand.
I can't wait!
Mother, I'm pregnant.
We're ruined.
I invited Nimet over last week.
She said they'd be out oftown.
But they went to someone else's place.
She lied to me.
What is she doing right now?
Who knows where they sleep, or what they eat.
The poor child is all alone.
Without a family, without a father.
She has ruined everything.
Everything.
The family,
Cem, our honor, me.
Why can't she at least live with us?
She causes us nothing but pain.
Kader, you must do something about Duran and Rana.
Speak with his father.
Convince him. Please.
They must get married!
Mommy...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Mommy?
Yes?
Are you going away?
No, I'll never leave you.
You left Daddy because he was angry with me.
No. We didn't leave because ofyou.
Your father loves you just the way you are.
Is he coming to see us?
Shall we walk for a bit?
Are you well?
I'm fine.
Rana's wedding is off.
Duran's father doesn't know that they have to get married.
Come home! For your sister's sake.
He says our family is without honor.
It's too late for that now.
I would only bring more shame upon you.
But Cem needs you.
And I would like to see you, too.
Then do something about it!
I don't know what.
Umay, please!
I don't want to! It's enough!
You can't treat us this way.
If so we'll never see each other again.
Mom!
Ok?
Ok.
Hi, Mete. How are you?
Who's that?
Acar. His sister was the one who called the cops.
That slut Haldun was talking about?
What did your friend just say?
Nothing, just talking about chicks.
What's the problem, boy?
You got a problem or something?
- No. - Sure!
What are you going to do now?
You should at least try to call again.
Hey man, hang on. Come here.
What?
Are you sure?
It's up there.
Hey, what's up? Are you coming or not?
- Leave me alone.
I'm gonna throw up.
- Not in my car!
I'm not coming.
- Why not? Afraid, or what?
I'm not afraid. Why should I be?
- I don't know.
Are you afraid?
- I'm not afraid!
I'm talking to you! Are you afraid?
Get out ofthere! Come down!
A house full ofwomen!
Like I said, she's a whore!
Shut the hell up!
Let's get out of here!
I know you're in there!
Stop. That's enough!
Go to hell!
Mommy?
Brother, stop!
Please stop!
Don't worry, my love. I'm here with you.
Brother, stop it! Please!
Take him, please.
Is this supposed to prove you're a man?
You don't scare me!
You whore!
Get lost!
Get away from the window!
Who is it?
I don't know.
Mommy?
Yes?
Why did you leave your T-shirt at Carmen's?
When you leave, it's important to leave something behind.
I'm sorry to put you through this.
Don't be.
I'm not afraid.
You need to press charges against Mehmet.
Don't you get it?
It's my family.
Can't you understand that?
You have your own family.
That's your child over there.
Come here.
Hey...
You can stay here for a while, really.
Thank you.
One, two... and three!
One, two, three!
I got it!
It crashed right into my butt, didn't it?
Was that you, by any chance?
- No.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'd love to.
I'm so sorry. I totally forgot.
No problem. I'm still here.
Yes.
Are you still hungry?
And what do they want for you?
Nice things.
The kind of life you aspire to when you live in Oldenburg, where everybody's always happy.
And you? What do you want?
Let's see what happens.
You want to tell me about your brothers?
For the Sugar Festival,
Mehmet always made sure that I looked pretty.
He'd comb my hair, carefully, very gently.
He used to give me all his candy.
Are you tired?
What was it you wanted to show me?
This.
This moment.
Let go of me!
- You're ruining everything!
I only want to see her for a moment.
I want Cem to be at his aunt's wedding.
Ifyou want to make Rana happy just leave!
It's enough.
It's my family too. Who are you to give me orders!
Did it ever occur to you that she might not want you here?
Did you forget who raised you?
Who changed your shitty diapers?
Who dried your tears when you sobbed?
Let me in, you asshole!
Why can't we see Rana?
Come on.
I have a son.
His name is Cem.
He's a good boy.
But, because he's my son, he's not wanted here.
As a woman I decided to live alone.
I have tainted your honor.
I have destroyed my family's dignity.
And now my son is without a family, too.
Baba, you used to say blood is thicker than water.
That we are only strong together.
Father!
Don't desert us...please!
I never want to see you again.
Never.
Do you want to draw something?
No.
Are you hungry?
No.
Do you want to play a game?
No.
I want to see my grandma.
So what are you going to do about it?
I'm not leaving again.
Well, what do you think is gonna happen?
This is about something else,
Umay, you know that.
Maybe your parents will forgive you.
But ifthey have to decide, ifthey have to choose between you and the community, they'll never choose you.
Yes they will.
Some day.
Thank you very much.
I thank you for hearing me.
I would like to inform you ofyour daughter's condition.
She's not well.
Gül... Gül Hanim was your name?
We appreciate your concern, and thank you for your efforts.
But you see,
Umay does not want any contact with us.
Kader, that is not true.
You know that.
Umay misses you. Very much, in fact.
But she fears you.
We are her family.
She has no reason to be afraid.
Look.
You are the head ofthe family.
Your sons listen to you.
You are their role model.
You should care for all your children.
Also your son.
You don't want to lose him too, do you?
Gül Hanim, please!
I beg ofyou!
Please.
Good evening.
- May God protect you.
You leave God out of it.
He has nothing to do with this.
This is the kitchen.
Nice.
This is Cem's room.
Aren't you hungry?
No?
I'll show you something.
Mom?
Mom, is that you?
Mom, say something, please.
Mom...
Here comes another one!
Oh, sorry.
Bullseye!
Happy Ramadan, Father.
I brought you baklava.
Father, I wanted...
Because of Rana's wedding...
Please forgive me.
You're my family.
You are my failure as a father, Umay.
You're breaking my heart.
Who was it?
The neighbors' kids.
They wanted sweets.
What are you doing?
Get out, Cem!
Wait!
He's my son!
What kind of mother kidnaps her own son?
What kind offather are you?
- What did I do wrong?
Get out, Cem.
- Don't drive us apart!
Don't ruin our lives!
Stop it, Kemal.
That's enough! Let him go.
That's no way to do this!
That's enough!
I'll get him!
How would your parents feel about you getting married again?
Would they give you some peace?
It wouldn't change a thing.
Once a whore, always a whore.
But thank you for asking.
I'm leaving.
Cem is all I have.
What if I came with you?
And the fairy said to him:
You see? I told you.
You're flying!
She holds him tight and her wings carry him.
And no one can see them except for him and the fairy.
Why do we have to leave?
Sometimes you have to leave people so you can find them again.
Like Ömer?
Will we find him again?
We always find the ones we love anew.
But when we go, we have to leave something behind.
We do.
I never meant to hurt you.
I'll finish school soon, go to university.
I've met someone I love.
Perhaps we will marry.
You can be proud of me.
I love you.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, my child.
Go now.
Go.
Let's go, Cem.
Mommy?
Is grandpa sick?
Yes. Grandpa is sick.
Can I walk with you for a bit?
Of course.
He'll get better.
Yes.
I'll be honest, Ferb.
I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this.
But I guess that's life, huh?
One minute, you're having the best day ever, the next, you're being fed to a monster the size of a two-car garage.
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life.
And everything started out so well this morning.
Good morning, Perry.
Now that's the way to wake up.
This is gonna be the best day ever.
We consider every day a plus
To spend it with a platypus
We're always so ecstatic
'Cause he's semi-aquatic
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus
Brings smiles to the both of us
Life's never fuddy-duddy
With our web-footed buddy
When we're brushing our teeth
It's better
Tying our shoes
It's better
Combing our hair
It's better
Like we're a cheese sandwich
And he's the cheddar
Blinking our eyes
It's better
Breathing in and out
So much better
Sitting in a chair
It's better
And taking a bath
Just a little bit wetter
Every day is such a dream
When it's started with a monotreme
He's duck-billed and he's beaver-tailed and hairy
You know that he's hairy
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
It's better
And we just want to tell you, Perry
Everything's better with you
Better with you
Good morning, boys.
Happy anniversary, Perry.
Oh, that's right! Gosh.
I can't believe it's been five years.
I remember the day we first got you.
Come on, kids.
Pick out any pet you want.
Look, Phineas, this one's looking at you!
And this one's looking at you, Ferb.
Why won't anything look at me?
Ferb! This one's looking at both of us at the same time.
That thing? You're kidding, right?
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes. We'd like that one, please.
You'd like to adopt a platypus?
Is that what it is? Well, yes.
- May we have him, please?
- Okay.
What would you even name a platypus?
Of course, Ferb and I knew exactly what to call you.
- Bartholemew!
- Bartholemew!
And then when we got you home, we renamed you Perry and gave you this locket.
Look how young we all were.
Hey, Jeremy.
You wanna go to the mall?
You know, I'd love to, but my dad's taking me to check out his old college today.
Booyah! Go Polecats! Booyah!
He's already set up an interview with an academic advisor.
Can you believe that?
Gee, Jeremy, I forgot you're a whole year older than me.
A trip to college?
That's... That's really great.
Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Jeremy! In the blink of an eye, you'll be moving on to the next phase of your life.
You'll be going to college
and wearing tweed jackets with patches on the elbows.
You'll be so mature.
And look at me. I'm a child!
Jeremy, you'll see. I can mature.
Starting with taking this silly photo off.
Mr Miggins!
Have you been there the whole time?
All right, looks like the pitcher's ready.
And batter up!
Batter, batter, batter, swing!
Yes, sports fans, that may be the best hit ever in the history of platypult baseball.
And the crowd exhales loudly through their mouths.
And Fletcher snags the pop fly.
He's out!
Hi, Phineas! What you doing?
Turning Perry's involuntary reflex into a sporting event.
Hi, Perry, can I try?
Whoa, momma! Nice shot, Isabella.
Did someone lose a ball?
Yeah, we were just playing platypult.
I love platypus-themed sports.
You know, if we had two Perrys, we could put a net between them
- and play platypult badminton.
- Who's Annette?
Ferb, that's it!
I know what we're gonna do today.
No, seriously. Who's Annette?
Okay, everyone, I think the tail is all set.
I'll just go check with the foreman.
- He's gone!
- Hey, where's Perry?
Did he really slip away?
On his anniversary?
Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed every single cool thing we've done all summer long.
I guess he can do whatever he wants.
After all, it's his day, right?
Hey, what was that small noise?
Let's all go walk over to it.
Good morning, Agent P. A quick word.
Recently you've been having some close calls
and your host family has almost caught you
sneaking into your lair several times.
No need to remind you, but I'll do it anyway,
that if your cover's blown,
you'll have to be transferred to another city with another host family.
And we both know you wouldn't like that.
I remember the day you were first assigned.
Enjoy your platypus!
Thank you, cheerio!
Agent assignment complete, sir.
Good job, Karl.
If you keep up the great work, you'll make unpaid intern in no time.
- And I did.
- Don't get cocky, Karl.
Agent P, as you know,
every operative is equipped with an autoscan replication device
just like the one in your hat.
We've been using the information you've gathered
to replicate each and every one of
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Inators.
Our top men have been analysing them to determine
if they've been getting smarter or dumber.
And to be honest, the jury's still out.
Now we find out that he's in the process of building
an alternate-dimension-related Inator.
Your assignment is to stop him before he finishes building it.
Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor,
is Karl, with some high-tech gadgets that you might find useful.
Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time.
Would you mind lowering the platform again?
Great. Let me cue the music again.
Well, obviously, this first item is our new wrist communicationizer.
It has many applications that will help you in the field.
For example, a powerful directional electromagnet.
It will draw any metal object to you.
See? And these are aluminium!
Quit goofing around, Karl, and show him the hologram.
Yes, sir.
Pretty nifty, huh?
With this device you'll be able to contact me from anywhere at any time.
But don't call between 3:30 and 4:00 because that's when I take a shower.
Wait a minute. Is that me?
No!
His holographic projection has become mesmerized by his video image.
I better shut it off.
And if you push this button, it gives your adversary an incredible ice cream headache.
It's gone.
You better watch where you point that!
Hey, girl! What are you doing?
Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon, and here I am, concerned with busting my brothers to my mommy and living in this nursery.
A unicorn! A unicorn, Stacy!
"Hi, I'm six!"
You've gotta help me get rid of all this junk.
Wow! Bold move!
Yep. Goodbye, childhood folly, hello, carefree undemanding adult life.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Candace, your father and I are off to the movies.
While we're gone, you're in charge, okay?
Okay, Mom!
And you know, I'm even thinking about giving up on busting my brothers.
The irony is, that as a grown-up, you don't need to tell your mom.
You can just bust them yourself.
That's it! Stacy,
I'm old enough to bust them myself!
That's what I just said.
Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror as I punch a hole through to another dimension.
- Behold, the Other-Dimensionator...
- Sir!
What? What?
I finished setting up the buffet.
For crying out loud, Norm.
I was in the zone!
I just thought you were playing with your doll.
It's not a doll, it's a stand-in!
Pretendy the Practicepus, see?
I wonder if Perry the Platypus practises with a fake me.
It would be nice to know he cares enough.
All systems are green.
Prepare to launch on my mark.
T minus 30 and counting.
Of course, you'll only need this if you're attacked by one of the royals or a member of Parliament.
So it's probably okay to leave the safety on.
And here's your brand new rocket car.
Sweet, huh? Good luck, Agent P.
Karl? Did you tell him the accelerator's a little touchy?
I think he knows, sir.
Three, two, one.
Service!
Phineas and Ferb, you are so busted...
Oh, my gosh! Where'd it go?
You there, small children!
Where's the big contraption?
I don't know.
It was here just a moment ago.
It disappeared?
- Stacy, do you realise what this means?
- We're done?
No, some kind of mysterious force always takes away Phineas and Ferb's inventions before Mom shows up.
This time it took away their invention before I showed up!
The mysterious force recognises that I'm now a grown-up.
A mysterious force? I'm not buying it.
I am a woman of science, at least that's what my horoscope said.
Well, I'm going to prove it to you and bust my brothers at the same time!
Where are my brothers?
We just launched them towards the park.
Buford is there with the other platypult.
Okay, as the adult,
I decree we are going to the park.
Does anyone need to go potty first?
Fine, make it quick.
Ferb, it looks like we're gonna hit that building that looks vaguely like your head.
Time to give it a little test.
Well, I just finished it.
It can't be broken already.
I stand corrected.
All right, what's with the giant shuttlecock?
We're really sorry, sir.
I don't know what happened.
One minute, we were innocently launching ourselves across the city in a badminton platypult.
The next thing we know, we're bouncing on up to the eastside to your deluxe apartment in the sky.
Well, it looks like you've totalled my Other-Dimensionator.
An Other-Dimensionator?
What does it do?
Well, at the moment, it just stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently.
But it's supposed to let me go into other dimensions.
That's cool! We can help you fix it.
I'm Phineas, and this is my brother Ferb.
I'm Dr Heinz Doofenshmirtz, but my friends call me...
I just got in such a funk.
Ferb is naturally handy with tools.
I bet we could put this thing back together in no time.
What the heck. Before we start, there's a whole buffet set up here, please partake.
I was expecting someone who seems to be running late.
You're lucky I got a rocket car winch.
Lots of guys don't have that.
Almost there.
Okay, field compressor attaches to the auxiliary generator.
Was this working before?
Well, if by "working" you mean
"functioning properly," then no.
Well, I think I see your problem.
Everything's wired through this self-destruct button.
Do you even need that?
Well, of course I...
Wait a minute. No, I do not need that.
You are absolutely right.
So Ferb has rigged up this remote control so that if we get separated from the portal, we can open another one.
- Nice touch, kid.
- I guess this is the last piece.
Okay, Ferb, boost me up.
I cannot wait!
- There you are, Perry.
- Perry?
Yeah. He's our pet platypus.
Is every platypus named Perry?
In a perfect world, yes.
Well, he's a cute little fellow. Hi, there.
Coochee, coochee...
Perry, no! We do not bite the elderly.
Again, ow! It's okay.
Platypuses don't typically like me.
Well, Perry, you're just in time to see us open a window into another dimension.
Perry, no! What are you doing? No, no!
Perry, this is not tug of war!
This is not tug of war!
Silly boy, what's gotten into him?
All right, let's get this show on the road, huh?
Remember, if your cover is blown, you'll never see the boys again.
Hey, does anyone hear someone talking?
Never see them again.
Okay, here we go. Right in...
Perry! No! Not on the sofa!
I'm sorry, Dr D. We should take him out.
No, no. Wait. It'll be all right.
I was planning on replacing this old couch anyway.
Now come on. Let's light this pop stand, or however it goes.
Gosh, this is...
It's kind of weird, actually.
I'm usually thwarted by this point.
Well, I guess he's not coming.
And now, behold!
The mind-blowing first images from beyond our dimensional reality!
It's a... It's a couch.
That's a bit anticlimactic.
I guess it's a nice couch, though...
Hey! I got an idea!
Let's swap my couch for that one!
I got it. I got... Or maybe I...
Come on, you want to give me a hand here?
Awesome, check it out.
Hello.
- Say, aren't you...
- Hey, Dr D! Look at this.
Hold that thought.
You're famous here.
Get off!
"Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your leader"?
A whole tri-state area where I am already in charge!
Yeah! Hold on,
I gotta go check something out.
Hello, again.
Is this some kind of test?
Is that really you, sir?
Holy boy!
Even the great Francis Monogram's my slave in this dimension!
I prefer the term
"indentured executive assistant".
Well, I want to meet this other dimension me.
Where can I find him?
You're from another dimension?
Well, he'll probably wanna see you then.
He's into that freaky sort of stuff.
Have a seat and I'll let him know you're on your way up.
Okay. So I just gotta sit here and...
He's Doof Doof Doof
Doof Doof Doof Doof
Bask in his glory
Kneel at his feet
You're in for such a treat
He's Doofenshmirtz
That was awesome!
All right, who's interrupting my...
Do I know you?
Yeah! I'm you from another dimension!
Well, that would explain the handsomeness.
Right back at you, big guy.
Does that mean you and I are exactly alike?
I suppose so.
Do you want some rice pudding?
Ick, no, that's gross
It was a test. Almond brittle?
- Oh, I love it the most
- Me, too
Do you collect coins?
Yeah, just in case
Vending machines become the dominant race
I've been alone all these years
With my irrational fears
But not the vending machine thing.
That's gonna happen.
But now before me, I see
Someone with whom I agree
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I thought I'd be taller
I've been told I slouch
I thought I'd have both my eyes
You know
It's in this pouch
You know, I can't help but notice that your scar goes over your eye patch.
Yeah?
Nothing.
Do llamas weird you out?
Yeah, are they camels or sheep?
No, no, I meant Lorenzo
That's right
He played Meap
Now I know all about you
And you know all about me
And now before me I see
Someone with whom I agree
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
Now that I found you
We can be a duo
That's right
Twice the evil
Double Doofenshmirtz
Coming at you Fridays
What's that? I mean, are we doing a TV show together?
No. It just sort of sounded like...
I mean, we could. We should!
Maybe we're not so much alike.
That can be our catch phrase.
You're the grumpy one.
Wow, he's done really well for himself.
What do you think, Perry?
Hey, where is Dr D?
So what you're telling me is you're still not ruler of your tri-state area?
Well, obviously you did not have to deal with my nemesis, Perry the Platypus.
Didn't I? Observe.
What is it?
This is Perry the Platyborg!
He was once my nemesis, but now, he's general of my army!
Wow! You are good!
Dismissed.
That was awesome!
Now who's interrupting me?
Remind me to berate my indentured executive assistant.
No, man, it's cool. They're with me.
Hey, Dr D. We thought we'd lost you.
Hi, fellas!
You dare to bring a secret agent in here?
This boy's a secret agent?
- No, not him!
- The quiet one?
No! Not... No. Him!
This plant?
The platypus!
That's Secret Agent Perry the Platypus!
Hey. He's just a platypus.
He doesn't do much.
This is rich. I see what's going on here.
You really think that he's your pet, don't you?
Wrong! He's using you!
You're just his cover.
He's a secret agent!
Here, here, let me prove it.
General Platyborg, come down here at once.
He'll be here in just a second.
All right, Platyborg, you see that platypus?
You know what to do.
Perry!
What was that for? Perry, are you okay?
Told you.
How are his vitals?
Wait, let me try something. Platyborg!
- Do the same thing to those two boys.
- What?
What?
Perry
Perry?
Yes! I knew it!
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Why does their platypus fight so good?
Perry the Platypus!
Really?
What?
Perry?
Get them!
You're a secret agent?
Hey, be careful with that.
So this is where you disappear to every day?
You come here and fight this guy?
No, he fights me.
He doesn't really know this guy.
You fight a pharmacist?
Why would you even do that?
Actually, I'm an evil scientist.
A lot of people are confused by the lab coat.
You're evil? He's evil?
So, not only have you been leading a double life this whole time, but you sat there and let us help an evil scientist open an evil portal into an evil dimension!
And you did nothing to stop us?
Well, he did pee on the couch.
Wait a second, I just realised.
That was a conscious choice.
You peed on my couch!
No, no. That wasn't enough.
That's when you should have put on your little hat.
Not now, after we've gone through it into this mess!
For badness sake, you can hash all this out in prison.
Guards!
Brain freeze!
I'm sorry. I'm just having trouble processing this right now.
"So you've discovered your pet is a secret agent".
I don't want your pamphlet!
He's coming back around!
You have got to be kidding me.
For crying out loud.
What, they didn't teach you how to get out of this in spy school?
Snap.
Look! There's a logo on this parachute!
He's got his own logo?
All this time we're like,
"He's a platypus. He doesn't do much".
Well, apparently you do!
You do... You're...
You're tangled up in the...
Wow! Saved by unconventional architecture.
May I please see your papers?
Show me your papers or be destroyed.
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
Jinx! You owe me a soda.
Get me!
I'm a Georgia O'Keeffe painting!
Fourth and Main.
What? No tip?
Never mind. I'm good.
Looks like they're gone.
You're a secret agent?
And you've been living with us this whole time?
Was that evil guy right?
Were we just a cover story to you?
I mean, were you ever really our pet or part of our family?
Well, apparently not, 'cause you didn't trust us enough to tell us.
Anyone else around here leading a bizarre double life?
Put your hand down, Ferb.
You're a secret agent!
He's a secret agent!
You're right, Ferb. We've got to concentrate on the task at hand.
We've got to get back to our dimension, and I don't even know where to start!
That's right! The remote!
I knew that would come in handy.
All right, let's go home.
Wait, that's not our dimension.
Nope.
Now this thing's broken.
We're gonna need some help.
I know! Let's go find us!
Wait, I just realised, you could have been cleaning your own litter box this whole time!
We are not done with this conversation.
So tell me, other dimension me, what do you see here?
An ordinary platypus.
And now what do you see?
Perry the Platypus!
You know, I'm starting to see why you haven't become ruler in your dimension.
All right, Mr Eviler-Than-Thou, just how did you manage to take over the tri-state area anyway?
Simple, I used an army of big, scary robots.
We should do lunch sometime.
Wow, that is scary.
I tried that robot thing once, too.
I hid the self-destruct button on the bottoms of their feet
so no one could reach them.
And march!
I think I've said enough.
I still don't get it.
If we're the same person, why are you so much better at being evil than me?
True evil is born through pain and loss.
You see, when I was a small boy back in Gimelschtump,
I had a toy train.
Then, one day I lost it.
Choo-Choo?
- That's... That's it?
- What do you mean?
That's your emotionally scarring back-story?
That's your great tragedy?
Dude! I was raised by ocelots.
I mean, literally.
Disowned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats, and you're telling me you lost a toy train? That's all?
That's all you got, really?
I had to work as a lawn gnome!
I was forced to wear hand-me-up girl's clothing!
Neither of my parents showed up for my birth!
Well, how did you feel when you lost that toy train?
I never lost that toy train...
Well, maybe if you had, you'd have done better.
Since you have neglected to take over your tri-state area,
I think I'll go over there and give it a shot myself!
Great! We can be a team!
Yeah, right. A team.
Wait, was that sarcasm?
No!
Yeah! Right there! I'm pretty sure that's my voice when I'm being sarcastic.
Okay, Buford, where are Phineas and Ferb?
How should I know?
They never showed up for me to return serve!
That's considered a forfeit in catapult badminton.
So I went to get some Victory Gum.
A tradition as old as the game itself.
Don't play with me, young man.
Where is the giant platypult they built?
I don't know. Seems to have vanished.
Really? Did you hear that, Stacy?
The mysterious force took the platypult away before I, the grown-up, could see it.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for all of this.
And they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig!
Who's laughing now, Wayne?
The logical explanation is the mysterious force.
The real question is, why does it care so much about my little brothers?
Why doesn't it want them to get busted?
Well, why don't you ask it, Kierkegaard?
What? Existentialist trading cards.
They came with the gum.
Wait, he's right! I should just ask it!
- I'll bet I can reason with it.
- Reason with it?
Candace, it's a force that you made up.
No, I know what I'm talking about, Stacy!
- Come on!
- Where are you going?
To my back yard!
The heart of the mysterious force!
Would you like to trade two Sartre for a Nietzsche?
All right.
Sucker!
Well, this should be our street.
But it sure looks different.
Dad?
Boys, what are you doing here?
You'd better get inside before the Doofbot catches you.
I'm off to the factory. See you next week.
Wow! Well, I guess we'd better get inside.
You might want to...
I mean, these guys might not know that you're not really a... You know.
Boys! I thought you were in your room.
Get inside!
And get your dooferalls back on before someone sees you.
If you need me,
I'll be hiding in the basement.
That was weird.
Let's find the other us's.
And... Hey, I got a one!
Pick a Doofopoly instruction card!
"Conform". I can do that.
Hi, guys.
No! They're replacing us!
I must not have conformed quick enough.
No, no, it's not like that.
We're you guys from another dimension.
- Different dimension? Is that allowed?
- Apparently.
Look! Perry's back!
Where have you been?
We've missed you so much.
Phineas, he's not your Perry.
He came with us.
Sorry.
Wait, can I hold him a little longer?
It's just that, well, he left one day and never came back.
He's been gone for a long time, and I'm really worried.
All right, you know the only time we're allowed to make noise is on Doofens Day.
So keep it...
Are there four of you in this room?
Five, counting Perry.
I see nothing.
I have plausible deniability.
Boy, your Candace is much less curious about what you're up to.
What do you mean?
Well, it seems like our Candace has spent her entire summer focused on what we're doing.
Summer? I think that was outlawed a long time ago.
You guys don't have summer?
Well, that's... That's terrible.
Summer. It sounds dangerous yet oddly compelling. What is it?
What is summer?
Man, where do I begin?
The days are longer
The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
It's noticeably warmer
Summer
Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold
Summer
It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda
Dripping down your chin
It's summer! Man, where do we begin
Summer
It's ponds and pools and garden hoses
Trying to beat the heat
Summer
Bicycles and roller skates
And even just bare feet
It's also surfing tidal waves
Creating nano-bots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird
Painting a continent
Or driving our sister in...
Wait, maybe we're going too fast.
Summer
It's crickets and cicadas
And a glass of lemonade
Summer
It's sitting with your brother
In the back yard
Under the shade of a big tree
That's what it means to me
The days are longer
The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
It's noticeably warmer
Summer
Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold
Summer
It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
Wow. Summer sounds like a blast.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
Like this summer for instance.
We built a rollercoaster, we became one-hit wonders, we travelled through time...
This is a message for other dimension Perry the Platypus.
If you turn yourself in,
I promise not to hurt your little friends.
If you don't, all bets are off.
And then we launched ourselves from a giant Perry the Platypult and...
You are kidding me.
You're actually sneaking away again?
So nothing's changed.
Did it ever occur to you that we could help you?
That we could have made a great team?
But I guess you can't have teamwork without trust.
You don't have to sneak away any more.
We know your secret. You can just go.
I walk away from you, my friend
I hope that this is not the end
Of all the times we figured out
How to seize the day
As I walk away
You know, I used to think you couldn't spell "platypus" without "us".
Well, you can.
But it would just be "platyp".
Well, I guess if you guys can't help us fix the remote, we could check with Isabella.
Who is Isabella?
The girl who lives across the street.
Mom says that talking to neighbours can be dangerous.
- It's true!
- Well, it's time you met her.
Come on, you'll like her.
What about the Normbots?
Relax! We've been avoiding them all day.
If you're really careful, you can...
Okay, we've got to be more careful than that.
May I please see your identification?
Display your travel papers or be destroyed.
Display your travel...
I can't stand these things.
- Hey! It's Buford.
- Who are you guys?
We're Candace's brothers.
We're going to Isabella's.
Are you part of the Resistance?
I used to be in the Resistance, but I got so good at it that I started resisting them.
Behold, the Other-Dimensionator!
Actually, this is the other Other-Dimensionator.
The Other-Dimensionator is back in the other dimension.
Okay, step one is, push this button.
Step two, stand back in awe!
That's it?
Now that I think about it, those two boys made some modifications to my design which may have allowed it to...
You know...
- To work.
- Great, now I need those two boys?
- Perry the Platypus!
- Perry the Platypus!
Jinx! You owe me two sodas!
Listen, Perry the Platypus,
I know I told you if you turned yourself in
I wouldn't hurt your friends, but change of plans!
Now I need to hunt them down which might involve a little hurting.
I know that makes me a liar, but hello! Evil!
Come on,
Isabella's house is right through...
What you doing?
Isabella?
- Do I know you?
- Hey, Isabella!
Him I know. Buford, what do you want?
I thought you were resisting us?
I was helping Candace's brothers cross the street.
Candace has two sets of twin brothers?
No, he and I are from another dimension.
We're trying to get back.
All right, girls, release them.
Why would you want to come to this dimension, anyway?
Well, we didn't mean to come here.
Now we can't get back unless we can fix this device.
Well, we may have someone who can help you. Dr Baljeet.
- Baljeet!
- That's Dr Baljeet to you!
Were you not listening?
Here is the crux of your problem.
Think of the universe and all of the many dimensions as circular.
The energy flows between the dimensions like this, clockwise.
Say this is your dimension and this is our dimension.
You travelled with the flow of energy.
So going clockwise would be easy!
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy, overloading the local power grid.
I have prepared a little song to help illustrate my point.
If you travel through dimensions
Going clockwise makes it easy
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy
overloading the local power grid
I know, it needs a chorus.
Anyway, without the 8 million gigawatts, you would have to go clockwise, the long way around.
Theoretically, you would get home but there is no telling how many dimensions you would have to go through.
Well, do you think you can help us get enough power to open the window backwards so we can get home?
Well, we should probably ask our leader.
Ask your leader what?
Who made the topiary out of wild parsnips?
I'm allergic, and it's messing up my voice.
Candace, you're the leader of the resistance?
What are you two doing here?
Never mind, I'll deal with you later.
You two,
I've been spending all these years trying to keep my brothers safe and suddenly their faces are all over the Doofen Channel.
We're just trying to get home.
Well, what's stopping you?
- Right now? Quantum physics.
- Baljeet.
We need to generate
8 million gigawatts for inter-dimensional travel.
Then we've got work to do.
- Isabella, start redirecting the power.
- Aye aye!
Gretchen! Monitor the Doofen Channel.
Make sure we're not raising any alarms.
- I'm on it.
- Buford, keep resisting.
- No!
- Excellent.
And will somebody get rid of that topiary!
Thank you.
Great and powerful mysterious force!
I know you are just trying to protect my brothers but I am simply trying to protect them, too, from their dangerous inventions.
Show yourself so that
I may reason with you!
Maybe we should build a shrine to it?
Candace, that's...
- It's a mysterious force!
- It's a mysterious force!
Ferb! I think we got it!
It looks like home!
What do we do now?
I don't know.
I can't believe it actually worked.
Well, thanks, everyone. Hey, where's...
That's right.
This just in. Our supreme leader has announced the capture
of public enemy number one, Perry the Alternate-Dimension Platypus.
I guess we won't be seeing him any more except as a platyborg.
It's 3:30.
We now conclude our broadcast day.
Now go to bed!
- We've got to save him!
- No.
Too risky. You've got to get back to your dimension.
We're not going anywhere without our platypus.
I thought you told us he was just using you as a cover.
I know what I said. I was hurt.
But even if it was all an act, he's still a part of the family, and we're not leaving him behind.
I may never be able to open this again.
It doesn't matter.
We're going back for him.
- Well, then you're on your own.
- Fine.
Just tell us where
Doofenshmirtz keeps his prisoners.
- We have to help them!
- No, we don't.
Yes, we do. Remember how we felt when our Perry disappeared?
Oh, criminy, I must be crazy.
All right, we can get there through the tunnels.
- Yes!
- Let's suit up, people!
You know what, Stacy?
I'm tired of the mysterious force pushing me around.
- I'm going to show it who's boss.
- Candace, wait!
I will try to keep it open for as long as possible but the window is very unstable.
Even the slightest disturbance will cause it to collapse.
- Like that, for instance.
- Hey, Candace.
You guys are so...
Wait, why are there four of you?
Oh, these guys are from this dimension.
Are we inside the mysterious force?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
And why is Isabella suddenly fashionable?
What do you mean, "suddenly"?
Seriously, where are we?
Candace, I'm sure you have a million questions, but right now we have to save Perry from being turned into a cyborg.
- What?
- We'll explain on the way.
So, how do I dress in your dimension?
Hey, is that me? I look good!
Oh, no. You two stay here.
- But we want to help.
- That's an order!
Wait, so in this dimension,
Perry is a secret agent?
No, in this dimension he's a cyborg.
So, where is he an agent?
That would be in our dimension.
But we're not in our dimension now.
Okay, I'm having trouble processing this.
Now I wish I hadn't thrown away that pamphlet.
And why are we in mine cars?
This'll take us as far as the underground entrance to Doof's headquarters.
From there we go up the ventilation shaft.
The detainment centre is on level four.
And the snack bar's on level five!
If there's time.
Buford.
I'm just gonna get some nachos.
So, if there's another me and another them, then there must also be a Jeremy Johnson here, too, right?
Oh, yeah, Johnson, Jeremy.
Leads a three-man strike team on the north side. Good soldier.
Good soldier?
That's all you think of him?
Don't you think he's dreamy or cool or even cute?
Tell me at least you think he's cute.
Cute doesn't win the war, kid.
Well, I guess.
But what do you guys do around here for, you know, fun?
Look, "Candace" is it?
No offence, but fun isn't really on my agenda.
You know, since Doofenshmirtz took over the tri-state area, even though I was a little girl,
I've been focused on one thing and one thing only.
- He's going down, down, down.
- Down, down, down, I know.
But what about BFF's?
Or slumber parties?
Or busting your little brothers?
Busting my brothers?
I spent every day of my life trying to protect my little brothers.
I had to grow up pretty quick around here to make sure they didn't have to.
Gee, you make growing up sound like it's a bad thing.
It is what it is. I'll do whatever it takes to protect the ones I love.
Thanks, sis!
What are you guys doing here?
- We're here to help.
- Sir, we're nearing the target!
Don't move!
Okay, people, change of plans.
This is as far as we go.
We're not going to help them?
No, we're gonna get you two home where it's safe.
- But we wanna...
- Look, this isn't our fight.
It's their fight, and you two shouldn't have gotten involved.
Maybe none of us should have.
Now we're out of here.
I don't remember it being so dark down here.
- Dark?
- That's because it's a trap!
And if it was light, you would have seen us and run away, hence ruining the trap!
I think they get that.
Perry!
We... We, well, came to rescue you.
So far it's not going as well as we'd hoped.
We didn't have a lot of time to, you know, plan something elaborate, but I guess we could have created some sort of diversion just in case...
Yeah, we could have thought this out more.
I got you and I got your little friends, too!
Game over! You lose! I win!
Mark this the hour of your doom,
Perry the Platypus.
Three forty... I got one of these watches with just the little hash marks.
It doesn't even have the numbers on it.
Let's just say it's between 3:30 and 4:00,
Eastern Standard Time.
Whoa!
I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!
They're getting away!
I knew this was a bad idea.
All right, everyone in the cars!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Isabella, start the motor!
Yes, sir.
I got it.
You two, keep your heads down and remember your training!
We never had any training!
Well, keep your heads down!
Consider yourself trained.
This is going to be close.
All right, you rust buckets. Let's dance.
Can you do that?
Well, apparently.
I am so in love with her right now.
- What?
- Nothing.
If we can get to the north tunnel before they get to us,
I can trip the security door.
Isabella, can you give us more throttle?
It's all the way in, sir!
All right, hang tough.
This is going to get hairy.
Can we make those turns at this speed?
Well, we're about to find out.
There it is. We should be okay if we can hold off these...
- Can we do that?
- No. Keep your head down.
We're slowing down, sir!
Keep it on the floor!
It's on the floor.
There's too much track, sir.
I don't think we're going to make it!
Everyone, to the front now!
We're going to have to cut loose these...
The motor's overheating!
Sorry, guys. You're on your own.
What are you doing?
My job. Protecting you two.
We've got to go back and help them.
That's not our fight.
But you just abandoned them!
We could have made it!
We could have all made it!
Or we could have all been captured, and I wasn't going to take that chance.
These are the tough choices, people.
Somebody's got to be the adult here.
You two are safe, and that's what's important.
- But... But... But...
- End of discussion.
Man, I had my heart set on those nachos.
Look, mysterious force,
I feel a little awkward talking to you since I didn't believe in you at first because, you know, it's crazy.
But then I saw you eat my friend, so I've made a little shrine here.
It's nice.
There's a banana and Mr Miggins.
So I hope this makes up for the whole disbelief thing.
Are we... Are we good?
Now you have no choice but to fix my machine.
- No.
- That's not one of your choices.
- Fix the machine!
- No.
Can I... Can I say something?
So, I think I'm up-to-date on the whole Perry Agent thing.
Strangely, that's the most normal thing that's happened this afternoon, but who exactly is this guy?
- Fix it!
- No.
Look, I would make myself do it but apparently he's an idiot.
- Hey!
- Fix the machine!
- No.
- All right, then, you've forced my hand.
Fix the machine!
- No.
- Really?
When I was your age, I did anything a puppet told me to do.
How old do you think we are?
I don't know. One, two?
You know, it's hard to tell with the one eye.
Anyway, I don't know why you're being so uncooperative.
All I'm asking you to do is make my machine work so I can invade and conquer your world and enslave your loved ones.
See, that's just it.
Why would we do something that would lead to our own self-destruction?
Self-destruction?
Self-destruct... Wait a...
Wait, that's it. I remember now.
They took out my self-destruct button.
I don't know why I put it back in, but here.
I'll just rewire this, like so, and there.
It's working! It's working!
It's functioning properly!
Well, look who just became redundant.
Send them to their doom!
Yes, her, too.
Yes, yes, everyone.
- Doom, doom, doom and doom.
- Doom!
Jinx! You owe me three sodas.
Okay, doom for him, too.
What? But I'm you!
Doom!
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time
I was doomed by a puppet,
I'd have two nickels.
Which isn't a lot. But it's weird that it happened twice, right?
Welcome, doomed guests.
Come on, keep trudging.
Doom is thataway.
I would say, so far, adulthood gets about a three.
You know, this may be as good as it gets.
And now for my all-time favourite game.
Poke the Goozim with a stick.
Surrounded by lava.
My second favourite game is backgammon. Love it!
Hold the phone. I could be useful.
What if you need a kidney or a stand-in for boring functions you have to attend?
Or another kidney?
Doom!
Pooh.
Cranky, cranky, cranky.
Oh, I love the crank!
I'll be honest, Ferb.
I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this.
Blah, blah, blah, two-car garage, etcetera.
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life!
Whoa, deja vu-ish.
Perry, check out that guard!
Keys!
Cool! Look out!
Is this the plan?
Tell me this isn't the plan!
You are tampering with the property of...
Let's make omelettes!
Can you get a little more lift out of this thing?
I think I just bruised a kidney.
My bicycle is missing!
Yes! Go, Goozim!
- It's muffin time, sir.
- Already?
Okay, I see where you're going with this...
I officially prefer our dimension!
This may not be the best time to tell you, but I actually flunked jungle gym in grade school.
I just couldn't get the hang of all the climbing...
Oh, great, you caught it! Unlock me!
Are you even paying attention?
That's right. It can wait. Later!
More guards!
- It's muffin time, sir!
- You're broken!
Yay, other dimension Candace!
Phineas!
Catch!
The remote!
Perry, let go!
What? No, no, don't let go.
Perry! Trust me!
Two words! La-va!
Trust me!
They opened another portal!
Go after them!
And her!
That banshee screaming girl.
Get her, too!
Thanks, Perry the Platypus.
Stop where you are. You cannot leave.
I use aggression to mask my insecurities!
The portal!
Boy, I could go for a lemonade.
The portal closed, sir.
Oh, pooh.
Oh, well. Time to start the invasion!
And somebody get me a muffin!
But it's not muffin time, sir!
All right, follow me.
We're going around clockwise.
If there's no hospitality
Just get out of town
You can't be lying on formality
And saying...
I guess I'll see you around
You've got no obligations
Nothing holding you down
Find a new situation
And say
I guess I'll see you around
You've got no time to waste on sentimentality
Get out and find yourself a brand-new reality
You've got to find yourself a brand-new reality
A particle duality
A new dimensionality
- Yeah, yeah!
- I guess I'll see you around
Sometimes it's appropriate
To stop for a snack
If you do then I hope you get back
I guess I'll see you around
Hopping clockwise through dimensions
Is a dangerous thing
But it seems to help a lot if we sing
And we can sing about
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
I guess I'll see you around
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
A brand-brand-brand-brand
I guess I'll see you around
All right, how about two Kafkas for your Dostoyevsky?
Stop wasting my time, Buford.
Wait, I think this is it.
- Where have you guys been?
- This is it!
I spy with my one little eye a new tri-state area that's one dictator short of a dictatorship.
Well, that's all about to change.
Pretty soon I'll be ruling over two tri-state areas, a virtual six-state area!
Fly, fly, my Normbots!
We've got some oppressing to do!
Why is Perry wearing a hat?
We don't have time to explain.
We've got to try and stop an evil...
It's too late!
They're never going to fire her and...
Hey, did you see that?
No, I... What's going on?
Oh, my!
- What is it?
- It's a comb over!
I know, I should really just shave it.
Not happening. Not happening.
My watermelon!
All vehicles must stop.
It's okay! It's a rental!
Oh, great!
Albuquerque '93 all over again.
I wish other-dimension
Candace was here.
She took out, like, 30 of them
- with a giant stone lawn gnome.
- Agent P! Our agents are being
overwhelmed by the sheer number of robots coming into our dimension.
You must get to Doof's headquarters and stop him.
Aye, aye, sir. We're ready to serve.
Oh, no. You kids need to go home where it's safe.
With all due respect, sir, we've been through quite a lot together.
We're a team now.
Nope, far too dangerous.
And besides, our insurance won't cover it.
Tell them, Agent P.
Come on, Perry.
Let's go kick some robot chassis!
Perry?
Wow, I guess we're going home then.
Hey, where's Dr D?
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Thompson? It's me, Heinz.
I think I left my keys in the other dimension.
Can you buzz me in?
- Who is this?
- Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Your neighbour.
For, like, 12 years.
- Who?
- I live in the penthouse.
I wear lab coats a lot.
I speak with the accent
I am currently speaking to you with.
Just like my neighbour upstairs.
Yes, exactly!
He's not home.
You'll have to come back later.
No, no, wait.
This is just beautiful.
I decide to do the right thing, and I end up in a cell.
Well, at least my brothers are safe.
What lesson am I supposed to be learning here?
I'm Jeremy Johnson.
I'm here to rescue you.
Johnson, Jeremy?
Yes, sir.
And I picked up a couple new recruits.
We found a way to bypass the entire security grid. It was cool.
What? You brought my little brothers?
Are you out of your mind, soldier?
I didn't know they were your brothers, but I should have known.
They're smart and courageous, just like you.
You think I'm smart and courageous?
Well, yeah, sir.
Good work, soldier.
We should really get out of here while we can.
Most of the Normbots are away in the other dimension.
We can slip away pretty easily.
The Normbots are in the other dimension?
This isn't the time to escape.
This is the time to make our move.
Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
Boys, wait. Thanks for rescuing me.
I'm really proud of you both.
And we're proud of you, too, sir.
I got nachos! Who wants some?
Nobody?
Mysterious force, you can see I'm really trying here.
Please bring back Candace!
Oh, hi, Stacy.
And I also want a car.
I still can't believe
Perry wanted us to go home.
I mean, look at this.
There's robots all over the tri-state area. And now for the weather.
There's robots, Phil! Robots!
You'd think he'd need all the help he could get...
Hey, what's that?
Ferb, do you hear that?
It's Perry's locket.
It's like a homing device.
Shall we?
This must be Perry's lair.
Welcome, Phineas and Ferb.
Please insert the key.
Do you have a key?
Please insert the key.
Good try.
Please insert the key.
Please insert the key.
That's odd. It's a shaped keyhole.
It kind of looks like...
Wait a minute.
Phineas and Ferb, this message is top secret, for your ears only.
If you are hearing this, the tri-state area is at emergency alert level Alpha Red.
Agent P needs your help.
How does he know we'll know what to do?
He knows you will know what to do.
He also knows you two are the only ones capable of helping him
because you two are the only ones capable of creating these.
Auto-scan replication initiated.
Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today.
You have a new leader.
Put on your dooferalls. 36-inch waist.
No way! I'm a 34!
So, I guess you trusted us after all.
I was wrong. It was not for me!
Heads up!
Platyposterior coming through!
Now this is what I call busting.
All right, everyone!
Let's kick some robot chassis!
Yeah!
All right, that is very good.
Phineas! Anything we can do?
Yeah! Musical accompaniment!
We're gonna kick some robot chassis
So you better tell your robot nation
To say a robot prayer
'Cause you better prepare
For an automaton annihilation
You think you're gonna take us down
Well, mechanical man, you just try it
You're gonna ride that rail out of town
This is a robot riot
I think you know what I mean
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you down
And sell you for scrap metal
But I'll keep enough
To build myself a trampoline
'Cause your momma was a blender
And your dad was just a washing machine
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to a chop shop downtown
You know that you'll be dreading
This android Armageddon
I think you better check your fluids
'Cause I know you're sweating
You know you're gonna lose
And sing the robot blues
You'll blow a fuse
And take a robot snooze
I will deactivate you
Because I kind of hate you
Don't want to beat around the bush
- We're gonna decimate you
- This is a robot riot
Oh, man, it's on
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna rip you up
And put you back together
In a new configuration
Just to mow my lawn
'Cause your sister is a fridge
And you know her light is always on
This is a robot riot
Robot riot...
We've got to do something about that portal.
Ferb! We're gonna go try to close the portal!
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to the chop shop downtown
I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to the chop shop downtown
What?
I've had just about enough of you, you...
What is on this!
I was wrong, Stacy, about everything.
I'm not a grown-up.
I can't control mysterious forces.
I can't even get my mom to see what my brothers are doing!
Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom to see what my brothers are doing!
Candace, where are you going?
I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom!
And I'm gonna fail!
No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
You borrowed sugar from me this morning.
I don't have any sugar.
I had to borrow some from my neighbour this morning.
Yeah. That's me!
He's a nice man, but I hear he's divorced.
That she remembers.
Mom!
Candace, what are you doing here?
You got to come outside and bust the boys!
I'm not leaving now.
The girl is about to forgive the guy for the cliché misunderstanding.
Well, after she battles these robots.
This 3-D is amazing!
Ferb, we'll handle it down here.
Go help Phineas!
Come on, you stupid thing. Work!
So that dish must be what's controlling the robots.
Maybe I don't need to close the portal if I could just take out that...
Yeah!
No, you don't.
Now the baseball is on the other foot.
Or however that saying goes, I'm not...
I'm not really sure.
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?
You know, all that's going to happen from you guys coming up here is that I'm going to have a brand-new platyborg.
And maybe even a boyborg!
Try saying that five times fast.
Boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg...
I guess it's not that hard, never mind.
You know something, kid?
You've been a thorn in my side all day long.
But that's about to change right now!
No!
My babies! No, what have you done?
It's weird that
Perry's a secret agent, huh?
Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect.
Has anyone seen my pants?
Yeah, they're over there.
Wolverines!
Mom, if you care one iota about me, your family, and your city, you'll come outside with me right now!
Well, I guess I could use some more popcorn.
Great! Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Ferb! Bro, I just hit the best home run ever!
Now, tremble before me!
No, I'm down here.
See, one last trick up my sleeve.
It's me! I'm the trick up my own sleeves,
'cause I'm in the sleeve, get it?
Pearls before swine.
Hope you got your 3-D glasses
'cause I'm coming at you!
Yeah!
Hey!
What? I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
I got a little something just for you.
Here.
Choo-Choo!
Yeah, it's mine.
See, I told you I never lost it.
It was in a box in my pantry labelled
"VHS tapes".
Go figure. Anyway, you can have it.
I can't believe it! Choo-Choo, it is you!
Heart melting, back-story resolving, evilness diminishing.
It's the least I can do.
You know, I don't even know what I was thinking with the whole evil robots thing.
Actually, when I look around,
I'm really embarrassed.
Let me clean this up.
Look! Self-destruct button.
You.
Yeah. Here we go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, hurry, hurry!
Do I even need to say
"there's nothing there" any more?
Mom, you can say it all you want.
There's nothing there!
Whoo-hoo! I did it, I saved the world!
You can go back to your movie now.
Yeah, you know what?
We're totally cool now.
I'm just gonna go return to my home and live out the rest of my days with my Choo-Choo. Okay then, ciao!
Home. It's good to be...
Book him, ladies.
You know, my crimes against humanity had just completely slipped my mind.
Hey! Did you guys just see that?
I saved Danville!
Good job, soldier.
So what'll you do now?
Wow, I haven't thought of anything but busting Doofenshmirtz for years.
- I don't know.
- Well, I know what interests I'd pursue.
Hey! Here you all are.
I'll take that under consideration.
What about you, Candace?
You know, after all of this,
I'm gonna give myself a little more time to be young.
It's not such a bad place to be.
You know what? Me, too.
Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for telling us all about summer, you know, opening our horizons, and teaching Ferb classical guitar.
Hey! It's our Perry! Perry!
Looks like the evil was fried right out of him.
Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.
Are you kidding?
That makes him extra cool!
Thanks so much, guys.
I'm glad we could help.
Man, this has been the greatest day ever.
Imagine how much fun we can have together now that we know you're a secret agent.
Yes, yes, the next 15 minutes should be a real hoot.
Well, then, of course,
Agent P will be sent away forever.
- What?
- You didn't know?
- Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
- We threw it away.
- Does anyone read those things?
- I tried to warn you, sir.
Kids, I'm sorry but now that
Agent P's cover has been blown, you won't be allowed to see him any more.
That's why you didn't want us to know your secret.
So we'll never see Perry again?
There has to be another way.
Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe.
You know too much.
Now I never wished so much that I could unknow something.
Sir, maybe there is a way.
What about
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Amnesianator?
I never built an Amnesianator.
I think I'd remember building something like that.
Well, that might work.
But you'd all have to agree.
So our choice is to either forget the best day ever, forget the biggest adventure we've ever had, and forget meeting Agent P, or remember today, but never see Perry again?
Well, we've had a lot of great days.
But we only have one Perry.
Agreed.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right, everybody.
Tall kids in the back.
Just need to do a little more programming here and we'll be ready to roll.
Hey, buddy, Ferb and I just wanted to say our goodbyes.
You know, we thought we'd finally met the real you when we found out you were Agent P, but the fact is, pet, secret agent, they're both the real you.
You are now and always have been a great pet and a great friend.
We're gonna miss you, Agent P.
I love you, pal.
Sir, are you crying?
No, I'm sweating through my eyes.
Okay, sir. We're ready.
Okay, Karl. We're set.
- Major Monogram?
- Yes?
So none of us will remember any of today?
That's right.
Good!
Isabella!
- Hit it, Karl!
- Wait! Wait, wait!
Seventh-grader.
Sounds a lot better than sixth-grader.
(SIGHS) This is a Greg thing.
I don't see why I had to come.
Because, Rodrick, this is a family event, and like it or not, you're part of the Heffley family.
Yeah. That and we already paid for your ticket.
[MAN ON PA]: I'd like to give a warm welcome to Westmore seventh-graders!
A new year of school starting.
Hi!
Rowley!
Greg!
Alakazam!
Alaka-zoo-wee Mama!
What are you doing?
It's a magic wand.
Do you want to see a trick?
Only if the trick is to make the thing disappear.
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Just put it in your pocket!
You don't want to give away your best tricks in public.
So, how was your summer?
That sounds pretty rough.
The only good thing that happened was I got rid of the Cheese Touch.
Who'd you give it to?
The new kid.
Jeremy Pindle.
[GIRLS]: Cheese Touch!
Hey, guys!
Anyone for pizza?
Hey! Thanks, Fregley.
You know,
I can't believe people leave perfectly good food just lying around.
I'll save that for later.
Let's skate.
[MAN]: I'd like to give a shout out to Taylor Pringle!
Uh-oh, dork alert!
Happy birthday, Taylor!
Five years young.
I hope your party's a blast.
Rowley, stop pulling me down!
[MAN]: Ho, ho, ho
It's magic
You know
Who is that?
Her name is Holly Hills.
She just moved here.
What grade is she in?
Seventh.
She's an all-star soccer player, has done professional modeling, and was her sixth grade class president.
She moved here from Oregon because her father got a big promotion.
They drive a hybrid SUV, live on the north side of town in a cul-de-sac near the park.
What? I googled her!
She's a picture of loveliness, is she not?
She's almost as pretty as my mom.
She's going to be very popular.
[GIRL]: Sit here!
Sit here!
Please, everyone, sit down. We have our seats.
[MAN]: It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
Excuse me.
What?
I said, excuse me.
You're blocking the exit.
(STAMMERS) Oh, sorry.
That's okay.
I'm Chirag Gupta.
And I'm single.
Wow. My name is...
We know exactly who you are.
Holly Hills of
432 Embury Lane.
[GREG]:
No, we don't know who you are.
We have no idea who you are.
Okay! Well, I think I'm going to go skating now.
Please congratulate your father on his promotion from me!
"We know exactly who you are"?
You trying to scare her?
Does it really matter?
A girl like that is out of your league anyway, Gregory.
She's new. She isn't out of anyone's league yet.
She doesn't know the social pecking order.
If there was ever a time for me to make a move, it's now.
Hey, Greg!
Can you break a leg or something so we can leave?
[RODRICK]: Oh!
That'll never happen.
Not a chance.
There's no way that girl will ever talk to you.
Yeah, well,
I just talked to her and we'll probably skate later.
Really? Okay.
Well, you see that clock?
They play a slow song at the top of every hour for couples skate.
If you're so confident, ask her to skate.
Maybe I will.
What you waiting for, wimp?
You the man!
Look, if we can get out to Holly and be standing right next to her when the clock changes, then I can ask her to skate and she'll have to say yes.
I don't know about that.
(INDISTINCT HIP-HOP
MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, honey, hi!
Remember when we were young like this, and we used to dance and go to parties, and things like that?
Whoo!
I'm going in.
Cover me!
Girl you are to me all that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life...
[MAN]: All rockers and hardcore skaters off the rink, unless you're looking for love.
It's time for couples skate.
I'm making my move.
Stop! Enough of that total lameness! Who's ready to rock? Yeah!
(HEAVY METAL
ROCK SONG PLAYING)
Come on, let's get out of here. Come on.
[ROWLEY]:
What are we gonna do? Stay calm.
All we have to do is just stay here.
[ROWLEY]: Whoa! Whoa!
GREG: Rowley! Hang on!
[SUSAN ON PA]:
Greg Heffley!
This is your mother.
Everything is going to be okay.
Stay where you are, and your father is going to come rescue you.
I repeat, everything is going to be okay.
Okay, here he comes. Here comes
Frank. I see him. He's on his way.
Dad!
I know, I know.
Okay. All right, everyone, go back to skating!
You all right?
Hey, Romeo, how'd it go with the new girl?
(GRUNTING) Whoa!
You ruined my birthday!
You jerk!
Ow! Ow! That hurt!
- [GREG]: Rodrick!
- (BABY CRYING)
Here, catch!
Let me start by saying that having a brother is really overrated.
Rowley always says he wishes he had a brother, and, boy, do I wish
I could give him one of mine.
I've looked into it and, unfortunately, it's not legal,
I mean, Manny has been telling on me ever since he was able to speak.
Bubby did it.
Bubby did it.
[SUSAN]: Greg!
And Rodrick is the king of laziness.
Except when it comes to torturing me.
[GREG]:
My mom has started writing... an advice column for the local paper.
She wrote an article last week... about how your brothers will always be there for you.
Well, that's exactly what I'm afraid of.
Hey, Bubby.
Got to go, Mom.
Later, Mom.
Yeah, see you, hon.
Okay, okay, wait.
Hold on.
Wait a second.
I need a moment for a family meeting.
Now, your father and I have been talking.
Things between you two have really gotten out of hand.
Can I just say...
You may not realize it now, but having a brother is one of the most important relationships of your life.
I mean, one day you're gonna be Uncle Greg and Uncle Rodrick to each other's kids.
That's important. So you need to get to know each other.
What?
What?
You need to spend more time together. What?
So that's why I've come up with a new program that's going to reward you for spending time together.
I'm calling it
"Mom Bucks. "
You're paying us with fake money? Yeah.
Okay, now, for every hour that you spend together without fighting, for example, let's say you give Greg a drum lesson, you each earn a Mom Buck, which you can then trade in for one real dollar.
Oh.
So, to start you off, I'm giving you each five Mom Bucks.
Now, if you're smart, you'll save up your Mom Bucks...
Can I cash out now?
Well, Rodrick, if you save...
But can I cash out?
Yes, but...
I want to cash out.
Frank?
I know.
Uh... Okay. Yes, you can. All right.
Okay. All right, great.
We should get going, because you don't want to be late for school. All right?
Yeah, gotta go. Let's go. Okay, all right.
This Mom Bucks thing is a gold mine, muchacho.
You better not ruin it for me.
[GREG]: Most kids hate it when summer ends, but I have to say, right now, school is starting to look pretty good.
Welcome back.
It's nice not to be the new kids this year.
I agree.
I know. Look at all the tiny sixth-graders.
I'm so glad that's not me this year.
Just a little higher.
Just a little higher.
Whoa! Greg!
Look who's in our class.
[GREG]: This was my chance.
If I could sit next to Holly,
I'd have the whole year to show her how great I am.
No way, Greg Heffley.
This is my seat.
No, it's not.
I was here first.
[PATTY GRUNTING]:
It's mine!
Let go!
You know I'm stronger than you, Greg Heffley.
Don't make me beat you up again!
Let's get something straight.
I was sick that day and
I had something in my eye.
[MR. DRAYBICK]: Well!
I've never had students so eager to start the school year.
What's going on?
This is my seat!
This is my seat!
(LAUGHS) Okay, let's start again. What are your names?
Patty Farrell, two R's, two L's.
Greg Heffley.
Would you be related to Rodrick Heffley?
I've got my eye on you, Heffley.
[GREG]:
There's no way to escape.
It's unbelievable! Even at school,
Rodrick is ruining my life.
Shh!
He might hear you.
Nah. Watch.
Holy cow!
He once slept through an entire day.
Do you have an amazing talent that you'd like to share?
Today, Plainview City Council announced a brand-new local contest:
Plainview's Most Talented.
Hey! Greg!
Maybe we should...
Can it,
Chunky Cheese!
Westmore is absolutely packed to the roof with talent.
The top prize is 1,000 dollars and of course, the admiration of your friends and neighbors.
This is huge. I gotta call the band. We gotta practice.
This is gonna be our big break!
Uh-uh-uh.
Wait a second.
Aren't you forgetting something? What?
I showered yesterday.
Smell.
Okay, okay.
Okay. Okay.
We agreed that you'd give a drum lesson to Greg.
You were serious?
[SUSAN]: Who knows?
Maybe you guys will really like it and we can form a family band.
Hello, world, here's a song that we're singing
Come on get happy
A whole lotta lovin' is what we'll be bringing
We'll make you happy
[GREG]: Rodrick says he's a professional musician, but as far as I know the only money he's made, is when Dad gave him five bucks once to stop playing.
When do we get to play the real drums?
Like I'd ever let you touch them!
Watch and learn, earthworm!
Hey, I was thinking we should enter the talent show.
I could do my magic act and you could be my assistant.
Assistant? No way.
Doing magic tricks is bad enough.
Assisting the guy doing the tricks?
I'd never make it to eighth grade.
What?
Hey, a cookie.
Manny, what have you done?
I'm only three.
What's going on?
What did you do to him?
Nothing!
He ruined my video game.
Oh! He didn't do anything on purpose. Did you, honey?
No, I didn't. No, he didn't. He's only three.
[MANNY]: I'm only three!
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
You want another cookie?
[GREG]: It's so unfair.
I have Rodrick making my life a misery on one side, and Manny attacking me from the other.
And I'm the only one who seems to get blamed for anything.
I wonder what it'd be like to have a family that actually loves me.
Little boy!
We're a very rich couple with no children and so much love to share.
Won't you come be part of our family?
Finally! Someone I can leave my billions to.
India? Why would you go there?
India is fascinating. It's the jewel of Southeast Asia.
My father has business to take care of, so he's taking the whole family.
Can you bring me back a cobra?
I want to teach it to dance!
[MALONE]: Wake up!
What are you guys doing over there?
Get the ball! Get the ball, kick it!
[MAN]: Kick it!
[MALONE]: Kick it!
Patty Farrell, you are the man!
Nice running, Heffley. Just have to work on the direction.
Wow. Holly Hills is better than
Bryce. And he's an all-star!
Well, I'm sure your soccer skills made a great impression on her.
Go strike while the iron is hot.
You'll see.
When you come back from India, she'll be hanging out with me.
[CHIRAG]: I would love for that to be true, Gregory.
It would provide hope for smaller boys everywhere, but girls like that just don't hang out with guys like us.
So, listen, you don't have to worry about being in my magic show anymore,
'cause I got Scotty from my karate class to be my assistant.
Scotty?
Isn't he like eight?
He'll be eight.
Get in.
Why?
What are you doing here?
Mom said she'll pay Mom Bucks if I drive you home from school.
We'd rather walk.
Get in! Now!
[GREG]: What happened to the seats?
I needed the room for my new equipment.
How'd you have the money for that?
You know, Mom Bucks.
There's no way. He only earned like five.
We gottao figure out what song we're playing at the talent contest.
Easy. Devil's Diper.
A ballad? Really, dude? We got to lift them out of their seats!
[BEN]: I got it.
Löded Diper!
Löded Diper!
Slow down, guys!
Slow down!
GREG: Whoa!
[GREG]: This Mom Bucks thing isn't working out.
Now Rodrick can get paid for beating me up.
(SNIFFS) Oh...
[GREG]: Mom, why are you writing about me again?
It's embarrassing.
What? You know how important honesty is to me.
And, Rowley, good news.
I called your mom and she gave her permission for you to come with us to
Rockin' Rapids next weekend.
Two days on the biggest water slides in the world!
It's gonna be great!
Thank you,
Mrs. Heffley, but I think I'd like to stay home and practice my magic act.
I just want to perfect my art.
Come on, let's go upstairs.
Mom, can I use your computer for homework?
For homework, right?
Yeah. Definitely.
Homework only.
I'm sorry, Bubby.
What's this?
It's a gift from Manny.
He made it for you because he wanted to say he was sorry for breaking your video game. Isn't that cute?
It looks dangerous. What if I sat on that thing?
Greg!
What are you doing?
(SOFTLY) Tell Manny you love his gift.
You're so lucky you don't have any brothers.
You're kind of like my brother.
And shouldn't we be looking up things for your "hundred years ago" assignment?
She looks like she was born 100 years ago.
Ahhh!
Oh, I hope she's okay.
She sounded pretty hurt.
Are you kidding me?
She's famous, and I heard she's a millionaire.
[ROWLEY]: I would love to be her!
You do know she was faking it?
Really?
Of course.
Anyone can be an Internet sensation.
We could.
I'm listening.
You just have to work with what you got.
Wake up in the morning... feeling like P. Diddy...
Grab my glasses on, I'm out the door
I'm gonna hit this city...
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack...
'Cause when I leave for the night,
I ain't coming back...
I'm talking, playing our favorite CD's...
Pulling up to the parties...
Trying to get a little bit tipsy...
Okay, three, two, one, fall.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
It looks fake.
It has to look real.
But how do I fake it if I'm actually falling backwards?
Maybe you need a gimmick, so people notice you.
Oh.
Wear this on your head.
Now, do it again.
Why can't you be the one that falls backwards in the chair?
Because I'm not the one wearing the underwear on my head.
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Remember when
I broke my arm?
That didn't feel good at...
I can't believe you sat on the tinfoil ball! We're going to be rich!
[SUSAN]: Okay, Rowley.
Hold still. Oy!
My computer was supposed to be for homework only.
You lied to me. You know how I feel about that.
Mom, from now on,
I'll be 100% honest.
[GREG]: Well, that lasted about a week.
Mom somehow didn't appreciate the completely honest version of me.
[ALL]: Happy birthday,
Grandpa!
Next year,
I want a chocolate cake.
That is, if you're alive next year.
[SUSAN]: Greg!
Honesty, Mom!
Mom, it's Mrs. Gillman from the PTA.
Tell her I'm not here!
But that would be lying... and I don't do that anymore.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gillman, but my mom isn't in the house right now.
[GREG]: On weekends, I try to stay as far away from my brothers as possible.
But on Sunday morning,
I have no choice.
Poopy!
(EXCLAIMS) Huh?
[SUSAN]: Greg! It looks like he has a candy bar on there.
Manny!
[SUSAN]: Frank, you're gonna have to do something.
[FRANK]: Yeah, I'll get a rag.
Dad, stop it!
Hold still!
All right, let me see.
You're fine.
Can't even tell.
I'm not going in with a poop stain on my pants.
Okay, well, you can't skip church.
No, I'm not going in like this.
Fine.
(ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND
BEAUTIFUL PLAYING ON ORGAN)
[ALL SINGING]:
He made them every one
Go.
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
What are you doing?
Go!
The Lord God made them all
[MINISTER]:
Please be seated.
Let me just say how gratifying it is to see so many smiling faces here today.
Mothers and fathers...
Okay, we're up.
Come on! We're up!
But everyone will see the sweater.
People are looking, okay?
So come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Poop!
He's pooped his pants!
No, it isn't what it looks like!
It isn't.
It's chocolate!
Chocolate. See?
What did I say about being civil to one another?
That's all
I asked of you!
Well, you have blown it big time!
Never been more embarrassed!
Everyone we know was there!
(SOBBING) I have no idea how I'm gonna write my column this week.
I feel like a complete fraud!
Well, you brought this on yourselves.
You can kiss Rockin' Rapids good-bye!
You two will stay here all weekend and work out your differences.
And if you don't,
I will.
And trust me, you don't want any part of that.
Do you understand?
Yes. Yes.
Yes.
All right, let's go.
And don't have anybody over this weekend.
Got it?
Snacks in the bowls, ice in the freezer, cups on the table.
Your party better be good.
Our party, little bro.
Wait! Whoa, whoa! We need chairs from the basement.
For what?
In case we wanna play musical chairs.
I haven't played musical chairs since the second grade.
Well, it comes back when you hit high school.
Wait! You get the chairs.
I don't want anyone to be disappointed. All right?
Okay.
All right.
Rodrick, help!
The door's closed!
Yeah, and it's staying closed.
I don't need a middle-schooler ruining my party.
What? I thought it was our party!
It's my party. Now keep quiet or I'll lock you in the dryer!
Rodrick!
(MOCKINGLY) Greg!
[ROWLEY]:
And that's magic!
Jefferson residence.
Rowley speaking.
Rowley, I need your help! Now!
Holy pepperoni!
Get inside.
Open the door and let me out!
Yes! You did it!
(LAUGHS) It's a really nice try, Greggy.
But whatever you thought,
I already thinked it.
When our band is huge, we'll have parties every night!
But they'll be backstage parties!
Sweet! We'll get to go backstage.
You, don't touch that phone!
Music off! (SHRILL VOICE) Everybody freeze!
If anyone makes a sound, the party is over and I am a dead man.
So... Shh!
Quiet, man!
Get back!
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Shh!
Hello?
Rodrick, it's Mom.
Is everything okay? It took a long time for you to answer.
Yeah, everything's fine.
I was just washing dishes.
Okay, honey. Well, I just wanted to check in and say I love you, and I'm sorry I was so harsh earlier.
No problem. Bye.
Now let me say good night to Greg.
Greg?
Oh, uh...
He can't. He's asleep.
I don't want to wake him.
No, I'm not. I'm right here. Hi, Mom.
Hey, Rodrick.
Hi, sweetie, is everything okay?
Why were you sleeping so early? (EXHALES)
Well, actually, I wasn't sleeping. I'm down in the basement.
(CHUCKLES) The basement? What the heck are you doing down there?
Wouldn't you rather be up here hanging with me?
Yeah, I would, Rodrick. Why don't you come down and get me?
Now.
(WHISPERING) I think they're trying to get along.
Huh? That's good.
Good, honey.
Okay. Everything is cool here, right, Greg?
Yeah, Mom. And I have your number if I need you.
Okay, sweeties. Well, we'll see you tomorrow. Good night.
Listen up.
If you do anything that embarrasses me, anything at all,
I will...
You'll what?
Just stay out of my way, nerds.
I think we should go upstairs.
Are you kidding me?
We might not get to go to another high school party for five more years.
We have an opportunity here, to see things no other kid in our grade has ever seen before.
Like what?
Teenage things.
Just follow my lead, and we'll be fine.
Hey, watch the elbows, popcorn dude. Not cool.
That was a close one.
I didn't know you could get up there.
[RODRICK]:
You should hear my band.
We play so loud, we actually make people's eardrums bleed.
Ew.
I mean, not really.
I think your brother likes her!
I have to go find my friend.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Reminder! You can't call if you're dead.
Dude, this party is dying.
Look, the girls aren't into it.
Look, they want to dance.
You don't ask them to dance, they're gonna leave, then you're just gonna be that guy who threw the lame party with no girls.
Go ask the girls to dance!
You ask them.
(LAUGHS) No, man. You go ask the girls to dance.
You almost did it.
I'm not going to do it!
I've seen you dance!
I'm not doing it...
Did somebody say "dance"?
Break it down!
Rowley, no! Don't!
That kid's dead. No, wait, man. What are you, new?
You can't mess with a chubby kid, the girls'll freak out!
(FAST-PACED
DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
I won't call Mom.
You can kill me.
Conga!
What is he doing?
Who cares? I'm going to go squeeze in next to Rachel Lewis and Amy Ramirez!
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake it all the time
My girl's name is Senora
I tell you, friends,
I adore her
And when she dances, oh, brother!
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather
Jump in the line,
Rock your body
This is great!
I know! I wish my mom was here.
Your parents are so cool to let you have this party.
Yeah, really cool.
And they can never know.
You can talk about Cha Cha
Tango, Waltz, or the Rumba
Senora's dance has no title
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to the bridle!
Jump in the line,
Rock your body in time
Whoa!
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake it all the time
[FRANK]: Hi. You've reached the Heffley residence. Please leave a message.
[SUSAN]: Hey, guys. Manny's sick.
We're on our way home.
See you in an hour.
Holy...
Moly!
You are in so much trouble.
Me? You lied to Mom, just as much as I did.
You know how she feels about lying! She's gonna kill both of us!
You do the living room,
I'll start the kitchen. Go!
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
I'd rather you didn't than did
I'd rather you didn't get rid
Of me at that age
Such a young awkward stage
That is not what you do to a kid
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
If this is the case
Let us cut to the chase
I'm so sorry
I never let go
I went to the doctor the kind that you talk to
And he said the process is slow
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Down, down, down!
All right, let's go.
I'd rather you hadn't than had
If you hadn't
I wouldn't be mad
At what I'd been handed
Despite it I've landed
On both feet so don't worry, Dad
It looks good.
Too good.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Let's get the kitchen.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Maybe we can paint over it.
I don't know how to make paint!
I got it!
See? It's a good thing
I locked you down here.
Now let's go!
We're not gonna make it!
We're gonna make it.
Trash mine if you'd like to
I'm sure you'd be psyched to
Remember our name is the same
See? Told you it would work.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Rodrick!
The bathroom door! The door doesn't have a lock on it.
The other door had a lock on it and this doesn't. We're dead.
And if they find out...
- Greg?
- [FRANK]: Hey, guys!
Hi.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
Hey, how's Manny? Is he feeling better? Poor little guy.
Yeah. He's doing okay.
[SUSAN]: Wow.
The house looks pretty good.
I was expecting a real mess.
Oh... (SIGHS)
Who ate pretzels on the rug?
So...
Who came over this weekend?
What? Nobody.
You said nobody, Dad.
No means no, right?
Yeah, yeah. Good boy.
So, you guys just hung out?
Had a good time together, huh?
Yeah, actually.
You know, I never thought I'd admit this, but we had a pretty good time together.
Really?
Yeah. Surprised me, too.
So you just worked it all out by yourselves?
Yeah, I guess. I don't know. Mom, don't make a big deal about it.
Please, just...
Okay. Okay.
But nothing...
Nothing makes me happier than to see you two being friends.
Right, Frank?
Hmm? Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, let's go upstairs.
Time for a nappy.
[FRANK]: Hey! What the...
You guys got something you want to tell me?
No.
What was General Grant doing on the thermostat?
I have no idea.
No idea.
No idea, huh?
Don't... These... These are off limits! No touch!
They are not toys.
They're figurines!
I can't...
(WHISPERING) We have to keep them away from the bathroom.
For the next 10 years?
Listen to me.
No matter what they ask you, no matter how hard they push, deny, deny, deny.
Even if they figure it out, never ever admit to anything.
Deny, deny, deny.
Got it?
Got it.
Deny, deny, deny.
It sounds to me like,
"Lie, lie, lie. "
I kind of wish you hadn't told me.
Don't you understand? Rodrick isn't beating me up anymore.
But how are they not going to notice that the lock's gone?
Please.
They're like 40.
They can barely remember our names.
Hi, Greg! I've returned from halfway around the world.
And I see that you're even further than that from Holly Hills.
I guess your unappealing older brother was right about you.
You have no game.
[GREG]: You know what?
I liked Chirag a whole lot better when he was in India.
Man, I sure do miss Chirag.
I wonder when he's coming back.
It's almost like I can feel his presence.
What are you talking about? Here I am!
Did you just hear something?
No. Nothing.
Well, better get to class. Chirag would've wanted it that way.
- (KIDS LAUGHING)
- [BOY]: Good one, Greg.
You may be able to dominate me physically, Greg Heffley, but mentally,
I am the more muscular!
[GREG]: It is officially on.
Hey, Rowley.
Hey.
Does he know about the D-O-R-E?
Huh?
The door!
Yeah. Don't worry. I already told him, deny, deny, deny.
Hi, Rowley!
What's new, huh?
Okay.
[FRANK]: Hey, wasn't there a lock on this door?
I must be losing my marbles.
Oh. I can't take this pressure. I'm leaving.
Okay, everybody, dinnertime!
Actually, Mom,
I have to skip dinner.
Why?
I've got the most important meeting of my life tonight.
Did you say you have a meeting? Yeah.
Like, for like a job?
Yeah. Kind of.
I'm meeting with the best guitarist in Plainview.
Now he's in between bands, and if
I can get him into LÃ¶ded Diper, then winning the talent show is a lock.
I mean, you'd like him, Dad. He's a real professional, like you.
Mmm-hmm.
Be supportive.
That's him.
I'll get that!
Oh, man,
I barely made it here.
Your address has so many numbers!
All right, Bill, we should... Whoa!
Do I smell pot roast?
Oh! Mmm.
[GREG]: Bill got voted
"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star"... when he was in high school.
[BOY]: You suck!
That hasn't really worked out.
We should be going...
Sit.
So, Bill,
Rodrick tells me that you're a professional musician.
So that means that you earn enough to make a living?
Oh, yeah! Yeah.
Well, enough if you live in your parents' basement. (LAUGHS)
My parents are really supportive.
Respect your parents, boys!
Hey! That's what
Joshie says!
Shh!
So...
It doesn't sound like a cakewalk, right? No.
Why don't you tell Rodrick?
Give him a picture of just how challenging it can really be.
No, it's really hard.
First of all, there's no home-cooked meals like this.
What? Really?
Yeah, yeah! No, on the road, it's all burgers and fries and pizza.
Then you got to deal with the fans, especially the girls.
No, it's definitely not for everyone.
But...
If you like rocking deep into the night and partying hard all day then it might be the life for you. It's definitely for me.
[ROWLEY]:
It does sound fun.
But what if you don't play a musical instrument?
Löded Diper always needs roadies.
So... you're joining the band?
Yeah, brother!
I'm in. Let's rock!
Yeah!
I think I might have brought too much stuff.
Let's see how many views our video's got.
It's got to be thousands.
Maybe millions!
Four? We only got four lousy hits?
Greg, I can't lie to your parents about the party. I never lie.
Joshie says a lie hurts everyone.
Guess who wanted to join the big boy sleepover!
Bubby, Rowley!
Mom, no, he'll ruin it!
He just wanted to come in and say hi to Rowley. All right?
And Rowley's mother brought over some healthy snacks and DVDs that she thought were appropriate.
Enjoy your granola bars, boys.
Andy's Magic Cushion.
Let's start with that.
Or should we watch The Foot?
What if she comes back in and asks about the party?
You need to relax.
How about a healthy snack?
We shouldn't be here.
We can't just let ourselves into a stranger's home.
The place is empty.
Nobody's going to mind.
Oh.
Look at his face.
[WOMAN]: What happened to his foot?
It sounded like someone was hopping.
I'm telling you, it's nothing.
It's just your imagination.
Did you just kick me?
You know, you really need to cut your toenails.
What was that?
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
[GREG]: Okay.
Only 'cause you're scared.
Let's just go to sleep.
[ROWLEY]: I wish we had watched
Andy's Magic Cushion.
I love this movie, Frank.
Don't you just love this movie?
He picked the housekeeper over the supermodel?
I know.
It's got me!
The foot has got me!
Greg, is there something you want to say to Rowley and his father?
I'm sorry for choosing an inappropriate movie for the sleepover.
At least nobody got hurt this time.
I'm a little birdy.
I'm a little birdy!
My knee bone.
What?
Mommy, look.
Mommy is looking. Mommy's looked a thousand times!
Mommy just needs to go to the potty for one minute, okay?
No! No!
[SUSAN]: What the heck?
Where's the lock?
Wait.
[SUSAN]: Rodrick, could you come here, please?
What happened to the lock?
I don't know what you're talking about.
There was a lock on this door.
Um...
I don't think so.
Rodrick, I've lived in this house for 10 years.
I've locked that door
10,000 times because sometimes it's my only moment of privacy of the day.
I know there was a lock on that door.
There wasn't.
Trust me.
Greg has walked in on me a million times.
And if there was a lock,
I would use it.
In fact, maybe you should put one on.
So that's your story.
There was never a lock and you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Yes.
Fine. I'll just go ask your brother the same thing.
Greg? Two words.
Bathroom door.
It was Rodrick! He made me! It was his idea.
He had the party! Someone wrote on the door, so we had to change it!
I knew it. I knew it.
No, Mom, wait! I was exaggerating a little bit.
It wasn't a party.
It was a band rehearsal for the talent show.
That's all it was.
We said nobody could come over. He knew the rules.
Yeah, but, Mom, if you punish him,
Rodrick's gonna know
I told on him.
We really had a good time this weekend. But if you do this,
Rodrick and I will never, ever be friends again.
The idea that one day my kids won't get to know their Uncle Rodrick?
Or have any family holidays?
You two really have been getting along better this week, haven't you?
Yeah. We really have.
Okay, if...
If I let this slide, and be our little secret for the sake of the family, and for your relationship with your brother, do you swear to be on your best behavior and get along?
I swear. I swear.
Okay.
You didn't buckle.
Deny, deny, deny, right?
You know...
You may not be half as lame as I thought you were.
[GREG]:
I couldn't believe it!
Rodrick was actually trying to be nice to me.
Wow! You're a Mom Bucks millionaire!
- Where'd you get these?
- Thrift shops.
There's enough in here to last me until I'm 30.
It's about time, little bro, that you learn the secrets to an easy life.
Rule number one, don't be good at something you don't want to do.
Guys!
Use clean rags, not...
Just give me that!
I'll do it myself.
Rule number two, always lower
Mom and Dad's expectations.
Hey, I took a math test today and I'm pretty sure
I flunked it.
Oh, Greg!
But I got it back, and look!
I got a C minus.
Well, at least you didn't fail.
Rule number three, never do something when someone else can do it for you.
"100 Years Ago. " I remember that assignment.
Why write a new one when there's a perfectly good paper already written by your brother?
Isn't that cheating?
Isn't Mr. Draybick cheating by handing out the same assignment every year?
New binder.
Teachers dig binders.
[GREG]: The thing was,
Rodrick had managed to get my dad to do... all his homework for the past five years.
Which one's the space bar again?
- Just let me do it, okay?
- Okay.
I would never actually hand in a paper Rodrick wrote.
But my dad?
That's a different story.
So that's just three of the things
Rodrick has taught me.
He has a lotta cool tips.
I'm not sure Rodrick's tips are really that cool.
Okay, so the invisible
Chirag joke is still going, and the whole school is in on it.
But it looks like Chirag's discovered our weakness.
Hello, Greg, Rowley.
Still pretending I'm invisible, I presume.
I don't know if I can do this.
Stay strong.
What is this?
A corn dog.
Rowley's all-time favorite lunch delicacy.
If you say you can see me,
Rowley, it is all yours.
Mmm. Smell that buttermilk batter.
- [GIRL 1]: You got him, Chirag.
- (ROWLEY GRUNTING)
[GIRL 1]: Resist it.
[GIRL 2]:
Don't do it, Rowley.
Hey, everyone, look!
There's a floating corn dog.
I don't want to get ahead of myself or anything, but I think I may have Class Clown in the bag for dreaming this one up.
In conclusion, without last century's technological advances, there would be no computers, cell phones, or modern medical miracles.
And so for that, we salute and thank our ancestors from 100 years ago.
Thank you, Holly.
That was excellent work.
I think we have time for one more.
I have to say that when I read this paper
I was a bit surprised by its content.
But more than any other, this one deserves to be read out loud.
Greg?
Yay, Greg!
Just read it, Greg.
All of it.
[GREG]: Okay.
"Sometimes I sit and wonder about stuff I do not know...
"Like, what the Earth was, like 100 years ago...
"Did cavemen ride on dinosaurs?
Did flowers even grow?
"Did spiders rule the Earth?
Were deserts filled with snow?
"There were no books or humans, so how were we to know...
"What life was like
100 years ago?"
Loser.
Now, Greg, when we talk about how important it is to recycle, we don't mean turning in your brother's old papers.
I thought Dad helped you with this paper.
Well, actually,
Dad started writing my papers because of that paper.
I looked like an idiot!
And the girl from the roller rink? She laughed at me.
Ouch!
Just do something that changes her opinion of you.
Like, set a firecracker off in the classroom. Boom!
Chicks dig bad boys.
Well, actually I was thinking about writing her a note.
You mean like one with words on it?
I've got it all figured out.
I'm gonna pass her a note with a question on it, but it'll be anonymous.
She'll be like, "I have to know who wrote this. "
Then later,
I'll walk up to her and ask her the exact same question.
It'll blow her mind.
(WHISPERS) A note?
Do you want me to spell check it?
Just pass it to Holly.
To Holly.
Thank you.
It's from Greg.
What's going on?
Greg Heffley is passing me notes!
No, I wasn't.
"How do you get your hair to smell so beautiful?"
[GREG]: Okay.
The note was a minor setback, but at least things are still going well with Rodrick.
It's amazing but I'm actually enjoying... watching Löded Diper rehearse for the talent show.
Bill's taken the band to a whole new level.
Somebody farted.
I got one. I got one.
I got a good one. I got a good one.
Somebody farted.
My dad should be happy that
I'm hanging out with Rodrick.
But I don't think he really likes Bill.
I think what he's worried about is I'll turn out like Rodrick,
Manny'll turn out like me, and, eventually, we'll all turn out like Bill.
Rock and roll!
Rock on.
Yeah.
[HOLLY]: Dear Greg, meet me in the art room before lunch.
There's something I want to ask you. Kiss, kiss. Holly.
Hi, Holly! I was glad to get your note.
I've been wanting a chance to talk to you.
And, hey, you like to paint.
I'm kind of an artist myself.
Holly?
Ha!
(GASPS) Chirag?
You see me now, don't you? Game, set and match to Chirag Gupta!
Hi, Holly.
Hi, Fregley.
She thinks
I'm Fregley?
That's got to hurt.
Want to see my secret freckle?
[BOTH]: Ew!
So the note to the girl didn't work out?
All right. Let's go.
Little bro, I am taking you out.
And here are my other men.
Greg, Rodrick, I'd like you to meet my editors,
Mr. Salz and Mrs. Kohan.
Hey. Hello. Nice to meet you.
Hello.
Where you boys off to?
Just taking the little brother out... for the evening.
He could use a good time.
Okay, well, be safe.
And be home by 9:00.
Yeah. See you!
- Bye.
- Bye. Have fun!
Good night.
Now that is impressive.
My older boy wants nothing to do with his younger brothers.
[MRS. KOHAN]: You certainly practice what you preach.
I think every mother in town should read your column.
Thanks.
Mom would kill us if she saw us eating this.
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze!
All I can say is, get ready to have your mind blown.
We are going to have an epic night.
Are you okay?
(LAUGHS) Fake vomit. You can't beat the classics.
Yeah.
Here we go. Here we go. Here he comes.
Okay. Very funny!
Very funny.
[GREG]: This is sweet!
I told you.
So, you know that girl who I sent the note to?
Yeah?
She thinks I'm Fregley.
(LAUGHING) Oh, man!
I mean, hey, don't take it hard.
Girls act like they're not into you when they really are.
I mean, tons of girls act like they're not into me, but they are.
I know they are. I bet she really likes you.
(WHISPERS) Check it out. Check it out.
Whoa!
Who's out there?
No way.
Coach Malone?
Real funny, yeah?
Oh, yeah!
Well, you just messed with the wrong athlete!
Move. Move!
[MALONE]: Show yourself!
Go, go!
You want to take me on? Yeah?
You want to take me on?
You better bring your A game,
'cause I am a competitor!
- Come on!
- [MALONE]: You will come out!
You know I'm gonna find you!
Help!
Come on.
Something tickles.
[RODRICK]: Come on.
Come on. Come on.
[MALONE]: You can't outrun me!
I'm a superstar!
RODRICK:
Go, go, go, go!
[MALONE]:
Everywhere you go, it's me!
- (RODRICK SHRIEKS)
- (MALONE GRUNTING)
Stupid carbs!
There's the mall!
Come on.
I can't go much further!
Got you!
[WOMAN]: Coach Malone?
"You can't outrun me!
I'm a superstar!"
"Everywhere you go, it's me!"
Come on.
Oh, you boys are five minutes early. Did you have a good time?
A great time.
That is so sweet.
I just can't get over how well your boys get along.
Well, Larry, we run a pretty tight ship around here.
It's all about boundaries, rules.
Anyway, let me show you some of those Civil War re-enactment photos
I was telling you about.
So, what did you boys do?
(STUTTERS) Just hung out at the mall.
And talked about life.
Nothing special.
Oh, my God.
Rodrick?
Can you explain what you're doing in this photo?
That's not me.
That's not you?
Nope.
Okay. How about these?
I can't believe that you had a party!
Greg, you told me it was a couple of kids, a band rehearsal!
Wait, Susan, you knew about this?
[SUSAN]: Yes.
Yes, I knew.
You told Mom?
I knew they had a party!
It slipped out, but I took it back!
My instincts told me you weren't being honest!
- I should've trusted my instincts.
- [FRANK]: Wait!
You knew about this, but you didn't tell me about it?
I still protected you!
I threw Mom off your scent!
Great job.
She has no idea!
We are supposed to be a team against them!
They were getting along so well
I let it blind me to the truth!
Why were you taking pictures?
It was so crazy that morning,
I forgot we took the pictures.
So I let it slide.
And I am so sorry.
Oh, God. It feels so good to get that out.
I haven't been able to look at that bathroom door for two weeks!
I knew that door had a lock on it!
And everybody was trying to make me feel like I was losing my mind!
We're just gonna let ourselves out.
I wouldn't write a column about this.
I'm going upstairs!
To a bathroom that has a lock on it and no one can tell me that it doesn't.
I have to go talk to your father.
I will deal with you boys later.
Rodrick, I really didn't tell her!
I mean maybe, sort of, but I made a deal with her, and we had a really good time, and...
You're my brother, but you'll never be my friend.
Your father and I have talked and we've decided on your punishment.
Greg, you're grounded for two weeks.
Also, no video games for two weeks.
Rodrick, you may only drive to and from school for the next month.
As the ringleader, you are also grounded for a month.
Mom, I'm sorry, and I won't do it again.
I know you won't.
And to make sure we're also not allowing you to perform in the talent show.
What? No.
You can't do that.
Ground me for a year,
I don't care, but you have to let me play in that show.
This could be my big break. I'm sorry.
Dad? Come on. This isn't fair.
I just got Bill in the band!
Actually, Rodrick, that doesn't help your case.
Bill's kind of a jerk.
Our decision is final.
You are so dead!
[GREG]: Things have never been worse.
Our parents are super mad at us, so we have to spend the weekend... at my grandpa's boring retirement community.
Holly Hills thinks
I'm Fregley, and my relationship with Rodrick is at an all-time low.
So he's made it his mission to ruin my life.
Quit it!
Why don't you tell Mom?
You're good at that.
Grandpa doesn't like TV.
Instead, he prefers to watch the lobby on the security channel.
I should be rehearsing right now.
Please, Grandpa. Please, can we watch a real TV show now?
TV is just a bunch of fakers.
This is real life.
It's real life.
You can't beat it.
How's about we all go down to the games room?
You boys like games, don't you?
[GREG]: The games room sounds fun... until you realize that all the games in there are from, like, the 1800s.
My grandpa's favorite is a really old board game called Gutbusters.
Now, remember, the object of the game is to read the joke card... and all the other players have to try not to laugh.
(SNICKERS) Good luck!
There is some real rib-ticklers in there!
Yeah.
You go first.
"Putting economic policy before fiscal responsibility...
"is like putting the cart before the horse"...
That is hilarious, Grandpa!
Read another one, Greg.
I'm going to go change my shirt.
Hi!
Oh, hi, Holly.
What are you doing here?
I'm visiting my grandma.
She just moved here.
I'm on Grandpa duty.
Listen, Greg, I'm really sorry for calling you Fregley the other day.
I don't know what happened.
I think it's the Greg and Freg part, my brain just flipped.
You called me Fregley?
I had no idea.
Really?
Not really.
I heard it.
It was pretty rough.
But don't worry, I have the rest of middle school to get over it.
What happened to your shirt?
Oh, my brother spit milk on me.
Let me guess, he was pretending to laugh at something that wasn't actually funny.
How did you know?
It's in the Older Sibling Handbook.
Last week, my older sister put hair remover in my shampoo.
If I hadn't smelled something,
I'd be completely bald by now!
Why would she do that?
Duh! 'Cause she's my sister.
It's part of the deal. You fight and then you get over it.
Not my brother.
He hates me and he'll never get over it.
Of course he will. He has to. He's your brother.
I also have a little sister who's spoiled rotten.
Tell me about it! My little brother ruins all my stuff, and somehow I'm the one who ends up getting in trouble for it.
Doesn't that drive you nuts?
[GRANDMA HILLS]:
Holly! Time for dinner!
I got to go. It was cool hanging out with you.
I'll look for you tomorrow, Greg.
See you later,
Fregley.
[GREG]: I thought being at Grandpa's was a punishment... but, really, it was destiny that Holly was here, too.
My luck had finally changed.
[RODRICK READING]: "I never believed in fate, or destiny,
"or whatever, until now.
"Things are finally starting to go my way!"
Rodrick, be quiet. Talk on the phone someplace else.
"I thought being at Grandpa's was a punishment...
"but, really, it was destiny that Holly was here, too.
"My luck had finally changed. "
Aww! (LAUGHS)
Give it back,
Rodrick!
This stuff is priceless!
No way.
Come on.
Give it back!
You know what?
I will give it back.
To Holly! Wait till she reads this garbage!
I don't even want to go
"I can't believe my luck!
"I finally got Holly all to myself
"without Chirag, or anyone else!"
Give it back, Rodrick!
Give it back.
No way.
Always stuck in a daydream
Can't focus on the other team
Hunted you all day and night
Now I'm ready for a fight
This is war
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This is war
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This is war
'Cause I got to knock you out
Whoop!
Oh!
They say that you're the best
You gotta follow all the rest
This is war
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Record, record, record.
This is war
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This is war
I can't be your friend
'Cause I gotta knock you out
I'm in the ladies'?
[WOMAN]: Peeping Tom!
There's a Peeping Tom in there!
Peeping Tom!
There's a Peeping Tom in there!
Let's get him!
What do you think you're doing in there?
We'll come in and get you!
Take that, you Peeping Tom!
[WOMAN 1]: Let's get him!
[WOMAN 2]: Get out of here!
[WOMAN 3]:
Stop that pervert!
[WOMAN 4]:
The little whippersnapper!
I've got him!
I've got him!
[WOMAN 5]: Shame on you!
[WOMAN 6]: I've got him in a headlock!
I'm not the Peeping Tom!
[WOMAN 1]: Where'd he go?
Did he just come out of the ladies' room?
[RODRICK]: Hey, Greg!
What's new? Huh?
[GREG]: Well, my life is officially over.
Now that Rodrick has that tape of me... running around in my underwear, he basically owns me.
The day of the talent show came around... and Mom and Dad made us both go.
Something about supporting the community, or whatever.
[ROWLEY]: Scotty!
Come on!
Scotty! Come on!
You don't wanna let the magic fans down, do you?
[SCOTTY]: Go away!
Rowley, what's wrong?
My assistant, Scotty, got stage fright... and now he doesn't wanna do the show.
Maybe Greg would help out.
He can be your assistant.
What? No way!
What?
Rowley is your best friend.
This is important to him.
You need to do this.
It's okay,
Mrs. Heffley.
Greg is just afraid that
Holly Hills will think less of him.
[GREG]: Rowley.
Mom, can we talk in private? Sure.
Scotty, please.
Look...
Who's this Holly Hills?
Is she your girlfriend?
No!
She's just some girl who happens to be a friend who I don't want to be humiliated in front of.
I see your point.
So is this Holly in your class?
Mom!
Okay.
Here we go.
So, are you going to make me do it?
[ROWLEY]:
Please, Scotty.
No. No, I get it.
I get it.
Can you at least point her out to me?
Okay, okay, I'll stop.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Plainview's
Most Talented!
And without further ado,
Ms. Patty Farrell!
(SINGING) Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
Wow, she's really good.
I remember the time
I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me...
Greg, she's cute.
She's super cute.
Mom!
Look, a new day
Has begun
Oh, thank you!
Say hello to the boys and girls, Freggers.
Hello, boys and girls!
I love you.
And tonight, when you are all fast asleep
I'm going to crawl through your window and give you all a big hug!
Hey, you could do that. Right?
Yeah.
A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam
I was born on the 4th of July
I've got a
Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my
Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee doodle came to...
You can't go on without me. I started
LÃ¶ded Diper. I'm the backbone!
Well, we got a new backbone now, dude. (LAUGHS)
This guy.
That's rock and roll, bro.
Did you guys see the audience? Oh, man! It's huge.
This roller-skating kid is really good!
Don't you think...
Greg! Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you.
Mom, you need to let Rodrick play in the talent show tonight.
Greg, we've been over this.
He needs to learn a lesson.
His band is playing without him, and it's not fair.
And I'm sure that's very hard on him, but I can't go back on the punishment.
Mom.
Yes?
You let Rodrick play in the talent show,
I'll...
...do the magic thing with Rowley.
Really?
You'd do that?
You'll be Rowley's partner, even though you said it's totally embarrassing and humiliating?
You're willing to do that just so your brother can play?
Yes.
Come here.
I mean, how bad can it be?
[ROWLEY WHISPERS]:
Scotty was right.
There's a lot of people out there.
Just start with your opening trick, like you rehearsed at home.
Forget about all the people. Go.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the Remarkable Rowley,
(TIMIDLY) master of illusion.
And joining me onstage is my faithful assistant, Scotty.
Greg!
Greg.
Who looks a little cold.
Maybe he needs a scarf.
Ew! Don't put them on me!
They're still wet!
Sorry, Greg.
Here's a peace offering.
Fly. Fly away.
Be free, little friend.
Oh. Oh.
That thing's dead.
(WHIMPERS) I think I had him in my pocket too long.
No hard feelings?
Keep going.
We're a hit!
And now, for my grand finale, the saw-the-lady-in-half trick!
If you will.
(WHISPERS) Push out the feet.
(WHISPERS) Okay.
No trap doors.
No chance of escape.
I will now miraculously saw Greg in half.
Wait. Forget it!
I want out!
What are you doing?
This is the showstopper!
Good, then stop!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ladies and gentlemen, the Remarkable Rowley!
And Greg the Great!
That should have been me!
We killed. And I didn't have to die!
It was even better than it was in the rehearsals.
Hi. Can I have your autograph?
Sure. Sure.
Your performance was pathetic, Greg Heffley!
Only a moron would find humor in bird poop!
You stupid bird!
Oh, my gosh. You guys did great. That was really funny.
The unitard or the performance?
Both.
Thank you, thank you!
Thank you.
Just do your best, honey.
Oh, um...
Can I borrow your eyeliner?
Yeah.
Looks like you guys made up.
We're brothers.
Please welcome to the stage...
Löded Diper! Oh, yeah!
[RODRICK]: Mom, go!
Get off the stage!
[BAND MEMBERS]:
We are Löded Diper!
(SINGING) You told us we were losers
And we can't do nothing right
You said we'd never make it
But just look at us tonight
All over the place!
Exploded Diper
In your face
Exploded Diper
We can't be stopped
Exploded Diper
Your head is gonna pop
Exploded Diper
You can't keep us down
We're gonna hit the fan
And rock this sleepy town
[BEN]: Get up, all you haters!
Dude, they love us!
No hard feelings, right, bro?
Hey, Bill, you know what?
When we're done tonight, you're out of the band.
What?
That's rock and roll, bro.
[BOY SINGING]: Löded...
[BOY 2 SINGING]: Diper...
Löded...
Diper...
Löded...
Diper
Come here. Look.
Dad? Are we gonna tell them... that the audience went crazy for Mom's weird dancing?
He's happy.
She's happy.
I say we keep this one between the two of us, okay?
Exploded Diper
It's us, the Diper
And yes, we rock
Exploded Diper
So, I just wanted to say that you getting Mom to let me play last night was really cool.
Yeah, well,
I kind of owed you.
Oh, and here.
The tape? You're giving it to me? Hey!
Don't make a big deal about it or I'll post it on YouTube, okay?
Now get out.
Doofus.
Okay.
Later.
Butt-brain!
You know, I guess having a big brother isn't all that bad.
Maybe we don't always get along, but I know he's gonna be there for me.
Hey, I just spilled grape juice on the couch and kind of blamed it on you.
Later.
I'll get him back.
Action!
Exploded Diper
All over the place!
Exploded Diper
[GREG]: Okay, it's uploaded.
In your face
Exploded Diper
[ROWLEY]: Holy cow.
This is huge! We're an Internet sensation!
[RODRICK]: Greg!
You are so dead!
Exploded Diper ö
Kevin: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS
WAS GONNA HAPPEN WITH MY LIFE.
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
[ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ]
Man: ELMO! ELMO!
ALL RIGHT ALREADY!
YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY!
Kevin: HE HAS BEEN
SO UNBELIEVABLY HUGE.
HI, EVERYBODY!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
LOOK AT ELMO, MOM.
 ELMO TO A 6-YEAR-OLD
 IS LIKE BRAD PITT.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ SQUEALS ]
ELMO IS JUST BUBBLY AND DANCING,
AND KEVIN COMES ALIVE
THROUGH ELMO.
Kevin: IT'S HARD WHEN
YOU ARE A PRIVATE PERSON.
IT'S VERY NERVE-RACKING
TO ACT AS MYSELF.
ABSOLUTELY HE IS MOST
COMFORTABLE IN HIS SKIN
WHEN HE IS ELMO.
Robinson: I'VE SEEN OUTTAKES...
CHEESE.
...STUPID. STOP IT!
...WHERE KEVIN WILL BE BITING
PEOPLE AND HITTING PEOPLE
AND BEING A LITTLE SON OF A GUN.
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?!
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?!
YES.
[ LAUGHS ]
ELMO!
WHAT?!
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ELMO?!
IT MAY BE PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME
TO SAY THAT THAT'S ELMO.
IT CERTAINLY IS KEVIN.
[ HORN HONKS ]
Cooney: IT'S AMAZING TO THINK
THAT THAT BIG A STAR IS NOT
RECOGNIZED IN THE STREET.
Kevin: WHEN I WAS 9 YEARS OLD,
IT WAS JUST A DREAM THAT I HAD.
"WOW, I WISH THAT I COULD WORK
WITH THE MUPPETS."
KEVIN'S A BRILLIANT PERFORMER,
BRILLIANT IN PART
BECAUSE OF THE SAME REASON
WE WERE ALL BRILLIANT.
IT'S BECAUSE OF JIM.
[ APPLAUSE ]
WHAT ABOUT JIM HENSON?
WHAT?
WHAT PART HAS HE EVER PLAYED
IN YOUR SUCCESS?
THIS IS TOO DEEP.
IT'S SORT OF --
IT'S SORT OF LIKE RELIGION.
IT'S LIKE ANOTHER BEING.
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
DEEP INSIDE OF YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Elmo: HELLO! [ LAUGHS ]
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
Robinson: WHEN A PUPPET IS TRUE
AND GOOD AND MEANINGFUL,
IT'S THE SOUL OF THE PUPPETEER
THAT YOU'RE SEEING.
THIS IS THE HOUSE.
BACK IN THOSE WINDOWS,
NENE, PAM, GEORGIE, AND I --
WE ALL LIVED IN THAT ROOM
RIGHT BACK THERE.
TURNERS STATION -- THEY CALLED
IT "CHOCOLATE CITY."
IT WAS AWAY FROM BALTIMORE CITY,
DOWN IN THE COUNTY.
IT WAS A SMALL COMMUNITY,
SO EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER.
AND SEE?
ALL THIS WATER BACK HERE
CONNECTS TO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY.
AND RAYMOND METAL'S
WHERE MY FATHER WORKED,
JUST OVER ACROSS THE WATER.
SEE, ONCE THEY BUILT
ALL THESE FACTORIES BACK HERE,
THE WATER BECAME POLLUTED,
AND SO INSTEAD OF BEACH,
IT WAS ALL JUST DEAD FISH
AND CRABS AND EVERYTHING,
AND IT JUST STUNK LIKE CRAZY.
YOU KNOW, I JUST LOVED WATCHING
"THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY."
I REMEMBER TINKER BELL
WOULD HIT,
AND THEN IT WOULD GO
INTO THIS WONDERFUL WORLD.
AND I WANTED TO LIVE
AT DISNEY WORLD.
I TOOK CONSTRUCTION PAPER
AND WROTE "I WANT TO GO
TO DISNEY WORLD.
I WANT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD.
I WANT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD."
I PUT A CARD IN OUR BEDROOM,
IN MY MOM AND DAD'S BEDROOM,
IN THE KITCHEN,
IN THE LIVING ROOM,
ANYWHERE THAT ANYBODY WOULD
STEP FOOT, IN THE BATHROOM,
THINKING THAT
THAT WOULD GET ME THERE.
IT DIDN'T.
WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE MONEY
TO DO THAT.
Narrator: KEVIN LOVED
WATCHING TELEVISION,
ESPECIALLY THE SHOW
THAT CAME ON EVERY WEEKDAY
AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING,
"CAPTAIN KANGAROO."
[ "PUFFIN' BILLY" PLAYS ]
Kevin:
"CAPTAIN" WAS A MAGICAL PLACE,
AS OPPOSED TO...THE TYPE
OF PLACE THAT I LIVED
AND THE TYPE OF PEOPLE
THAT I SAW.
Narrator: ON THE MORNING
OF NOVEMBER 10, 1969,
THE FLEDGLING
PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM
AIRED A NEW EXPERIMENTAL
PROGRAM.
* SUNNY DAYS
SWEEPIN' THE CLOUDS AWAY *
* ON MY WAY
TO WHERE THE AIR IS SWEET *
* CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET,
HOW TO GET TO SESAME STREET? *
SALLY, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
A STREET LIKE SESAME STREET.
EVERYTHING HAPPENS HERE.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
Kevin: JUST AS SOON
AS IT CAME ON, I WAS GLUED.
THAT WAS IT.
IT WAS MORE LIKE
MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
THERE WAS BLACKS AND WHITES
AND ASIANS AND LATINOS.
HI, MR. HOOPER.
* BA-DUMP-A-DUMP-A-DUMP *
* DEE-DEE-DOO-DEE-DOO *
Kevin: THEN I SAW THE MUPPETS.
HEY, ERNIE, ERNIE,
HEY, THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.
LOOK AT ALL THE DECORATIONS.
YEAH. DOESN'T IT
LOOK NICE, BERT?
YEAH. WHAT ARE THE DECORATIONS
FOR, ERNIE?
ERNIE LOOKED RIGHT IN THE CAMERA
AND SAID, "HEY, BERT, COME HERE.
THERE'S SOMEONE SPECIAL
I WANT YOU TO MEET."
A SPECIAL VISITOR?
YEP. YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO IT IS?
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHO IS IT? WHERE?
OKAY, WELL, IT'S
A VERY SPECIAL VISITOR.
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE DECORATED
THE WHOLE PLACE UP.
YEAH?
TAKE A LOOK.
WHERE?
LOOK RIGHT -- LOOK RIGHT
IN THERE, BERT.
IN THERE?
SEE RIGHT IN THERE?
YEAH, LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER.
SEE WHO IT IS?
YEAH.
SEE? SEE, BERT?
OH, YEAH. W-WELL, HI.
"WHAT? WHO, ME?
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME?"
BOY, I SURE AM GLAD
IT'S YOU.
UNBELIEVABLE.
I MEAN, I WAS JUST MAGNETIZED
TO THESE CHARACTERS --
BIG BIRD...
OSCAR...
AND MY FAVORITE, GROVER.
AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW.
HOW ARE THOSE PUPPETS MADE?
WELL, HOW DO THEY DO THAT?"
AND I THOUGHT,
"WELL, WHO IS DOING THIS?
WHO IS CREATING THIS?"
HELLO, THERE. MY NAME IS
JIM HENSON, AND I'M A PUPPETEER.
I'M CALLED A PUPPETEER
BECAUSE I WORK WITH PUPPETS.
THEN I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING
THAT JIM WAS DOING.
WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT TELL YOU
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW YOU GO ABOUT
MAKING VERY SIMPLE PUPPETS.
ANYTIME I HEARD OF A SPECIAL
THAT WAS COMING ON WITH JIM,
YOU KNOW,
OF COURSE I WOULD WATCH IT.
MAKE THE SOCK WORK
A LITTLE MORE.
I PUT A RUBBER BAND
AROUND THERE.
DOES THAT HURT?
[ Deep voice ] NO,
IT DOESN'T HURT AT ALL.
OF COURSE NOT.
THERE. NOW I CAN ALMOST
ALL THE WAY SEE IT.
SON OF A GUN.
"WOW. LOOK AT ALL OF THIS STUFF
THAT HE'S DOING."
THIS IS DON SAHLIN,
WHO IS OUR MUPPET BUILDER.
"WOULDN'T I LOVE
TO BE A PART OF THAT?"
THIS IS FRANK OZ.
HELLO.
HE'S A PUPPETEER, ALSO.
"THIS IS WHO
I WOULD LIKE TO BE."
TAKE OFF MY MUSTACHE.
AH! TAKE OFF MY BEARD.
OOH! THERE GOES MY NOSE.
AND THEN WE MOVE HIS EYES UP
ABOVE HERE.
Kevin: ONE DAY, I GOT THIS URGE.
I SAW MY DAD'S TRENCH COAT.
INSIDE,
THERE WAS THIS BLACK FUR.
I THOUGHT, "WOW, THAT WOULD MAKE
A GREAT MONKEY."
I JUST WENT OFF.
I WAS ENTRANCED.
I CUT IT UP, AND I MADE
THIS PUPPET CALLED MOANDY.
I PUT THE PUPPET
IN MY MOM AND DAD'S DRESSER.
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED
GETTING REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD DO TO ME,
SO I HID.
WHEN I HEARD MY NAME, I WAS
LIKE, "OH, NO. HERE IT COMES."
HE SAID, "WHAT'S HIS NAME?"
AND I SAID "MOANDY."
THE NEXT THING HE SAID WAS,
"NEXT TIME, JUST ASK."
I WAS LIKE, "PHEW!"
Gladys: I WAS SO THRILLED
WITH WHAT HE DID.
FORGET THE COAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
KEVIN GONNA MAKE MONEY.
HE CAN BUY HIM ANOTHER COAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
KEVIN GONNA BUY HIM
ANOTHER COAT.
I WAS SO THRILLED, I HAD --
THAT COAT --
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED.
I WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED.
Kevin: MY MOM HAD
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF KIDS
THAT SHE WAS BABYSITTING.
MY FATHER HELPED ME BUILD
A PUPPET STAGE,
SO I WOULD SET THAT UP
IN THE BACKYARD,
AND THEN THE KIDS
THAT MY MOM WOULD WATCH,
AND THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WOULD COME AND WATCH THE SHOW.
THIS IS WHERE -- WE KEPT --
MY MOM WOULD PUT THE CLOTHES AT,
CLOTHESLINE AT,
AND THAT WAS WHERE I HAD
MY FIRST PUPPET SHOW.
I WOULD THROW THE BLANKET
OVER THIS,
AND THEN MY MOM'S DAYCARE KIDS
WOULD COME OUT HERE
AND WATCH ME DO THE SHOW.
I STARTED DOING LIVE SHOWS
AROUND THE BALTIMORE AREA.
Narrator: HE HELD A BENEFIT
FOR A CHILD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHO HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED
IN AN ACCIDENT.
AT A LOCAL CLINIC, HE PERFORMED
FOR CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND.
AND HE SOON DISCOVERED
HE HAD A GIFT
FOR BRINGING SMILES TO THE FACES
OF CHILDREN WHO NEEDED IT MOST.
SO, ARE YOU READY FOR A SHOW?
YEAH.
YEAH.YEAH.
I SAID,
"ARE YOU READY FOR A SHOW?"
YEAH!
YEAH!YEAH!
Kevin: NORMALLY,
I'D GO TO VARIOUS SCHOOLS
ALL AROUND THE BALTIMORE AREA,
AND THIS ONE
WAS A HANDICAPPED SCHOOL.
THEY'RE A REALLY PLEASING
AUDIENCE.
THEY TEND TO REALLY ENJOY THE
THINGS THAT I'M PUTTING TO THEM.
Puppet: MS. CICELY!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
COME OVER HERE, STEVEN.
COME ON.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
COME ON, COME ON.
OOH!
YOU LIKE ME?
YES.
I LIKE YOU, TOO.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
WHY?
I SEEN YOU BEFORE.
YOU SEEN ME BEFORE?
I'M TALKING TO YOU,
NOT HIM.
OH!
YOU TALKING TO THE PERSON
THAT'S WORKING ME, HUH?
YEAH. YOUR VOICE
IS COMING THROUGH HIM.
FROM WHERE?
YEAH.
OH!
DO YOU REALLY LIKE ME?
YEAH.
GIVE ME A HUG.
I SEEN YOU BEFORE.
OH. BUT GIVE ME A HUG.
Kevin:
WHEN I SEE SOMEONE LIKE STEVEN
LAUGHING AT THE CHARACTER
THAT I MADE,
IT REALLY GIVES ME
A GOOD FEELING
AND MAKES ME FEEL TERRIFIC.
I GOT TO GO, OKAY?
BUT I'LL BE BACK.
OKAY.
OKAY, BYE.
BYE.
BYE.
Narrator: BUT TO SOME PEOPLE,
KEVIN'S WORK
DIDN'T SEEM SO SPECIAL.
I LOVED BARBIES,
AND I FELT LIKE MY MOM
DIDN'T TREAT MY BARBIES
LIKE SHE DID HIS PUPPETS.
GEORGE AND ANITA,
THEY WOULD THROW THEM AROUND.
Kevin: SHE THREW ALL MY PUPPETS
OUT THE WINDOW,
SO I THREW ALL OF HER COSMETICS
OUT THE WINDOW.
AND THERE HAPPENED TO BE
SNOW OUTSIDE.
AND THERE WAS STARTING TO BE
SOME CRITICISM
FROM KIDS TEASING ME IN SCHOOL.
HE HAD GUYS THAT WOULD PICK
ON HIM,
SAID HE WAS PLAYING
WITH DOLLS.
Anita: SOME ADULTS
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND,
"WELL, WHY ISN'T HE PLAYING
BASKETBALL OUT?"
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID, "WELL,
HE SHOULD BE PLAYING OUTSIDE."
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
I KNEW IT WAS A TALENT HE HAD,
AND HE LOVED IT.
George Jr.:
HE FACED A LOT OF OPPOSITION,
BUT HE JUST STUCK
WITH HIS DREAM,
AND HE WENT FOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT
HE TRULY BELIEVED IN HIS HEART.
Narrator: WHILE PERFORMING
AT A NEARBY COUNTY FAIR,
KEVIN WAS SPOTTED
BY A LOCAL TELEVISION
PERSONALITY, STU KERR,
WHO SUGGESTED THAT HE COME UP
TO CHANNEL 2
AND TRY OUT
FOR A NEW CHILDREN'S PROGRAM.
ON THE DAY OF THE AUDITION,
THE CLASH HOUSEHOLD WAS BUSTLING
WITH ACTIVITY.
I GOT KEVIN FIXED UP
IN HIS ROOM.
WE GOT HIM
THIS LITTLE CORDUROY --
THEY WERE WEARING THESE HIPSTER
JACKETS WITH THE PANTS.
IT WAS BEIGE CORDUROY,
A DARK-BROWN TURTLENECK,
AND I GOT HIM DARK-BROWN
HUSH PUPPIES.
Narrator: BALTIMORE'S CHANNEL 2
IS ONE OF THE OLDEST TELEVISION
STATIONS ON THE EAST COAST.
FROM HERE, STU KERR'S PROGRAMS
WERE BEAMED TO THOUSANDS
OF CHILDREN EVERY AFTERNOON.
KEVIN WAS AUDITIONING FOR A NEW
SHOW THAT STU WAS CREATING
CALLED "CABOOSE."
Kevin: THIS WAS MY FIRST
TELEVISION STUDIO.
I SAW CAMERAS, AND THERE
WAS A STAGE, YOU KNOW,
WITH ALL THESE LIGHTS.
RECORD.
I WAS STILL VERY SHY
AT THE TIME.
FADE UP EFFECTS.
CUE STU.
IT WAS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE.
[ MUMBLES ]
OH, HI.
WE'RE JUST, UH -- WE'RE JUST
CHECKING OFF THE LIST HERE
OF THE THINGS
THAT I'D BETTER PACK.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
JUST WANTED TO GET UP THERE
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
HA! WE'RE GOING
ON A P-I-C-N-I-K-I-N-I.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
YOU GOT THE HOT DOGS.
HOT DOGS! CHECK!
MAYONNAISE! CHECK!
Kevin:
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT WAS FINE.
LET'S TRY ONE MORE TAKE.
STU SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA
DO THIS WITH ME."
I REMEMBER
THIS TINGLING SENSATION.
Puppet: YEAH!
[ LAUGHS ]
Kevin:
"I'M GONNA GET TO DO THIS."
RIGHT NOW I HAVE 85 PUPPETS.
THE WAY I GET MY IDEAS
FOR MY PUPPETS
IS THEY'LL JUST COME UP
IN MY HEAD,
AND THEN I'LL TRY
DIFFERENT VOICES
AND PRACTICE AND PRACTICE
UNTIL I GET IT.
[ Kid's voice ] HI.
[ Normal voice ] HI.
[ High-pitched voice ] HI.
[ Excited voice ] HI.
[ Deep voice ] HI. HOW YA DOING?
Ziemann: HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
[ High-pitched voice ]
HI. MY NAME IS PUCKY.
HOW MANY KIDS WENT OUT
AND BUILT THEIR OWN PUPPETS,
NOT JUST A HAND PUPPET, BUT
A COMPLETE MUPPET THAT WORKED?
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS HAD
WHAT I CALL CENTRAL CASTING
OF PUPPETS.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW, AND YOU WOULD
MAKE THE PUPPETS
LOOK LIKE THE CREW MEMBERS.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU MADE ONE
THAT LOOKED LIKE ME.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY GOODNESS!
[ LAUGHS ]
LOOK AT THAT NOSE.
LOOK AT THAT NOSE.
THE NOSE, THE NOSE.
LOOK AT THAT NOSE.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.
LOOK AT THAT PROFILE.
YEAH, YEAH.
AND YOU KEPT THIS.
AND SEE...
OH, MY GOODNESS.
I USED TO SEW
THESE MOUTHS IN.
SEE? I USED
THE WRONG COLOR.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACH.
BUT THREAD COST A LOT
BACK THEN.
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
LOOK AT THE STITCHES. BOY.
I'M GLAD I'M BETTER NOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
Narrator: EVERY SATURDAY
AT 12:30 IN THE AFTERNOON,
TELEVISIONS
IN KEVIN'S NEIGHBORHOOD
WOULD TUNE TO CHANNEL 2.
THOSE SAME KIDS IN SCHOOL
WERE COMING UP AND SAYING,
"SO, HOW'S STU KERR?"
IT WASN'T ABOUT
"YOU SLEEP WITH YOUR PUPPETS."
Narrator: THAT YEAR,
THE DUNDALK SENIOR-HIGH YEARBOOK
FEATURED
A SURPRISING PHOTOGRAPH.
Gladys: THEY GOT HIM STANDING
BY A ROLLS-ROYCE, RIGHT,
AND HE'S GOT A CASHMERE
BLACK COAT ON
AND A CAP AND SUNGLASSES,
AND THEY GOT HIM THE MOST
LIKELY...TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.
Narrator: FOR KEVIN,
TELEVISION WAS NO LONGER
JUST ENTERTAINMENT.
IT WAS RESEARCH.
Kevin:
IF I COULD HAVE CLIMBED IN,
ACTUALLY BE ON THE SET
OF "SESAME STREET,"
I WOULD HAVE TRIED IT.
Narrator: IN 1976,
HENSON BROUGHT HIS MUPPETS
TO PRIME TIME
WITH "THE MUPPET SHOW."
Kevin: OF COURSE, I WAS THE
CLOSEST ONE TO THE TV WATCHING.
Narrator: BROADCAST
IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES,
IT BECAME THE MOST POPULAR
TELEVISION SHOW IN THE WORLD.
THEY COULD DO NO WRONG.
THEY JUST COULDN'T.
I MEAN, ANYTHING THAT JIM
TOUCHED TURNED TO GOLD.
Narrator: HENSON'S CLOSEST
PARTNER WAS FRANK OZ.
Kevin: IT WAS AMAZING TO ME
TO WATCH JIM AND FRANK PERFORM
ERNIE AND BERT IN THE MORNING
AND THEN WATCH THEM PERFORM
KERMIT AND MISS PIGGY AT NIGHT.
NOW I'M GLUED TO THE TELEVISION
TRYING TO FIND OUT
HOW THOSE PUPPETS WERE BUILT.
I WAS STILL PRAYING
THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'LL LEARN HOW TO MAKE A PUPPET
LIKE THE MUPPETS.
I STILL DIDN'T HAVE IT
JUST RIGHT.
YOU SAW THE SEAMS.
YOU KNOW, AND WITH THE MUPPETS,
YOU NEVER SAW THE SEAMS.
IT STUMPED ME.
MY MOM WOULD SAY,
"YOU KNOW, LISTEN.
YOU HAVE GOT TO MOVE BACK.
YOU'RE GONNA GO BLIND."
[ FUNKY MUSIC PLAYS ]
Narrator:
ON TELEVISION ONE AFTERNOON,
KEVIN CAME ACROSS A PROGRAM
ABOUT A MAN WHO DESIGNED
MANY OF JIM HENSON'S
MOST FAMOUS PUPPETS.
HIS NAME WAS KERMIT LOVE, SEEN
HERE ON "THE DICK CAVETT SHOW."
[ APPLAUSE ]
KERMIT HAS DONE
ALL OF OUR BIG CHARACTERS.
HE DID THE BODY OF BIG BIRD
AND THOG
AND THE GREAT BIG
FEATHER GUY HERE,
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,
A GREAT ENGINEERING THING.
DID ANY OF THIS -- DID YOU HAVE
TO STUDY ENGINEERING
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS?
NO.
WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND?
JUST HAVE TO STUDY
JIM'S CONCEPTS.
YOU DO?
IT'S AN AMAZING THING.
WELL, IT WAS GREAT FUN.
Kevin: I WAS SO INSPIRED,
I SAID TO MY MOM,
YOU KNOW, AFTER IT WENT OFF,
"I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO TRY
TO GET AHOLD OF KERMIT LOVE."
MY MOM DIALING THE PHONE, I
MEAN, WHICH WAS AMAZING TO ME.
Gladys: I CALLED KERMIT.
"HELLO." HE SAID, "WHO IS THIS
THAT'S SO ANXIOUS TO MEET ME?"
I SAID, "WELL, IT'S MY SON."
I SAID, "HE'S INTO PUPPETRY,"
AND I SAID, "HE WOULD LOVE
TO MEET YOU."
Kevin: LO AND BEHOLD, HE SAID,
"WHENEVER WE'RE IN TOWN,
COME AND VISIT."
Narrator: KEVIN'S FAMILY
COULDN'T AFFORD
TO SEND HIM AWAY,
BUT IN HIS SENIOR YEAR,
AN OPPORTUNITY CAME UP.
HIS CLASS WAS TAKING A TRIP
TO NEW YORK CITY.
Kevin:
I REMEMBER GETTING ON THE TRAIN,
SO EXCITED, I WAS HUMMING
"NEW YORK, NEW YORK" THEME,
WATCHING THE SKYLINE GETTING
CLOSER AND CLOSER.
MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS
"MAN, IT'S REALLY ENORMOUS."
[ SIREN WAILING, HORN HONKS ]
ALL OF US JUST LOSING OUR MINDS.
NOW I'M BREAKING AWAY FROM THEM
TO GO TO KERMIT'S WORKSHOP
BY MYSELF.
I WAS TAKING THE SUBWAY.
TO ACTUALLY GO ALONE
WAS NERVE-RACKING.
BOY, I'LL TELL YOU,
ON THE SUBWAY,
JUST THINKING OF ALL THE THINGS
I MIGHT GET TO SEE --
"WHAT ARE THEY WORKING ON
RIGHT NOW?
"MAYBE I'LL GET TO LEARN THOSE
SECRETS THAT I COULDN'T FIND OUT
THROUGH WATCHING THE SHOW."
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
STANDING AT GREAT JONES
AND BUZZING THE BUZZER,
AND THEN HERE IS KERMIT LOVE,
WHO LOOKS LIKE SANTA CLAUS.
KEVIN! GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW YOU DOING, KERMIT?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
MADE IT ALL THE WAY UP
FROM BALTIMORE, HEY?
"KEV FROM BALTIMORE," HE SAID,
"COME ON IN!"
WHO IS THIS?
OH, THIS IS PUCKY.
PUCKY?
YEAH.
OH. LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN AROUND
THE RINK A COUPLE OF TIMES.
KERMIT JUST TOOK ME IN LIKE
HE KNEW ME FOR A LONG TIME,
AND HE SHOWED ME EVERYTHING
HE KNEW.
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
OKAY.
AND LET'S GO IN.
HE TOOK ME AROUND, AND ALL THIS
MAGIC WAS HAPPENING THERE.
I MET THESE TALENTED BUILDERS
THAT HE HAD AT HIS SHOP,
AND I COULD ASK THEM A QUESTION
ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
"WHERE DO THEY GET THE EYES?
"YOU KNOW, DO THEY MAKE THEM
FROM SCRATCH?
"CAN YOU BUY?
"YOU KNOW, THE COLORS
ARE SO BRILLIANT, THE FUR.
"I CAN'T GET THAT TYPE OF FUR
IN BALTIMORE.
WHERE DO YOU GET THAT?"
I MEAN, ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO FINALLY
GETTING THEM ANSWERED.
THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS SO COOL.
NOW I GET TO GO
TO THE MUPPET WORKSHOP,
WHERE THEY BUILD
ALL OF THE OTHER "SESAME STREET"
CHARACTERS.
EVERYTHING IS
AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
FUR OVER HERE
AND FOAM OVER THERE.
EYES.
YOU PULL OUT
THESE LONG, BIG DRAWERS,
AND IN THERE COULD BE
DIFFERENT TYPES OF EYES,
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF EYES WITH
LIDS, NO LIDS, THE EYELASHES,
YOU KNOW, SMALL PUPILS,
BIG PUPILS.
THEN YOU CAN OPEN
ANOTHER DRAWER,
AND IT'S DIFFERENT-SIZED NOSES
AND DIFFERENT-COLOR NOSES.
AND THE SAME THING
WITH HAIR, TEETH.
[ LAUGHS ]
Man: MUSTACHES,
BEARDS, GOATEES.
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE'S ONE.
THAT'S A GREAT ONE.
IT WAS JUST AMAZING.
I KNEW WHEN I GOT IN THERE
THAT THIS IS THE TYPE OF
WORKSHOP I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
OH, IT'S WONDERFUL, ROLLIE.
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE
AT THE SHOP WHEN ROLLIE,
WHO IS A PHENOMENAL BUILDER --
SHE'S BEEN THERE FROM THE
BEGINNING OF "THE MUPPET SHOW."
SEE? I'M GETTING
RED RIGHT THERE.
OH, YEAH. OKAY, SURE.
YEAH. I CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF FLEECE, YEAH.
FLEECE OR SOMETHING, YEAH.
AND THEN IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST --
OH.
OH, I SAW HER BUILDING
NEW ERNIE AND BERTS.
ROLLIE WAS A GENIUS AT IT.
ERNIE HAS A TUBE.
MM-HMM.
AND WHAT'S THAT?
COFFEE CAN.
YEAH. COFFEE CAN?
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?!
YEAH!
THAT'S WHY I'M FEELING
THE RIDGES.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
IN KERMIT'S SHOP SO LONG AGO...
[ GROANS ]
BOY, YOU REALLY PUT IT IN
TO STAY, DIDN'T YOU?
...HE EXPLAINED TO ME HOW THINGS
WORK, HOW PUPPETS WORK,
HOW MUPPETS WORK.
GOOD, GOOD.
YEAH, I THOUGHT...
BUT LOOK. NOW WE HAVE
A MOUTH THAT WORKS.
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SIT THERE,
AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME
HOW YOU CAN DO THE SEAM
WHERE YOU DON'T SEE IT.
IT WAS A TYPE OF MATERIAL
THAT THEY WERE USING
THAT I COULDN'T GET IN BALTIMORE
CALLED FLEECE
THAT ACTUALLY WAS MADE
FOR THE ARMY.
WE COVER IT WITH THIS FLEECING
THAT IS A MARVELOUS MATERIAL,
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEW
IN RATHER INTERESTING SEAMS
THAT DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY.
Henson: THIS IS A KIND
OF FABRIC THEY USE
USUALLY TO MAKE THINGS
LIKE BLANKETS AND SO FORTH.
WE USE IT BECAUSE
WHEN YOU MAKE A SEAM --
THAT MEANS WHEN YOU SEW
TWO PIECES TOGETHER --
NOW, HERE'S A PUPPET
RIGHT HERE
THAT'S BEEN SEAMED
RIGHT UP THE FRONT.
YOU SEE? YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT
ON TELEVISION,
BUT THAT'S A SEAM
RIGHT THERE.
THERE'S ANOTHER SEAM
RIGHT UNDER THE JAW
THAT GOES STRAIGHT DOWN
THROUGH THERE.
I CALL THAT THE HENSON STITCH,
'CAUSE JIM DEVELOPED IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT JIM HENSON STITCH.
I FOUND OUT THAT THROUGH KERMIT.
I'M 17 NOW.
IT TOOK ME I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
YEARS TO FIND THAT OUT,
BUT IT WAS WONDERFUL
TO FIND OUT.
I THINK WE OUGHT TO GIVE HER
SOME PUPILS.
THE FOCUS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
QUITE RIGHT.
HE WAS REALLY...A WONDERFUL
GRANDFATHER FIGURE.
NOW PUT YOUR HAND IN
AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
[ Woman's voice ] HELLO!
AND NOW SHE'S TAKING ON
QUITE A -- SHE...
SHE.
...IS TAKING ON
QUITE A PERSONALITY.
KERMIT TOOK KEVIN MORE OR LESS
LIKE A MOTHER HEN,
YOU KNOW, HOW SHE KEEPS
THE BABIES UNDER HER WINGS.
HE JUST GATHERED KEVIN
RIGHT IN
AND TAUGHT HIM ALL THE THINGS
THAT HE NEEDED TO KNOW.
CICELY.
SING IT. SING IT OUT.
* CICELY *
MY NAME IS...
* MY NAME IS CICELY *
LOVELY.
LET ME SEE.
DO YOUR VOWELS
ONCE FOR ME.
A-U-E!
"U."
OOH!
OOH.
SHE'S LISTENING TO YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
NOW DO CICELY
AND PROJECT IT FORWARD.
* CIC-E-LY *
THERE, THAT'S IT.
AND UP.
* CICELY *
* CICELY *
[ SPEAKING FRENCH ]
NOW YOU'RE STIFFENING.
I CAN SEE YOU STIFFENING.
YES.
LOOSEN IT UP.
[ SPEAKS FRENCH ]
[ LAUGHS ]
[ SPEAKING FRENCH ]
REMEMBER, THE VOICE COMES
FROM BACK IN THE MOUTH.
Narrator: IN PARIS,
KEVIN IS TRAINING
THE CAST OF THE FRENCH VERSION
OF "SESAME STREET."
WELL, ANOTHER THING
THAT YOU SHOULD DO
WITH HER ALL THE TIME
IS GIVE HER A LITTLE SMILE.
SEE, IF YOU KEEP THAT MOUTH OPEN
JUST A LITTLE BIT,
THERE'S A LITTLE SMILE,
YOU KNOW?
YEAH.
AH.
IF YOU DO THAT,
THAT'S DEAD.
SHE'S TOO SERIOUS.
DEAD.
SHE'S NOT HAPPY.
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT'S...
THAT'S CURIOUS.
LISTENING, BUT STILL ALIVE.
IT LOOKS EASY,
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO MAKE A PIECE OF FABRIC
WITH A FOAM HEAD
REACT LIKE A HUMAN BEING WOULD.
BUT KEVIN -- OH, MY GOSH --
HE'S BRILLIANT AT MANIPULATION.
TRYING TO CREATE REALITY.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING
TO CREATE A HUMAN.
SO CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE DO
WILL MAKE IT LOOK HUMAN.
CERTAIN THINGS
THAT WE DO, YOU KNOW,
THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO
DOESN'T, YOU KNOW.
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T.
IT'S MORE -- YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE SHAKE OR WE LISTEN
TO EACH OTHER, SAY, "AH."
IT'S NOT...
I THINK EVEN
IF YOU CLOSE THE MOUTH,
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT THE PUPPET STAYS ALIVE.
IT CAN'T JUST SIT THERE.
IT HAS TO, YOU KNOW, LOOK
AROUND AND KEEP ALIVE.
[ SPEAKING FRENCH ]
CHRISTOPHE, WHEN YOU DO
A SCRATCH OF THE HEAD,
TO SHOW LESS ROD,
YOU BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN.
THAT'S IT. BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN
INTO THE FRAME.
THEN THERE'S LESS ROD.
OKAY.
HE'S ALWAYS PLAYING ON CAMERA.
HE'S ALWAYS SEEING
"HOW -- HOW ELSE --
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO
WITH THIS PUPPET?"
I THINK I WAS ON THE SET THE DAY
THAT KEVIN REALIZED
THAT IF HE PUSHED HIS HAND
IN A CERTAIN WAY
AND PUSHED DOWN
WITH HIS FINGERS,
HE COULD MAKE ELMO'S -- THE TOP
OF HIS HEAD KIND OF CAVE IN
SO IT LOOKED LIKE ELMO'S EYES
WERE LOOKING UP
IN A FUNNY DIRECTION.
WELL, THIS ONE IS DISGUSTING.
AND THIS ONE IS "ELMO'S HUNGRY."
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S THE BEGGING LOOK.
AND THIS ONE
IS WHEN ELMO'S CONFUSED.
"HUH? HUH?"
[ LAUGHS ]
Kevin: EVERYBODY UP.
SEE IT WITH THE MUSIC.
[ CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS ]
OKAY, STOP.
SEE? YOU'RE DOING THIS.
YOU'RE DOING THIS.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE FOCUS.
REMEMBER, WE DID THAT
IN REHEARSAL.
AND YOU'RE NOT DOING IT AS MUCH
WITH THE PUPPET.
EVERYBODY, JUST COME DOWN
AND WATCH MY HAND FOR A SECOND.
WATCH JUST HOW COMFORTABLE
IT LOOKS.
[ CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS ]
[ MUPPETS SINGING IN FRENCH ]
SEE? SEE HOW JUST COMFORTABLE
THAT IS?
FEEL IT.
IF HE COULD TAKE HIS TALENT
AND PUT IT IN YOUR ARM,
IT WOULD BE THE DREAM.
[ LAUGHS ]
Kevin: YOU TOOK THESE?
YES, YES, YES, YES.
WHERE?
IN NEW YORK?
IN NEW YORK, YES.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
[ LAUGHS ]
THESE ARE WONDERFUL.
LOOK AT THAT.
AND DURING WHAT WAS
A SHOOT OF --
IT WAS A PHONE, BUT --
HAD TO USE IT.
IT WAS ON JULY
OR AUGUST '69.
THAT WAS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING
OF "SESAME STREET."
I WAS 9.
WHEN DID YOU START?
I WAS 9.
[ LAUGHS ]
ONLY ONE TO GET THIS PICTURE.
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I MET JIM HENSON.
THAT WAS THE YEAR
THAT THE MUPPET MOVIE CAME OUT.
JIM PUT THE BUS
FROM THE MUPPET MOVIE
IN THE MACY'S
THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE,
AND THAT MEANT
THAT JIM AND FRANK
WOULD BE ON THE BUS
FOR THE MUPPET MOVIE,
SO THEY NEEDED EXTRA PUPPETEERS
FOR THE "SESAME STREET" FLOAT.
KERMIT ASKED ME
WOULD I LIKE TO BE ON IT.
I JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.
IT JUST BLEW ME AWAY.
I WAS SO EXCITED.
Narrator: KEVIN WAS GIVEN
ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED
AND SILLIEST OF MUPPETS --
COOKIE MONSTER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Kevin: THE "SESAME STREET" THEME
STARTED,
AND I HEARD A MAN YELL OUT,
"'SESAME STREET,'
JOIN THE PARADE!"
THE FLOAT STARTED TO MOVE,
AND EVERYBODY CHEERED.
KERMIT TOLD US, "OKAY, YOU CAN
PEEK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE."
AND, MAN, I HAD NO IDEA.
PEOPLE AND MORE PEOPLE
AND MORE PEOPLE.
IT IS MIND-BOGGLING.
NOW I'M ON THIS FLOAT,
AND I HAVE ONE OF THE MUPPETS,
THE "SESAME STREET" MUPPETS,
ON MY HAND,
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK
AT IT TO SEE HOW THEY BUILT IT
FOR SO MANY YEARS.
OF COURSE, I TURNED IT
INSIDE-OUT AND LOOKED IN IT,
AND I SAW
THAT JIM HENSON STITCH.
AND THEN
AFTER THE PARADE IS OVER,
EVERYBODY GETS TO GO
INSIDE OF MACY'S,
AND THEY HAVE A BIG PARTY.
ALL THE CELEBRITIES GO UP THERE.
I WAS JUST THIS KID, AND I WAS,
LIKE, TAKING IT ALL IN.
AND THERE, ACROSS A CROWDED
ROOM, WAS JIM HENSON.
THAT SHYNESS CAME BACK,
SO I WENT TO USE THE BATHROOM.
AND LO AND BEHOLD,
ONE OF THE MAIN MUPPETEERS,
RICHARD HUNT, WAS THERE.
AND HE SAID, "SO, YOU'RE HERE.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WORKING
WITH KERMIT?"
I SAID, "YEAH."
HE SAID, "LISTEN.
"YOU KNOW, JIM DOESN'T HAVE
ANY BLACK PUPPETEERS,
SO YOU NEED TO GO OUT THERE
AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU DO."
SO I CAME OUT OF THE BATHROOM,
SHAKING.
KERMIT TOLD ME TO COME OVER,
'CAUSE HE WAS TALKING TO JIM.
IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
MEETING SOMEBODY
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO MEET
AND NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D GET THE CHANCE TO.
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
ANY EYE CONTACT,
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING
TO BE, YOU KNOW, AS...
I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE
WITH JIM
AS MUCH AS RICHARD TOLD ME TO,
BUT IT'S NOT IN MY NATURE.
SO FORTUNATELY KERMIT WAS THERE
TO HELP ME THROUGH.
HE SAID, "LISTEN, JIM,
THIS IS KEVIN CLASH."
AND JIM LOOKED AT ME AND SAID,
"CAN YOU STAY UP NEXT DAY?"
IT WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOODNESS.
THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE,"
KNOWING THAT I COULDN'T.
BEFORE I COULD SAY YES,
KERMIT SAID,
"NO, KEVIN HAS TWO SHOWS
LOCALLY IN BALTIMORE
"THAT HE HAS TO GET BACK TO, BUT
HE COULD SET UP AN APPOINTMENT,
OR HE COULD SEND YOU SOMETHING."
AND JIM SAID, "OKAY. WELL, YOU
KNOW, CAN YOU SEND ME A TAPE?
YOU KNOW, AND WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM THERE."
AND BEFORE I COULD SAY YES
[LAUGHS]
KERMIT SAID, "YES, HE WILL."
SO I WENT BACK DOWN
TO BALTIMORE,
AND I'M SO EXCITED, I RAN HOME.
MY MOM AND DAD WAS
IN THE KITCHEN.
I WENT TO THEM, AND I SAID,
"GUESS WHAT?
I FINALLY MET JIM --
JIM HENSON."
Narrator: KERMIT WASN'T THE ONLY
ONE BRAGGING ABOUT KEVIN.
STU KERR COULDN'T HELP BUT
TELL HIS OLD FRIEND BOB KEESHAN
ABOUT THE AMAZING
YOUNG PUPPETEER
HE DISCOVERED IN BALTIMORE.
OH, DID I MENTION
THAT BOB KEESHAN
IS ALSO KNOWN
AS CAPTAIN KANGAROO?
Ziemann:
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, STU SAYS,
"WE NEED TO SET UP THE STUDIO
FOR AN AUDITION TAPE."
I SAID, "FOR WHO?"
HE SAID, "KEVIN."
AND I JUST LOOKED AT HIM.
HE GOES, "DON'T START.
JUST DON'T START."
Kerr: THIS IS AN AUDITION
FOR "CAPTAIN KANGAROO."
COULD WE HAVE THE FIRST
CONTESTANT, PLEASE?
Narrator: FOR 18-YEAR-OLD KEVIN,
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
RECORDING OF HIS LIFE.
NO. HAVE YOU BEEN ON --
HAVE YOU BEEN
ON TELEVISION BEFORE?
UH, NO, NOT REALLY, NO.
Kevin: STU WAS OFF-CAMERA,
ASKING MY PUPPETS QUESTIONS.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
COULD YOU TURN
THIS WAY, PLEASE?
THAT'S IT.
OH! OH, THERE YOU ARE.
OH. HOW YOU --
GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN.
UH, NO, I'M NOT CAPTAIN.
I KNEW IF I LISTENED TO HIM, I'M
GONNA DO THE BEST THAT I CAN.
WHO'S NEXT, KEVIN?
Kevin: FIEFER.
LET'S SEE.
OOH, LOOK AT FIEFER.
HI, FIEF.
HEY, FIEF.
HI.
[ LAUGHS ]
DON'T BE AFRAID.
WHY? I DON'T LIKE CAMERAS.
OH, OH, LISTEN.
[ SIGHS ]
TELL US A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOURSELF, FIEFER.
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
ARE YOU?
WE KNOW
YOU'RE A LITTLE SHY.
YEAH.
WELL, UH, I'M A NICE PERSON.
OH, ARE YOU?
YEAH.
I AM KIND OF SHY, BUT SOMETIMES
I GET OVER IT, YOU KNOW?
WELL, IT'S OVER NOW.
YEAH.
I SAY THE AUDITION
IS OVER.
OH, OH, THE AUDITION IS OVER?
I THOUGHT --
I THOUGHT MY SHYNESS WAS --
NO, NO.
OH.
WELL, MAYBE THAT IS, TOO.
YOU CAN LEAVE, BY THE WAY.
OH, I CAN LEAVE?
YES.
OH, GREAT!
YEAH.
GOOD!
OKAY, BYE!
BYE.
PHEW!
I LOOKED AT STU, AND I SAID,
"HE'S GONE.
"HE'S GONE, AND YOU'RE TO BLAME,
AND I'M TO BLAME FOR SHOOTING
OUR BIG MOUTH OFF."
Kevin: I GOT A CALL
FROM CAPTAIN KANGAROO.
ONE OF THE PRODUCERS
AND THE HEAD WRITER
CAME DOWN FROM NEW YORK
TO BALTIMORE.
AT THE TIME
I BUILT ALL THESE PUPPETS,
I'D GOTTEN
THESE PLASTIC SHELVES,
AND ALL OF THEM WERE
IN MY MOM AND DAD'S BEDROOM,
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY SPACE.
AND SO ALL OF THESE PUPPETS WERE
ON THESE SHELVES.
AND THEN LITERALLY GOING
INTO MY MOM AND DAD'S BEDROOM,
PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH
PUPPETS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE
ON "CAPTAIN KANGAROO"
JUST SEEMED VERY SURREAL TO ME.
Narrator: KEVIN AND HIS PUPPETS
WERE MOVING TO NEW YORK CITY...
...BUT ONE PUPPET STAYED BEHIND.
THE DAY HE LEFT, HIS LAST SHOW,
HE CALLED ME OVER AND SAID,
"CAN I TALK TO YOU?"
I SAID, "SURE."
HE SAID,
"I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS."
HE PULLED THE PUPPET ZEE OUT,
AND HE SAID, "I WISH
I COULD GIVE YOU MORE."
I SAID, "KEVIN, YOU'VE GIVEN US
SO MUCH HERE AT CHANNEL 2."
HE SAID, "NO, I WISH
I COULD GIVE YOU MORE."
BUT I SAID, "YOU GO AND SOAR."
Gladys: YOU KNOW, KEVIN DIDN'T
REALLY HAVE AN IN BETWEEN.
HE JUMPED FROM HIGH SCHOOL
RIGHT TO NEW YORK.
Kevin: THEY PUT ME ON THE TRAIN.
THEY PUT ME
IN A REALLY NICE HOTEL
THAT WASN'T THAT FAR AWAY
FROM THE CBS STUDIOS.
I MEAN, IT WAS AMAZING.
THEY ACTUALLY ASKED ME
DID I WANT TO ACT ON IT.
WANT TO PLAY, HUH?
OH, I'M SORRY, SIRE,
BUT I MUST TAKE THE ROYAL
LAUNDRY TO THE ROYAL LAUNDRY.
BUT THE MONEY WAS RIDICULOUS,
'CAUSE IT WAS NETWORK.
Narrator:
AND IN ANOTHER STUDIO,
KERMIT LOVE WAS HELPING
CREATE A NEW SHOW
CALLED
"THE GREAT SPACE COASTER"
AND BROUGHT KEVIN ABOARD
FOR THE RIDE.
Kevin: AND THEN I GOT A CALL
FROM JIM HENSON.
HE ASKED ME
WOULD I BE INTERESTED
IN DOING THE MOVIE
"DARK CRYSTAL."
Narrator: HENSON WAS EMBARKING
ON THE MOST AMBITIOUS PRODUCTION
OF HIS LIFE.
COLLABORATING WITH THE RENOWNED
FANTASY ARTIST BRIAN FROUD,
HE WAS DESIGNING AN ENTIRELY
NEW WORLD OF IMAGINARY CREATURES
AND BUILDING THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED PUPPETS
EVER CREATED.
AND THIS WAS ANOTHER, YOU KNOW,
WHERE I WAS "YES!"
KERMIT WAS THERE AGAIN AND SAID,
"LISTEN, YOU HAVE TWO SERIES.
"NOW, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
"A MOVIE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF MONTHS, AND THEN THAT'S IT.
ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE UP
THOSE TWO SERIES FOR A MOVIE?"
FIRST THING I ASKED HIM
IS HOW MUCH IS HE OFFERING.
AND I WAS LIKE, "KERMIT, I DON'T
KNOW IF I CAN, YOU KNOW?"
SO I WENT IN TO MEET WITH JIM,
MY HEAD DOWN.
THIS WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.
JIM SAID, "YOU KNOW,
WELL, GIVE ME A MINUTE."
AND HE WENT OUT.
HE CAME BACK IN, AND HE SAID,
"WELL, YOU'LL GET THIS MUCH."
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW,
THE PROBLEM IS, JIM,
I HAVE TWO SERIES
THAT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP."
AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
WELL, I UNDERSTAND.
WE'LL THINK ABOUT CHECKING
YOU OUT THE NEXT TIME."
AND I REMEMBER
WALKING OUT OF THAT OFFICE.
OH, I LOST IT.
I WENT DOWN TO THE SHOP.
THE BUILDERS WERE MAKING
THREE-DIMENSIONAL
PUPPET VERSIONS
OF ALL THE BRIAN FROUD DESIGNS.
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT
I WAS SAYING TO JIM HENSON
"NO, I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS PROJECT."
WOW.
Narrator: KEVIN STAYED
BY THE SIDE OF THE CAPTAIN.
BUT AS 1984 BEGAN,
BOB KEESHAN'S LEGENDARY SHOW
WAS IN BIG TROUBLE.
Kevin: IT WAS THE 29th SEASON,
AND IT WAS ON LIKE 7:00 A.M.
IN THE MORNING.
NOBODY WAS WATCHING.
AND THEN "CAPTAIN KANGAROO"
WAS CANCELED.
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,
NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
I HAVE ONE LEFT."
AND THEN THE PRODUCERS DECIDED
TO STOP "GREAT SPACE COASTER."
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
AND THEN, LO AND BEHOLD,
JIM HENSON ASKED ME
TO DO "LABYRINTH."
AND I SAID, "YES!"
Narrator:
KEVIN WAS FLOWN OFF TO LONDON.
NOW 25 YEARS OLD, KEVIN
HAD FINALLY NAVIGATED HIS WAY
INTO THE WORKSHOP
OF THE MASTER PUPPETEER
HE HAD ADMIRED SINCE HE WAS 10.
KEVIN WAS GIVEN
A DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENT --
A COMPLICATED SCENE WITH FUNNY
DEMONS, CALLED THE FIREYS.
Kevin:
THERE WAS THIS ONE SEQUENCE
WHERE THE FIREY
POKES HIS EYES OUT,
PULLS THEM OUT, SHAKES THEM,
THROWS THEM,
AND SAYS, "SNAKE EYES."
AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO PULL THEM
UP, THROW THEM UP IN THE AIR,
SWALLOW THEM AGAIN, AND THEN
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE COMING BACK,
YOU KNOW, WHERE
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.
[ Laughing ] SO, WE WERE
ON OUR...28th TAKE
OF TRYING TO GET THIS.
I KNEW, YOU KNOW,
WE WERE IN TROUBLE,
SO I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD
TO GO OVER AND TELL JIM
THAT THE SHOT
WAS NOT GONNA WORK.
I WAS REALLY, REALLY CONCERNED
OF WHAT HE WOULD SAY,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT JIM.
I SAID, "JIM, YOU KNOW, THE
SHOT, YOU KNOW, WITH THE FIREYS
THROWING THEIR EYES UP
AND SWALLOWING IT --"
AS I'M SAYING THIS TO HIM,
HE HAS THIS CLOUD OVER HIS FACE
LIKE HE DOES NOT WANT
TO HEAR THIS AT ALL.
"I'M NOT HAVING IT.
YOU'RE GONNA GO,
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT SHOT."
SO AS I WAS SAYING, "YOU KNOW,
"THE WHOLE THROWING UP
AND THE SWALLOWING --
OKAY, WE'LL GET IT.
WE'LL DO IT."
[ LAUGHS ] HE SAID, "OH, GOOD."
ON THE 29th TAKE...WE GOT IT.
Narrator: HENSON HELD
A GLITTERING, RED-CARPET
PREMIERE IN LONDON.
THE CREATURES FROM THE MOVIE
WERE IN THE LOBBY
TO MEET
ALL THE CELEBRITY GUESTS,
EVEN PRINCE CHARLES AND DIANA.
Kevin: ALL OF US THAT WORKED ON
IT GOT TO GO TO THE PREMIERE
AND FINALLY SIT DOWN
AND SEE THE FINISHED PRODUCT.
THE MOVIE STARTS.
THE MUSIC IS BEAUTIFUL.
YOU KNOW, I SEE
THE COMPUTER-GENERATED OWL
FLYING PAST.
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MY NAME IS UP THERE.
THIS WAS MY FIRST MOVIE,
SO IT REALLY BLEW ME AWAY.
AND I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
THAT MY NAME WOULD BE THERE.
...WONDERFUL.
WELL, WE WISH YOU
ALL SUCCESS.
THE GENEROSITY OF JIM
WAS VERY HUMBLING
AND VERY EMOTIONAL FOR ME.
I'M NOW A PART
OF THE MUPPETEERS.
I GOT "SESAME STREET."
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A GROUP
OF PUPPETEERS TO COME IN
AND TAKE OVER IN CERTAIN WAYS...
...BECAUSE JIM
WAS NOW PURSUING MOVIES,
AND SO THAT'S HOW I GOT PULLED
IN, AND KERMIT FINALLY DID IT.
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I SEE THE STEPS.
IT'S THE STREET.
IT'S SESAME STREET.
THERE WERE PEOPLE
HUSTLING AND BUSTLING,
AND I SEE THESE PUPPETEERS
THAT I'VE TOTALLY ADMIRED
OVER THE YEARS.
THEY WERE ALL MY IDOLS --
JERRY NELSON...
RICHARD HUNT...
FRAN BRILL...
MARTY ROBINSON...
CAROLL SPINNEY.
BOY, I WAS A LITTLE FISH
IN A BIG POND.
I KNOW, I KNOW!
YOU WANTED TO BE A DAZZLEMO.
Narrator: ONE OF KEVIN'S FIRST
CHARACTERS WAS HOOTS THE OWL.
PLAY IT!
OH, NO CAN DO, SWEET ONE.
THIS IS THE KIND YOU SING.
HOOTS THE OWL
WAS WORKING OUT OKAY,
BUT I WASN'T DOING
ENOUGH OF HIM.
* THAT'S ALL *
THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CHARACTER
CALLED FERLINGHETTI DONIZETTI
THAT JUST...
LOOK AND BOOK,
STEW AND GLUE,
BIG AND FIG,
MAD AND GLAD...
THANK YOU,
FERLINGHETTI DONIZETTI!
...ELVIS AND PELVIS,
CAT AND HAT, BLUE AND FLEW...
AND NOBEL PRICE.
THIS IS A FLYING CUPCAKE!
[ EXPLOSION ]
AH! EUREKA!
[ LAUGHS, COUGHS ]
WOW!
OH, BOY.
I CAN'T STOP MOVING.
IF I STOP MOVING,
I-I'LL STOP JUGGLING.
I DID A CHARACTER
CALLED JUGGLES.
THE HANDS WERE DOING, YOU KNOW
[LAUGHS] TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THAN THE HEAD WAS DOING,
SO THAT FELL APART.
JUGGLING IS MY LIFE.
WELL, TO MAKE
THE PERFECT EMPLOYEE,
YOU MUST START
WITH THE PROPER RAW MATERIAL.
Narrator: KEVIN WAS GIVEN A SHOT
AT A TINY COMMERCIAL JOB
THAT HENSON WAS DOING
ON THE SIDE.
Kevin:
I HAD TO PERFORM THIS PUPPET
THAT WAS LIKE
THE ULTIMATE BUSINESSMAN.
NOW, THIS
IS OUR RAW MATERIAL.
YEAH. RIGHT HERE.
I WAS SANDWICHED
BETWEEN FRANK AND JIM.
OH, GOODNESS.
I WAS SO NERVOUS.
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NOT YET, NOT YET.
IT'S FRANK OZ AND JIM HENSON.
A PERFECT EMPLOYEE
MUST BE VERY SMART.
FRANK WAS TAKING OFF
THE FEATURES,
AND I WOULD HAVE TO
CHANGE THE VOICE.
[ Nasally voice ] HMM.
LET'S EXAMINE ALL ALTERNATE
MARKETING CHANNELS.
Kevin: I WANTED TO SHOW THEM
THAT I COULD DO THIS,
THAT HE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.
I LITERALLY HAD ONE PHRASE
THAT I HAD TO DO EACH TIME
THAT THEY CHANGED THE FACE,
BUT I JUST COULDN'T MEMORIZE IT
'CAUSE I WAS SO NERVOUS
WITH THEM ON BOTH SIDES OF ME.
AND SO I HAD
THIS LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER
THAT HAD THE PHRASE ON IT.
[ Authoritative voice ]
LET'S PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO THE BOTTOM LINE.
STICK TO YOUR BUDGETS.
AND THEN JIM SAID TO ME,
"YOU CAN'T MEMORIZE THAT?"
OH...
[ LAUGHS ]
I TELL YOU, I SHRUNK
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.
I WAS LIKE INSIDE OF THE PUPPET.
Man: STAND BY. REHEARSAL.
AND COUNTDOWN, PLEASE.
Narrator:
ON THE "SESAME STREET" SET,
VETERAN MUPPETEER RICHARD HUNT
WAS PERFORMING A LITTLE-KNOWN
AND RARELY USED MUPPET.
[ DRUMS BEATING ]
Bob: NO PEEK -- NO PEEKING.
[ EXPLOSION ]
OH.
WHAT'S THAT?
[ GASPS ]
BROKE BALLOON.
ELMO...
[ Deep voice ] UH-OH.
ELMO SQUEAK BALLOON TOO HARD.
[ LAUGHS ]
Kevin: AT THE BEGINNING, ELMO
HAD KIND OF CAVEMAN-TYPE TALK.
ELMO, I MEAN, UH, WHAT'S --
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
ME FIND RHYME FOR "BOYS"!
YOU DID? WHAT IS IT?
RHYME FOR "BOYS" IS "NOISE"!
I WAS IN THE ROOM.
I WAS THERE AT THE TIME
WHEN RICHARD HUNT
WAS JUST TOTALLY FED UP
WITH HIS CHARACTER.
YOU KNOW,
RICHARD'S A SEASONED PUPPETEER.
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HIS JOB.
HE COULD DO WHATEVER
HE WANTED TO DO.
HE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE,
"I HATE THIS DAMN PUPPET.
I'M SUFFERING WITH IT."
SO YOU CAN KIND OF TELL
[Laughing] HE WASN'T PLEASED
WITH IT.
Narrator: RICHARD LEFT THE SET,
CARRYING THE RED MUPPET
LIKE AN OLD MOP.
Kevin:
HE CAME INTO THE MUPPET ROOM,
AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE
PUPPETEERS CONGREGATE, YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE'RE HANGING OUT
TO WAIT TO GO ON.
AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE
IN THE ROOM.
TOSSED IT IN KEVIN'S LAP
AND SAID,
"SEE IF YOU CAN GET SOMETHING
OUT OF THIS PUPPET."
Kevin: YOU KNOW, HE IS ONE
OF THE MAIN GUYS WITH JIM.
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH IT,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT?
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW.
AND I SAID...
[ High-pitched voice ]
HELLO! THIS IS ELMO!
AND HE SAID, "OKAY."
"FINE. GIVE IT A TRY."
Kevin:
I REALLY WANTED TO SUCCEED,
SO I WENT BACK TO BALTIMORE,
HOPING THAT THIS CHARACTER
CAN HOLD ITS OWN
WITH ERNIE AND BERT,
BIG BIRD, COOKIE,
ALL THOSE WONDERFUL CHARACTERS
THAT ARE LEGENDARY TO US NOW.
WHEN I GOT BACK HOME, I KNEW
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT I HAD TO THINK ABOUT
TO REALLY GET SOMEWHERE WITH
BRINGING THIS CHARACTER TO LIFE.
AND SO I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT FRANK ALWAYS SAID
WHEN HE WAS CREATING
A CHARACTER.
HE SAID, "FIND ONE SPECIAL HOOK
FOR THAT CHARACTER."
LIKE WITH FOZZIE BEAR,
HE SAID HE REALLY FOCUSES
ON THE VAUDEVILLE COMEDIAN
WHEN HE PERFORMS FOZZIE.
AND HE SAID MISS PIGGY
IS A TRUCK DRIVER
WANTING TO BE A WOMAN.
AND SO I KEPT THOSE THINGS
IN MIND
AS I HUNG OUT WITH MY MOM
AND THE DAYCARE KIDS.
I WATCHED THE KIDS AND THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC ESSENCE,
THAT ONE THING THAT WOULD SAY
THIS IS ELMO TO ME.
AND THEN I GOT IT --
THE ONE THING THAT IS JUST RIGHT
FOR ELMO.
[ GROANS ]
THE FIRST SCRIPT WAS THIS CUTE
LITTLE SCRIPT WITH ELMO
GOING ON AN IMAGINARY VACATION.
SAY, UH, ELMO...
YES, LUIS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ELMO GOING ON
A MAKE-BELIEVE TRIP
AS SOON AS WE DO ONE THING.
YEAH? WHAT'S THAT?
COME DOWN HERE, LUIS.
COME ON DOWN. SEE?
OKAY.
COME ON.
WHAT?
HERE IT IS.
OH.
GOODBYE HUG.
I KNEW THAT ELMO
SHOULD REPRESENT LOVE,
JUST KISSING AND HUGGING.
OKAY.
GOODBYE.
BYE-BYE.
SUITCASE.
[ GROANS ]
ELMO BACK!
[ GIGGLES ]
NO MORE GOODBYE HUGS.
ELMO LOVES YOU.
HE JUST LOVES YOU.
AND WHEN HE SAYS THAT,
YOU GET IT.
WHAT?
DO THIS...
HELLO HUG!
YOU PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF WHAT
KEVIN WAS LIKE AS A LITTLE KID.
HE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE SCAMP
AND VERY SWEET.
THE PURE INNOCENCE PART OF KEVIN
THAT I THINK
HE ALWAYS WANTS TO BE,
BUT PEOPLE WOULD THINK
HE WAS A CRAZY PERSON
IF HE WAS ALWAYS THAT WAY
AS AN ADULT.
I ALWAYS SAY
THAT ELMO IS NOT KEVIN.
ELMO IS MR. AND MRS. CLASH.
THEY'D BE SUPPORTIVE WHATEVER
KEVIN DID.
KEVIN HAS PUT THIS INTO ELMO.
Kevin: ELMO'S LIKE MY DAD.
HE'S VERY IMAGINATIVE
AND CREATIVE.
AND ELMO'S ALSO LIKE MY MOTHER.
THE BALL OF FIRE THAT ELMO IS,
MY MOM IS LIKE THAT,
A LOT OF ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT
ABOUT LIFE.
AND THE WRITERS THOUGHT,
"THIS IS ACTUALLY A NICE LITTLE
NICHE THAT WE DON'T HAVE."
HE'S KIND OF THE YOUNGEST, YOU
KNOW, OF ALL THE CHARACTERS.
AND THEN RESEARCH STARTED
LOOKING INTO
IF, YOU KNOW, THE KIDS WERE
ACTUALLY LEARNING FROM ELMO,
AND THEY WERE.
...SESAME STREET.
Cooney:
I WOULD GO OVER TO THE STUDIO,
AND PEOPLE WHO WORKED
ON THE SHOW
STARTED TALKING
ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN --
KEVIN THIS AND KEVIN THAT.
AND IT WAS HARD NOT TO HAVE HIM
ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN,
BECAUSE THIS WAS TAKING OFF.
[ LAUGHS ]
Kevin: I WAS IN THE PROCESS
OF CREATING A CHARACTER
AND TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK,
AND THEN ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS
STARTED HAPPENING
ON "SESAME STREET"
WHERE, YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD SAY,
"WELL, THERE'S A CHILD
THAT HAS A WISH
OF SPENDING TIME WITH ELMO."
AND I WOULD SAY,
"OKAY. THAT'S COOL."
AND THEY WOULD SAY,
"WELL, THE WISH IS BECAUSE
SHE'S A SICK CHILD,
AND THIS IS HER DYING WISH."
AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW."
YOU KNOW, I HAD NO IDEA.
TO THIS DAY, WHEN A MAKE-A-WISH
CHILD OR A SICK CHILD IS THERE,
THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME,
THEY'LL ASK FOR ELMO.
BRING MARIA OVER.
COME ON, COME ON.
COME ON OVER.
AW, HELLO, MARIA.
ELMO'S SO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.
WILL YOU GIVE ELMO
A KISS?
KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS.
MWAH.
HI, EVERYBODY.
COME ON IN, DADDY.
[ GIGGLES ]
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
KISS AGAIN. KISS, KISS.
KISS, KISS.
[ SMOOCHES ]
[ SIGHS ]
ELMO'S HAPPY NOW.
ELMO WILL BE LIKE YOU.
GOOD!
EVERYBODY, CONGRATULATE
MARIA FOR COMING! YAY!
[ APPLAUSE ]
[ LAUGHS ]
BYE-BYE, DADDY.
BYE, BROTHER.
BYE, MOMMY.
COMING IN AS A PUPPETEER,
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW CONNECTED
AND HOW LOVED THE SHOW REALLY IS
TO THE FAMILY.
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
THAT THIS WAS BIGGER THAN ME.
TOYS, TOYS.
WHEN MY EX-WIFE, GENIA,
WAS PREGNANT,
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CREATION...
...DIFFERENT FROM FOAM AND GLUE.
ELMO -- ELMO WANTED
TO GET IN HERE
TO TELL YOU THAT GENIA IS
IN LABOR WITH YOU!
Kevin: I REMEMBER SHOOTING ELMO
SAYING, "COME IN.
WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME."
Elmo: THERE'S YOUR MOMMY.
[ LAUGHS ]
SHE'S GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
TO HAVE YOU RIGHT NOW.
AND THIS IS YOUR MOMMY'S
SISTER-IN-LAW,
AND THAT'S YOUR MOMMY'S MOMMY.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW, AND GENIA'S SAYING,
YOU KNOW, "WILL YOU PUT THE DAMN
CAMERA DOWN AND GET IN THE CAR?"
WHEN SHE FINALLY WAS BORN,
GENIA WOULD GET MAD WITH ME,
'CAUSE I'D BE TRYING
TO PUPPETEER HER,
PUPPETEER SHANNON, YOU KNOW,
MOVING HER LEGS, YOU KNOW,
AND MOVING HER LIPS TO MAKE
HER TALK AND EVERYTHING.
AND SHE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW,
"THIS IS NOT A PUPPET.
THIS IS A REAL BABY."
HEY, SHANNON.
HEY, GIRL.
A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER,
I WENT TO BABY DEPOT.
I PUT SHANNON IN THE CAR,
ROAMED AROUND,
AND I SAW
THE TICKLE ME ELMO DOLL.
I WAS LIKE, "UH, TICKLE ME?"
YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALLY SAY --
WITH ELMO, I NEVER SAY "ME."
SO I WAS LIKE, "WELL,
THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK
[LAUGHS] "TICKLE ME.
IT SHOULD BE 'TICKLE ELMO.'"
[ GIGGLING ]
PARENTS ARE LINING UP BEFORE
DAWN IN FRONT OF TOY STORES.
[ SCREAMING ]
THIS IS THE BEATLES
OF TOYS THIS YEAR.
Man: NO PUSHING!
A CANADIAN SALES CLERK TRAMPLED
AND SENT TO THE HOSPITAL.
I HAD ONE IN MY HAND.
AND REALLY, THE LADY JUMPED ME
AND BEAT ME UP.
KEVIN CALLED ME UP AND SAID,
"MAMA, DO YOU SEE THE WAVES
OF PEOPLE GOING CRAZY?"
LOOK. HE SHAKES, HE LAUGHS.
[ GIGGLES ]
HE'S SHAKING.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I GET, "HOLD ON.
ROSIE, PICK UP LINE TWO."
AND IT'S AARON SPELLING.
AND AARON SPELLING
LIKE A, YOU KNOW, HUGE,
HUGE, MAJOR MEDIA MOGUL,
HOLLYWOOD BILLIONAIRE, BIGGEST
HOUSE IN HOLLYWOOD, RIGHT?
"ROSIE, IT'S AARON SPELLING.
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET ME
TWO TICKLE ME ELMOS?"
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
I FELT LIKE A CRACK DEALER.
Woman: AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE TICKLE ME ELMO CRAZE...
SAY SOMETHING
OTHER THAN "ELMO."
...EVERYBODY WANTED
ELMO, ELMO, ELMO, ELMO.
Kevin: THE SCHEDULE THAT I HAD,
I'D BE IN L.A.,
OR I'D BE IN JAPAN,
OR I'D BE IN CHINA,
OR I'D BE IN SOUTH AFRICA.
I STARTED TRAVELING SO MUCH.
I WASN'T THERE FOR THE FIRST DAY
AT SCHOOL.
YAY!
I MET SO MANY CELEBRITIES.
[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ]
RIGHT THERE WAS ELMO, SINGING
WITH THEM OR ACTING WITH THEM.
THAT IS SOME CONCENTRATION,
ELMO.
CAN'T TALK, MR. HUGH.
WHAT?
ELMO'S CONCENTRATING.
I'M SORRY.
HMM...
HI. THIS IS ELMO'S FRIEND
WHOOPI.
HI, EVERYONE.
IT WAS AMAZING.
WHO ARE YOU?
MY NAME IS KOFI ANNAN.
I'M THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
OH! WELL, ELMO IS ELMO.
THERE WERE SOME CONCERN ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT
THERE NEEDED TO BE AN ADDITIONAL
PERFORMER ON ELMO
IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND.
AND KEVIN WAS LIKE, "NO.
I CAN DO IT."
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED
A CELEBRITY LULLABY.
WHAT, IS IT BRAD PITT?
ELMO LOVES BRAD PITT.
IT'S NOT BRAD PITT.
IT'S RICKY GERVAIS.
THAT'S ME.
UH, IS MR. RICKY GERVAIS
A CELEBRITY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, OF COURSE I AM.
[ APPLAUSE ]
YOU DON'T HAVE A BLACK MAN
WALKING BEHIND YOU
LIKE ELMO DOES, DO YOU?
[ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ]
HAVE YOU GOT
SOME FUNKY DANCE MOVES?
OH, YEAH.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE ELMO DANCE?
OH, YES, PLEASE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, YEAH.
TAKE IT TO THE BANK.
Kevin: IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
AND THEN I STARTED TO GET
MORE AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY
ON "SESAME STREET."
Cheryl: KEVIN HAS REALLY
DEDICATED HIS LIFE
TO "SESAME STREET."
HE'S ELMO.
HE IS ALSO MUPPET CAPTAIN.
HE'S ALSO PRODUCER.
HE'S ALSO DIRECTOR.
HE'S ALSO EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
OF "SESAME STREET."
AND HE'S ESSENTIAL TO THAT SHOW.
Kevin: BEING AWAY SO MUCH,
THERE WERE TIMES
WHEN I WAS DOING SHOWS
WITH CHILDREN SHANNON'S AGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Kevin: WHO-O-O-A.
YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT HE'S PRETENDING TO BE.
ANYBODY KNOW WHAT HE IS?
[ ALL CHEERING ]
THERE I WAS, SPENDING TIME
AND PLAYING WITH THEM.
WHAT IS IT?
A BALLOON!
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS!
ELMO, ARE YOU A BALLOON?!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DEFINITELY FELT I WOULD RATHER
BE, YOU KNOW, WITH SHANNON,
GIVING HER THAT TIME.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Man: YOU GUYS WERE GREAT.
GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE.
Narrator: IN FEBRUARY 1990,
JIM HENSON BROUGHT ALL
OF HIS MUPPETEERS TO FLORIDA
TO FILM A TELEVISION SPECIAL
CALLED "THE MUPPETS
AT DISNEY WORLD."
Kevin: THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I GOT TO GO
TO DISNEY WORLD.
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, AND
WE WERE SITTING ON THE SIDEWALK,
AND I SAID TO JIM, "WE NEVER HAD
A PHOTO TAKEN OF EACH OTHER."
AND HE SAID, "WELL,
I'LL SET THAT UP RIGHT NOW."
SO, HIS PHOTOGRAPHER THERE,
AND HE SAID,
"NOW, I HAVE THE SCRIPT HERE.
LET'S LOOK LIKE WE'RE WORKING."
AND SO HE OPENED UP THE SCRIPT,
AND HE POINTED, AND I'M LOOKING,
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'RE DOING WORK.
IT MAKES ME LAUGH.
JIM AND I WERE BECOMING FRIENDS.
I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN.
AND OVER ONE DINNER THAT WE HAD,
HE TALKED ABOUT
HOW HE WAS SO HAPPY
THAT ELMO WAS WORKING OUT
AND REALLY IS A LOT OF FUN
AND VERY SWEET AND WORKS VERY,
VERY WELL ON "SESAME STREET."
THAT WAS REALLY A WONDERFUL
THING TO HEAR FROM JIM.
[ APPLAUSE ]
HE ASKED ME TO BE ON "THE
ARSENIO HALL SHOW" WITH HIM.
IT WAS A CHARACTER
THAT HE ACTUALLY HELPED ME
CREATE CALLED CLIFFORD.
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH."
WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU
STARTED WORKING WITH KERMIT?
I WAS A SPONGE, MAN.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I WAS DOING?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Kevin: I NOTICED THAT HE WAS
COMPLAINING OF A SORE THROAT.
TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT, I GOT A
CALL FROM ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS.
"DID YOU HEAR ABOUT JIM?"
AND I SAID, "YEAH.
I KNOW HE'S UNDER THE WEATHER."
AND SHE SAID, "NO.
THEY'RE SAYING HE MIGHT NOT
MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT."
AND I WENT INTO SHOCK.
Man: THIS IS "WORLD NEWS
 TONIGHT" WITH PETER JENNINGS.
 GOOD EVENING.
 A LITTLE OF THE MAGIC IS GONE.
 JIM HENSON, THE MAN
 WHO CREATED THE MUPPETS,
 THE MAN WHO MADE COMPLEX
 CHARACTERS OUT OF CLOTH,
 HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF ONLY 53.
 HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL
 HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
 YESTERDAY,
 AND HE DIED VERY EARLY...
Man: * IF JUST ONE PERSON
BELIEVES IN YOU... *
Kevin: PRIOR TO HIS DEATH,
HE WROTE A LETTER TO US.
* BEFORE YOU KNEW IT *
* SOMEONE ELSE WOULD THINK *
* "IF HE CAN DO IT *
HE SAID...
* "I CAN DO IT" *
"I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO HAVE BLACK ON."
* MAKING IT,
TWO WHOLE PEOPLE... *
"I WANT EVERYBODY
TO HAVE COLOR ON."
AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
AND YOU CAN'T DISAGREE WITH ME.
"I'M GONE, YOU KNOW?
YOU HAVE TO ABIDE
BY WHAT I'M SAYING."
* THERE'S BOUND TO BE
SOME OTHER PERSON *
* WHO BELIEVES IN MAKING IT
A THREESOME *
HI.
* MAKING IT THREE *
Kevin: IT WAS A HUGE LOSS FOR
ME, BUT, ALSO, I WAS SO HAPPY
THAT I GOT TO WORK WITH HIM
AND HE LIKED WHAT I DID.
* AND IF THREE WHOLE PEOPLE,
WHY NOT FOUR? *
* AND IF FOUR WHOLE PEOPLE, WHY
NOT MORE AND MORE AND MORE? *
[ APPLAUSE ]
* AND WHEN ALL THOSE PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN YOU... *
Kevin: SHANNON PUT TOGETHER
AN E-MAIL TO ME.
SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, DAD,
I'M PROBABLY GONNA BE LEAVING
"TO GO TO COLLEGE
IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS,
"AND PLEASE LOOK INTO
GIVING ME SOME TIME
BEFORE I LEAVE TO DO THAT."
THAT DEFINITELY [CHUCKLES]
KNOCKED ME IN THE HEAD.
SO I TOLD THE COMPANY THESE ARE
THE DATES THAT ARE OFF-LIMITS,
BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER BE THERE
THAN WORKING.
DO YOU LIKE THE BAG?
THEY MIGHT BE TOO SMALL.
Kevin: I'LL HOLD IT.
YEAH, I'LL HOLD IT.
THERE WE GO.
[ APPLAUSE ]
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU KNOW, IT JUST MELTS YOU.
I TELL YOU, THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA DO THIS
IF SHE GETS MARRIED.
I CAN'T.
I WOULDN'T GET THROUGH IT.
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT A SURPRISE
FOR SHANNON.
LET'S BRING DOWN THE LIGHTS.
 SWEET 16.
 IT'S ME, JACK BLACK.
 I'M SAYING HAPPY SWEET 16.
 ENJOY IT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 MWAH!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 SHANNON, CONGRATULATIONS
 ON YOUR SWEET 16.
 YOU ARE THE WINNER.
 EVERYBODY SALUTES YOU
 AND LOVES YOU.
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 HI, SHANNON.
 ELMO JUST WANTED TO SAY
 HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY, TOO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
 ELMO LOVES YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.
 SPEAK TO YOU SOON.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Kevin: I CREATED PUPPETS
EVER SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OLD,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE, YOU
KNOW, CREATING A HUMAN BEING.
THAT'S AMAZING.
IT IS JUST AMAZING.
I TELL YOU, EVERY SINGLE DAY
I THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING IT IS.
IT JUST BLOWS ME AWAY.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
I BECAME A PUPPETEER, TOO,
JUST OBSERVING THE HUMAN SPIRIT.
THERE'S JUST --
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.
I'VE BEEN VERY, VERY LUCKY,
VERY BLESSED.
I GO AROUND TALKING TO KIDS
AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND AROUND THE WORLD,
SAYING IF EVERYBODY ELSE
YOUR AGE IS DOING SOMETHING
VERY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE
SAYING TO YOU
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT SUCCEED
WITH IT.
YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY MONEY
WITH THAT.
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOME
TYPE OF OBSTACLE IN THE WAY.
ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL GO AWAY
IF YOU REALLY FOCUS
ON WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.
COOL.
[ Telephone rings ]
TAU: Hello.
HELLO, TAU.
Hello?
HI. THIS IS KEVIN CLASH
FROM "SESAME STREET."
HOW ARE YOU?
No, you're not!
I KNOW WHO I AM.
[ Laughs ]
LESLIE CARRARA SAID THAT
SHE MET YOU DOWN IN ATLANTA
AND SAID THAT
YOU'RE A HUGE FAN
AND YOU STARTED BUILDING PUPPETS
WHEN YOU WERE 8.
Sometime during that time, yes.
OKAY. WHAT TYPE OF MATERIALS
DO YOU USE?
I use, um... fleece and foam and sometimes white, plastic spoons for eyes.
Uh, I have so many questions.
HEY.
COME ON IN.
HOW ARE YOU?
[ LAUGHS ] HI.
HI, MR. CLASH.
Tau: OH, DEAR LORD.
WHAT'S THIS PUPPET'S NAME?
HIS NAME IS JUICE.
JUICE?
YEP.
OH, THAT'S SIMON THE SALMON.
YES.
[ LAUGHS ]
I THINK I CAN NAME
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
OKAY. DO IT.
WELL, ONLY THE PUPPETEERS.
OKAY, WELL, THIS ONE
IS JERRY NELSON.
I THINK THAT ONE'S
CAROL WILCOX.
YES. CAROLY WILCOX, YEAH.
THAT'S JIM HENSON.
THAT'S FRANK OZ
AND RICHARD HUNT.
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHO THIS GUY
IS ALL THE WAY OVER THERE?
YOU NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM.
OH, WAIT. JON STONE?
YEAH. [ LAUGHS ]
SEE, YOU WOULD HAVE GOT
AN "A."
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ]
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WONDERING WHERE
YOU GET THAT MATERIAL FROM.
THESE ARE
ALL THE DIFFERENT FURS.
THESE ARE
THEIR EYES AND EARS.
[ GASPS ]
[ Old man's voice ]
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU SURE YOU DON'T HAVE
AN APPLE OR A SUGAR CUBE
SOMEWHERE IN THERE,
ANYWHERE?
[ LAUGHS ]
[ BABBLING ]
PICK ONE.
THIS ONE.
HOW DID YOU LEARN HOW TO WORK
THE PUPPET?
DID YOU JUST KEEP WATCHING
"SESAME"?
WHAT DID YOU DO?
YEAH. I KEPT
WATCHING "SESAME STREET,"
AND I WAS CATCHING ON
HOW TO DO IT.
SAW DIFFERENT VIDEOS.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
YOU WAS DOING IT RIGHT?
WELL, I LOOKED WHILE
I WAS DOING THE PUPPETRY.
EXACTLY WHAT I DID.
LIKE I SAID, YOU FOCUS
ON YOUR LIP SYNC.
Kevin: WHEN I'M TEACHING A CHILD
WHO IS INTERESTED IN WHAT I DO,
I BECOME ONE OF THEM.
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES
WITH PUPPETEERS...
I'M PASSING ALONG THE ENJOYMENT
OVER SO MANY YEARS OF WORKING
ALONGSIDE THESE MASTERS.
YOU REALLY HAVE A NICE, NATURAL
MOVEMENT TO YOUR PUPPET.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
[ As Elmo ]
YOU'RE WELCOME.
LIKE THEY SAW WITH ME,
IT'S SO REWARDING.
HI THERE, ELMO.
WHAT'S UP?
HI, PORKY.
PORKY.
IS THAT YOUR NAME --
PORKY?
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S MY NAME.
HIGH FIVE.
OR HIGH FOUR.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHEN ELMO GROWS UP,
ELMO WANTS TO BE A TEACHER.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
HOW DOES ELMO FEEL WHEN HE KNOWS
THAT HE HELPED SOMEBODY?
ELMO FEELS VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE
ELMO WOULD LOVE TO HELP THEM,
BECAUSE THEY HELP ELMO
ALL THE TIME.
[ INDISTINCT YELLING ]
Goldberg:
THE THING THAT PEOPLE LOVE
ABOUT ELMO IS HE NEEDS THEM,
AND THAT'S WHY LITTLE KIDS LOVE
HIM, BECAUSE HE NEEDS THEM, TOO.
ELMO!
HELLO! GOOD TO SEE YOU!
YAY! HUG, HUG, HUG.
HUG ELMO.
HUG. HUG ELMO.
MWAH, MWAH!
THERE IS A FEELING
THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING,
AS LONG AS THEY'VE GOT THEIR
ELMO WITH THEM.
HELLO, MR. CLASH.
HELLO.
[ As Elmo ]
HOW ARE YOU?
I ATTRIBUTE THAT TO KEVIN,
BECAUSE OF HIS EMBODIMENT
OF THIS CHARACTER
AND WHAT HE MEANS TO CHILDREN.
[ TRUMPET PLAYS ]
[ GROANS ]
Spinney: HIS ELMO,
LIKE A LOT OF GOOD PUPPETEERS,
YOU PUT A LOT OF YOURSELF IN IT.
AND I THINK THAT THE DICKENS IN
KEVIN COMES OUT IN LITTLE ELMO.
I THINK THAT'S WHY
HE'S JUST SO DARN GOOD.
Oz: THERE'S SO MANY TERRIFIC
PUPPETEERS,
AND KEVIN IS A BROTHER
LIKE THE OTHER PERFORMERS
ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
HE REALLY DOES EXEMPLIFY WHAT
JIM HENSON BEGAN WITH, YOU KNOW,
THAT JIM WAS CREATING SOMETHING
THAT TOUCHED EVERYONE.
[ SMOOCHES ]
WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT
THAT HE'S GIVEN US
OVER SO MANY YEARS AND OF
THE SPIRIT AND THE CAMARADERIE
AND THE SILLINESS,
YOU CAN SEE IT THROUGH ME.
YOU CAN SEE IT
THROUGH ANY PUPPETEER
THAT'S EVER WORKED WITH JIM.
WE WERE GIVEN THE TORCH
TO KEEP GOING WITH IT.
AND WE WILL.
WE WILL SUCCEED, BECAUSE
IT SHOULD NEVER GO AWAY.
READY? DO IT AGAIN.
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO,
HERE WE GO.
DON'T LOSE IT.
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta-da! Ta...
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Huh?
Three weeks, and we're still no closer to cracking this.
Right, bring him in!
Yes, sir.
This is the best party ever!
Yeah!
Ha!
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!
Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us.
Yay!
No, no, no. What do you mean she's not coming?
I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess.
Hurts! Stop it!
Listen! I don't want a refund, I want the fairy princess, please!
Please, I'm begging you.
You know what? I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!
Ooh, ooh!
When's the fairy princess coming?
Any minute now!
Yay!
Stall them!
Ooh!
Whoa! Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.
That's enough of the magic show.
Aw!
Wait, did you hear that?
It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.
It's the fairy princess! She's coming!
Look!
- Huh? Oh!
- Eh?
Ow!
Ow.
It is I, Gruzinkerbell, the most magical fairy princess of all!
And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday!
How come you're so fat?
Because my house is made of candy, and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems!
How come you have...
Okay, time for cake.
Yay!
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell! You're the best fairy princess ever!
You are welcome, little girl!
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids.
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!
Hello, Jillian.
So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and... Oop.
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.
Come on, she's a riot!
She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her...
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?
No!
Oh! Oh! I know someone whose husband just died...
I'm sorry,
I did not see you there.
Or there.
Kyle? Kyle?
Kyle, no! Do not do your business on the petunias!
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.
Good boy!
Mr. Gru?
I didn't...
What? Yes?
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
Oh, whoops!
Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me.
Oh, sorry, I...
Freeze ray!
You know, you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru.
For example...
Lipstick taser!
Oh, it works so good.
Man!
Large person.
Oh, sorry.
Get in there...
Huh?
...you big man!
Boss!
Uh? Huh!
Whoa!
Huh?
Ah! Whoo!
Ooh!
Oh!
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!
Wow!
What? Where?
Whoa, foot is asleep.
Ah, pins and needles!
Good afternoon,
Mr. Gru.
Eh.
I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
I am not gonna lie,
I enjoyed that.
Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.
That's enough, Agent Wilde.
Sorry, sir.
Okay, this is bogus!
I don't know who you people think you are, but...
We are the Anti-Villain League.
An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.
But you want to melt the polar ice caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji, or even steal the Moon...
Then we notice.
First of all, you got no proof that I did that.
Second, after I did do that, I put it back!
We're well aware of that,
Mr. Gru.
That's why we brought you here.
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.
Bottom.
Hilarious.
Agent Wilde?
Oh, me now? Ah.
Um, recently, an entire top-secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle.
Yeah, the entire lab, just...
Gone. Where did it go?
I don't care.
Hmm. The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum.
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.
Ah!
Huh, you usually don't see that in bunnies.
As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.
Fortunately, it has a very distinct chemical footprint.
And using the latest chem-tracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
A mall?
Precisely. And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
And that's where you come in.
As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.
The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully...
Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission: Impossible stuff, but no. No!
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.
I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.
"Jams and jellies"?
Oh, attitude!
That's right!
So, thanks, but no thanks.
And here's a tip. Instead of taeing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call!
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.
Ramsbottom.
Oh, yeah, like that's any better.
Hello.
Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing.
So, if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome, give us a call.
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.
Oh, sorry.
So, when you going on your date?
What?
Remember, Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
Yeah, well, she is a nut job, and I'm not going on any date.
Why not? Are you scared?
Hey, did you guys see the Moon landing on TV?
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!
Excuse me? Lisa?
I was talking to
Billy the other day.
No way!
He is so cute.
Ah. Hey, Lisa,
I was wondering if you...
Ew! Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!
Ew!
Lisa's got Gruties!
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!
I just have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed.
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.
Let's go to bed.
Good night, Edith.
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?
No one. Just my friend Avery.
Avery. Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
Does it matter?
No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!
I know what makes you a boy.
Uh, ooh, you do?
Your bald head.
Oh, yes.
It's really smooth.
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine a little chick popping out.
Peep peep peep.
Good night, Agnes.
Never get older.
Hey, oh!
Uh...
Okay, okay.
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.
So, how's today's batch,
Dr. Nefario?
I developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.
That tastes good!
I love the flavor of that!
It's horrible, isn't it?
No, no!
Oh, we're making great progress!
Here, try some of this.
Mmm.
Ah.
Whoa.
Okay, just because everybody hates it, doesn't mean it's not good!
Listen, Gru.
There's something
I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.
What? What's wrong?
Um...
I miss being evil.
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes, it's what I live for.
I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?
Well, I'm also considering a line of jams.
Um, the thing is, Gru,
I've had an offer of employment elsewhere.
Dr. Nefario!
Come on, you're kidding, right?
It's a great opportunity for me.
Bigger lab, more evil, full dental.
Very well.
Let us give you the proper send-off.
Minions!
The highest honor awarded to Dr. Nefario for your years of service, the 21-fart gun salute!
Uh, I counted 22.
Farewell, my friends.
This may take a while.
Go about your business.
I miss you already!
Huh?
Huh.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Yes, it's for his own good.
Okay, we need to choose a picture.
No.
Scary.
Weird.
What is that?
Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make.
Hey, what celebrity do you look like?
Uh, Bruce Willis.
Mmm, no.
Humpty Dumpty!
Ooh, Gollum!
Okay, what are you doing?
We're signing you up for online dating!
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.
Oh, come on. It's fun.
And it's time for you to get out there.
No! Stop! No one is ever getting out there! Ever!
Oh! Okay, now for the announcement.
I have accepted a new job.
Whoa! Really?
Yes, I have been recruited by a top-secret agency to go undercover and save the world!
You're gonna be a spy?
That's right, baby!
Gru's back in the game.
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars.
The whole deal.
Awesome!
Are you really gonna save the world?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Ah!
Hmm.
"Bake My Day."
Blech.
All right, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the Internet.
And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!
Whoo.
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?
Ooh. You got a little...
Here, I'll get it.
Oh.
It's just spreading.
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!
Oh.
I'll let you get it.
Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new
I've been working on.
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare and krumping.
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.
Yay!
What? No, no "yay".
Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.
Well, it seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you.
But not me. I stepped up.
And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.
Walla!
Ya!
Aah!
Do you know this guy?
Yes, he's one of my minions.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have known.
You are free to go.
Uh? Ah!
Kampai!
Oh!
Dave...
Earth to Dave!
Huh?
You can leave now.
Oh, uh...
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?
Fire them at me.
First suspect,
Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop.
No, not her.
Okay, moving on...
Chuck Kinney, owner of Stuff-A-Bear.
Ooh.
I don't think so.
Hello?
Buenos días, my friends!
I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa y Salsa restaurant, across the mall.
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.
This is just going to take un momento.
I am throwing a big
Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag.
It looks something like this.
What do you think?
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Look away!
You, whoo.
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!
Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay?
And welcome to the mall family.
El Macho.
What?
But it couldn't be.
What? What couldn't be?
That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho.
From about 20 years ago.
He was ruthless!
He was dangerous.
And as the name implies, very macho.
He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands!
But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.
He died in the most macho way possible.
Riding a shark
with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest
into the mouth of an active volcano!
It was glorious.
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead.
They never found the body.
Oh, no.
All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!
Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant? Tonight?
Yes, that's good, because I am telling you, if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum, it's him.
All right, all right, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.
What's the big hurry?
I just have a lot of work to do.
Work, what kind of work?
Very important business.
So, hugs, kisses.
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.
Whoa!
But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show.
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.
My mother is beyond compare.
We love you, mothers, everywhere.
Wow! That was something else.
I really liked the way you smiled at the end.
Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?
Okay.
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair...
Perfect! Time to go.
I don't think I should do this.
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?
I don't even have a mom.
Well, you don't need one to do the show.
I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat.
This is different.
Okay, well, then maybe you can just use your imagination.
You mean I pretend I have a mom?
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?
Yeah! I do that all the time.
Thanks, Gru!
Hey!
All right. Hey, hey, no, no! No.
Hey. Hey, please.
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!
Come on!
Mmm-mmm!
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Huh?
Oca!
Oca!
Looka too!
Huh?
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.
Right. Gotcha.
Ya!
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.
Wait! Wait.
What?
What are you doing?
I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
It's a restaurant!
You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set.
Huh? Come on.
There are no booby traps.
Ha! Booby!
Oh. There's a chicken.
Are you lost, little guy?
You must be lost.
Ha! Some guard dog.
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!
Aah!
I got you!
I got it!
Ha!
Oh!
What is wrong with that chicken?
Hey, that pollo es loco.
No?
Okay, let's go.
Are you getting anything?
No, not yet.
But, hey, maybe you can find something with these X-ray goggles.
Bah.
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!
Aah! Oof!
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
That's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blech!
I knew it!
The serum is in here!
Ooh, then let's get it.
This is going to be good!
Ah.
Ah-ha!
What?
Salsa?
Aw, man.
Oh.
Somebody's going to die tonight.
Pollito!
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?
Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken?
What? Who's there?
Mmm-mmm.
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?
Yah!
Huh?
Stop!
My eyes!
Gru, call one of your munchkins!
We've been spotted!
Come get us!
Huh? Hey!
Ah!
Hmm, subtle.
Over here! Over here!
Over here.
Hold tight!
Aah!
I have you now!
Yay! Ice cream!
Huh?
Huh?
All right, there he is.
Suspect number eight,
Floyd Eaglesan.
Oh, okay.
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.
All right.
What the...
Oh, no. That's not good.
Whoa!
Hey, uh, what?
Oh!
Hey, Gru!
Oh, girls! What are you doing here?
Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work.
So, you're saving the world in a garbage can?
Funny.
Hey! There you are.
Oh. Who's this?
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.
Hello.
Hi.
Are you single?
Oh! Goodness.
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall? Bye!
Here is some money, go buy some useless mall junk.
Some headbands and...
Are you gonna marry Lucy?
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.
Plus, you love her.
You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!
And you're gonna get married!
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.
And I will be the flower girl!
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!
Almost forgot. Hugs!
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.
Bye, Gru!
Kids, right? They're funny.
Those girls totally adore you.
I bet you're a fun dad.
Huh.
I am pretty fun.
Is that stealing?
Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.
Whoa!
Cool glasses.
Oh.
I'm Antonio.
I'm Margo.
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?
Uh, sure.
I'm Margo.
Um, I'll catch up with you guys later.
Bye!
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"
We gotta go tell Gru!
All right, I'm going in.
If it picks up any traces of the serum, the sensor in your belt buckle will make a sound like this...
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Okay!
I get it. I get it.
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.
It's about time you showed up,
Mr. Gru.
You know my name?
When someone moves into the mall who is folically-challenged,
I make it my business to know all about them.
You are bald, and that is bad.
There you go, my sweet.
I'm getting nothing so far.
I think you need to move around.
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?
I take it you're an art lover?
No serum.
Yeah, not so much.
Oh, how about this impressive trinket?
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru.
Nothing.
The International...
Yeah, I don't care.
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!
Ah, and what do we have here?
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.
No, thanks. So, what's on the other side of the wall?
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!
Gru?
I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible.
Margo has a boyfriend!
And they're going on a date!
Date? Boyfriend?
What?
There she goes!
Oh, you're so funny.
Gross!
Look, they're in love.
Oh, no, no, no.
Do not say that. No, no, no.
And my dream is to one day play video games for a living.
Wow.
You're so complicated.
Margo.
What is going on here?
Oh, Gru, se llama Antonio.
Me llamo Margo.
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.
Whoa!
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.
Yay, Pop!
That's awesome!
So good to see you again, mi compadre!
Ha! Yeah.
Oh, I see you have already met my father.
What? Father?
Si. Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?
Come, sit, let me get you something.
Oh, look at you.
Heh?
He likes me.
Oh, oh! I'm sorry. Pollito is usually very friendly.
He had a rough night.
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.
That is a pity.
Young love is beautiful, no?
No!
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.
You are right, Cabeza de huevo.
They must get to know each other better!
Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?
No, no.
Si!
I'm sorry, El Macho?
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect after the whole salsa incident?
Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy.
You need to arrest him immediately.
And his deviously charming son!
I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too.
The son, also!
You got to get the son!
I think that the son is the mastermind!
There's a look, there's a devilish look in his eyes, and I don't like it!
Yes, but I don't really see any evidence.
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho.
Lock him up, lock up the son.
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
But, on the less crazy side of things,
Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!
Hmm, interesting.
Yeah! And you know who made that happen? Huh?
This guy.
Nailed it. Amazing, right?
No, I mean, sure. But it's not him, it is El Macho!
Mr. Gru, please!
No! It is him, and I will prove it!
Gru, come on!
He really thinks it's El Macho.
Can you tell?
Oh. Whoo!
Give me that!
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!
Kevin?
Hey, Lance, where the heck is Kevin?
All right, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get.
I can't find anybody anymore.
Gru, it's Jillian!
I've got good news!
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.
I was thinking you two could get some grub.
You know, tear it up, see what happens!
Open up!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...
Agnes! Agnes, tell Jillian I'm not here.
Gru's not here.
Are you sure?
Yes, he just told me!
Mmm-mmm!
I mean, no, he didn't just tell me.
Agnes, where is Gru?
He's putting on lipstick!
He's swatting at flies!
No! No!
He's chopping his head off!
He's pooping?
I know you're in there, Gru!
There's no way you're getting out of this!
I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight.
I mean there's just so many phonies out there!
Yes, I hear you.
Oh, so, do you work out?
Well...
I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it?
Huh? Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.
As you can tell, right? Huh?
Ah.
I can tell.
Solid.
We are in the restaurant, you know.
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?
Sure, just a sec.
Your accent is so exotic.
Ah. Well, thank you very much.
I know someone who can fix that for you.
And you'll be talking normal in no time!
Whoo. Is it hot in here?
How's the food?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?
What?
Ah! I don't think so.
I knew it.
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!
Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine.
No, they're not!
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing off your head, and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
I don't think so, Miss Lady.
Hello?
Hello? Are you...
Hey, Gru.
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?
Wow, looks like your date's out for the count.
It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer.
Yeah, I'm winking because that's what actually happened.
Scusi, what's happening here?
She no like?
Oh, she's just, uh...
Oh, ho.
Sì, Sì. Sì.
Shall we take her home?
Oh!
Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever.
Huh, tell me about it.
Don't worry. It can only get better from here, right?
But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun.
I've had to use it on one or two dates myself.
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
I think I'm good with just the one.
Well, good night, partner.
This was fun.
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.
Oh, and, uh, just between you and me?
You look much better bald.
See you tomorrow.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Yay!
So, I take it the date went well?
No, it was horrible.
High-five!
Bump it.
Mr. Ramsbottom?
Oh, hello.
What are you doing here?
We got him.
Got who?
Floyd Eaglesan!
Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night and discovered this.
It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it.
He's our man.
So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.
I was framed!
You won't get away with this!
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.
Ah. All right. So what now?
Well, now you're free to go back to your business.
Mmm. Jams and jellies.
And it looks like
Agent Wilde will be transferring to our
Australian branch.
Australia?
Yes.
But thank you for everything.
And by everything, of course I mean nothing.
Toodle pip and cheerio,
Mr. Gru.
Hey, there.
Hey.
So, we got him.
Yay. That's great.
And now you're going to Australia?
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.
I've already been working on my accent.
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.
Hugh Jackman.
So, um... Pretty excited.
Great.
Well, good luck.
Thanks. You, too.
Oh! Here.
I wanted to give you this.
Your lipstick taser?
Yeah, it's just a memento.
Just, you know, from the first time we met.
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.
Agent Wilde.
Well, it looks like they need you, so...
Yeah, I better go.
Bye, Gru.
I brought you an umbrella.
Ah, thank you.
What are you doing out here?
Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?
Well, it turns out, you're right.
Really?
Yes, but...
Well, she's moving away.
I'm never going to see her again.
Is there anything
I could do to help?
Aw, I don't... I don't think so, sweetheart.
Well, is there anything you could do?
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.
I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for
Australia and all, but...
Okay, here is the question.
Would you like to...
To go out on a date?
Uh, no.
Okay, that's not helping.
All right, here we go.
For real this time.
I can do this.
Agh! I hate you!
Ah.
Eh.
Kevin?
Mmm?
Tom?
Hello!
Kampai!
Kampai!
Huh? Kampai!
Bah!
Oh.
Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Whoa!
This place is awesome!
Okay. Let's party, huh?
But first, let's go over the rules.
Because what is fun without the rules?
Agnes, easy on the churros.
Edith, try not to kill anyone.
Hai!
Margo!
Hello, Mr. Gru.
Okay.
Gru!
There must be the standard 6 feet of space between you and boys.
Especially this boy.
Ah, you are a funny man.
There are no rules, señor.
It's Cinco de Mayo.
Come on!
They're starting the dance!
Arriba!
So glad you could make it, mi compadre.
Hey, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing is wrong.
I'm just chilling with the guac, from my chip hat.
Gru, please. I know that look all too well.
It is the look of a broken heart.
How did you know?
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
You?
Yes.
But we are survivors.
There's much more to us than meets the eye.
Enjoy the party.
Huh.
Ah-ha!
Ouch!
Say what?
Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?
That's a good joke.
I just did a boom boom.
I really need you to make a choice, hon.
I choose Gru.
I choose Gru!
Thank you, Gru stewardess!
You're welcome!
Aah!
You have not lost your touch, my friend.
Ah-ha! I knew it!
You are El Macho!
That's right!
Nobody believed me!
Ho-ho! But I knew you weren't dead!
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.
But now, it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil.
Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here.
Dr. Nefario?
Nice to see you, Gru.
Wha...?
So, this is your new job opportunity?
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.
Sorry.
I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.
Oh! Kevin!
No, he's not Kevin anymore.
Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!
Bah!
Just watch this.
Bah!
And here's the best part!
I got an army of them!
Look, look, look!
Bah!
Soon I will unleash them on the world, and if anyone, anyone tries to stop them...
Yeow!
...their city gets eaten!
We can do it together.
Together?
Together!
I have admired your work for years, amigo.
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?
We would be unstoppable!
Men like you, men like me.
We should be ruling the world!
So, are you in?
Woo-hoo!
Uh, yeah, probably.
Probably?
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.
I just have a lot going on right now.
I just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all.
Excuse me?
No, forget it.
One hundred percent! I am in!
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.
That's Agnes calling me from on the surface.
Totally in!
You know what?
I am not so convinced that he is in.
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!
Oops, sorry.
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?
But I didn't get a turn!
Margo!
Come on. We're leaving...
Hey, what's wrong?
I hate boys.
Yes. They stink.
Uh, sorry. Honey, we got to go.
Oops! Sorry.
Ya!
Hey! Pollito, what's the matter?
Oh, hey, Eduardo!
Lucia, I apologize.
Pollito, he's usually not like this.
The same thing happened the other day with Gru, and...
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him?
I really need to talk to him.
Yes. I think he's somewhere around here.
You two are close, no?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?
It's more what he didn't say.
For instance, he never mentioned that you were both working for the Anti-Villain League!
You're coming with me.
Hey!
Crikey!
So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?
Cool!
No, it is not cool!
Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me!
Gru!
Well, Dr. Nefario.
El Macho's onto you. He knows you're working for the AVL.
And he's got your partner.
Lucy?
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!
Nefario?
Sorry, gotta go!
He's got Lucy?
Not for long.
Come on, we're getting her out of there.
What was that?
I don't see anything.
Run!
My unicorn!
Agnes, no!
Come on! Hurry!
What's the matter?
Bah!
Ooh là là.
Kevin!
Dr. Nefario! You're back!
In the flesh.
Behold, the antidote.
Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use.
Ah! Ah!
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.
Huh?
Huh?
Uh...
Uh...
Oh.
Uh!
Curses! Foiled again!
These guys captured me!
Uh...
No?
Bah!
Run!
Up that tree!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hello, Gru!
Hey hey!
Nice work, Dr. Nefario!
I put an antidote in the jelly.
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family.
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, let's go get the...
Hi!
You brought the girls?
Yes!
Oh.
Was that wrong?
What's happening to my minions?
Gru?
You guys, take care of the rest of the minions.
I'm going to find Lucy.
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
Whoa! Whoa!
It's over, El Macho.
Now, where is Lucy?
Let me show you.
Oh, hey, Gru!
Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh?
Yay!
One push of this button, and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.
Only this time, it's for real.
No!
Yam
Tallyho!
We could have ruled the world together, Gru!
But now, you're gonna die.
Oh!
Ah!
Mmm, lipstick taser!
Aw, he copied me.
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.
Ho-oh!
Don't worry about me,
Gru, I'll be fine.
I have survived lots worse than this.
Okay, that's not entirely true.
I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!
Don't worry,
I will get you out of this.
I really hate that chicken.
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!
Gru, anytime now!
Listen, Lucy, we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question.
Uh, better make it quick.
If I had asked you out on a date, what would you have said?
Are you kidding me?
Yes!
Jump!
Lucy!
Lucy, where are you?
Oh, Lucy!
Gru!
Sorry! I guess you need your arms to tread water, huh?
They'll be back.
Underwear...
Underwear...
Underwear...
Oh!
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"
Underwear...
Okay.
Excuse me.
Um, hi, excuse me.
Uh, hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.
Uh...
Okay.
She, um...
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.
We love you, mothers, everywhere.
And my new mom,
Lucy, is beyond compare.
Aww.
Aw.
To the bride and Gru!
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
I'm so happy!
Huh? Ha!
Bah!
Hey, Bob! Stuart!
Eh!
No?
Ah!
Bob!
Uh-oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Aah!
Mmm?
Shh!
Blah.

SCRIMGEOUR:
These are dark times, there is no denying.
Our world has, perhaps, faced no greater threat than it does today.

We, ever your servants...

...and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.
Your Ministry remains...

DUDLEY: I still don't understand why we have to leave.
VERNON: Because, unh, it's not safe for us here anymore.
Ron, tell your father supper's nearly ready.

MRS. GRANGER:
Locks wonderful, doesn't it?

VOLDEMORT:
Severus.
I was beginning to worry you had lost your way.
Come, we've saved you a seat.
You bring news, I trust?
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.
YAXLEY:
I've heard differently, my Lord.
Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy...
...will not he moved until the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17.
This is a false trail.
The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that right, haven't they?
[ALL LAUGH]
What say you, Pius?
One hears many things, my Lord.
Whether the truth is among them is not clear.
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.
You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he he taken, the boy?
SNAPE: To a safe house.
Most likely the home of someone in the Order.
I'm told it's been given every manner of protection possible.
Once there, it will he impractical to attack him.
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy.
[YELL IN DISTANCE]
Wormtail!!
Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
Yes, my Lord.
Right away, my Lord.
VOLDEMORT: As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...
...I must he the one to kill Harry Potter.
But I face an unfortunate complication.
That my wand and Potter's share the same core.
They are, in some ways, twins.
We can wound, but not fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him...
...I must do it with another's wand.
Come, surely one of you would like the honor?
Mm?
What about you, Lucius?
My Lord?
"My Lord?"
I require your wand.
Dc I detect elm?
Yes, my Lord.
And the core?
Dragon. Ahem.
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.
- Dragon heartstring.
- Mm.
VOLDEMORT:
To those of you who do not know...
...we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage...
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.
[ALL Chuckle]
It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.
She would, given her way...
...have us mate with them.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

HAGRID: Hello, Harry.
HARRY: All right. Wow.
Hello.
HAGRID: You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.
What say we get undercover before someone murders him?
HARRY:
Evening.
[GRUNTS]
HARRY: I thought you were locking after the Prime Minister.
You are more important.
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.
FRED: He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.
True enough.
Owe it all to a werewolf, name of Greyback.
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.
LUPIN: Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.
My husband, the joker.
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I--
All right. We'll have time for a cozy catch-up later.
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.
Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.
What's the Trace?
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.
We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect:
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.
That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will he...
...they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one?
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
No. Absolutely not.
I told you he'd take it well.
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, I--
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.
Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.
MOODY:
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They've all agreed to take the risk.
[MUNDUNGUS CLEARS THROAT]
Technically, I've been coerced.
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.
All right, Granger, as discussed.
- Blimey, Hermione.
MOODY: Straight in here, if you please.
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:
It tastes like goblin piss.
Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye?
Just trying to diffuse the tension.
Oh.
Ugh.
[ALL GRUNTING]
BOTH:
Wow, we're identical.
MOODY:
Not yet, you're not.
GEORGE: Haven't got anything a hit more sporting, have you?
FRED:
I don't really fancy this color.
MOODY: Well, fancy this, you're not you.
Sc shut it and strip.
MUNDUNGUS:
All right, all right.
You'll need to change too, Potter.
FLEUR:
Bill, lock away. I'm hideous.
RON:
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.
HERMIONE
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.
Right, then. We'll he pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.
- As for Harry--
ALL: Yes?
The real Harry.
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.
MOODY:
You'll ride with Hagrid.
I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.
Seems only right that I should he the one to take you away now.
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.
[HEDWIG SCREECHING]
MOODY: Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.
On the count of three.
Hold tight, Harry.
MOODY:
One...
...two...
...three!
DEATH EATER 1: Which one?
DEATH EATER 2: Where are you?
He's on your right!
He's over there!
DEATH EATER 3:
Down!
Hagrid, we have to help the others!
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.
Hang on.
Stupefy!
[HORN HONKS]
[GAS PS]
Hang on, Harry.

Harry. Hagrid.
What happened? Where are the others?
Is no one else hack?
HAGRID: They were on us right from the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness you two are all right.
HAGRID: The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush.
GINNY: Ron and Tanks should've already been hack.
Dad and Fred as well.
LUPIN
Here!
Quick. Into the house.
Oh, my boy.
Oh. Oh.
[BOTH GRUNT]
- Lupin!
GINNY: What are you doing?
What creature sat in the corner...
...the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!
A Grindylow.
[HARRY SIGHS]
LUPIN:
We've been betrayed.
Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight.
I had to make sure you weren't an impostor.
[WHOOSH IN DISTANCE]
Wait.
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.
Thanks.
TONKS:
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.
- I wouldn't he standing here without him.
HERMIONE: Really?
Always the tone of surprise.
We the last hack?
FRED:
Where's George?
How you feeling, Georgie?
Saint-like.
Come again?
Saint-like. I'm holy.
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?
The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for "I'm holey."
That's pathetic.
Reckon I'm still better-locking than you.
Mad-Eye's dead.
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.
MOODY:
Head for the Burrows.
DUMBLEDORE:
This is beyond anything I imagined.
SLUGHORN: Seven?
RIDDLE: Seven...? A Horcrux.
HARRY:
They could be hidden anywhere.
SLUGHORN:
To rip the soul into seven pieces...
HARRY: If you did destroy each Horcrux...
DUMBLEDORE: One destroys Voldemort.
Trust me.
VOLDEMORT:
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.
[GRUNTS]
RON:
Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.
For you?
You think Mad-Eye died for you?
You think George took that curse for you?
You may he the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
It's always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.
Don't tell her I said that.
Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.
They're our only chance to heat him...
...and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.
Tonight's not the night, mate.
We'd only he doing him a favor.
[HARRY SIGHS]
[BAG THUDS]
Dc you think he knows?
I mean, they're hits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...
...he must have felt something.
To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them.
Where are they?
Where do we start?
FRED:
Ready when you are.
[RON & FRED GRUNTING]
ARTHUR: Please pay attention! it's your brother's wedding. Buck up.
GINNY:
Zip me up, will you?
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?
Given everything that's going on.
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...
...because of everything that's going on.
GEORGE:
Morning.
ARTHUR:
Come on, keep up.
All together now.
One, two, three.
How's it looking at your end, boys?
FRED & GEORGE:
Brilliant.
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.
And this is...?
SCRIMGEOUR: "Herein is set forth the last will and testament...
...cf Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...
...I leave my Deluminator...
...a device of my own making...
...in the hope that, when things seem most dark...
...it will show him the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.
Brilliant.
What is if?
Wicked.
"Tc Hermione Jean Granger...
...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...
...in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive."
RON:
Mom used to read me those.
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pct."
"Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump."
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.
No?
"Tc Harry James Potter...
...I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...
...as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance...
...and skill."
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important historical artifact, it belongs--
HERMIONE:
To Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor.
That does not make it that wizard's property.
And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.
HARRY: Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...
...hut you can't fight this war on your own.
He's too strong.
[FOLK MUSIC PLAYING]
LUNA:
Hello, Harry.
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
Of course not. How are you, Luna?
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler...
...unlike those toadies at The Daily Prophet...
...fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime...
...and, in his death, support you just as fully.
Thank you.
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.
He's just too polite to say so.
XENOPHILIUS:
Harry Potter.
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.
HARRY:
Thanks.
I found what you wrote in The Daily Prophet really moving.
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...
...and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.
Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.
Don't despair, Elphias.
I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter...
...in 800 pages, no less.
Word has it that someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.
A monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
MURIEL: My God, boy...
...she's only the most celebrated magical historian cf the last century.
She was as close to the Dumbledores as anyone.
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...
...to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.
Godric's Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot lives at Godric's Hollow?
Well, that's where she first met Dumbledore.
You don't mean to say he lived there too?
The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.
Oh, it was quite the scandal.
Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?

I used to come to the theater here with Mom and Dad.
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.
This way.
HERMIONE:
We need to change.
RON:
How the ruddy...?
Undetectable Extension Charm.
You're amazing, you are.
Always the tone of surprise.
[THUD]
Ah. That'll be the hooks.
What about all the people at the wedding?
- Do you think we should go hack?
- They were after you.
We'd put everyone in danger by going hack.
[MUFFLED MUSIC

- Ron's right.
WAITRESS: Ahem.
Coffee?
HERMIONE: A cappuccino, please.
- You?
- What she said.
- Same.
Sc where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?
It's too dangerous.
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.
Everyone from the wedding will have gone underground, into hiding.
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
You're joking.

I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.

This one's name is Rowle.
He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.
Sc, what we gonna do with you, hey?
Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?
HARRY:
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.
HERMIONE:
Ron.
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?
It's better we wipe their memories.
You're the boss.
Hermione...
...you're the best at spells.
Obliviate.
HARRY:
How is it they knew we were there?
HERMIONE:
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?
Can't he. Trace breaks at 17. it's wizarding law.
[HERMIONE GASPS]
What?
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.
We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed...
...by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
Right.
Perspective.
We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.
[HERMIONE SHRIEKS]
What was that all about?
Probably Mad-Eye's idea, in case Snape decided to come snooping.
[CLATTERING]
Homenum Revelio.
We're alone.
OLLIVANDER:
I believed another wand--
VOLDEMORT: You lied to me.

I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.
There must he another way.

Harry? Hermione, where are you?
I think I've found something.
Lovely.
"Regulus Arcturus Black."
R.A.B.
HARRY: "l know I will he dead long before you read this.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it."
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.
Yes.
Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?
[CLATTERING]
[KREACHER GRUNTING]
You've been spying on us, have you?
KREACHER:
Kreacher has been watching.
HERMIONE:
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.
HARRY:
Have you ever seen this before?
Kreacher?
It's Master Regulus' locket.
HARRY:
But there were two, weren't there?
Where's the other one?
[KREACHER WHIMPERS]
Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?
Filthy Mudblood.
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.
KREACHER: Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.
Yes.
It was here in this house.
A most evil object.
How do you mean?
Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...
...hut no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things, including the locket.
Who did?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
[DOOR OPENS]
My father will hear about this.
NEVILLE:
Hey, losers.
He isn't here.
As your new Minister for Magic...
...I promise to restore this temple of tolerance...
...to its former glory.
Therefore, beginning today...
...each employee will submit themselves...
...for evaluation.
But know this:
You have nothing to fear...
...if you have nothing to hide.

That Dumbledore had hidden something inside it.

MUNDUNGUS [IN NORMAL VOICE]:

As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...
- Expelliarmus.

What you playing at? Setting a pair of bleeding house-elves after me.
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.
And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.

I'm a purveyor of rare and wondrous objects.
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.
Master Weasley, so good to see you again.
Wicked trainers.
[NEWSPAPERS THUD]
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?
Could I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?
KREACHER: You...
HERMIONE: Tell the truth.
When you turned this place over--
Don't deny it.
-- you found a locket, am I right?
Why? Was it valuable?
HERMIONE:
You still got it?
No, he's worried he didn't get enough money for it.
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?
[SIGHS]
There I was, flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...
...when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license.
Says she's a mind to lock me up.
And would've done it too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- NO, I--
Well, she's there. Lock.
Bleeding how and all.
[GRUNTS]
[SNORING]
Right, remember what we said.
Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.
If we do that, then with a hit of luck, we'll get inside.
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.
- Correct.
- Yeah.
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.
The world's mental.
Come on...
...we've got a Horcrux to find.
[TOILETS FLUSHING]
RON:
We flush ourselves in.
That's bloody disgusting.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
GUARD 1:
Name?
GUARD 2:
You. Come.
MAN: What? What?
GUARD 2: Come on.
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.
HARRY: Are those-- ?
HERMIONE: Muggles.
In their rightful place.
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a hit.
How long did you say this hatch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?
I didn't.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
YAXLEY:
Cattermole.
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You do realize I'm going downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now, if my wife's blood status were in doubt...
...and the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement...
...needed a job doing, l think l might just make that a priority.
You have one hour.
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.
FEMALE VOICE [OVER SPEAKERS]:

RON:
But how do I stop it raining?
HERMIONE:
Try "Finite lncantatem."
FEMALE VOICE:
Department of Magical Law Enforcement...
...and Improper Use of Magic Department.
HERMIONE:
This is you, Ron.
Finite lncantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?
FEMALE VOICE: Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.
If we don't locate Umbridge within the hour...
...we go find Ron and come hack another day.
- Deal?
- Yes.
Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?
Good, we'll go straight down.
Albert, aren't you getting cut?

Let's calm down, shall we?
Let's get hack to work, please.
Calm down.
Runcorn.

Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you locked like.
Where's Hermione?
She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge.
[ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS]
RON:
Bloody cold down here.
ALDERTON:
I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside cut.
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.
We must go hack. I'm half-blood.
UMBRIDGE: Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
MARY: Yes.
UMBRIDGE: Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,

MARY: Yes.
- it's here.
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?
Wife to Reginald?
Reg?
Thank you, Albert.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
Yes.
A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today.
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?
MARY:
I didn't take it.
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You're lying.
Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.
Reg, tell them what I am.
[WHIRRING AND CHITTERING]
What on earth are you doing, Albert?
You're lying, Dolores.
And one mustn't tell lies.
Stupefy!

It is, isn't it?
This'll he one to tell the kids.

Mary, go home.
Get the kids.
I'll meet you there. We have to get out of the country, understand?
Mary, do as I say.
Mary?
Who's that?
Long story. Nice meeting you.

Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag.
There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."
Shh. Shh.
Okay, okay. Quickly.
- Accio Dittany.
HERMIONE: Shh.
It's all right. Unstopper it.
Hermione, his arm.
I know, just do it.
It's okay.
- Okay, it's gonna sting a little hit.
- What happened? I thought we meant...
- ...to he going hack to Grimmauld Place.
HERMIONE: We were. We were. Shh.
It's all right. One more, one more.
We were there, we were there, but Yaxley had hold of me, and I...
I knew once he'd seen where we were, we couldn't stay...
...so I brought us here...
...hut Ron got splinched.
It's all right.

Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...
...to find all these Horcruxes, but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.
Doesn't that bother you?
[SIGHS]
MAN [ON RADIO]:
A goblin by the name of Gornuk was killed.
It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...
...both believed to have been traveling with Tanks, Cresswell...
...and Gornuk, may have escaped.
If Dean is listening or anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts...
...his parents and sisters are desperate for news.
Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home.
VOLDEMORT [WHISPERS IN VOICEOVER]:
You know the spell, Harry.
[GAS PS]
Tell me.
Tell me, Gregorovitch.
GREGOROVITCH:
It was stolen from me.
Who was he? The thief?
GREGOROVITCH:
It was a boy. It was he who took it.
I never saw it again.
I swear on my life.
I believe you.

You can't keep letting him in, Harry.
HARRY:

The wandmaker?
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have...
...hut I don't know what.
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.
[STATIC CRACKLES ON RADIO]
HERMIONE:
Don't.
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.
What's he expecting to hear, good news?
MAN [ON RADIO]: -- who long expected it, the fall of the Ministry was shocking.
I think he just hopes he doesn't hear had news.
We promise to remain your eyes and ears--
How long before he can travel?
-- bringing you news when we can, from wherever we can.
I'm doing everything I can.
You're not doing enough!

Take it off.
I said, take it off now.
- Better?
- Loads.
We'll take it in turns, okay?

And now, other news:
Severus Snape, newly-appointed headmaster of Hogwarts...
...has decreed that all students must conform to the latest house rules.
[RUSTLING]
Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the school under Dumbledore's leadership.
Snape's curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...
...and infractions are dealt with harshly by the two Death Eaters on staff.
[RUSTLING]
What'S that?
What's that smell?

Well, then, we'll go on foot.
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

HERMIONE:
I'll tell you in a minute.
HARRY:
Maybe you could tell me now.
The sword of Gryffindor, it's goblin-made.
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
Okay.
Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right?
Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...
- ...in that bloody headed bag of yours...
- Don't you see?
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.
Its blade is impregnated with Basilisk venom.
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.
Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail...
...and perceive clearly that which others overlook.
Yeah, there's only one problem, of course.
RON:
The sword was stolen.
Yeah, I'm still here.
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Not according to you, anyway.
Lock, if you've got something to say, don't he shy. Spit it cut.
All right, I'll spit it cut.
But don't expect me to he grateful...
...because there's another damn thing we've gotta find.
I thought you knew what you signed up for.
Yeah. I thought I did too.
Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.
What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?
Did you think we were gonna he staying in a hotel?
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd he hack by Christmas?
I just thought, after all this time...
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.
I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile.
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.
In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux.
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them.
Ron. Please, take--
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't he saying this...
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.
RON:
Want to know why I listen to that radio?
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom.
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!
No, you don't know how it feels!
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.
HERMIONE: Stop. Stop.
HARRY: Fine, then go!
Go, then!
Fine.
Ron.
And you?
Are you coming or you staying?
Fine. I get it.

Hermione? You were right.
Snitches have flesh memories...
...hut I didn't catch the first Snitch with my hand, I almost swallowed it.
- "l open at the close."
- What do you think that means?
I don't know.
I found something as well.
At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is.
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary.
Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the hook. Somebody drew it.
HARRY: Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Why would someone draw it in a children's book?
Lock, Hermione, I've been thinking.
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.
It's where I was horn. it's where my parents died.
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you.
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost died there.
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd he likely to hide a Horcrux?
It's dangerous, Harry.
[HERMIONE SIGHS]
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.
I think it's possible something else is hidden there.
What?
HERMIONE:
The sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...
...where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?
Hermione...
Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.
I still think we should've used
Polyjuice Potion.
No.
This is where I was horn.
I'm not returning as someone else.

Like nothing's changed.
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.
If I brought my parents back here now, they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.
Not the trees, not the river...
...not even me.
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.
Grow old.
You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.
I know.

HARRY: He's the thief I saw in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.
Speaking of which, where is my wand?
Where's my wand, Hermione?
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.
I'm sorry.

Why did you come hack?
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.
What is that?
You destroyed it.
And how is it that you just happen to have the sword of Gryffindor?
It's a long story.
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?
Lock, I wanted to come hack as soon as I left.
- I just didn't know how to find you.
HARRY: Yeah, how did you find us?
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.
I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub...
...keeping away from some Snatchers...
...and I heard it.
If?
A voice...
...your voice, Hermione...
...coming out of it.
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.
Just my name.
Like a whisper.
Sc I took it, clicked it, and this tiny hall of light appeared.
And I knew.
And sure enough, it floated toward me, the hall of light...
...went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here.
And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...
...and came to this hillside.
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.
I just hoped that one of you would show yourself.
And you did.
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.
How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
Well, just keep talking about that little hall of light touching your heart...
...and she'll come round.
It was true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy...
...hut I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator.
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way hack, and she'd lead me.
Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you?
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.
Took if off a Snatcher a couple of weeks ago.
Don't tell Hermione this, but they're a hit dim, Snatchers.
This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him.
Engorgio.
- Reducio!
HERMIONE: What's going on in there?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
We need to talk.
Yeah, all right.
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?
See this?
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Lock at the signature.
It's the mark again.
It keeps cropping up.
In Beedle the Bard, in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.
HARRY:
It was there too.
- Where?
HARRY: Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.
But what does it mean?
Lock, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...
...hut this, this means something.
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood.
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?
You're not still mad at him, are you?
I'm always mad at him.
RON:
Luna.
HERMIONE & HARRY:
Luna.
[KNOCKING]
"Keep off the dirigible plums."
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.
Could we come in?
HERMIONE: Where is Luna?
- Luna?
She'll he along.
Sc how can I help you, Mr. Potter?
Well, actually...
It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
You mean this?
Yes.
That exactly.
What we've wondered is, what is it?
What is if?
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.
RON & HERMIONE: The what?
- The what?
The Deathly Hallows.
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."
RON & HERMIONE: Yes.
- No.
HERMIONE:
I have it in here.
"There were once three brothers...
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight."
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight"
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.
HERMIONE:
Dc you want to read it?
RON:
No. it's fine.
HERMIONE:
"There were once three brothers...
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.
But being learned in the magical arts...
...the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.
Before they could cross, however...
...they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death, and he felt cheated.
Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.
But Death was cunning.
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic...
...and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.
The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.
So Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby.
The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further...
...and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.
So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.
A humble man...
...he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place...
...without being followed by Death.
And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
The first brother traveled to a distant village...
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...
...he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled.
Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him...
...he bragged of his invincibility.
But that night, another wizard stole the wand...
...and slit the brother's throat for good measure.
And so Death took the first brother for his own.
The second brother journeyed to his home...
...where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death...
...appeared before him.
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.
Driven mad with hopeless longing...
...the second brother killed himself so as to join her.
And so Death took the second brother.
As for the third brother...
...Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.
Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother...
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son.
He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly...
...departing this life as equals."
[SQUAKING]
XENOPHILIUS: Sc there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.
[MUMBLING]
Where's that pen I had?
The Elder Wand.
The most powerful wand ever made.
The Resurrection Stone.
The Cloak of Invisibility.
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
Together, they make one master of Death.
That mark was on a grave in Godric's Hollow.
Uh, Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell Family...
...have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?
Uh-- uh-- lgnotus-- Excuse me. -- and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...
...are thought to he the original owners of the Hallows...
...and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh-- Uh--
But your tea's gone cold.
I'll he right hack.
Let's go down here.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff, hot or cold.
Thank you, sir.
- You forgot the water.
- Water?
For the tea.
Did-- ? Did I?
[XENOPHILIUS LAUGHING]
How silly of me.
It's no matter.
We really should he going anyway.
No, you can't!
[MUMBLING]
HARRY:
Sir?
You're my only hope.
They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing.
Sc they took her.
They took my Luna.
My Luna.
But it's really you they want.
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
[SHRIEKING]
[HERMIONE SHRIEKS]
Stop! I've got him!
[G ROANS]
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?
They kidnapped her because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello, beautiful.
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.
[ALL PANTING]
[HERMIONE YELLS]
[GRUNTS]
[grunting]
[G ROANS]
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...
...hut surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Tell me who possesses it.
The Elder Wand lies with him, of course...
...buried in the earth.
Dumbledore.
[PANTING THEN SIGHS]
HARRY:
The Hallows exist...
...hut he's only after one of them, the last one. He knows where it is.
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.
- Don't touch her. Unh!
HERMIONE: Leave him.
SCABIOR:
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...
Get off me.
...if he doesn't learn to behave himself.
[HARRY & RON GRUNTING]
What happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
SCABIOR:
Check it.
[HERMIONE GRUNTING]
And you, my lovely...
...what do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.
[SNIFFS]
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.
GREYBACK: Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.
How come you don't want us to know who you are?
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.
BELLATRIX [WHISPERS]:
Get Draco.
[GRUNTS AND PANTS]
BELLATRIX:
Well?
DRACO: I can't he sure.
- [WHISPERS] Draco. Lock closely, son.
If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...
...everything would he forgiven.
All would he as it was, you understand?
Now, we won't he forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
Lucius.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Don't he shy, sweetie. Come over.
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all.
We need to he absolutely sure.
What's wrong with his face?
BELLATRIX:
Yes, what is wrong with his face?
SCABIOR:
He came to us like that.
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.
Ah. Got you.
[LAUGHING THEN GASPS]
What is that?
Where'd you get that from?
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.
[BELLATRIX GRUNTING]
[Hisses]
SCABIOR:
Are you mad?
[GROANING AND CHOKING]
Go! Get cut!
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.
I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl.
[BOTH GRUNT]
[DOOR CLOSES]
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.
GIRL:
Ron?
Harry?
Luna?
That sword is meant to he in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?
What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!
[SOBBING] I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.
I don't believe it.
[SCREAMING]
[BELLATRIX LAUGHS]
We have to do something.
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. it's enchanted.
HERMIONE: Please! please!
BELLATRIX: Shut up!
LUNA:
You're bleeding, Harry.
That's a curious thing to keep in your sock.
[HERMIONE CONTINUES SCREAMING]
Help us.
- Let her go.
WORMTAIL: Shut up. Get hack.
You, goblin, come with me.
[DOBBY GRUNTS]
- Aah!
- Dobby?
What are you doing here?
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.
Dobby will always he there for Harry Potter.
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.
Works for me.
Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--
Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
Trust me.
Whenever you're ready, sir.
Sir? I like her very much.
[DOBBY MUMBLING]
Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.
[GRUNTS]
Ow.
Who gets his wand?
BELLATRIX: I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin.
Think very, very carefully before you answer.
GRIPHOOK:
I don't know.
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?
GRIPHOOK: When I was last in your vault, the sword was there.
BELLATRIX: Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
GRIPHOOK:
There is no place safer than Gringotts.
Liar!
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.
The same won't he said for this one.
Like hell.
Expelliarmus!
Stupefy.
BELLATRIX:
Stop!
Drop your wands.
I said, drop them!
Pick them up, Draco, now.
Well, well, well, lock what we have here.
It's Harry Potter.
He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord.
Call him.
Call him.
[SQUEAKING]
[BELLATRIX YELLS]
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Stupefy!
BELLATRIX:
Stupid elf.
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.
Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.
[NARCISSA GRUNTS]
How dare you take a witch's wand?
How dare you defy your masters?
Dobby has no master.
Dobby is a free elf.
And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.
[WHOOSH]
[HARRY PANTING]
Hermione.
You're all right. We're safe.
We're all safe.
DOBBY:
Harry Potter.
Dobby.
[DOBBY GROANS]
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.
Hold on. Lock, just hold on, okay?
We'll fix you.
Hermione will have something.
In your bag. Hermione?
Hermione?
What is it? Help me.
Such a beautiful place...
...to he with friends.
Dobby is happy to he with his friend...
...Harry Potter.
We should close his eyes.
Don't you think?
There.
Now he could he sleeping.
I want to bury him.
Properly. Without magic.
BEEFEATER:
Admiral Collingwood!
Well, Admiral?
Great news,
Your Majesty!
The French are defeated at last.
Also the Russians, the Portuguese, the Chinese and the Welsh.
Then our navy rules the ocean.
Almost entirely,
Your Majesty.
"Almost"?
Unfortunately, just here, we're still having a little trouble with...
...pirates.
What does it say on my royal crest, Admiral?
"I hate pirates," ma'am.
Exactly.
Hate them.
With their idiotic shanties!
And their ridiculous hats!
And their endless, blasted roaring!
I want them sunk,
Admiral!
Scuppered, smashed, fed to the sharks.
Do you hear me?
I hate pirates!
It's the looting.
It's the cutlasses.
It's the looting!
It's the cutlasses!
Looting!
Cutlasses!
Looting!
Oh!
Sorry, Captain.
We were just discussing what's the best bit about being a pirate.
Oh, YOU were, were you?
I suggested it might be the looting.
Whereas I contend it's the shiny cutlasses.
And I thought it was the chance to catch exotic diseases.
Hmm.
Well, you're, all of you, wrong.
The best bit about being a pirate isn't the looting or the cutlasses.
It's not the grog or the scurvy.
Or the scantily clad mermaids.
The best bit about being a pirate is Ham Night!
Ham Night!
PIRATE: Ham Night!
ALL: Ham!
(CHEERING,
EXCITED CHATTER CONTINUES)
PIRATE: On your nose.
Go, Captain. Go, Captain.
Hey! Hey!
Ooh!
It's like a meat ballet.
To Ham Night!
Ham!
And to the Pirate Captain!
Pirate Captain!
Pirate Captain!
How was that, Number Two?
You've still got it, Captain.
I'd take a jellyfish in the face for that man.
Okay, now, shush, shush, shush.
Settle down, lads. Shush.
Lads, lads.
Pirates!
It's not all about me.
Don't be modest.
No, no, no.
Behind every captain with glittering eyes and a luxuriant beard...
Luxuriant!
That's what it is.
...there's a crew of briny rogues.
Briny rogues!
Sure, some of you are as ugly as a sea cucumber.
Will you get away with ya?
Some of you are closer to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate.
And some of you are just fish
I've dressed up in a hat.
But you're still the best crew a captain could wish for.
Oh, oh!
Don't forget Polly.
And not forgetting, never forgetting...
...Polly. The finest parrot to sail the seven seas.
Come on, girl.
ALBINO PIRATE:
I love her beady eyes.
Who's the feathery heart and soul of our boat?
Is it you? Is it you?
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
It's definitely you, isn't it?
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Right. (STUTTERS)
Where was I?
Ah, yes! Ah, yes.
Important announcement.
(GASPS) PIRATE: Ooh!
Shh-shh, shh-shh!
By order of the Pirate King himself...
The Pirate of the Year Awards?
Are you going to...
(DEEP VOICE) Are you going to enter again?
That I am, Surprisingly
Curvaceous Pirate.
I know it hasn't worked out perfectly for the last...
20 year.
20 years, yeah.
Exactly, Pirate with Gout.
20 years.
It might be a bit more.
Yes, yes.
Thank you, thank you.
PIRATE 1: You were very good, though.
PIRATE 2: Shush!
The point is, every time I've entered I've failed to win.
So by the sheer law of maths...
Ooh! Maths.
...I must have a really good chance this time.
Are you with me, lads?
Yes! This can only end brilliantly.
Then let's go plundering!

J' Back with milady and the fires burnt tall

PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Excuse me. Mind out.
Captain coming through.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
One Pirate of the Year entry form, if you please.
Thank you.
Now, let's see.
"Booty"?
Oh, yes.
"Roaring." Check.
Shanties.
I shall put "rousing."
"Beard"?
Luxuriant.
Obviously. Duh.
Do you think I should sign it in blood?
Make it more dramatic?
Might be a bit on the showy side.
Bit too much.
You might be right.
Pirate Captain.
You can't lose, Captain.
I'd bet my face.
Well, thank you,
Albino Pirate.
You're a shoo-in, sir.
Sure, there's not a pirate on the seven seas can match you.
Lock up your daughters!
It's me,
Peg-Leg Hastings!
Back from plunderin' the Spanish Main.
Oh, good grief.
And I reckon this will make me
Pirate of the Year.
Don't worry, sir.
He's all flash and no bang.
ALBINO PIRATE:
Ah, Cutlass Liz.
The Butcher of Barbados.
Hello, boys.
Whoa.
You're probably all wondering if I'm still as deadly as I am beautiful.
Well, I am.
Hello, Cutlass, you trollop.
Peg-Leg, you pile of squid bait.
Check it out, lubbers.
The world's biggest diamond.
That baby's got my name on it.
She doesn't even have a beard.
Oh, sweet Neptune's briny pants.
Black Bellamy.
Roar!
Read it and weep, ya coves!
That's right, Black Bellamy is gonna be Pirate of the Year.
Again.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Grog for everybody!
Grog for everybody!
Wow, we are rubbish compared to them, aren't we?
Perhaps we should be off, sir.
Yes.
Yes, yes, good point.
(STAMMERS) I just remembered, actually, I have some very important bits of rope
I need to untangle.
BELLAMY: Thank you.
Well, if it isn't the Pirate Captain.
Oh! (CHUCKLES)
Hello, Bellamy.
Cutlass. Peg-Leg.
Didn't notice you come in.
The beard's looking great, my man.
And I see that you're more wanted than ever.
(GUFFAWING,
MOCKING LAUGHTER)
Come on, everybody, be nice.
Give him a break.
Bring it down a little bit.
All right.
Seriously, Captain, how's the pirating business treating you?
Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly.
Thanks for asking. (CHUCKLES)
Treasure coming out of my eyeballs.
Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes.
CUTLASS LIZ:
Oh, really?
If you've got so much booty, then how come you're still sailing that old wreck?
Anyway, look, (CLEARS THROAT) I'd love to stay and chat, but, you know, places to pillage, people to...
People to skewer.
Huh?
Ugh!
Ooh.
Oh, come on!
That is disgusting.
Wait a minute.
Captain, what is this?
What?
Captain?
Oh, that's nothing. Could I possibly have that back?
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
Thank you.
"Pirate of the Year"?
You're entering
Pirate of the Year?
No, no, no, no, no.
Uh, yes.
Again?
Yes!
BOTH: Ooh!
Come on. Listen, did they change the rules?
I mean, I always thought they gave it to the pirate with the most booty.
Do they now just give it to the guy with the fattest parrot?
She is not fat.
She's just big-boned.
She's fat, dude.
Yeah, go on.
Go on, then, laugh.
Everyone laugh.
Ignore them, Captain.
It's not worth it.
The trophy would just clash with your wallpaper, anyway.
You'll see, you'll see.
I will be
Pirate of the Year.
Oh, yes.
And then you'll be laughing on the other side of your faces.
Yes.
And believe me, that is a very painful thing to do.
Come on, lads.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
All right, now listen up, you coves.
'We'll show those swabs a thing or two about pirating.
There's still time to fill these chests with sparkling booty.
I can practically taste that trophy!
Trophy! Trophy! Trophy!
Captain!
Sail off the port bow!
Aha!
Let's get after her,
Number Two.
Aye, aye, sir.
Clap on all sail!
Royals and topgallants!
PIRATE:
Release those gallants!
Aha!
Fire those long things that go bang.
Fire cannons four and six!
Eat cannonball, lubbers.
Here we go, lads!
Look and learn.
Yee-haw!
Go get 'em, Pirate Captain!
Avast!
I'm the Pirate Captain.
And I'm here for your gold.
Gold? This is a plague boat, old man.
I'd give my right arm for some gold.
Or my left. (CHUCKLES)
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Right, lads.
Minor hiccup, that last one.
This time, it's payday!
Aha!
I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold.
Geography field trip.
Aha! I'm the
Pirate Captain, and...
Naturists.
Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.
Ghost ship.
Sorry.
Mmm.
Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir.
Mm-hmm. That's nice.
Do you want to give the order to attack?
No, not really, Number Two.
No, I think I've...
Think I had enough of piracy.
I'm hanging up my cutlass.
Captain, no!
Yeah, I was thinking I might go into baby clothes, actually.
What?
I hear there's a fortune to be made in baby clothes because babies grow so fast.
No, but you can't.
I mean, the crew...
They'd... They'd be lost without you.
Oh, what was I thinking,
Number Two?
Pirate of the Year?
Me?
Look at the trophy cabinet.
Best Anecdote About a Squid.
I mean, that is all I've got to show for my entire career.
Pirate of the Year?
It's just commercialized nonsense.
Real piracy isn't about trophies.
It's about fighting up staircases backwards.
It's about sliding down sails with a knife in your teeth.
Beard glossiness!
And think about all the adventures we've had.
Our adventure with Aztecs.
Our adventure with that pig.
Our adventure with...
Shh!
Okay, maybe not the librarians.
But the fun we've had.
And what about the shanties?
Well, I mean... People would miss my shanties.
And the running people through.
Well, I... I do enjoy running people through.
Enjoy it?
You're brilliant at it!
You're a brine-soaked terror of the high seas!
Do you think so, Number Two?
Everyone does!
You're more of a pirate than
Black Bellamy or any of them.
You're a real pirate.
That's why the crew, they think you're the best thing since boil-in-the-bag ham.
Why do you think they all got that tattoo? Come on.
What do you say?
Arrr!
By Neptune, where's that ship?
MAN: Ooh!
This is the one, lads!
Ninth time lucky!
I can feel it in my beard!
Well, don't just sit there like lemons!
Hoist the flag!
Standard, sir?
Or extra gruesome?
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Extra gruesome!
Let's make their gizzards shake.
DARWIN: Journal of
Charles Darwin.
Day 93 aboard the Beagle.
I have, today, discovered a new kind of barnacle, which I have categorized in the order of Pygophora.
I'll never get a girlfriend. lam so unhappy.
(CANNONBALL WHISTLING
THROUGH AIR)
And now I'm being attacked by pirates.
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold.
I haven't got any gold.
No gold, eh?
Then what, might I ask, is this?
It's a baboon's kidney.
Is it?
Oh.
And what about this?
Oh, it's another baboon's kidney.
We searched the hold, Captain.
And?
Just creatures.
Bits of creatures in jars.
And an unhappy-looking baboon.
What kind of ship is this?
(STAMMERING) We're a...
Well, we were a scientific expedition.
Charles Darwin, at your service, sir.
Oh, for pity's sake!
Is it so much to ask? Is it?
I just want one tiny bit of success!
One teensy weensy bit of respect from my peers just once in my life!
Is that such a crime?
Is it?
No?
No!
(GASPS) No.
Oh, but you try telling that to the universe.
Just once, just once for things to go right.
Just... Just once.
So, are we done here?
DARWIN: Dear Diary, about to meet a watery grave.
NUMBER TWO: It's nothing personal, you understand.
It's just...
It's been a tough week, and a good plank walk usually cheers him up.
Will die without reaching second base with a lady.
Oh, get on with it!
Today's weather: inclement.
Stop! PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Oh, now what?
Last request, is it?
Do we have to grant those?
Is there some sort of human rights convention we're signed up to?
But that bird!
My parrot?
She's just big-boned!
No, she's not. I mean... I mean, she's not a parrot.
Not a parrot?
What's he on about, old girl?
She's... She's...
She's the scientific discovery of our age!
She's a... (PLANK
THUMPS, DARWIN SCREAMS)
Huh?
Sorry. It's just, that's my favorite bit.
A dodo, you say?
They've been extinct for 150 years.
To find one alive today, it's quite incredible.
Whoa!
Well, clever old girl.
Not going extinct.
If I might be so bold,
I would be prepared to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly.
Polly's not for sale.
Ten pound.
She's one of the family.
She's like an auntie.
With a beak.
Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles.
Polly here is the feathery heart and soul of the boat.
Come on, little dodo.
Oh.
It's such a missed opportunity.
If I could've presented her in London to the Royal Society at their annual science show...
(CHUCKLES) No question of that, I'm afraid.
She'd have been an absolute sensation.
Yeah, well, can't be helped.
And of course a shoo-in for the top prize.
Prize?
For best scientific discovery. Yes.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
This prize, valuable, is it?
Valuable?
It's priceless.
Untold riches.
Captain...
No, no, no, no.
I was thinking, perhaps perhaps
I was being a touch hasty.
But, Captain, London?
The home of Queen Victoria, mortal enemy of pirates everywhere?
We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock.
(SCOFFS) Oh, pah!
We laugh in the face of danger, remember?
Um, I don't.
I don't really like danger at all.
Captain, do you remember the little talk we had?
The one about whether pigs are actually a type of fruit?
No.
No.
The one about us trying to avoid harebrained schemes that end in us facing certain death.
You heard the man,
Number Two.
"Untold riches."
Here's the plan.
We go to London, Polly wins this science show thingy we take the prize money, I enter
Pirate of the Year, I win!
Bingo!
But, Captain, I'm not sure...
It can't fail.
And besides, look at her little face.
(HIGH-PITCHED) I sure want to win that science prize.
Squawk!
Bravo, Captain!
I see you're a man of vision!
Right, then, Charles. When is this science show of yours?
A week tomorrow.
Ah, confound it!
You see, we could've made that with a good wind behind us, but unfortunately there's this dirty great sea monster in the way.
Um, mmm, I think they just add those onto maps for decoration, Captain.
Is that a fact?
Well, blow me down.
(LAUGHS) I dare, you could learn something from this fine fellow,
Number Two.
J' London calling to the faraway towns
J' London calling to the faraway towns
J' Now war is declared and battle come down
J' London calling to the underworld
J' Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
J' London calling, see, we ain't got no high
♪ 'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
J' Now get this
J' London calling, yes, I was there, too
J' And you know what they said?
Well, some of it was true
J' London calling at the top of the dial
J' And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Ah! London Town.
The most romantic city in the world.
J' I never felt so much alike alike, alike, alike... J'
"Queen Victoria
"welcomes you to London."
Ah, that's nice.
Perhaps she's not so bad after all.
Well, don't look so worried,
Number Two.
Pirates are always visiting London.
Turn back!
This is the fate of pirates here!
Is that Scarlett Morgan?
Pirate Captain.
Goodness me!
I haven't seen you since that business in Madagascar.
Ah, yes. I could've sworn they were girls.
You're looking well, Morgan.
Yeah, lost a bit of weight.
What are you up to these days?
Oh, you know, this and that.
Yeah, just gonna enter a science competition, actually.
Ah! Good luck with that.
Yeah, thanks, thanks.
Eh?
No, no, wait, wait!
Turn back!
Turn back.
Oops. Sorry.
Oh, no!
Look what you've done to me boat.
Look at the state of it.
I hope you've got some insurance, 'cause I...
Ow.
Right, then. We'll be off.
I'll bring her back tomorrow straight after the show.
Well, don't be daft, Charles.
I'll be presenting Polly.
You?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I always fancied trying my hand at a spot of science.
But you can't. I mean, the streets of London are no place for pirates.
Pirates? What pirates?
Nobody here but us Girl Guides.
Yes!
I've got a badge for looting.
We're not really Girl Guides.
It's us, the pirates.
We're masters of disguise.
How ingenious.
But all the same, Captain, best we lie low for the night.
Perhaps at my house.
Captain, I really think...
Good plan, Chuck.
Be fun to see how you boffin types live.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, come on. Taxi!
Evening, Officer.
Hidey-ho, ladies.
ALBINO PIRATE:
London smells like Grandma.
Whoa.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
You don't get many women back here, do you, Charles?
People who live alone are always serial killers.
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Sweet Neptune on a bike!
DARWIN:
Oh, don't mind Mr. Bobo.
Just an old project of mine.
Project?
Yeah, I had this theory.
I thought that if you took a monkey, gave him a monocle and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass, then he would cease to be a monkey and become more of a...
A man-panzee, if you will.
Bold theory.
I don't like the monkey.
But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny.
He's not a patch on Polly here.
Oh!
Anyhow, big day tomorrow.
We all need our rest.
Let me show you to your room, Captain.
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Right behind you, Chuck.
DARWIN: (WHISPERING)
Now, shh, here's the plan.
You know what to do. Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep, then sneak into his room and...
Shh!
Captain.
It's... It's Mr. Darwin, sir.
I'm sure he's up to no good.
Oh, honestly, Number Two, what's got into you?
Thanks to Charles, we're about to win lavish untold riches, and here you are trying to find fault with the poor fellow.
Yes, but... No, no, no.
Not another word.
A future Pirate of the Year needs his beauty sleep.
Do you think you could make nautical noises until we drop off?
Oh, that's lovely.
Now, that is lovely.
Can you do the shiver a timber?
Oh... Mmm.
And just chuck in a few gulls, would you?
Caw, caw, caw!
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, our winner.
Give it up for the Pirate Captain!
Congratulations,
Pirate Captain.
Nobody deserves this more than you.
Thanks, Cutlass.
And that beard of yours, (GASPS) it drives me crazy.
Give it here.
Give it back,
Bellamy, it's mine!
No, give it back.
Neptune's navel!
Come back here, you lubber.
Stop, thief!
I'll take that.
Not so fast, my friend.
Number Two!
Number Two, are you all right?
Unhand that dodo!
Whoa!
Evening, Captain.
(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING,
CRACKING)
Oh, Number Two!
We're under attack!
Abandon ship!
Hello, Pirate Captain,
Pirate with a Scarf!
Come back here,
Mysterious Shadowy Figure!
Faster! Faster!
Got you!
Are you all right, girl?
Captain!
I mean, what's going on?
Don't play the innocent.
You and your hench-monkey tried to steal Polly.
Steal Polly? Oh, dear me, no, you're mistaken.
Then how do you explain this?
Well, I think it's obvious what's happened, isn't it?
Is it?
Some jealous rival scientist must have tried to make off with the dodo.
Well, that explains everything.
Captain, please, let's go.
Polly's not safe in London.
I couldn't bear it if something happened to Polly.
Nothing is going to happen to Polly.
She'll be perfectly safe.
Leave everything to me.
Now, come on, we can't keep that prize waiting.
Um... Anyone got a towel?
DARWIN: Nice going, banana butt.
Now this briny buffoon is gonna grab all the glory.
It's a disaster.
It's...
Bad news,
I'm afraid, Captain.
You can't go in.
Eh?
Mmm.
It's strictly scientists only, you see.
I'll just have to present Polly myself.
We're not really scientists.
It's us, the pirates.
See? (CHUCKLES)
Masters of disguise.
But where's Polly?
That is on a need-to-know basis from here on in, Charles.
Pardon?
I am keeping her hidden.
That shadowy figure could be anywhere.
Luckily, I am not only a master of disguises,
I am also a master of hiding things.
Right, lads, let's show these boffins what's what.
But, Captain.
Really, I...
Hello!
(BELL DINGS) We're here for the science show.
We're scientists.
Hmm?
That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin, and I am the Scientist Captain.
If you're a scientist, name three elements.
Oh, well, let's see now.
There's...
There's gold, ham...
Mmm-hmm?
...and the tears of a mermaid.
Yeah, two out of three Close enough.
First on your left.
The balloon of my airship contains
20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Just here, you will notice the open log fire to ensure a comfortable temperature at higher altitudes.
Ooh!
Captain?
Captain, Captain, please.
You can't possibly appear on stage without Polly.
Patience, Charles.
All in good time.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Sorry.
SCIENTIST: Idiot!
Just a tick.
Oh, but, Captain...
How on earth did...
My airship will revolutionize the fields of meteorology and cartography.
But mostly, it's for looking down ladies' tops.
Ingenious.
Captain, I really, really think it would be best if I take over from here.
There's a certain manner in which these things are conduc...
Nonsense, Chuck.
What this science stuff needs is a bit of showmanship!
Look, it's the captain.
Captain! Captain!
Shh!
Fellow scientists, poindexters, geeks, prepare to be confounded.
Prepare to be amazed.
Prepare to...
Oh-ho, wait a second.
What's this?
What's this?
Stop!
I am the world's leading doctor, and I declare the science you are doing is too shocking by half.
Dr. Albino, are you saying that those of a nervous disposition should leave immediately, in case the sheer unexpected remarkableness of my discovery should cause their hearts to explode?
Uh... lam.
Well, science lovers, you have been warned.
This is our most educational adventure ever.
(PLAYING
ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA)
Back from the dead.
Back from beyond the grave.
Back to astound you all.
The ninth wonder of the world.
She's traveled halfway across the globe to be here tonight.
Here's Polly!
MAN: It's a dodo.
By Jove.
That is astounding!
An actual dodo!
Makes electricity look like a pile of crap.
(LIGHT BULB CRACKLING
WITH ELECTRICITY)
MAN:
The Royal Society's prize for best scientific discovery...
Oh, I hope it's not a check.
...Is awarded to...
Have you any idea what the sterling-doubloon exchange rate is these days?
...the Scientist Captain.
Thank you, thank you.
You're too kind.
Please stop.
Enough. Thank you.
Thank you.
(GASPS) Is that it?
Oh, no.
Ah, good.
You also get this leather-bound set of encyclopedias.
Excuse me just one moment.
Thank you.
Okay, Chuck.
Now, I like encyclopedias as much as the next man, but they're not exactly gonna help me win Pirate of the Year, are they?
Where's the booty?
Booty? What booty?
The prize! The "untold riches," remember?
Oh.
Perhaps I didn't explain.
It's not all about money.
No, the real prize is...
MAN: Her Royal Majesty, the Empress of India,
Ruler of the Kingdom of Java...
...a personal audience with...
...Defender of the Faith,
Queen Victoria!
Queen Victoria herself.
Scientist Captain, congratulations.
What a tremendous discovery.
(STAMMERING) Your, uh...
Your Majesty.
And who are these charming fellows?
Well, this is my crew.
By which he means lab assistant crew.
Yes, yes. I'm using "crew" in the street sense.
Yo.
And I'm Charles Darwin,
Your Majesty.
I helped find the dodo.
Yes, whatever.
But where has your delightful creature disappeared to?
Resting, ma'am.
Hidden away.
I only let her out for the big performance, I'm afraid.
In case sinister forces should try to make off with her, you see.
Sinister forces?
Ooh, dear.
Well, we have a wonderful petting zoo at the palace where Polly would be quite safe.
Perhaps we could take her off your hands.
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's out of the question.
But she'd have a lovely time.
There are guinea pigs and a donkey.
No, no, I couldn't, ma'am.
Not even for little old me?
No, no, no,
I'm afraid not, ma'am.
No, you see, there is nothing more important to a pirate than his trusted dodo.
She is the feathery heart and soul of the boat.
Did you say...
..."pirate"?
Pirate? No, no, no, no, no.
Scientist. (CHUCKLES)
Yes, good old, good old science.
Can't get enough of it.
Mixing stuff together.
You know, test tube tubing and Bunsen burning.
See? (GRUNTS)
He's no scientist!
He's a Girl Guide!
Ooh! (GRUNTS)
He's no Girl Guide!
He's a pirate!
BOTH: Pirate!
Hang on, hang on.
There's been some kind of mistake. Some...
Some silly mistake
Whoa, laddies!
Stop, stop. I can explain.
Your Majesty.
He's hidden the dodo.
If you chop his head off now, we might never find out where.
Wait a mo.
One doesn't know why.
Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard or his gleaming teeth or the way he smells faintly of coconuts.
But we have taken a shine to this pirate.
Do you have a name, pirate captain?
They call me the Pirate Captain.
Well, Pirate Captain, we hereby pardon you of your piratical crimes.
You will stay in London,
Pirate Captain, and entertain us with your stories and your wit.
And especially your dear little dodo.
Hell's barnacles.
Can we please get out of here now?
That was a bit close for comfort, Number Two.
I will get you the dodo,
Your Majesty.
See that you do,
Mr. Darwin.
Ooh! Uh...
Captain?
Captain! Captain!
Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.
Let's get back to sea where we belong.
PIRATES:
Aye, aye, Captain!
I told you coming to London was a bad idea.
The sooner I get the smell of brine in my...
DARWIN: Captain!
Captain!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You're not leaving, surely?
I most certainly am.
You've let me down badly, Charles.
Look! Look!
Also, to be frank...
Captain...
...your nose is too small for your face.
But you're the toast of London Town.
Oh, I say, look at that.
Ooh!
They've really captured my eyes.
We were hoping you might come out for a little celebration before you go.
We don't want to miss the tide, Captain.
No, no, no. Quite right, quite right.
Oh, Captain, do join us, please?
I'll just stop for a quick one.
Rude to refuse.
But it's Ham Night.
I'll be 20 minutes.
Half an hour tops.
Just get her... Get her warmed up without me.
Aren't we going yet?
Shh!
(WHISPERING) But what about winning the Pirate of the Year and showing all those other captains that he's not a loser?
WOMAN: Yoo-hoo!
Come along, Captain.
Captain...
Cheers!
Good evening.
Thank you.
Thank you so very much.
Captain... PIRATE CAPTAIN:
And your name is?
DARWIN: Miss Jane Austen.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: And that, and that is why, in a straight fight, a shark would probably beat a Dracula.
Jane Austen, feel free to use it in one of your books.
Oh, Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur.
So much better than the last chap we all went doolally over.
You've all been
(SLURPING) terribly kind.
Oh!
Oh, do run along.
Another drink, Captain?
Hmm? Cheers, Chuck.
Huh?
I say, you're not related in some way, are you?
Pardon?
It's just you, sort of...
Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Cheers.
Do you know what
I've discovered, Charles?
The friends you make after you've become famous are better, truer friends than the ones you've had for years beforehand.
So very wise.
But the lads will think I'm a fool.
No. A fool, you? Oh.
You're an intellectual giant.
Just look at how you managed to keep Polly safe from those sinister forces.
Yes, I did do that, didn't I?
You did.
And wherever she's hidden,
I bet it's somewhere really ingenious.
It is rather.
You'll never guess where.
Well, no, why, you're too smart for me, Captain.
Right under everyone's noses.
Or right under my noses, anyhow.
Ta-d a!
You've been keeping Polly in your beard?
Actually,
I keep all sorts in here.
I'm sorry about this, Captain.
About what?
Oh.
What the... What's the monkey-man playing at? (CHUCKLES)
This patently isn't even a real... (SCREAMS)
Come back here, you lubbers!
Sorry, Your Reverence.
Aha!
Got you, you rogue!
Yeah, that's rather nice.
Neptune's lips, what are you up to?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.
What do you mean
"not your fault"?
You steal Polly, you shoot my best hat full of holes.
Hmm?
Well, go on, then.
Explain yourself.
There's this girl.
I'm hopelessly smitten with her.
I'm listening.
I know how partial she is to exotic animals, and I thought if I could get her the dodo, then she might like me.
Oh, I'm so ashamed.
Why didn't you say so?
We've all done stupid things to impress girls.
Yeah, you should act aloof.
They love it when you act aloof.
Still, must be quite a girl for you to go to all that trouble.
QUEEN VICTORIA:
She is quite a girl.
Kraken's biscuits!
Mr. Darwin.
Honestly, Charles.
It's the bun. The bun really does it for me.
QUEEN VICTORIA: And I see you've brought a friend.
How delightful.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
Oh, get a grip, man. You couldn't manage one tiny task, could you?
It's pathetic.
Oh.
Listen, Captain, I can see I've gone about this all wrong.
You see, I might have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and soul of a person who really, really wants that dodo.
I seem to recall that you piratical types have a bit of a soft spot for shiny things.
Or am I getting you muddled up with magpies?
(STUTTERING) I couldn't.
I mean,
Polly, she's a family...
Come now, Captain, it's so simple.
Polly here could live like a queen at my petting zoo, and you...Well...
With treasure like this, you could be famed across the seven seas.
NUMBER TWO: Captain.
Polly's not for sale.
You? Win Pirate of the Year?
You're a shoo-in, sir.
There's not a pirate on the seven seas can match you.
But what about winning
Pirate of the Year and showing all those other captains that you're not a loser?
(ECHOING) Loser... Loser...
Whee!
I'm a floating head.
So, Captain.
Are you going to do the right thing?
J' I'm sailing out on the ocean
J' Out on the deep blue sea J'
20 minutes, he said.
Didn't he say 20 minutes?
Don't worry, lads.
He probably just got caught up,
(EXHALING) you know, battling a giant squid or something.
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Well, come on, you lubbers!
(LAUGHS) It's him!
I told you!
I... I told you he wouldn't let us down.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Hello, boys.
Miss me?
I'm having a mirage.
But... How?
Good question, Number Two.
I stole it all in a daring raid on the Tower of London.
You stole all this from the Tower of London?
That's right.
Then I burnt it to the ground, wrestled a bear, oh, and I kissed a princess for good measure.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Don't just stand there like porpoises.
There's atrophy with our names on it!
Set a course for Blood Island!
(FIREWORKS WHISTLING
AND POPPING)
ANNOUNCER ON MIC:
Avast, me hearties!
And welcome to the 59th Annual
Pirate of the Year Awards!
This is the ticket, eh, Number Two?
Oh, please, please, please, can't Polly come out now?
(STUTTERS) Best not.
She's still very tired.
And here is your host for the evening... Shush.
The Pirate King!
Hello, Pirates!
ALL: Hello, Pirate King!
Any lubbers in tonight?
ALL: No!
ALL: Behind you!
MAN: (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, I'm Queen Victoria!
And I hate pirates!
Ooh!
Oh, come on, cheer up.
PIRATE KING:
And now, you swabs, this is the big one.
The nominees for Pirate of the Year are as follows:
Black Bellamy.
Cutlass Liz.
Peg-Leg Hastings.
And a surprise late entry, the Pirate Captain!
The panel of independent judges have counted each pirate's booty and declared that this year's winner is the Pirate Captain!
Oh. Oh.
(SERENE INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)
(MAJESTIC INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)
BELLAMY: Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Listen, this is all very moving.
I'm welling up here, but...
Bellamy, this is most irregular!
So is this!
ALL: (GENTLY) Aw!
It seems Queen Victoria has pardoned the Pirate Captain.
No!
So what if she did?
BELLAMY:
If you've been pardoned then, technically, you're no longer a pirate.
And if you're no longer a pirate, you really can't be
Pirate of the Year, now, can you?
No, you can't!
That's right!
Is this true?
(STUTTERING) Well, that's one, frankly, rather negative way of looking at it.
Villainous treachery!
Treacherous villainy!
You have betrayed the pirating fraternity.
But, Pirate King...
Your pirate hat and coat!
Your pirate badge with googly eyes.
And your World of Hooks discount card.
Confiscate his treasure!
Every last bit of it.
Begone! May your lubber shame bear down upon you.
You are hereby banished from Blood Island!
You are a pirate no more!
And stay out!
Yes, well, not a...
Not a total success.
We don't need them and their stupid awards.
The best thing about being a pirate isn't the treasure.
It's the cutlasses.
It's Ham Night.
It's Polly.
Where is Polly, Captain?
(CHUCKLES) What do you mean?
You know where she is.
She's been upset enough.
(SIGHS) Captain...
Oh... (GRUNTS)
Okay, Okay.
I sold her to Queen Victoria for a boatload of treasure.
There, I've said it.
Oh, well, come on.
She was just a parrot.
I mean, she wasn't even a parrot.
Always weeing on the boat's carpets, biting everyone.
She gave half of us tetanus, for goodness sake.
But she was our Polly.
(STUTTERING) Well, you know, you should be happy for her.
She'll be, she'll be living the high life.
Eating gold bricks wrapped up in, you know, swans.
Well, where are you swabs going? Come on.
Well, we'll have an adventure somewhere tropical with those native ladies whose outfits don't leave much to the imagination.
Looks like it's just you and me now, eh, Number Two?
Good old inseparable you and me.
Us two against the world, eh?
Yeah?
Like serrano ham and, you know, that other kind of ham.
Arrr.
You can't always just say
"arrr" at the end of a sentence and think that makes everything all right.
Fine.
Fine, go on, then. Go.
Go!
It's not like I need any of you, anyway.
See if I care.
J' I'm not crying
J' It's just been raining...
See if I care.
J' On my face
J' And if you think you see some tear tracks down my cheeks
J' Please, please
J' Don't tell my mates
J' I'm not crying
J' No, I'm not crying
J' And if I am crying
J' It's not 'cause of you
J' It's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine
J' You don't know who is dying, that's right, dying
J' These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me
J' I've just been cutting onions
J' I'm making a lasagna
J' For one
J' Oh, I'm not crying
♪No
J' I'm not upset because you left me this way
♪ My eyes are just a little sweaty today
J' They've been looking around and are searching for you
J' They've been looking for you
J' Even though
I told them not to
J' These aren't tears of sadness, they're tears of joy
J' I'm just laughing
J' Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
J' I'm not crying
J' I'm not crying
: Crying T
Huh?
DARWIN: You're too late.
She's gone.
Charles?
Is that you?
What are you doing here?
We're tramps now. It's not unlike being a scientist, but...
...with less experiments and more drinking your own sweat.
But where's Polly?
Why isn't she in her cage?
Oh, it's too horrible.
"Banquet for world leaders"?
I've been a fool for love.
Victoria never wanted
Polly for her petting zoo.
"Terrine of Tiger,
Black Rhino Ragout,
"Panda Face Fritters"?
I've discovered the Queen is a member of a terrible secret dining society.
Kings, queens, emperors from around the world, they meet on her flagship, the QV1, to eat the rarest and most endangered creatures they can find.
This year, the highlight is...
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
"Dodo a l'Orange"?
She's going to eat Polly?
It's all my fault.
I'm an awful human being.
I'll never get a girlfriend.
Now pull yourself together, man.
Ow!
Now listen, Charles, we've all done something unforgivable.
I've betrayed my pirate honor, you've betrayed science, and Mr. Bobo's betrayed the animal kingdom.
We've got to rescue her.
Us?
Against the crowned heads of the world on an impregnable warship?
It's impossible odds!
It's only impossible if you stop to think about it.
Come on, we didn't evolve from slugs just to sit here drinking our own sweat, now, did we?
Are you with us, Mr. Bobo?
"Are you out of your..."
Oh, I say.
Well, pah!
We can do without the monkey-man.
Sorry, what was that about slugs?
No time for that now
Come on.
J' Ready, said are you ready to go?
J' Said are you ready?
Prepare to be boarded, nerds.
J' Full Stop, me, stop, Full Stop
J' Ranking Full Stop
J' That is my name and I would really, really say
J' Full Stop,
Ranking Full Stop
J' Ranking Full Stop...
It's true! You can see down ladies' tops.
Keep pedaling, Charles.
J' Said are you ready to stop?
I said stop
Help!
J' Ready, said are you ready to go?
J' Said are you ready?
J' Said are you ready to go?
J' Full Stop, me, stop, Full Stop
J' Ranking Full Stop
J' As I would tell you 'bout this song, now come on...
Oh!
J' Said are you ready?
J' Said are you ready to stop?
I said stop
J' I'm dead J'
Neptune's nostrils.
Not a thing.
Where the devil can she be?
Uh, Captain?
Pedal faster, Chuck!
DARWIN: But how on earth do we get on board?
This might sting a bit.
I really don't...
Catch hold of something!
Good man.
How do you like my pygmy elephant nuggets, Your Majesty?
Hmm. They're good, but not quite rare enough for my tastes.
Not rare enough?
Only three have been seen in the last 50 years.
As many as three?
(CHUCKLES) Well, well.
Just wait until you see what
I've got for the main course.
Gaston?
Gaston?
Are you there?
Oui, Your Majesty.
Gaston, I think we're ready.
Neptune's teeth.
There's not a moment to lose.
We've got to find that kitchen.
But it's hopeless. Where do we even start to... Shh, shh.
So that's why I reckon, in a straight fight, a shark would probably beat a Dracula.
No!
Course, a Frankenstein versus a jellyfish, well, that's a different matter.
All clear, Chuck.
Chuck?
It's all right,
Charles, I'm coming!
Don't worry, I'll just...
Charles?
Just... Just hang on!
Ow! (GROANS)
Charles?
Poseidon's lips!
Are you all right, Charles?
GUARD: Hey, you there!
What are you doing here?
Ah! Well, now.
Excellent question.
All exotic animals should have been delivered to the chef by now.
What?
What is it?
Some sort of duck?
Oh. Yes, yes.
That's it, yes.
(MUFFLED) Quack, quack.
Hurry up, then.
Kitchen's that way.
Yeah, come away! Go on.
DARWIN: (MUFFLED)
Quack, quack.
Here we go, my Pretty-
It's time to be...
...délicieux!
Mmm.
(GASPS) Mon dieu!
Polly, come to Daddy.
Oh, I'm sorry, old girl.
I will never, ever leave you again.
I promise.
I will never leave you.
Perhaps we'd best make a move.
Hmm?
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Back to the balloon.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Gaston?
Gaston?
Hello ?
Captain. No.
Hello, Your Majesty.
The dodo is coming tout de suite.
This really isn't wise. Oh.
Claudette est dans Ia bibliotheque.
DARWIN:
Please, I think we...
But you know, Your Majesty, you cannot hurry the cooking.
Is a very delicate recipe, uh?
And the dodo is a very fattening dish.
Perhaps is not so good for you.
(BELL DINGS) And, you know, the calories, they will go straight to your chubby thighs.
Captain.
A minute on the lips is a lifetime on the...
Zut alors!
Well, well.
Pirate Captain.
Here you are again. And...
Oh. my-
Is that Mr. Darwin behind those feathers?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Hello.
What a delightfully unexpected surprise.
You know,
I think, secretly...
...I've always loved you, Charles.
Gosh.
Really?
No!
Give me my dodo!
Now, come on, Vickie, be sensible.
It's just you, a tiny queen, against me, a dashing terror of the high seas.
En garde!
Oh, dear!
Poor defenseless me.
What is a girl to do?
Now, steady on.
Now careful.
Do you know why
I really hate pirates?
Childhood trauma, was it?
Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby?
Beard envy?
It's because you're out-of-date.
You're dinosaurs!
All that
"romance of the seas" guff!
Aha!
Oh.
Right, where were we?
Look at you.
You should be extinct.
Along with your little friend!
Pity you can't eat pirates, really.
But you'd probably taste of barnacles.
Whereas, dear little
Polly here is going to be absolutely delicious!
Mr. Bobo?
Give me back my dinner!
Captain, catch!
Number Two!
Sorry, Vickie.
Dodo is off the menu.
Eh? (GASPS)
Oh, no, no, stop!
Stop!
Stop!
I'm being squashed by giant barrels of vinegar!
Good work, Chuck.
Number Two, what are you doing here?
How did you find me?
Where are the lads?
Don't worry, they're on the case.
It's all thanks to Mr. Bobo here.
He rowed halfway across the ocean to tell us what you were up to.
And, you know,
I figured you tend to end up wrapped in sausages facing certain death at about this point in an adventure.
(CHUCKLES) Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Listen, uh, (STUTTERING)
Number Two, I...
I realize I let you down.
CURVACEOUS PIRATE: Sorry.
I let everybody down.
You know, I've...
Well, I've done some pretty appalling things in my piratical career. (CHUCKLES)
Like that time I used babies as squid bait.
Or that other time
I thought it would be okay to let a turtle drive the boat.
But the thing is...
I mean, what I'm trying to say is...
You decided to single-handedly take on Queen Victoria's flagship, in order to rescue Polly.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
That's terrifically idiotic.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Yes.
It's also the reason why me and the lads, well, we still think you're the best pirate on the seven sea...
Gadzooks!
No!
Polly!
Oh, no, you don't.
Captain?
Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye.
That's it, Polly.
Snip-snip.
Come on, little dodo.
Bitey-bite.
The dumpy lady's got Polly!
Snip-Snip
Bite it!
Bite it, you stupid bird!
Bite it!
QUEEN VICTORIA: No!
My dodo!
Polly!
QUEEN VICTORIA: My dinner!
Oh, barnacles.
Well done, sir.
Hey!
Wah-hey, Captain!
Whoo! Whoo!
Fair play to you, sir.
(CHUCKLES) Wah-hey!
This is our most unexpectedly heartwarming adventure ever.
QUEEN VICTORIA: You'll swing for this!
Curse you!
And after you've done swinging,
I'll chop your head off!
I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!
Does that mean he's not pardoned anymore?
"Pardoned"?
You'll be outlawed across the globe!
There'll be a higher price on your head than any pirate before you!
The whole world will know your name!
NUMBER TWO: Welcome back,
Captain.
Yay!
See ya!
Bye!
Bye-bye!
J' You can get it if you really want
J' But you must try
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles.
Good luck with the science.
Thank you, Captain.
Oh, and just a little tip, grow yourself a beard.
It'll make your face look less lumpy.
J' You've got your mind set on a dream
J' You can get it though hard it may seem now
100,000 doubloons.
Not bad, eh, Mr. Bobo?
J' You can get it if you really want
J' But you must try, try and try
That... I...
Is this a bit of squid tentacle?
ALBINO PIRATE: Yeah.
And that's my earwax.
I keep telling you, it's never been about the trophies or the treasure.
It's about who you are, inside.
I say, you're not...
Not a woman disguised as a man, are you, Number Two?
No.
Because that does happen surprisingly often at sea.
J' But the harder the battle, you see
J' Is the sweeter, the victory now
J' You can get it if you really want
J' If you really want
J' You can get it if you really want
J' But you must try J'
Well, come on, you coves.
Those treasure chests won't plunder themselves.
Hoist the flag!
ALL: Aye, aye, Captain!
Set a course for adventure!
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
You see? I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Just added on for decoration, my foot.
J' We are young
We run green
J' Keep our teeth nice and clean
J' See our friends

J' We wake up
We go out
J' Smoke a fag

MARS NEEDS MOMS (2011)
NASA scientists are excited over recent findings by the Mars Rover
of fossilised organic compounds on the surface that indicate
at some time in the past there may have been life on the red planet.
Thank you.
Was it really that hard?
Every day with the trash!
What is the big deal?
Well, can you imagine what the world would look like
- if nobody took out the trash?
- Yeah, it would be awesome.
And speaking of trash, have you cleaned your room yet?
And don't forget to shut the door.
Milo, sweetie, can you get that?
I have to do everything around here.
Stromboli's Slave Shack, captive 331 speaking.
- Hey, stinker.
- Dad! Hey, are you almost home?
Because the movie starts at five, and then it starts again at seven, and I...
Hold on. Slow down. Slowdown.
I don't think I'm gonna make it back in time.
Well, you can't miss the beginning.
That's when the vampires take over the submarine...
No, I know. I know. But... looks like my flight's cancelled.
And no one's flying till this weather lets up.
I'm really sorry, Milo.
I'll make it home as soon as I can.
- I love you.
- OK. Bye.
- Hi, honey. What's up?
- Stuck at the airport.
That's too bad. Milo was really looking forward to...
- I was looking forward to taking him.
- Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
Well, maybe if he finishes all his dinner
he could watch Zombie Dawn III on pay-per-view.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
You didn't eat your broccoli.
Broccoli makes me barf.
Besides, it looks like brains.
Well, you like zombies.
Zombies eat brains.
Mom, no one likes zombies.
They're an abomination.
I'm committed to their annihilation.
OK. Well, no broccoli, no TV.
Milo!
Come over here.
- Is that broccoli?
- No. That's vomit,
- but I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.
Well, you're not gonna make me eat it now, are you?
- Go to bed.
- But you said I could watch...
No. That was before you lied to me and poisoned the cat!
- That broccoli was poisonous?
- No!
Of course the broccoli wasn't poisonous.
- Well, you just said that...
- No!
I meant that it's poisonous to the cat.
Well, how can it be good for me if it's poisonous to the cat?
Because cats are not supposed to eat vegetables.
Maybe I'm not supposed to eat vegetables.
Milo! Just go to bed.
Now.
I thought I told you to go to bed!
You told me to go to bed.
You didn't say get into bed.
- It's not specific.
- Milo!
My life would be so much better if I didn't have to be a nagging mom.
Yeah, well, my life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all.
Cujo. Wake up.
I can't sleep.
I shouldn't have said what I said, should I?
It wasn't a good thing to say.
I feel really bad about it.
I should go tell her I'm sorry.
Right? I'm gonna go tell her I'm sorry. Right now.
Mom? Are you still up?
'Cause I wanted to tell you that...
Mom?
Mom?
Milo?
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
Mom!
Let her go! Let her go!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Mom!
Let me go!
Hey! I'm... I'm caught in here!
Let me...
Wow! I'm in a spaceship!
This is so cool!
Did I get super powers?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello?
What's going on?
Low gravity!
Keep it together!
Jump down chute number three.
What? Who's there?
Hey, keep it quiet, and jump down chute number three!
You want me to jump in there?
Why?
Jump down chute number three!
Just jump down the chute!
Relax, it's like... a water slide...
... without the water!
Or the slide.
A world of trash!
It is awesome.
Zombies!
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!
I know karate!
Well, at least on the Wii.
No! I don't... I don't...
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just trying to find my mom.
- I want to find my mom.
- Mom?
Don't you understand? My mom.
- Mom? Mom!
- Yeah, my mom.
No, my mom. She's the one that feeds me. She feeds me...
- Feem? Feem?
- Yeah, my mom. She feeds me.
No, no, she... she... she washes my clothes.
She washes my clothes.
You know, my...
No, my... No, she... she...
My mom. She vacuums the house.
You know, she vacuums the house.
Yeah, she's the one...
No.
No. No, that's not it.
Stop. No! My... my mom.
She's the one that...
She tucks me in at night.
She tucks me in? My mom?
Can you... can you?
No. No!
No, you can't...
What are you doing?!
Let go of me.
OK. All right. Chill out, Chachi.
You seriously don't want to get dropped right now.
You!
You sent me down a trash chute, you jerk!
Yeah. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
Prepare to disembark the aircraft.
Let him down easy, TwoCat.
- Hello?
- You like video games, man?
Check it out. Space flight simulator.
I programmed it from the manual so it's just like the real thing.
I'm just messing with you.
Hey, brother!
Yeah. You're not a Martian.
You're a kid.
Man, it's been so long since
I've seen another kid.
Hey!
I'm excited, too, buddy.
My name is Gribble.
Gribble the First.
What's your handle?
No, wait, let me guess. Maverick.
- No.
- Wolfman?
- No.
- Iceman.
- No.
- Did you see Top Gun?
- It's Milo.
- Milo. How low can you go, Milo?
How 'bout I call you "My Bro"?
Check it.
You're a person...
...from Earth!
- Shut up!
What, are you crazy?
I'm part of Ronald Reagan's secret astronaut programme.
The Secronauts.
You might have heard of us.
We're here to stop the threat of interplanetary Communism throughout the galaxy.
Why else do you think they call it "the Red Planet"?
I do crazy stuff like that all the time, man.
You're gonna have so much fun here.
It's wobbly and shaky here.
Come on! I wanna show you something.
You gotta move pretty fast to keep up with me, buddy.
- Wait.
- Come on down!
Hey, check my room out, bro!
Oh, man.
You're not used to the low gravity yet?
OK, OK, OK. Don't worry, man.
I can totally fix that.
I can fix anything.
There we go. I got an extra.
Listen, I just wanna try and find my mom.
This'll hold you down.
- What is it?
- Right here. OK? I'm gonna patent it, call it the Gribblemeister 3000.
It's working, right? That's awesome.
I wanna show you something cool.
- What?
- Hold on tight. Banzai!
The weight belt helping you?
Check this out, man.
They're trying to figure out how you escaped. Watch this.
Oh, my word! I cannot get out! Help me!
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Watch this, watch this, watch this.
You wanna hear what they're saying?
Sure you do.
Wait. Gribble, I wanna find my mom.
TwoCat! That is disgusting.
Here we go.
What is that?
- That's a translator.
- Wait.
- Supervisor not likee.
- Getting off me, you Martian!
Unauthorised dogpile!
- "Unauthorised dogpile"?
- I know. They say that all the time.
Come with me, man. This is so cool.
Hey! Come on in.
What do you think, bro?
- About what?
- About the room, bud.
It's for you, man.
What do you think?
- For me?
- Oh, don't mind this guy.
I just tried to train him to be like my wingman, you know, but he's useless.
It's more like a wing nut.
Oh, gosh.
I'm gonna get rid of him.
But forget it, man. That's all history.
- 'Cause I got you now!
- Me?
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and me, bro.
Best buds hanging out forever.
Playing video games all day, watching TV all night.
There's no such thing as too much TV, man.
Mom?
Oh, yeah.
Maybe there is such a thing as too much TV.
- No. Wait.
- I wanna show you something in here.
What are they saying?
Subject will be terminating.
- Oh-four, oh-three...
- "Terminating." Terminating?
Terminating. I love that movie.
Hey, you know what? Let's go. I wanna show you something cool, dude.
No, wait. Gribble, what's going on?
I don't wanna tell ya, and you can't make me. OK?
- Just forget about it.
- No, Gribble, tell me.
- Please!
- System overload! System overload!
- Tell me!
- Help! Hey!
- Tell me!
- Oh, my...
Get... Uncle! Get off!
Chafe-y.
All right.
All right, I'll tell you.
Fact is...
...Mars needs moms.
What the heck does that mean?
These are hatchlings.
They are baby Martians, and they pop out of the ground, like potatoes, every 25 years or so.
And the Martians, they're terrible at mothering, which is ironic, really, since the ones running the place upstairs, they're all female.
- Can you get to the point?
- I... All right.
What they are good at is building robots, right?
So they build these Nanny-bots to raise the girls.
And each Nanny-bot gets one kid to raise, and then it's toast.
It can't be reused after that.
Who knew mothering was so hard?
"Hard?"
- So why did they take my mom?
- OK.
They have to program the
Nanny-bots each time, right?
So... they find someone who is really good at controlling their own kid.
Hey, that's my house.
And that's me!
Are these my mom's memories?
Yeah.
See, all these Martians care about is order and discipline.
What was that one about?
Just tell me what they're gonna do to my mom.
All right.
Right up there.
You see, they have this memory extraction machine.
It takes the discipline out of the mom and it puts it into the Nanny-bots.
It works on some kind of solar-wind focusing system.
And when the sun rises...
...they extract what they need to program the Nanny-bots, and that's it.
OK? That's it.
Wait. So my mom is gonna lose all her memories?
Yeah, something like that.
No, that... that can't happen.
- We've gotta save her!
- Well, that's impossible,
- so, like, get over it and move on.
- But we've gotta try.
- We've gotta try!
- This, my friend, is a Martian wristwatch.
You see the bars here?
Counts down to sunrise.
So you must have about 6.93 Earth hours left.
Less than seven hours? That's all?
Let's say that, for the sake of argument, that we do, we disguise you.
And we use all this awesome spy gear to guide you up to the surface.
Those Martians, man, they...
They're gonna spot you.
They're gonna chase you and shoot at you and... and... and...
Wait a minute.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
But you just said they're gonna shoot at me.
What? Oh, hey. What you talking about,
"shoot"? "Shoot"? That's crazy talk.
- That's what you said.
- Who said that?
Someone say he's gonna shoot at him?
What are you talking about, brother?
No one's shooting at anybody.
Don't even sweat it.
You trust me.
This is gonna be great.
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact, this is gonna be...
...Gribbletastic. Yeah!
I don't know, Gribble.
Are you sure this is gonna work?
Yeah, dude. It's gonna be awesome.
That disguise totally rocks.
Trust me, you're gonna blend right in.
Even the SISS won't spot you.
The SISS? What's the SISS?
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention them.
They're the Supervisor's
Secret Security.
They're the ones in the black uniforms.
But I'll take care of them, man.
Don't worry about it.
Anything else you "forgot to mention"?
What? No. What're you... Me?
Dude, honest Injun, man.
We're in this together.
Once he gets up top, he's gonna give himself away.
They're gonna chase him halfway around Mars, and I'm gonna save his butt.
And he's gonna be so totally grateful.
It's gonna be so cool.
Give me a break.
OK, OK. So, it's a... it's a fib, but it's for his own good, man.
After this, he'll stay down here, where it's safe.
OK, go ahead.
Dude, you march like a girl!
Which is kind of perfect.
There's that bleached-prune lady again.
Who is that?
That's the Supervisor.
She's like the school lunch lady,
only with the power to execute you on sight.
Man, Mars needs Botox.
Don't mess with her.
She runs everything around here.
Gribble, are you seeing this?
Yeah, man. Those tags are so cool.
I don't know who does 'em, but the Supervisor hates 'em.
Oh, hey, look sharp, man.
You see that tall building up ahead?
That's the Citadel.
Your mom's up at the top.
You get up there and get your mom.
I am gonna program the ship
and make it repeat its last
Earth mission, and then, boom!
You're through the wormhole and home in time for Pop-Tarts. OK? Easy.
TwoCat, this is it, man.
They're gonna spot him here for sure.
Stop it. Don't look at me like that.
I'm gonna take care of him.
Check it out, all right?
When he gets to the checkpoint gate, he's gonna trigger the alarm, the guards'll close in,
I'm gonna press this button.
The cleaning hatch is gonna open, gonna drop down to the maintenance floor, where he can escape down the trash chute. See? It's very simple.
OK. It'll all be fine.
But if anything, you know, weird or unexpected happens,
just run like crazy, OK?
You see?
Totally in my control.
I pushed the wrong one.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Gribble, where are they taking me?
OK, just give me a minute.
Don't have an aneurysm.
Oh, man, OK, you're going up, and that's not good.
I thought I wanted to go up?
Well, yes and no.
This is a very, very bad up.
OK, OK, OK... don't panic.
- Get ready.
- For what?
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!
And he's off! Yes! Finally.
Gribble! Which way now?
- Dang, I'm good!
- Gribble!
I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side
Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot and tell me which way!
Did you just call me an idiot?
Which way? I'm lost here!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I think that you have to apologise now.
Gribble!
I'm waiting.
All right, all right, I'm sorry!
Apology accepted. Go left.
No, no, no, no, not that left!
Not that left, not that left!
Back up, man!
- Turn it down, Gribble!
- TwoCat, turn off your alarm!
What is going on here? TwoCat?
Oh, no. Mommy? Mommy!
Gribble! I need to know...
Gribble, come in. Are you there?
Gribble! Come on, Gribble, this is no time for the silent treatment!
Gribble? Help me.
I'm trapped, and there's nowhere to hide!
Gribble!
If not using ropes, my friend, you will needing wings.
We must cleaning paint off you before someone is seeing you.
It will getting you in trouble.
Giving me your helmet...
The Earth hatchling!
Gribble! Gribble, come in. They've spotted me! But I think I lost them!
Get off me! Let me go! Let me go!
Cool it! I gotta clean you up!
- Get off of me!
- Hey!
Mellow out, man!
I'm not the fuzz!
- I'm not bustin' you.
- You're not?
Check it out!
What is that?
- They were tracking me?
- Not you.
They were trackin' whoever you were chattin' with.
Who I was... who I was talk...
I was talking to Gribble! Oh, no!
No time! Sorry! No time!
You got time now?
This is so low temperature!
OK. You're from Earth, so you must know...
What do you "turn on"?
How do you "tune in"?
What do you "drop out" of?
What powers do flowers have?
That's English!
Where did you learn English?
Two quarters ago,
I was working in the administration block.
The Supervisor was talking with 113-Elder-331.
They were viewing some top-secret Earth documents.
When they left, I wanted to check out what was making the weird light.
What's going on here?
It's a chrysanthemum, baby.
A chrysanthemum?
That's not a chrysanthemum.
And it was...
... amazing!
So I copied all I could.
The way that light vibrated and sang!
Nothing in my world has ever made me feel like that!
It was like my eyes were open for the first time.
It was crazy beautiful, man.
This is a chrysanthemum.
Flower power, it's gonna change the world, man!
Yeah, that's just groovy, man.
They called it...
Colour.
Your hippie alien life story is totally interesting, but I'm kinda busy saving my mom!
You mean your Nanny-bot.
No! I mean my mom!
She's a human being!
Wait. No, but...
I saw inside her headspace.
You said, "My life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all."
I know what I said, but I was wrong, and I do want her.
Heavy! Why?
Because she...
She looks after me and she tells me what to do!
Oh, like the Supervisor!
No, not like the Supervisor!
My mom is kind.
She takes me to Disneyland, and she reads to me, and she makes me hot chocolate, and she puts bandages on my cuts, and she hugs me and she...
She loves me.
"Love"?
Chute number three.
Crazy.
Gribble? Can you hear me now?
Gribble?
Oh, no.
Gribble?
Gribble?
Gribble?
Gribble!
Oh, no. That's only five and a half hours!
Stupid weights.
"Private. Keep out.
No Martians allowed."
"Gribble."
"George Ribble."
He must've been a kid, too, when he came here.
Why wouldn't he tell me?
TwoCat? TwoCat!
Hold on, buddy.
Are you OK?
Oh, here. Where's Gribble, TwoCat?
I gotta find him!
He's the only person on this entire planet who can help me save my mom.
That burnt area. That's where they shoot people, isn't it?
That's a firing squad, and they're gonna shoot Gribble?
TwoCat, we gotta save him!
Ladies, ladies, you don't wanna do this.
Listen, I'm a walking A-bomb!
You shoot me, and the whole planet's gonna go up!
You don't want that on your conscience...
OK, seriously.
OK, you could be precipitating a major interplanetary war here, people, aliens, Martians.
OK, listen! I've been living in your sewers for years.
I'm disgusting, they're contaminated, and they need a vaccine and I'm the only one that has it.
OK. Listen. You made your point.
I invented some great stuff!
I can let you in on the ground floor, OK?
How 'bout blue mascara?
I've got a Slinky!
A Rubik's Cube?
You like Dungeons and Dragons,
I love Dungeons and Dragons.
How 'bout skateboards?
I got millions... OK. Hey!
I can get you a Cabbage Patch Kid. Not one of those gnarly ones, a real one.
What about a pizza?
You like crop circles?
I have quite a crop.
Oh, and I'll teach you how to moonwalk.
Can't really do it in these chains.
Legwarmers!
Wait, wait.
We're really gonna do this?
Unauthorised dogpile!
Hey! Milo, what are you doing here?
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?
It's exactly according to my plan!
Ki!
Hot, hot, hot!
Wait! Stop it with the shooting!
My toe! What are you doing?
Oh, my gosh!
When you're going to shoot a laser at someone, you should bring them a change of underwear!
Hairy Tribe Guys.
Wingnut?
- OK. OK. Thank you.
- Oh, come on. Let go!
- Let go! What are you doing?
- They're hugging!
It's all these males ever do! That's why the females chuck 'em down here!
We don't have time!
The SISS are gonna find us!
- Run!
- Run!
Wingnut! It's Wingnut!
OK. Come on! Come on.
What?!
Wingnut! No!
Wait!
Gribble!
Relax, Grib. Fat floats.
Hey!
Oh, nuts.
There goes my sexy tan.
Less than three and a half hours.
Echo!
This place is amazing!
It's Gribbletastic.
You have got to stop saying that.
You sound Gribblediculous.
Hey, hey.
TwoCat's homing in on our headsets.
I built him with a location device.
I think of everything.
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.
Stretch... stretch that bar across this rock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good, good, good.
You know this place is perfect?
We can rebuild right over there.
- You see that?
- No.
- Keep still.
- Yeah, right, sorry.
Build a whole new lair.
Be years before we fill this place up with our junk.
What do you say, pal?
You and me? Best buds?
You can be emperor this time.
And I... I shall be El Presidente.
Hey!
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this!
- Gimme that!
- But...
Maniac!
These things are dangerous!
Tried to blow up some trash once with one of these, almost took my foot off!
Yes!
Oh, good, it's nearly empty.
Anyway, why don't we go rebuild right over here. What do you think?
That lava slope looks like our best way up.
My mom's running out of time, Gribble.
- Let's go!
- Hey, no, come on!
It can't be done!
Did you see what happened up there?
Man, I nearly got toasted!
To death!
Thanks for saving me, but... I'm never going up there again, man.
You... You can't!
You can't just bail on me now!
Bye.
George!
Your name's George!
- What did you just call me?
- George.
George Ribble.
- You were a kid, like me!
- Where did you get this?
This is mine.
They took your mom, too, didn't they?
It's OK, Grib, I know how you feel!
How I feel? How I feel...
You have no idea how I feel.
You see this?
This is when they chose my mom.
But way before they chose yours.
I know, Gribble.
It happened to me the same way.
No. No, you don't know.
How could you possibly know?
I was a good kid.
I did my chores.
Put my things away.
I did as I was told.
Turns out, that's exactly why they chose her.
'Cause of me.
Man. What kind of message is that to send to a little kid?
I know. It's not fair!
I'll tell you what's not fair, man.
Not fair is when a bunch of scary aliens take your mama,
your only parent, away from you in the middle of the night.
Not fair is when you follow them, and you sneak onto their ship,
and you search but you can't find her.
And then you see her...
They got your mama strapped into some kind of machine.
Mom!
So I grabbed a couple of breathing helmets,
and I went to get her.
But I didn't know what I know now.
I didn't know...
... that when the sun came up, it'd start the machine.
I didn't know... what that machine was gonna do to her.
Not until it was too late.
And then I realised...
... I was all alone.
I'd never see my mom again.
And I'd never be able to tell her I loved her.
"Never be able to tell her you love her..." What do you mean?
No, no, you don't have to worry about that.
It's not gonna happen.
Not this time.
Not to you.
We're gonna go up there and we're gonna...
We're gonna go get your mom.
Really? You mean it?
Yeah. You and me, buddy.
Best buds, right?
- Thank you, Gribble.
- Yeah, man.
Yeah, we'll get your mom back, man.
"Best buds."
That's like the "love" thing, right?
My, my, my, my...
...my, my Sharona!
- No! Gribble!
- Evasive action!
I'm sorry.
- No, Gribble! Gribble, stop! Relax!
- Don't shoot me, please!
Gribble, Gribble! Relax! Listen!
She's not gonna shoot you!
- She's not gonna shoot you!
- She's not?
No! She's the one that helped us escape!
She is?
- TwoCat brought her.
- He did?
I used to be administration unit 231-Ki-312.
But now,
I'm down with your scene, man.
What is she talking about?
I don't know.
She talks like that a lot.
But I think she wants to help us, right?
Right on! Come on!
We gotta beat feet!
"Beat feet"?
Oh, you mean run! Yeah, we do!
- Yeah!
- All right, Gribble, let's go!
- OK! Come on!
- It's just so weird!
Come on, guys!
This is the way out!
Is there gonna be a lot of running?
Psychedelic! What are they?
They're paintings.
You know, like your flower graffiti.
Wait! Wait, wait! Ki, Ki!
Hold on. You're the one...
...that paints those flower tags?
That is so bad!
Bad? But... but it is meant to be good.
No. No, no, I mean... no.
Bad means good. I just,
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...
I think that...
I think you're amazing.
Gribble!
- You can change colour!
- What?
That is also..."bad".
What is that?
That? It looks like a family.
Kids and parents.
That's the "love" thing.
What are "parents"?
You know, people like my mom, who look after kids like me?
I guess you guys had families once.
You know, if you Martians had parents, you wouldn't have to kidnap moms to program your Nanny-bots.
- Come on.
- But...
But the Supervisor said that Martians have always been raised by machines.
Wow, looks like she lied to you, big time.
We never knew.
That's the Citadel.
We've got to get to the top.
That's where mission control is, on the surface.
Your mom is in the Extraction Machine here.
And your ride back to Earth is in the silo here.
That's all well and good, guys, but I don't think we're gonna make it to the Citadel.
Why are they checking everyone?
Well, you're kind of a celebrity now, buddy.
And who is that handsome devil next to you?
You better keep your heads down.
If they bust you, they will slap you in the joint!
Wait a minute. That's exactly where we wanna go!
Yeah! He's right on!
What? What... Hey!
We're going to jail?
No, no. When they first found me, they brought me straight to jail.
The jail's next to the silo where they keep the spaceship!
- OK.
- Sub-level two. Go ahead.
If we can get through the jail, and up through the silo, we can get to the surface.
And that's where Mom is.
Yes, but isn't the jail thousands of feet above us?
One thousand and thirty-two!
Wait! Wait a minute.
How strong is this line?
I'm a little over my goal weight right now. Hey!
OK. We've got to take out the guards, shut down the surveillance cameras, then we can sneak through the jail and get to the silo.
We catching the two terrorists.
Supervisor ordering we must locking them in cells.
Is this gonna work?
- No, wait.
- No! No, please, please, no!
I don't wanna go back to jail! Please!
No, no, please! No!
I need a doctor and I've got measles!
And I've got gingivitis!
And I've got male pattern baldness.
I will getting prisoner tranquilizers.
Where are they?
- Bottom left control.
- Restless leg syndrome!
I got Saturday Night Fever!
- Bat wing disorder!
- And halitosis!
Yes! Horrible halitosis! I do?
Hey! Awesome!
And this officially ends today's prison broadcast!
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!
OK, here's the plan.
I'll go get my mom.
You guys fire up the spaceship, and we'll be outta here before they can say...
- Hey, Grib, what are you doing?
- It's Wingnut, man!
He's still alive! Hey, bud.
I can't just leave him in here.
OK, well, get him out, but do it fast! We gotta go!
OK. Come on! This will do it.
Yeah! Come on out, you freakazoid!
I know. I know. It's OK.
What's with all the grabbing and squeezing?
It's called "hugging".
It's another love thing.
OK, enough already.
Come on! We gotta go!
Man! I must have opened up all the cells.
- Who let the dogs out?
- No duh.
What?
What's going on?
It's the hatchlings.
They're sorting them.
Yeah. The girls are all assigned their Nanny-bots.
And the boys are sent down below where they'll be raised by the Hairy Tribe Guys.
These guys knew a bunch of boy hatchlings were coming!
That's why they were dancing down in the trash. They were celebrating!
Yeah, but all the Hairy Tribe Guys are up here now.
There's no one down there to take care of them.
The boys are gonna be all alone.
And to be alone is...
...to be without the crazy love thing.
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys. We gotta go!
Wait. Wait!
Go down the garbage chutes!
Listen, listen! Guys!
If you jump down chute number three, you can save the hatchlings.
OK? Do you understand?
Chute...
...number... three!
- Come on, Grib.
- One, two, three!
- We gotta go! They'll figure it out!
No, they won't!
They're dumb as a box of rocks.
- Ki. It's no use.
- We gotta go!
Go, Wingnut!
On the other side of the rocket, there's a ladder up to the surface.
But how do we get past all those Martians?
I can totally fix that.
Hey, everybody grab a helmet.
Put it on real tight.
Good game. Good game. Good game.
Here. Don't forget that.
Keep in touch, kiddo.
Get up that ladder over there.
Good luck!
Wait a minute! Won't they see me from Mission Control?
No way, buddy.
They'll be looking into the rising sun.
Won't be able to see a thing. By the time they figure out what's going on,
we'll be on the couch eating Smurf
Berry Crunch and watching He-Man.
- Gribble.
- Gribble.
Yes. And I am Ki. Remember?
No, I know.
I mean... No, I said that because, well, you know, the ship's got this... voice-activated launch system.
And I had to record a word, and Ki just didn't seem like a word that would start an engine... you know?
Except...
...now that I think about it...
..."Ki" is like a perfect word to start an engine because it's, you know, used to...
...unlock things like...
...my heart.
I dig it when you change colour.
Gribble! Ki! I'm halfway there!
Oh, no!
What dummy left that there?
Milo?
Gribble, I think I fell into something!
Gribble, come in!
- It's OK, Ki. I've got him.
- Great job!
- Gribble!
- Hey.
- That's the second-to-last lens!
- We're not gonna make it!
You wanna bet? Yeah!
This thing is going on my Christmas list!
Guys! The SISS are gonna crash Mission Control!
They'll be through the airlock and on the surface any minute!
Oh, no! What do we do?
All right, take her in.
OK. You go save your mom.
I'll take care of the SISS.
- But, Gribble, they're gonna...
- No, no, no.
My mama always said,
"Son, you gotta do the right thing."
And for the first time since
I came to Mars, I'm doing it.
Man, I hope Ki saw that.
Go get 'em. Fire butt blasters!
Mom! Mom!
Mom, wake up! Wake up!
Milo, can you turn the cartoons down?
I'm trying to sleep.
No. Mom, come on. You gotta wake up!
We gotta get out of here!
Milo, the alarm hasn't even gone off.
Can you just let me sleep until sunrise?
Believe me, that would be a bad idea.
- Gribble!
- Gribble, Gribble, Gribble.
Oh, no! I activated the launch system.
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Come on, Mom. Come on!
We gotta go. Hurry!
Hurry! Mom, come on! Mom, Mom!
Milo? The launch system lit up.
I can't cool it.
You got two minutes.
Two minutes! Mom, come on.
We gotta hurry. Mom.
Wait a second.
Did you just pull me out of bed?
No! Mom, Mom.
Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me.
Look at me. I'll explain everything, but later. OK?
- Right now we gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?
- The ship.
- What ship?!
- That ship!
- Milo! Sixty seconds.
- Get it on!
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- OK.
- Here. Just put this on.
And then you gotta twist this lever to seal the neck. See? Like this.
- What do you mean?
- We need air. We can't breathe outside.
- There's no air?
- Mom, it's Mars.
OK. One, two, three!
Help!
Now, start running! Run!
Are those Martians?
Yeah. The hairy guys are good, and the uniforms are bad.
Let's just hope we don't see...
...the Supervisor!
No! Mom!
You gave me your helmet?
No! No! Mom! No! No!
No! Mom! Mom!
No! No! No!
No, Mom! Mom, no! No.
Mommy, you have to come home with me.
You have to come home with me!
You're... you're my mom...
...and I love you!
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
No!
Gribble! My mom!
Bingo.
Milo! I'm coming, buddy!
I got it. I got it.
Lift her head.
Milo. You saved me.
No. It was Gribble.
No, bro. No, it was you, man.
It was you.
You saved your mom, man.
I'm sorry for what I said before.
My life wouldn't be better without you.
Oh, Milo. My love.
Milo! Gribble!
I've got the ship under control...
- Ki!
- I'm good.
- I can buff out the scratches.
- Come on, Mom. We gotta go.
- We gotta go.
- Oh, OK.
Stopping right there!
This is not over.
You will surrendering.
Hey! Surrender this!
Ki! What are you doing?
I will not letting you do this.
Insolence!
You cannot stopping this.
This is the way it has always being.
No. No. No!
This is not the way it is always being.
She lied to us! Look!
We were not meant to being raised by machines.
We were meant to be raised by families.
By parents.
We were meant to having that... that...
That crazy love thing?
That crazy love thing.
Never!
You fool. I saved you!
Before any of you were even born
I realised we do not have time to raise hatchlings.
And the males? They never helped.
Always dancing and playing.
That is why we must throw them away.
There must be order.
Arresting the evildoers!
Evildoer, you.
No! I did this for you!
I did this for all of you!
You will be sorry. Let me go!
So are you gonna stay?
Wow.
Wow...
Actually, I think I'm gonna...
You know, Mars is different now.
I'm gonna hang out with Ki and...
...help paint and stuff.
He's really good at red.
Stop it.
So will I ever see you again?
What? Are you kidding me? Of course.
We'll keep in touch.
- How?
- What do you mean "how?"
I could fix it.
It's gonna be Gribbletastic.
Best buds?
You better believe it.
Thank you, Gribble.
Your mother would be proud of you.
It's my pleasure.
Oh, man.
I'm not crying. It's allergies.
Silly.
- Bye! Goodbye!
- Bye.
Bye!
I love you, Milo.
I know that... now.
- Dad!
- Hi, stinker.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Did something happen to Milo this weekend?
Colour.
Flower power is gonna change the world, man!
- Mark.
- No, that's vomit.
- But I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.
Well, you're not gonna make me eat it now, are you?
Mom!
My mom. She... she vacuums the house.
You know, she vacuums the house. My...
Yeah, she's the one.
Yeah, that... No.
I'm just messing with you.
Oh, don't mind this guy. He's a...
I just tried to train him to be like my wingman, you know, but he's useless.
He's more like a wing nut. Yeah!
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact, this is gonna be... Gribbletastic.
Yeah!
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!
And he's off! Yes! Finally.
I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side
Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot and tell me which way!
Did you just call me an idiot?
Mark.
- Get... Wait a minute!
- Gribble!
Let's hit every single pipe on the way down!
- Gribble!
- I'm trying!
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this.
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...
I think that...
I think that you're amazing.
Gribble!
- You can change colour!
- What?
That is also..."bad".
- Mark.
- Chute...
...number... three!
- One, two, three!
- Come on, Grib. We gotta go!
- They'll figure it out!
- No, they won't.
They're dumb as a box of rocks.
What dummy left that there?
No! Mom. Mom!
Mom. Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me.
Mom, look at me. Look at me.
I'll explain everything, but later. OK?
Right now we've just gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?
- The ship.
- What ship?!
- That ship!
Tonight on "fact or faked:
Paranormal files"...
Former FBI agent Ben Hansen leads his group of investigators.
As they uncover the secrets behind the best.
And most baffling paranormal footage ever captured.
Whoa!
They'll break down every clip...
And put each case to the ultimate test...
I think it could be easily manipulated.
...As they try to re-create.
The world's most mysterious footage.
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Through a series of incredible experiments.
Using cutting-edge technology...
...They'll determine once and for all if each case is fact...
Hey, we just found some bones!
...Or faked.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my goodness!
There's a flying saucer.
I'm getting a series of lights right there.
Oh, my god!
What the heck is that?
Kill the lights.
My name's ben hansen.
Maintain silence unless you see something on-camera.
I've been investigating the paranormal.
Since I was 10 years old growing up in utah.
I used to be in the fbi, but after I left the bureau,
I took my paranormal investigations.
To the next level.
Three years ago,
I set up a team to join me in my search for the truth.
When we evaluate the videos that are sent to us,
We ask the following questions -
Is the footage compelling?
Is the witness credible?
And can we test it?
Together with my team,
We're out to solve whether these cases are fact of faked.
Okay, guys.
I'm excited about these clips.
I want to see what we've all brought to the table today.
All right, guys.
I got a really good video.
It's from connecticut.
It's actually considered a ghost town.
It's most famous for its haunted forest.
He's claiming it's a ghost.
From the legends and theories of the area.
So, I'm gonna go ahead and show you the video,
And tell me what you guys think.
Okay.
Okay, watch up along the tree line.
Jael:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You see that?
Chi-lan: There it goes.
It's right there. Yeah.
Like a dark shadow.
Did you see it? Ben, pull it back. Pull it back.
Bill:
That's pretty good.
He's a very, very light, shadowy figure right there, right?
Man: No way!
Chi-lan: It almost looks like he has limbs.
When he crosses this section here.
Okay, wait one second.
The thing that concerns me with this video.
Is that this guy is all worked up.
He's breathing heavily,
And it's almost like he's anticipating it to come out.
Well, maybe he already saw it,
He went and grabbed his camera,
And then he was shooting, and then it crossed again.
Ben: You would think that's how it would happen.
I can see a lot of cg in that video being a huge possibility.
I'm with chi-lan -
I think it's faked,
And I think it could be easily manipulated.
Okay. Let's move on.
How about bill?
What do you have?
I've got an alien-abduction case out of florida.
And this is a couple that have claimed they've had.
Alien visitations and abductions repeatedly.
In this case, they got video.
Okay, it's moving.
So, is this a surveillance camera?
Yes, in their bedroom,
Thca wuse tatre hevisitations have been happeni.
So they set up a surveillance cam in their room.
Larry: I see something walking in.
And this is time-lapse video,
So the frame rate is gonna be stuttering.
Where is this at, bill?
Florida.
It's not an alligator.
Jael:
It doesn't look that clear.
And, to me, it looks like it could be a kid.
Chi-lan: Yeah.
I mean, it doesn't walk into the room completely.
It looks like it's just poking its head in.
And turning around or just staying there.
Larry, what do you think of the video itself?
It's kind of unclear, and it never fully enters the room.
I mean, it could be something on a broomstick.
That somebody's poking in there.
The fact that we're discussing it so much,
This is a really intriguing video.
I would love to investigate this.
I want more background on these people,
Exactly what happened to them.
I personally say "faked,"
But I say with more research, take it from there.
I don't want to completely throw this out for now.
Okay.
But at the same time,
We don't have quite enough to work off of.
All right, let me try to get a little more information.
On the family's background and the location.
And see if there are any other similar occurrences in the area.
I have a ghost car.
We have a ghost car in savannah, georgia,
Slightly outside, in a town called garden city.
This tape was shot.
From a video camera mounted inside the police car.
Now, he was pursuing a vehicle.
Which was doing some very erratic maneuvers.
Then it ends in a very strange way.
Here you go.
Like, it starts out like a normal pursuit.
It turns into high speed.
I mean, this guy is really clocking it.
And here, he's swerving back and forth,
Kind of doing strange maneuvers.
You know, he does this u-turn.
There's this point.
Where the officer following him makes that u-turn,
And he's far, far up ahead of him.
A lot of people are saying.
That's kind of something extraordinary.
That the car takes off that quickly.
So, now watch this part.
He comes down the dirt road.
The officer is still following pretty closely at this point,
But you'll see, as he turns left, he loses sight of him.
Officer turns around, follows.
Boom!
Now he's on the other side of the fence.
Chi-lan:
What?! Wow!
You see him turn here.
This is in slow motion.
He turns off to the left, hard left,
He pulls his car around, and boom!
The officer has to stop.
Because there's a fence right in the way.
And the ghost car is on the other side of the fence.
There wasn't a gate?
No.
This is a solid fence all the way around.
See, that's creepy.
That gives me the chills.
Now, this video has over 5 million hits online.
So a lot of people have seen it,
But it's never been investigated.
This is from a law-enforcement officer's car.
I'm sold.
Yeah. Good eyewitness.
Good video.
I didn't see the gate.
I didn't see how it went through that fence.
Maybe the fence is ghost.
It's a ghost fence.
Austin:
Ghost fence.
We have a good witness.
We've got an actual physical, tangible location.
With hardware - the fence, the car,
Everything that we can do a lot of experiments with.
That's why I think we should go investigate it.
I want to go.
I would really like to go, as well.
Looks like we've found our first case.
Jael, what else you have for us?
I actually found a pretty interesting case.
It takes place in the u.K. -
A woman named tonya pittman.
She has kids, and her kids keep claiming.
That they're hearing noises coming from the bedrooms.
Um...
Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa.
From the parents' bedroom?
No, from their bedrooms.
Okay, gotcha.
Continue. I'm sorry.
So, one night, her 12-year-old son.
Hears whistling coming from one of the bedrooms.
He gets freaked out, and he picks up his cellphone,
Turns on the camera, runs upstairs,
And he captures a shadow.
Boy: Downstairs.
Oh!
Sorry to get all up in your business, but see how it jumps?
Oh, yeah.
You see it being reflected on this wall and sort of staying.
I'm saying that there's a light over here.
And there's somebody walking across out of camera,
Out of frame that we can't see,
And is casting a shadow across here.
It looks like it's coming this way.
But, in fact, it's being projected here across this.
And then against that wall.
Do you think there's enough to go on here?
No.
I got to say no.
Ben: Sorry, jael.
I know.
I've been completely outnumbered on this one.
Bill:
I have some ufo footage.
That was shot by jeff willes in arizona.
If you play it, you'll see that.
There's some unusual movement of these lights in the sky.
So, why don't you roll it?
All right, here we go.
Man:
So, I think, you know, uh -
Whoa!
I was just doing a little bit of research,
And I found there are a bunch -
I mean, a whole lot - of eyewitnesses.
That actually saw this event,
And none of them could describe what they were.
There's a military base close to this area?
Bill:
Luke air force base, yes.
Well, then how do we know that it's not.
Just some normal flight pattern for some of these planes?
It could be, and it could be coincidental.
That it happens to show up.
Just when these lights appeared in the sky.
Some of these sightings have been looked into before,
And they end up just being military flares.
Is that maybe what we're seeing right here?
As a matter of fact,
I got footage of military flares being dropped.
I want to point out some just very obvious differences here.
So, I'm going to hit "play" - and look at the characteristics.
These things drop straight to the ground.
Yeah, it looks nothing like it.
Even if there's a little parachute on them...
They just plummet.
These don't.
Isn't this place called
"the ufo parking lot"?
I never heard that particular one,
But I wouldn't doubt if they would call it that.
The guy who's filming this sounds genuinely excited.
I mean, it doesn't sound like he's faking this.
I'm liking this.
We've got very compelling video.
We have a credible witness.
Who has a lot of experience in ufo documentation.
Plus, we have a lot to work with as far as the experiment.
Jael, austin, you come with me to savannah.
We'll do the ghost-car investigation.
And, bill, larry, and chi-lan,
You guys head out to arizona to do these lights.
Chi-lan: Sounds good.
All right.
Let's pack up, huh?
Jael:
Let's pack up, guys.
Narrator: Coming up on "fact or faked: Paranormal files"...
Daniels: When I turned in, the only thing I see.
Is taillights on the other side of the fence.
Four lights appeared near these mountains right here.
Begin hyper jump.
Go.
Austin:
Absolutely insane.
Oh, my god! Wow!
We both were wrong.
Did you hear that?
Ho!
Bill: I'm thinking if we go to arizona,
Maybe we could do some experiments.
We have a ghost car in savannah, georgia.
I think we should go investigate it.
We're in savannah, georgia,
One of the most haunted cities in america.
I've seen this video quite a few times now.
And it's gonna be the first time that we're gonna be able to meet.
The actual officer who was in that car.
Jael:
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
I'm sure that must have been quite an adrenaline rush.
Austin: I think there he is right there.
Let's do it.
How you doing?
I'm doing all right.
How y'all doing today?
Wayne daniels.
Glad to meet you.
We are so excited to be here.
What I would love to do is to take you back to that night.
And I was thinking that maybe you could take us on a ride.
And show us the exact route that you guys took.
Love to. All right.
Should we go ride?
So, is this where it started - right here?
Yeah, this is where it actually started.
This is where I noticed him weaving in the road.
You could see him hitting the lane markers and the fog light.
Right about here is where I hit the blue lights.
He hit the gas, and off we went to the races.
Right here is where he actually made a u-turn.
I pulled up into his driver's door.
At that point, he shot on around me.
And it took me a second to get around.
As he was accelerating up old willisville road here.
So, there was a split-second.
Where you don't have him in sight.
And the next thing you know, he's far up the road.
That's correct.
Would you say that he took off at an unusually quick speed?
I was surprised that it was able to accelerate that fast.
We hung the right here on 307.
But when he come around...
And as I turned in, the only thing I see.
Is taillights on the other side of the fence.
And I says,
"no. He didn't do that."
He did it.
I'd actually like to take a closer look at this fence.
Obviously, like I said, the fence has been changed.
At the time, it didn't have the gate and stuff.
But this fence would have been on the backside of this pole.
And did you actually come up.
And inspect these brackets and these ties?
I came up and checked the fence.
Where the car went through, and these were missing.
Could you actually tell me.
That you witnessed him going through the fence?
I can't say I seen it.
I mean, in the paranormal realm, it would either have to be.
Something extremely paranormal happened.
Or the only other option is that this car had to go.
Under, through, or possibly launch over that fence.
Correct.
Well, I think that about does it.
We really appreciate your time.
Jael: All right, thank you very much. Bye-bye.
I think we've got two different things going on here,
One is the very logical, hard, tangible stuff.
We need to test, and the other, the paranormal stuff.
Right now, I'd like to get back to doing the tangible.
We got a stunt guy, and he's gonna be setting up.
Some of these experiments we talked about.
Awesome.
Should we go do it?
All righty. Let's go.
Jael: Let's do that.
Hey, michael.
Hey, ben, how are you?
Good. Good.
Are you ready to do this?
We are absolutely ready to play.
What have we got set up here?
We have the officer behind us.
He's gonna be the chase car.
I'm sergeant myers.
Y'all can call me shawn.
You've got the roads blocked off.
We do, in all four directions.
So we're just gonna leave this parking lot.
And do our first u-turn...
And then do some supernatural speeding.
Nice.
Well, jael and I will be using some new radar guns.
We're gonna be testing the speeds further down the road,
And we'll see what happens.
Cool.
Uh, I'm just - I'm just - just kidding.
It's a bad habit.
Yes.
Ben: So, we're about ready to start our first experiment,
Which is the u-turn experiment.
In the ghost-car video, the ghost car takes this u-turn...
...And takes off.
At what some would say is a supernatural speed,
Leaving the officer wondering where he went.
So, we've got our own stunt car.
It looks almost exactly like our ghost car.
And we got a professional driver.
That'll be executing these u-turns.
And we have our own chase vehicle,
Which is a police-department vehicle.
In which austin will be riding shotgun.
I've been with ben and the group from the start,
From the very beginning.
My background's in biology, but I'm also a thrill-seeker.
I love an adrenaline rush.
It usually always puts me right in the center of the action.
And I absolutely love it.
If our stunt car can duplicate the u-turn...
...And get the same distance away,
That would help to further explain.
That maybe this wasn't a paranormal event after all.
Jael: All right, so, we're at the shoulder of the road right now.
And we've got the whole road shut down -
Cops, everybody's at a standstill.
Bruce is ready to go, apparently.
And we are ready to do our u-turn at the moment.
Austin:
I'm currently riding shotgun.
In the front seat of our buddy shawn,
Who's an officer of garden city police department.
We're getting ready to try our first experiment.
My heart's starting to race.
Blood's starting to boil.
We're gonna be doing a high-speed pursuit,
Trying to re-enact the exact video that we have.
We have cameras in the car.
We have cameras on the car.
We got cameras everywhere, seeing if we can get every angle.
And prove to see if this is something paranormal.
Or something that we can make happen.
Michael is gunning to go.
He looks like he's ready to go.
He is ready to do this.
We're on this other side of the ditch.
Just in case things get out of control, we're not in the way.
Or so we don't die.
So we don't die.
Yep, we're ready.
In 3, 2, 1!
So, we're about ready to start our first experiment.
If our stunt car can duplicate the u-turn,
Maybe this wasn't a paranormal event after all.
In 3, 2, 1!
Go!
Ben: We're up to 50 miles an hour now.
I'm really worried that we're not gonna be able.
To duplicate this disappearing u-turn.
We're trying to duplicate some very specific maneuvers,
Which makes it very risky and very dangerous.
Austin: Is this about how far away.
You would follow somebody in a normal pursuit, shawn?
Myers:
Yeah, about this distance.
Have you ever lost anybody in a u-turn?
You ever seen a car disappear while making a u-turn?
Once or twice.
He's swerving like in the video, hitting 56.
Let's get out of the way.
That's it.
Austin: He is definitely out of sight right now.
He is nowhere to be seen. We're gonna see if we can catch him.
There he is, coming out up front.
I can see glimpses of his tail.
I can barely make out a little bit of red.
This is exactly how it looks in the video -
About this far away, kind of some dramatic driving,
Absolutely insane.
Ben: All right.
Austin:
That is what I'm talking about!
It seriously looked almost just like the video.
We definitely got the footage we needed.
You got the "t" just right.
Ben: You're hitting it, like, on a dime,
And I think we got what we needed from it. Super.
Let's go under the fence.
Let's do the fence.
Let's make it happen.
We'll follow you there.
That is what I'm talking about.
One of the most prevalent theories.
Is that the car hit a ditch before getting to the fence.
And it somehow launched it up and over it.
Right here, we've got this ramp that's been built up,
And we've got our fence, but we're gonna see if we can do it.
The fence is exactly 6 feet high,
Just like our other fence that we had,
And it's about, what,
10 feet from the ramp?
So, officer daniels talked.
About the car going about 40 miles an hour.
That's what we're gonna have mike do.
He's gonna go out, come hit this thing about 40 miles an hour,
And, hopefully, he's gonna clear this thing.
Jael: Mike, how dangerous is a stunt like this?
I do have a lucky coin on.
As long as I've had it on,
I've never been hurt.
Ready?
Here we go.
Ben: Michael, ready?
In 3, 2, 1!
There he goes.
Oh, he just made that!
I can't believe he made that.
He didn't even take the fence out.
Wow.
Yes!
Whoa! Hey!
He's not even fazed.
Hey, mike!
Ha ha.
How are you?
Are you okay?
I'm good.
Yeah?
You all right?
The car's hardly even dented.
Okay, now that you're finished, do you think that somebody.
Without all the equipment and all the safety gear.
Could have gotten over something like this without getting hurt?
No, they would have definitely gotten hurt.
Okay.
Austin:
Let's get this man out.
Yeah, look at this fence, guys.
Unbelievable.
The fact is that in the original location,
There was a small ditch.
There was nothing even comparable.
To a manmade, set-up, perfect ramp.
There's no way, especially making that sharp turn it did,
It could have gotten enough speed off a small ditch.
To clear a fence perfectly.
I think we've proven it's possible, but how possible?
Correct?
Yeah.
I think we need to keep trying a few more tests,
Because I don't think this is what occurred.
Ben: So, we're here in front of a fence.
That is almost exactly the same height.
I mean, I'm 6'6".
This thing's about 6 feet,
Same as the old fence we had over there.
And what we're going to do.
Is remove some of the fasteners on the fence,
Which officer daniels said were missing.
You can see up here where we've got it secured,
It's really sturdy, really rigid.
But down on the bottom, we've taken off the bottom fastener.
And what we're going to do is drive the car through it.
And hope that the fence will come up.
And let the car slide underneath it.
And come right back down, just like in the video.
So, hopefully, he'll hit between
30 and 40 miles an hour,
Just like he did in the video.
Like I said, there's many variables,
But if we've calculated this correctly -
Well, if he goes straight through,
We've pretty much debunked the myth of the ghost car,
Haven't we?
Jael: I've been a journalist and a reporter.
I traveled the world with josh gates.
On "destination truth."
What I love about being on this team.
Is that I can really use my skills to get to the bottom.
Of some of the craziest paranormal cases out there.
It looks like we're about ready to go.
All right.
Ben: In 3, 2, 1, go!
Here we go.
Ben: What we're going to do is drive the car through it.
And then hope that the fence will come up.
And let the car slide underneath it.
In 3, 2, 1, go!
Oh, my god! Wow!
We both were wrong.
All right.
Wow.
Well?
What do we do with that?
I don't know.
There goes that theory.
The posts are definitely still in place,
Yet the whole top of the fence came off the top rung.
I honestly did not expect that to happen.
Austin: We just watched stunt-car driver mike,
In the ghost car, take off, hit the fence doing about 25.
However, it did not go really as we had planned.
The whole fence popped off.
Nothing stayed.
Apparently, either the fence wasn't stable enough,
Wasn't put together,
Or - who knows? -
Maybe it's just impossible.
Should we see if it's salvageable?
Absolutely.
Okay. We got to hoist it up and then move these.
We are going to hoist this fence back up.
And attempt the experiment one more time.
But, ben, I think this time what we might want to do.
Is actually have four fence fasteners instead of two.
I agree.
Because we don't know how much strength the old fence had.
Maybe that'll keep it from -
I think two on each end this time instead of one.
So, what we realized is what made this fence fall.
Is these top caps popped off, and that happened.
Because we took off too many of these fasteners.
So what we're gonna do.
Is go back and put a few more of these on it.
Hopefully, it'll keep everything intact.
Right about here, do you think?
Um, maybe a little bit higher, even.
Think we're good to go?
Let's have him go another run.
All right.
Jael:
This is our last try.
To get the ghost car to go through the fence.
If we can't pull this off and debunk it,
Then I do not have a reasonable explanation.
On how this car got through the fence.
Maybe the whole ghost-car event was paranormal.
Ben: Michael, ready?
In 3, 2, 1!
Here we go.
There we go.
There it is.
I think this is a key piece of evidence right here.
This could be our answer.
I couldn't believe it.
No. Yeah.
We have a lot of notes to compare.
So, how was it?
We just got back from georgia.
Well, tell us about it.
So, our third experiment.
Was to try to get our car to go through the fence.
Watch what happened.
Michael, ready?
In 3, 2, 1!
Whoa!
It's good.
Wow.
Wow.
Larry:
Can you believe that?
It opens like a theater curtain.
Oh, my gosh.
And goes down just in time.
To not even detect any movement from it.
Here we go.
Side by side.
This final turn, he turns left.
The fence goes up...
...Comes down.
Wow.
Completely intact.
Not even moving.
By the time the officer turns around,
Officer daniels sees the fence.
Just as it comes down and stops moving.
We catch the taillights at about the same point.
Tell me that's not what happened. That's it.
Is there any question.
That that's what happened that night?
I don't think there's anything ghostly about that.
Altogether, you would say.
There was nothing paranormal about this case.
Finally, an answer.
Bill:
Thanks to you guys.
Ghost car - case closed.
Oh!
So, the savannah ghost car -
Nothing paranormal about that one.
Bill, how did the arizona lights case go?
Well, with the arizona lights, we had compelling video.
And a seemingly credible witness,
And we came up with some great ideas.
On how we could re-create the footage.
Here's what happened.
Bill: Jeff?
Hey, how you doing?
Doing well.
How about you?
Maybe we start off by you telling me.
About the circumstances that you were in.
When you shot that video.
Me and my friend - we decided we were gonna do.
A video on ufos, a documentary.
Actually went over here near these mountains right here.
At about 7:00.
And then all of a sudden, four lights appeared.
And the light on the far right disappeared.
And skipped in front of the remaining three.
Let me ask you -
I know that we're really close to luke air force base.
Is there any chance at all.
That those lights that you saw could be military flares?
The next day,
I called luke air force base,
And they said not only were they not dropping flares,
But they had no planes up at the time.
Is there any way that we can take this camera from you?
Yeah.
Jeff, great meeting you.
Good to meet you.
We're headed to the area.
That jeff willes recorded the video.
That brought us into this case.
We're gonna set up a base camp,
And we're gonna conduct a series of experiments.
To see if we can re-create what we saw on tape.
Let me grab the gear bag here.
Here are the lasers.
What we're gonna do is just set up a pane of glass,
And we're gonna shoot lasers in it.
And show that anyone can actually do.
This very simple experiment and put lights in the sky.
At a specific time of day and record it.
I'm a tv journalist, and I love photography,
Which comes in really handy.
When I'm analyzing photos and videos.
During my paranormal research.
I'm a natural-born skeptic,
And I think that my experience will help me determine.
If these lights are an optical hoax or the real deal.
That's gonna be the camera's point of view.
So, right over that second peak,
In between the first peak and the second peak,
We want to see those lights going on and off, on and off.
I'm a video specialist during the day,
But my real love is paranormal research,
Which I've been doing for 15 years.
My background does help me catch hoaxes,
Like some people think in this case jumping lights.
If you think about the height of the glass,
It's like - it can be from here to here.
We don't want this glass to slip.
We don't have another pane.
Don't tell me that.
Grab that end.
I'll grab this end.
Okay, very good.
Chi-lan: Wow, guys, this is some setup.
I think we should hunker down for a little while,
Let the sun dip down below the horizon,
And let's resume the experiments.
Hey, guys, conditions are, like, perfect.
It's like we've got just an amount of ambient light.
It looks just like what we have in jeff's video.
We only have a small window of opportunity, no pun intended.
I'm gonna turn on the camera so we can go ahead.
And try to get the same angle.
That we saw in jeff's video on may 12th.
Larry: I have always loved the paranormal.
I carried that love for the paranormal.
All the way into college, where I met ben.
He asked me to join the group as the effects specialist,
And it was a no-brainer - easiest decision I've ever made.
We're only gonna have a couple of minutes for this.
I'm gonna use the green wavelength,
Which is the more powerful of the two,
Between the red and the green.
You ready, larry?
Yep.
Okay, 3, 2, 1...
On.
Chi-lan: What we're gonna do is just set up a pane of glass,
And we're gonna shoot lasers in it.
And show that anyone can actually do.
This very simple experiment and record it.
You ready, larry?
Yep.
On.
All right.
Do you see it?
I see it, actually, very well.
Let me look through your viewfinder.
Oh, yeah.
There it is.
There it is.
It looks really convincing.
With both sides of the pane, it's making two different orbs.
Independent.
Look at that. Now it's three.
Yeah, you're right.
My gosh, it actually works.
It's working.
I can't get the movement the same.
I have to, like, keep it out of line.
Otherwise, this happens.
See how it does that?
That doesn't happen in the video.
You know what?
The motion is just not right.
It's the pattern that
I'm having the problem with.
If it's flaring, that's not what we saw in the video.
The laser in the glass has got similarities to the video.
Thing is, we just can't nail the movement down.
We can't get that pattern.
To replicate what we had in jeff's video.
I think we should just move on to the next experiment.
I want to get the balloons up.
All right.
Larry, grab that toolbox.
We have just enough time to set this up, so let's jump on this.
We have six balloons that inflate to 6 feet.
The balloon is gonna hoist the lamp, like this.
Once it's inflated, it'll be like that.
There is a dimmer panel.
That's it right there.
It's standard dimmers, but we can turn each light on and off.
Hopefully, it will look like hyper jumping,
Because one light will go off.
And the other one goes on on the other side.
We're gonna get the balloons inflated one by one.
You guys are gonna send them up,
Another person - like you -
Is gonna be controlling the lights.
Turn them on and off.
I'll be at the vantage point.
And if it's the right poin in the horizon.
And I'm seeing it and I'm taping it.
And it looks similar to jeff's video,
We've got a possible explanation.
Okay.
Ready?
Think that's 6 feet. , the zip tie is gonna fasten...
Bill: It's gonna go on the neck itself.
I can see your hand shaking.
Nice and tight.
Don't catch your finger.
Now we're gonna attach the lantern.
So, it's gonna go here.
All right.
Very good.
We have a lot of work to do.
We've got a lot more wiring.
We've got to find our position in the field.
We've got to jump on the control.
After we get these things wired up.
Gether...
And a little tighter...
And ready to go.
We have 6 ools, all of them 500 feet,
That we're gonna be able to lift up over that horizon.
I'm gonna head over to the vantage point,
Because when I look at the video,
It was right above the horizon is where the lights were.
We're hoping that these balloons.
Would disappear against the darkened sky.
And I will only see the lanterns.
That the balloons have hoisted up.
Fortunately,
I have jeff's original camera,
And I'll be able to record using his exact camera.
That he used to recordn 2005.
Chi-lan: The balloons are set in the same pattern as we saw.
With all the orb lights.
All right, let's go wait at master control.
When we get the okay, we'll turn these guys on.
That's it.
All right.
Looking good.
Hey, guys, heads up.
The ambient lighting.
Is just about where it was on jeff's video.
The lighting is good for the next probably three minutes.
Begin hyper jump.
Begin hyper jump.
Go.
Hey, bill, are you seeing ufo magic up there?
Actually, it's looking really good.
Team, I think we can conclude this phase of the experiment.
We just launched the balloons.
It looked okay,
But it wasn't exactly the same as jeff's original video.
It's time for us to do a nighttime investigation.
We're gonna put some cameras on the ground,
As well as one pointing at the sky.
We hope to catch something as it happens.
Or find some trace evidence.
Chi-lan, larry, excellent work.
This is the spot that all the reports.
About the ufo activity have been centered around.
We've got the four
I.R. Cameras set up.
We're covering the whole mountain range.
You're gonna stay here and monitor all the video,
So keep your eyes on the screens.
If you see something, you got to let us know.
In some of the videos,
It seemed like the crafts have been coming low,
Or, in the cases where they feel that flares have fallen,
We'll have contact with the ground,
So we're gonna go look for trace evidence.
Sounds good. Okay?
Let's make this count.
I'm hearing something over there.
Did you hear that?
Larry, have you seen anything at all on the cameras?
Larry: As of right now, I mean,
I see the star in the sky here.
No sign of anything unusual.
I cannot see anything.
There's something unsettling about the atmosphere.
Mm-hmm.
Shine your light over there.
That's the second time
I've heard something.
I am hearing something over there.
Bill to larry - keep your eyes peeled.
For the left side of the mountain range, please.
We keep hearing some sort of movement out here.
What is it exactly that you're hearing?
It's kind of.
Maybe like a low humming noise and then a thump.
I'm looking at the camera.
That you're in front of right now - camera 1.
I cannot see anything in the sky.
As for the ground, my vantage point is very limited.
I cannot see anything.
Seems like the closer we get to this mountain range,
The more we're hearing this humming sound.
And these thuds.
Ho!
I didn't enjoy that sound.
Bill, bill, come in.
I've been looking at a star in the sky for a while now,
But it's moving - it's definitely not a star.
It's going up and down, back and forth. Look up there.
Bill, bill, come in.
I've been looking at a star in the sky for a while now,
But it's moving - it's definitely not a star.
It's going up and down, back and forth.
Look up there...
...Just to make sure you're seeing what I'm seeing.
We do. We see it with the naked eye right here.
No camera lens, no zoom, nothing. We can see it.
L-I don't know what this is.
Chi-lan:
Oh, my god!
It's moving back and forth, back and forth,
Very erratic for any light in the sky.
It's definitely not a satellite.
Look.
It's moving away from us.
It's gone.
At first, it was moving at such a steady pace.
That I really did think it was a satellite.
But now, in watching it, it did then cut left,
And now it's going right again.
Satellites just go in orbit.
It's not a star.
It's not a planet.
Not if it's moving at that pace.
I don't know of any aircraft that moves in a zigzag.
So, we've been out here for hours.
I mean, we finally have been able to capture something.
It hasn't been on the ground, like they were hoping.
It's actually been in the sky.
This is more than I could have asked for.
I think it's more than any of us could ask for.
Bill: We've witnessed some lights in the sky that defy explanation.
At this time of the night,
There shouldn't be any planes in the area that we know of.
The movement of these lights are different from any satellites.
Or an object in the sky that we know of.
We need to get back to the situation room.
And examine the video we've captured.
To try to decide what it is.
We had an interview with jeff willes.
We took the recording and had it analyzed.
With the same technology used by law-enforcement agencies.
So, I'm gonna actually pull up the results of that,
And I want you guys to take a look.
Man: If they did hoax it, I would like to know how they did it,
Because I have no idea how that could be done.
So, as you can see here, it says "truth."
He's obviously telling us.
That this is the most compelling evidence.
He has seen or recorded.
With some great video evidence to inspire us,
We had a couple of experiments that we had hopes for.
One of them was the laser experiment.
It looked good, but it didn't work. Couldn't get the motion.
We moved on to balloons with electric lanterns,
And although we were able to get the motion,
We couldn't get the altitude.
That wasn't convincing, either.
Now, since it was nighttime,
We realized we were gonna just hunker down.
And conduct a nighttime investigation.
It was during this nighttime investigation.
We had hoped that we could find maybe some trace evidence.
Or record something ourselves,
And it was then we caught something in the sky.
You caught something on tape?
I believe if you take a look at the clip we have cued,
You'll see for yourself.
Let's see what you got.
Austin: Whoa!
Wow!
Look at the speed.
That thing is hauling.
You sure that's not, like, a helicopter?
It was completely silent.
It was moving far too fast.
To be an aircraft of any sort that we know of.
And it's definitely not a satellite.
Satellites sometimes you can see with the naked eye,
But they move very slow across the sky.
It was going in one direction.
You're watching it, you're watching it.
All of a sudden, it just would cut back in the other direction.
Especially at that velocity, like bill said,
I don't know of any aircraft.
That's capable of doing something like that.
The simple speed of this thing.
Made it where we can only say.
That there is mysterious ufos over the sky of arizona,
And we happened to get it on tape.
So, what do you guys think?
It looks to me like this place.
Is a hotbed of paranormal activity.
Couldn't replicate the original video,
And we caught something on-camera we can't identify.
This video breathes new life.
Into the notion that there is ufo activity over phoenix.
We can all see that it's a flying object.
That's unidentifiable.
There's something out there.
We don't know what it is.
Transcript by Adriano_CSI
Every day in the heart of Africa, amazing true stories happen that no one ever sees.
Not so long ago on these plains, two mothers battled forces that sought to destroy them.
Only by showing extraordinary courage would these mothers prevail.
A mighty river divides this land.
It marks the boundary between two rival families of lions.
To the south lives the River Pride, six lionesses and their cubs.
They're a close-knit family, and rely on each other for comfort and protection.
Layla is the oldest and most experienced lioness.
She has just one cub, six-month-old Mara.
Layla's age is starting to show.
A lifetime of hunting has taken its toll.
The cubs are fed and raised by the lionesses, but they are protected by the pride's ruler,
Fang.
His broken tooth is a war wound from a recent battle, and a mark of his bravery.
He is the father of all of the cubs and their defender.
To Mara, he's the best dad ever.
Fang keeps Mara and her mother safe, and guards their pride lands, rich lands that every year host a great migration a million strong.
Fang lets all other lions know that he alone rules the southern kingdom.
North of the river lives a very different cat, the fastest creature on land, a cheetah.
Sita's life is different from a lion's in every way, because she lives alone.
Sita has a secret.
Not long ago, she gave birth in this grassy den to five cubs.
They are still blind, helpless and totally reliant on their mother.
Sita is a single mother, and with no pride to help her, she must leave her cubs all alone when she hunts.
Cheetahs may be the fastest animals on land, but hunting still isn't easy.
The Thomson's gazelles she favors are almost as fast and very agile.
Sita is built for speed, but has no staying power.
To have any chance, she must sneak as close as possible.
Under 30 seconds before exhaustion.
It's now or never.
Success.
Sita's cubs will not go hungry today.
The river is a great bringer of life to this wilderness, but it can also be a deadly foe.
The surging rapids can carry even the strongest lion to his death.
This is where dragons dwell.
The River Pride feeds on a dead hippo washed up on the river's bank.
Crocodiles don't fear the rulers of the land, with one exception.
Fang.
Today, the pride's protector has earned his keep.
A crocodile-infested river does have one benefit.
It protects the pride from invasion from the north.
The northern kingdom is ruled by Fang's greatest enemy,
Kali.
And Kali is not alone.
He has four sons in their prime.
Together, they form the most powerful force in this land, one set on conquest.
Kali already rules the lionesses of the north, but he is not content with that.
He and his sons are driven to expand their realm to the south. lf he overthrows Fang, he will kill Mara and have new cubs of his own.
Kali is little Mara's greatest danger.
For now, the river is high, a barrier that Kali will not cross.
But eventually, its waters will fall.
For Sita's five cubs, living in their snug little home seems like paradise.
The cubs are now old enough
For their first trip.
The gazelle herds have moved on, and the family needs to catch up.
Sita quickly discovers that herding cats isn't easy.
For Sita, it's time to cross the open plains to find them food.
For the cubs, it's a huge adventure.
What an amazing first adventure.
Massive herds still cross Fang's southern kingdom, so food is plentiful for the River Pride.
Layla may be old, but she is the most experienced hunter.
She knows the best place to stage an ambush.
The lionesses hunt as a team.
With Layla leading, they slowly begin to close the trap.
Despite her aging body,
Layla is determined to help the pride.
Hunting is always dangerous.
Layla and her sisters must eat quickly if they are to get the reward they deserve.
Fang, the protector, demands the lion's share.
For Layla, the hunt is a disaster.
A zebra's kick has injured her further.
Staying fit is critical for a lioness.
The pride cannot carry a female who is too weak to hunt.
Something's wrong.
Kali and his sons are on patrol.
Lions are Sita's greatest enemy.
A male is more than five times her size.
As a single cheetah, she would flee.
But with dependent cubs, she must hold her ground.
She is totally focused on Kali.
Incredibly, she's goading him.
It seems insane, but it's a trick.
She's drawing him away from her cubs.
Kali tires.
It worked.
His son, however, is more determined.
Sita is risking everything.
Her speed has won the day, for now.
Her terrified cubs are scattered and lost, in danger until they're back with their mother.
Time is not on their side.
The dark will cloak other predators.
It's a mother's worst nightmare.
Hyenas have taken two of her cubs.
They're gone forever.
The season is changing and the pride lands are drying.
The great herds are moving on in search of greener pastures.
They may be gone for a year or more.
With the herds gone, the River Pride will struggle to find food.
Layla is exhausted by her injuries.
Mara tries to comfort her mother, but there is little she can do.
With the herds moving on, the pride must follow.
Layla cannot go on.
She needs rest so her body can heal.
Mara faces a terrible choice, stay with her mother or follow the pride.
Layla calls to the pride and to Mara, begging them to wait for her.
But the pride must leave in search of food.
They cannot jeopardize themselves and the other cubs.
The pride moves further and further away.
Layla forces herself to try and follow.
Mara stays with Layla, but is in danger now.
Mother and daughter have lost the protection of the pride.
Layla must find the strength to catch up,
For the sake of her daughter.
Sita's cubs are growing in leaps and bounds.
In their minds, they're the fiercest hunters in the land.
Enemies approach.
Three cheetah brothers.
They may be fellow cheetahs, but these brothers can be dangerous for Sita's cubs.
They are the one foe she cannot outrun.
The brothers back down, but they have separated Sita from her young.
Male cheetahs will sometimes attack small cubs.
Incredibly, the cubs hold their ground.
They have their mother's spirit.
In this land, even bullies get bullied.
The lionesses are tired
After their long journey.
But cubs will be cubs and siesta time is soon over.
New playmates are always welcome.
Luckily, he can't get the lid off.
Layla and Mara have braved the long journey and finally caught up.
But their timing couldn't be worse.
The river has fallen.
The pride's protective moat has gone.
Kali sees his chance to invade the southern kingdom.
Kali and his largest son cross the crocodile-infested waters.
Fang senses the danger.
Sounding strong might deter an attack.
But Kali is not fooled.
Fang sees it's two against one.
His chances are slim.
Kali attacks.
Fang has no answer.
Kali's son threatens, too.
Fang deserts his pride, leaving them unprotected.
Kali is poised for takeover.
Mara may be killed.
But a mother will do anything to save her cub.
Layla is the lionesses leader.
Despite her injury, she puts herself between the invaders and the precious cubs.
Inspired by Layla, the other lionesses attack.
Layla and the lionesses have saved the pride and their precious cubs.
Kali has lost this battle, but next time he may bring reinforcements.
Fang has also been saved by the lionesses.
But for how long?
The attack has taken a terrible toll.
This little cub is badly hurt and lucky to be alive, but Mara is nowhere to be found.
Layla has taken
Another devastating blow in the fight.
It takes all her strength just to get to her feet.
She must find her Mara.
With a mother's desperate hope, she calls for her cub.
Mara has survived.
Her mother's bravery has saved her.
There is no greater bond than that between a lioness and her cub.
The rains have returned, but the herds are still far away.
Hunting is never easy.
Now, it's dangerous for Sita as well.
Hyenas.
Sita has already lost two of her cubs to these deadly enemies.
Her biggest fear is that they will steal the others.
The hyenas call, drawing in more and more of the pack.
They know Sita is hiding something.
Bit by bit, they tighten the noose.
The hyenas have been kept at bay.
This time, Sita's courageous defense has saved the cubs.
Cold, hard rain.
This is a time of suffering for everyone.
For the River Pride, the cold rain has been a blessing in disguise.
It allows them to appreciate the bond and protection of a larger family.
One of Layla's sisters, Malaika, has small cubs of her own.
With her injuries not healing,
Layla is drawn closer to her sister's family. lf Layla builds a bond with her sister, then Malaika might look after Mara as well as her own cubs.
Layla's time is short.
Strengthening the bond with her sister may be Mara's best chance to live.
Layla may soon have to give up her cub.
And Mara's life will depend on getting closer to her cousins.
It's happening.
Mara is being adopted by Malaika and the pride.
There's nothing better for a lion than close companionship.
With Mara safe,
Layla can go.
The time has come for Layla to leave the pride forever.
Layla struggles to find a quiet, safe place to be alone.
The pride is now far away.
Mara searches for any scent, any sign of her mother, but it's not there.
All alone with her precious cub far away,
Layla, at last, gives up the fight.
Sita's cubs have grown in size and strength, and they can't wait to show off their new powers.
Since the failed invasion,
Kali has prowled the southern side of the river with his largest son.
Now, he calls on his other sons
To join them.
Kali goes to greet his sons.
They have been separated for some time.
The family bonds between these ruthless fighters are very strong.
But there is also fierce rivalry between them.
They all want the crown.
But Kali is their father and he lets them know that he is still king.
Together, they are the most powerful force in the land.
Together, they will make another assault on Fang and the River Pride.
Fang's future as leader is hanging by a thread.
As the months have passed, the cubs have grown into young adults.
Within this close-knit family,
Mara has thrived.
She is now a teenager in lion years.
The bonds of affection within the
River Pride have never been stronger.
Kali and his sons are coming with a vengeance.
Fang's enemies lock in.
They launch the attack.
Fang's only hope is escape.
He runs for his life.
Fang will be shown no mercy if he stays.
Kali's gang is victorious, and Fang is never seen again.
Now the invaders attack the rest of the River Pride.
The fighting is over.
Kali and his sons rule.
Their will is now law on both sides of the river.
Kali's sons try to make peace with the lionesses.
But in the battle the youngsters were driven away.
The pain of losing them is still too fresh.
The pride's young males are in the greatest danger.
Kali's gang view them as a threat and hunt them down.
Mara also fled in the battle, but as a lioness, is in less danger.
For the first time in her life, she is alone.
She has lost everything.
Kali's gang drive out Mara's young male cousins, banishing them from the pride lands forever.
And there is only one escape route, across the river.
The river has swollen, but the young males have no choice but to cross.
And now, the crocodiles have the advantage.
The youngsters know what lurks just beneath, but they fear Kali more than they fear crocodiles.
The current drags them down into deeper water.
They are in over their heads in every sense.
They've escaped,
But just by the skin of a crocodile's teeth.
With all the warring between lions south of the river, life in the north has been relatively carefree for Sita.
The cubs have grown to young adults, but they're still cubs at heart.
Sita is not finished with their training.
It's time for another journey, one where they can learn the final lessons they'll need to survive.
Lesson one, buffalo are very grumpy.
Lesson two,
Never get fresh with an ostrich.
The savanna is the greatest schoolyard, but some of the other kids are a bit different.
A serval cat is drafted into a game of tag.
It's no fun for the serval, but the young cheetahs can safely test their skills against smaller teeth and claws.
And wouldn't every cat just love to chase a dog?
A jackal is the perfect size.
Lesson three, even little dogs bite back.
Lesson four, hyenas.
The cubs remember all too well
Their terrifying encounters with hyenas when they were small.
Now, they must learn to stand their ground.
The cubs have finally come to terms with hyenas.
They're close to becoming independent cheetahs.
But not just yet.
With her family blown to the wind,
Mara has found living alone a challenge.
With no pride to hunt with her, she's going hungry.
Warthogs seem to be the perfect meal, small, tasty and easy to catch.
Not quite so easy after all.
The herds are still gone, and all the other alternatives seem to be super-sized.
But young lions think they're a match for anything. lf only Mara had taken Sita's class in avoiding grumpy buffalo.
Now the real cost of losing her family is painfully clear.
Mara was driven out before she learnt to hunt.
The gazelles that Sita hunts have crossed the river to the south.
She must follow them or her family will starve.
For the cubs, this may be their most dangerous lesson yet.
Sita rarely crosses the river.
She knows it's deadly.
They've just entered Kali's new realm.
The River Pride lionesses once again proclaim their ownership of the pride lands.
They have made peace with Kali.
Their new ruler has become a committed protector.
Mara is still an outcast.
With food scarce, the lionesses don't want Mara taking a share.
She must fend for herself.
It seems harsh, but the other lionesses have new priorities.
Cubs.
Kali's cubs.
Kali has achieved his goal.
The lionesses are now raising his cubs, not Fang's.
Sita and her family confidently stride across Kali's land.
The young cheetahs now have the confidence to challenge everything in their path.
Even lions.
But wait.
The young cheetahs have yet to learn that lions live in prides.
The hunters are being hunted.
This lesson is not hunting lions, it's escaping them!
Kali.
The game is over.
The most important lesson, never mess with lions.
The sight that Mara and all the lions have been longing for.
At last the great herds are returning to the pride lands.
For the lions, the good times are back.
With the pride lands rich again, it's also a chance for Mara to end her hunger.
No longer hungry,
Mara has one last goal, to be accepted back into the River Pride.
Sita's work is done.
She has taught her cubs everything they need to know about this wilderness.
The cubs have survived the toughest of upbringings, but now they know what's safe, what's dangerous and, above all, how to hunt.
Sita knows her cubs are ready to fend for themselves.
She must return to the solitary life of a cheetah.
Against all odds, with the courage that only a mother can bring,
Sita has raised three magnificent cheetahs.
Mara is desperate to rejoin her mother's pride into which she was born, but will Malaika and the lionesses welcome her back?
The lionesses have finally accepted
Mara back into their family.
Layla's brave fight for her cub to live on was not in vain.
The River Pride is reborn.
Sita's cubs and Mara are living proof of the power of a mother's love.
Ripped & spellchecked by Itzik Gur
A hundred years ago, all was right with our world.
Prosperity and peace filled our days.
The Four Nations:
Water, Earth, Fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony.
Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element.
The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements.
He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World.
With the Spirits'guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world.
And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey!
It Worked better that time.
I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Yeah. I guess so.
Just stop doing that stuff around me.
I alWays get Wet.
My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city.
Our father is off fighting in The War.
My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young.
In this time of war, food is scarce.
My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.
- Tiger seal.
- Are you sure?
I did everything Dad said to do.
I Watched Which side of the fin tracks are more indented.
That shoWs Which direction they're going.
I saW hoW long the drag skids are.
That shoWs you hoW fast they're going.
There's something under there.
It's a cave-in!
Move aWay from the cracks!
Katara, don't go near it.
This is probably some Fire Nation trick.
Just back aWay really sloW.
Katara! Do not hit that sphere!
Uncle, look!
Is he breathing?
Did you see that light shoot into the sky?
What's your name?
HoW did you get here?
HoW did you get in the ice?
He's exhausted.
We need to get him back to the village.
What is this thing?
It's trying to eat me!
Look. See?
HoW'd you get all the Way out here?
I ran aWay from home.
We got in a storm. We Were forced under the Water of the ocean.
I see.
It Wasn't very smart. I Was just upset.
- Thanks for saving me.
- Lucky.
I probably should get home.
They'll all be Worried.
- You're not still upset?
- Not as much as I Was.
The Fire Nation is here.
- What?
- And they brought their machines.
Don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
- Is something Wrong?
- No. Please Wait here.
- Hurry, noW!
- Secure the area!
It can't be coincidence that We break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and noW the
Fire Nation is here With their machines.
Sokka, don't.
I am Prince Zuko...
...son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne!
Bring me all your elderly!
- Papa!
- Move!
Yeah?
Grandma!
Please don't... don't harm him!
Come on!
Katara, don't.
- Form a line!
- Come on!
Here.
Hey.
Grammy!
You're scaring these people.
Who are you? What's your name?!
- I don't need to tell you anything.
- Firebenders!
I'm taking you to my ship.
If you don't come,
I'll burn doWn this village.
I'll go With you.
Don't hurt anyone.
They Were looking for someone old and they Were looking for someone
With the same markings the boy had.
They dragged Mom aWay the same Way When We Were babies.
She Wouldn't have Watched us being taken aWay. She Would have fought.
We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight.
What Would you do if they tried to take me aWay?
I'd kill them all.
- Why?
- Because you're my sister.
Because Dad told me to protect you With my life.
Because I'm your responsibility.
And this boy is our responsibility.
What do you Want us to do, Katara?
HoW are We supposed to save him?
They're on a ship.
We'd need a miracle to catch them.
I knoW you think everything's going to Work out, but I don't.
His bison creature thing floats.
What do you Want With me?
My nepheW Wants me to perform a little test on you.
- What kind of test?
- I assure you, it Won't hurt.
I've performed it hundreds of times.
It only takes a feW moments.
And then you're free to go.
Would you mind if I put a feW things in front of you at the table?
It Will only take a moment.
That's all you Want?
My name is Iroh, and you have my Word.
Grandma, I knoW you're gonna try to stop us,
- but this is just something I need...
- Sit doWn.
I kneW from the first time
We discovered you Were a Bender, that one day,
I Would realize your destiny.
There hasn't been a Waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama Was taken aWay.
Today, I found out that destiny.
Did you see that boy's tattoos?
Tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century.
I believe they are Airbending tattoos.
HoW can that be?
I believe that little boy might be the Avatar.
Once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
What is the Spirit World, Grandma?
It's not a place made up of things you can touch.
But it exists, nonetheless.
It is filled With the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures...
...that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests.
Each of these creatures is a Spirit.
They've Watched over us since the beginning.
They have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
Aren't there Spirits here?
Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're Watching us
With great sadness...
The Fire Nation doesn't Wish to live by the Spirits.
That's Why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
- What can he do?
- With his mastery of the four elements, he Will begin to change hearts.
And it is in the heart that all Wars are Won.
NoW, go help this boy.
He Will need you tWo.
And We all need him.
You are my prisoner...
...Airbender.
I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
- You said...
- I apologize.
I should have explained further.
If you failed the test, as all others did, you Were free to leave.
But, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire World
Who could pass this test.
It is truly an honor to be in your presence.
Don't even try to escape.
This is a Warship!
Stop! There's no Way you can...
Don't move! You have noWhere to run!
Halt!
Don't let him escape!
Get him!
Thanks for bringing Appa to me.
The Fire Nation is up to something.
I have to go back noW.
- We'll come With you.
- I can take you back to the village.
We're going With you.
You found the Avatar.
For a moment, I had my honor back.
Your destinies are tied, Zuko.
That, you can be sure of.
Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned.
Aang Airbended a sphere around them, and ice formed.
And he couldn't remember anything after that.
Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back!
Hey, guys! I Want you to meet someone!
This is Where you live?
They must be playing some trick or something.
Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment.
He's the teacher responsible for me.
He's kind of like my father.
- Is it OK if you tell me your name?
- The monks named me Aang.
OK, guys! Enough!
Spider-rat!
They're poisonous! Get behind me.
He's a flying lemur-bat.
We keep them as pets.
Weren't they extinct a long time ago?
Extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
Your friends Were monks?
I knoW Where they are right noW.
They're at the prayer field!
Aang, Wait! I have to talk to you!
Aang...
...I think you Were in that ice for almost a hundred years.
- The Firebenders started a War.
- I left a feW days ago.
Aang, the Fire Nation kneW the Avatar
Would be born into the Air Nomads...
...so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
You're lying!
You're lying!
This is Monk Gyatso's.
I made it for him.
No!
Katara! Stay aWay from him!
Katara!
Stay away from him!
Your friends were monks?
The Avatar?
Where have you been?
Aang!
You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need!
Don't give up! We can do this together!
Aang!
The banished prince.
Let's offer him lunch.
I Wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining With us.
As you knoW, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the Prince, and renounced his love of him, and Will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar.
The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he Will become strong and become a Worthy heir to the throne.
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.
For example, it seems
I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not alloWed to Wear the Fire Nation uniform.
But We Will let him Wear it today, like a child Wearing a costume.
One day, my father Will take me back and you Will boW before me.
You OK?
I'll be fine.
You knoW, my grandma thinks because you're an Airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
HoW much does the Fire Nation control?
A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here.
They haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
So...
...are you the Avatar, Aang?
What is this?
Stay hidden.
- That child is being arrested.
- For What?
He Was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
He can bend earth?
Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
Leave him alone.
You're not taking him anywhere.
No one is taking anybody aWay!
She's a bender!
Katara!
Move.
You, too.
Dad!
- This is my father.
- Hello.
That's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
HoW did this happen to your village?
Fire Nation sent soldiers.
We fought them and defeated them.
Then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal.
There Was nothing We could do.
Those Who could not bend Were alloWed to live in peace, if We Were imprisoned.
Earthbenders!
Why are you acting this Way?
You are poWerful and amazing people!
You don't need to live like this!
There is earth right beneath your feet.
The ground is an extension of Who you are!
If the Avatar had returned...
...Would that mean anything to you?
The Avatar is dead.
If he Was here, he Would protect us.
My name is Aang...
...and I am the Avatar.
I ran aWay, but I'm back noW.
It's time for you to stop doing this!
The Avatar Would have to be an
Airbender. Are you an Airbender, boy?
Leave him alone!
HoW is he doing that?
I don't Want to hurt anyone.
All Airbenders should be dead.
Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
OK! Everybody can help us noW!
Don't be afraid!
Just leave them!
Fall back!
Go! He's an Airbender!
They took aWay any tools related to bending.
The Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
A Waterbending scroll.
This is rare.
My mom told me about these.
This Was you When you Were born an Earthbender, tWo lifetimes ago.
You came to our village.
Avatar Kyoshi loved games.
I do, too.
I mean, I still do.
A lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village Was.
They prey on the Weakest toWns and villages.
We should go visit some of these toWns, Aang.
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it, Aang?
I ran aWay before they trained me to be the Avatar.
I don't knoW hoW to bend the other elements.
Why did you run aWay?
The day they told me I Was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family.
They said it cannot Work With the responsibilities of the Avatar.
- Why can't the Avatar have a family?
- I asked that!
They said that's the sacrifice the Avatar alWays has to make.
OK. So, What if We found you teachers.
Teachers to teach you bending?
Which element Would you have to learn first?
Water. Water comes after Air in the cycle.
Air, Water, Earth, Fire.
But there are really poWerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe.
My dad told me about it before he left.
It's led by a princess because her father died.
There are teachers there, but all the Way on the other side of the World.
- We can get there on Appa.
- That's What I Was thinking.
And maybe We can stop in the villages on the Way, start a change in The War in these small villages.
- Should We try it?
- Yes, We should.
The scroll we had was proving to be helpful.
Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with Waterbending.
We moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom.
We tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.
Sire, I have good neWs.
As you knoW, I conducted a raid on the Great Library,
- Which most said didn't exist.
- Get on With it.
I found scrolls in the library.
We are deciphering them.
But I believe they may contain information as to Where the Ocean and Moon
Spirits live in this World.
With this information,
We could bring doWn the Northern Water Tribe city,
We could shoW the World the true strength of fire.
I am pleased.
Well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
Our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar.
They describe him as just a boy.
We should set a trap for this person.
We have many Earth Kingdom people under our control.
I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
- And my son?
- He had his chance. He missed it.
Let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar.
He Would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
Well, I suppose it's a race, then.
We're close, Uncle.
They've been moving farther and farther north.
We're catching them.
There are a lot of pretty girls in this toWn, Zuko.
You could fall in love here.
We could settle doWn here, and you could have a blessed life.
We don't have to continue this, Zuko.
I'll shoW you Why We must, Uncle.
Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
You look like a very smart boy.
Tell me What you knoW about the
Prince, the Fire Lord's son.
- He did something Wrong.
- He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends
Who Were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
Then Prince Zuko
Was sentenced to an Agni Kai duel, but When he shoWed up,
- it was his father he was to fight.
- That's right.
He would not fight his father.
Then his father mocked him and said,
"I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
Then the father burnt his son...
...to teach him a lesson.
We'll catch him soon, Uncle.
Then We can think about the pretty girls.
Aang...
Try to keep your Wrist bent, like it's shoWing.
What's Wrong?
You've really been distracted today.
I saW Sokka's maps.
We're near the Northern Air Temple.
Do you think it Would be OK if I just visited there and came back?
- I'd be back in less than a day.
- Why?
He had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field.
He talked to a Dragon Spirit
Who he thinks can help us.
He thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
I don't think that's a good idea.
We started a rebellion.
Try to talk him out of it.
I can't do this.
I need help.
- I guess your talk didn't Work.
- He'll be back in a day.
The Fire Nation is folloWing us. If We make a Wrong move, they'll catch him.
Who are you?
Why, it cannot be!
I've heard stories. Are you?
My name is Aang.
I cannot believe
I've lived to see your return.
I'm an Earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
The Fire Nation destroyed this temple.
They have ruined everything.
No, no, no, not everything.
You knoW, there's a hidden chamber of statues
I think you, of all people, should see.
These are all the Avatars.
These are the reincarnations of you over the years.
The Avatar Roku Was your last life.
NoW, hoW did the Airbenders knoW you Were the Avatar, little one?
They gave me a test.
They put 1,000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four.
They said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars.
That's When they told me
I could have no family.
Told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations.
There's a ceremony
When everyone boWs to me.
That's When I accept my role as the Avatar.
But When everyone boWed...
...I didn't boW back.
You seem like a nice young man.
You really do.
You Will forgive me, Won't you?
- For What?
- For luring you doWn here.
I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.
So you Will understand my actions today.
I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.
I have seen a vision of the moon turning red.
The Fire Nation has stolen knoWledge of us from the Great Library.
They are planning to misuse this knoWledge.
I Will stop them.
You must go to the Northern Water Tribe.
If they take that city, more Will suffer and die, as your Airbenders have.
You must go noW!
Will I stop them?
Wake up, young man!
My name is Commander Zhao.
I set this trap for you.
Don't Worry, I'm not gonna kill you.
Besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search Would continue.
So Where have you been all this time?
And hoW is it that you're still a boy?
I understand that When you freed that handful of toWns, you Were very impressive, but...
...you only used Airbending against my soldiers.
NoW, Why is that?
The Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the doWnfall of our enemies.
I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.
Who are you?
Wait! Don't!
Stop!
Fools.
Close the inner gates!
The Avatar has escaped!
Lock doWn the gate!
Lock doWn all the gates!
To the main post!
This Was their practice area.
Go again!
Do not kill the Avatar!
He Will just be reborn again!
Why are you doing this? Who are you?
Open the gates.
Let them out!
- Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
- Not at all.
Do it.
What is this?
And hoW did he escape?
I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor.
Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
You think...
...my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Yes.
Zhao's men Were searching the coast, looking for you.
They also searched the ship.
I told them you Went on vacation With a girl.
Where Were you the past four days?
NoWhere.
We have to keep moving.
The Avatar is traveling again.
Take rest first.
It looks like you
Went through a great deal.
When you Wake, We'll have tea together before We start the engines.
Do not harm my son.
Leave him to his isolation.
You have my word, sire.
I will not harm him.
Zuko!
And what of the Avatar?
We assume he has rejoined with his supporters.
It has been confirmed that he's traveling north.
It is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.
I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, Air.
I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water.
He's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice Waterbending.
We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe.
We presented ourselves to the royal court.
My brother and the princess became friends right away.
Aang showed them he was the last Airbender, and was accepted to train with the master.
The city knew our arrival would bring great danger.
And they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.
The city Was designed to Withstand any assault.
If We keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls,
Where We have the advantage,
We Will succeed.
If We let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us.
As many fires in this city should be put out as possible When the alarm sounds.
We Want to minimize their bender sources.
I must assign a guard to be With you at all times, Princess.
Your presence is our inspiration.
I'll do it. That's me.
I'll be her guard.
Nothing Will happen to her.
I had a feeling you might volunteer.
I've heard no word of my son for quite some time.
- Do you know where he is?
- I've not heard of anything, sire.
I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
The Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
They Will be difficult to defeat.
NoW, if for some reason the Spirits Were not involved, that Would be different.
What have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
We have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
It is our destiny to have found this information, Zhao.
Eliminate the Spirits, take the city and We Will have thWarted the Avatar in the process.
Water is What?
The floWing element.
The element of change.
To master Water, you must release your emotions,
Wherever they may lead you.
Water teaches us acceptance.
Let your emotions floW like Water.
Aang, Would you like to spar?
You haven't sparred in a feW days.
NoW, use offense, Aang!
General Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us
- on this historic event.
- Your invitation Was most gracious.
You are a gifted strategist.
No one can argue that.
Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se Won't be held against you.
Your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Again, I offer my condolences on your nepheW burning to death in that terrible accident.
Thank you.
I've loved spending these Weeks With you, Sokka.
Me, too.
Should We see What the ocean is doing today?
When there is some safety for all of us,
I Will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
That Would be great.
But I Warn you...
...my grandmother Will ask you a lot of questions.
What might she ask me?
She'll say, "Why is your hair White, young lady? You look very odd."
I Would say to your grandmother, my hair is White because When I Was born
I Was not aWake.
My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move.
So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred Waters.
My parents said that my hair turned
White then and life poured into me.
WoW.
You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask me.
Only your grandmother did.
I'm sure Zhao Was the one
Who ordered the attack on you.
Any problems?
We have arrived at the Northern
Water Tribe's stronghold.
They believe the boy is there.
Why do you seem upset, Uncle?
Zhao has no sacredness.
Are you sure you Want to be here?
I Will not be alloWed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father!
Is that not clear to you?
What is this?
Yue...
...the Fire Nation is here.
NoW be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck.
And remember, your Chi can Warm you.
I knoW, Uncle.
Be safe.
Aang needs to ask you something.
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.
He can help me defeat the Fire Nation.
Is there a spiritual place
Where I can meditate?
There is a very spiritual place.
The city Was built around this place.
But we must hurry.
Momo, be nice.
To get your Airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time Without losing focus.
Some of the great monks can meditate for four days.
- I have to get back.
- I'll take you.
I'll stay With him.
Aang?
Aang, can you hear me?
I kneW you Were real.
I alWays kneW you'd return.
Me, too.
The Fire Lord's son.
You took him from our village.
Who are you?
My name is Katara, and I'm the only Waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.
- Go for the children.
- Yes.
I'm not alloWed to go home Without him.
The Waterbenders get poWer from the moon.
They Will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
General Iroh,
I've been keeping a secret.
And What is that?
In my raid of the Great Library earlier this year,
I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
To meet a Spirit Would be a great honor.
Well, I hope I can give you that honor.
What happened?
What happened?
Prince Zuko's here in the city.
He took Aang again.
We'll just Wait till everyone's fighting everyone.
Then in the night, We'll slip out.
Aang, can you hear me?
I knew you were real.
I always knew you'd return.
Hello! Hello!
Please, tell me hoW to beat the Fire Nation!
You are not dealing
With the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths.
You are stopping yourself from grieving.
You are angry.
You must let this go.
As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others.
Use the ocean.
ShoW them the poWer of Water.
Go! Do this noW.
My sister Azula was always the special one.
She Was a Firebending prodigy.
My father loves her.
He can't even look at me sometimes.
He says I'm like my mother.
I advise that you pull back your men soon.
They Will be trapped in the city
When the moon's poWer comes out.
Do not Worry about the moon's poWer,
General Iroh.
Why should you not be Worried about the moon's poWer?
Because your brother,
Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
What?
Calm doWn. We'll find him.
Are you OK?
Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me.
I knoW What to do.
Aang, We have to go.
You Won't be killed by Waterbenders if you stay hidden here.
We could be friends, you knoW.
They're getting stronger.
This is a scroll from the Great Library.
This is our map.
Our World is going to change soon, gentlemen.
Right there and right there.
See Where they're going!
I'll go join the fight!
They are called many names:
Yin and Yang, push and pull.
May I introduce you to the mysterious
Ocean and Moon Spirits?
Why do Spirits take the form of such benign things?
It leaves them so vulnerable.
To teach man kindness and humility.
Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper With.
The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.
What are you doing here?
Stop, Zhao.
The World Will go out of balance.
Everyone Will be hurt.
The Fire Nation is too poWerful to Worry about children's superstitions,
General Iroh.
Commander Zhao, don't.
We are noW the gods!
No!
Man all battle stations!
You are too soft, General Iroh.
He's making fire out of nothing!
They're breaching the Wall!
To the front!
As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others.
You must show them the power of Water.
All is lost.
You have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
- He gave me life When I Was a child.
- Then there is still a chance.
You can give your life back for the Spirit's.
- Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
- Nothing is ever truly lost.
- Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
- There are reasons each of us are born.
We have to find those reasons.
- This Was the reason I Was born.
- Yue, please.
There is no love Without sacrifice.
Yue, What are you doing?
You don't knoW What Will happen.
I believe my life force Will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
And then What?
My soul Will no longer exist in this form.
Please don't do this.
There must be another Way.
I can't let you do this.
I'm supposed to protect you.
My people are dying, Sokka.
Those Who are in charge of others have a responsibility.
It is time We shoW the Fire Nation
We believe in our beliefs
- as much as they believe in theirs.
- But Yue...
I'm scared.
Don't make me any more scared.
I Will miss you more than you knoW.
I killed you.
Come aWay from him, nepheW.
There are too many soldiers noW.
They Will never let you take the Avatar.
We must leave immediately.
He Wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko.
Walk aWay!
Come!
You stand alone.
And that has alWays been your great mistake.
Water teaches us acceptance.
Let your emotions flow like water.
Aang?
They Want you to be their Avatar, Aang.
We all do.
Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city.
General Zhao Was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor.
My son's proven himself a failure.
NoW, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years.
It Will give all Firebenders the ability of the highest Firebenders, the ability to use their oWn Chi to create Fire.
That is the day We Will Win this War and prove the Fire Nation's dominance.
NoW you must stop the Avatar from mastering Earth and Fire.
You must give us the time to get to that day.
Do you accept this unspeakably important task
I'm putting in your hands?
I do, Father.

- GIRL: OK, enough tuning already.

The bus will be here in five minutes.
Uh-huh! I'm totally (QUIETLY) almost

WOMAN: Good. You don't want to be late for the last day of school.
Let me see.
Shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes.
- Help me, Mouse! Where are my? Ah!
- (MEOWS)
Hairbrush, hairbrush, hairbrush.
Oh, hairbrush!
See, here's the thing, Mouse.
You know how every summer is "S" for Snoresville because all I ever do is visit Grandma Lou and get a sunburn and pick my scabs and watch TV.
And it's not even cable.
But this summer is going to be different because I have a plan.
A P-L-A-N for the most super duper, double-rare, not bummer summer ev...
- WOMAN: Judy?
- Coming!
- (MEOWS)
- Mouse. (SMACKS LIPS)
- Look, Mom!
- Hey.
- BOY: Look, Dad.
- Nice.
Hi!
Beat you to the bus, Stink. Bye!
Is that a new trend?
Wearing pajamas to school?
Let's just be happy she remembered her shoes.
Rocky!
Judy!
Last day! No more homework, no more tests.
No more fink-face Finch, the pest!
Yeah!
What's with the Mr. Potato Head hair?
I wouldn't talk,
Mr. "Frank Eats Paste" Pearl.
- For me?
- FYEO. "For Your Eyes Only."
And Amy and Rocky.
"TP Meeting...
Shhh!
Shhh.
(WHISPERING)... after school for way important summer plan."
What's going on?
Is it the last day of school or something?
ALL: Yay!
Frank.
Don't get too excited. There's still...
...three hours and 27 minutes until summer officially begins.
In fact, guess what I have here?
Hot off the press.
A pop quiz.
What? No way!
JUDY: On the last day of school?!
Just a few questions to make sure that you were paying attention.
All right.
Question number one.
How many times did I wear a purple tie to school?
- Twenty-seven! Twenty-seven!
- A hundred! A hundred!
- Never.
- (BELL DINGS)
"Never" is correct.
Excellent, Jessica.
- Ha-ha.
- Fink-face Finch strikes again.
- MR. TODD: Question number two.
- Aww.
- How long did it take our class
- For me?
- To go around the world?
- ALL: Eight and a half days!
- (BELL DINGS)
- You guys are breezing through these.
These are too easy for you.
I gotta go deeper.
Let's see, let's see, let's see here.
Ooh, oh, this is a good one.
This is a big one.
Mucho grande.
- Come on! Tell us!
- OK, OK, OK.
Can anyone guess, and this means you, class 3T, what I, Mr. Todd, will be doing this summer?
We need a clue!
Give us a clue!
ALL: Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue!
Clue! Clue! Clue!
Clue! Clue! Clue!
- OK, OK. Hold it to a dull roar, dull roar.
- (SHOUTING STOPS)
- Let's see.
- (BELL DINGS)
Ooh! I have the perfect clue.
The clue is...
- (WIND HOWLING)
- Brrr!
...cold.
- Oh, refrigerator salesman!
- That's not bad.
- Snow remover guy.
- That's clever.
- Polar bear trainer!
- That's dangerous.
ROCKY: Snowball fight. Snowball fighter.
Antarctica is cold.
- JUDY: Mr. Todd?
- Judy!
Ooh! I know! You're going to Antarctica!
The real one!
That's a great guess, but sadly, no.
- (BUZZER RINGS)
- Any other guesses?
All right.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.
# Well, I come
from the teachers' break room
# With a banjo on my knee
# Now listen up, dear students
It's so elementary
# World-class 3T
You'll wanna look for me
# 'Cause if somehow you find me
# There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee!
# You'll see me at the mall,
the pool, the park and by the sea
# And sometimes you'll find me
at the public library
# Oh, class 3T
You'll wanna look for me

All right, kids, let's go!
Let's go! Have a great summer!
- Bye, Mr. Todd! Stay warm!
- I will.
Stay Judy!
- Whoa!
- Ooh!
Last one in is a... Whoa!
Hey, no fair!
OK, TPers, are you ready for the most way rare, double-cool summer plan ever?
Time out. What's a TPer?
Oh, we forgot.
Amy's not a member.
- A member of what?
- Of our club.
- Quick, Frank, go find a toad.
- Me? You find a toad.
JUDY: Frank.
Do you see anything?
Rock. Rock.
(CHUCKLING) Not a rock.
- Why am I doing this again?
- (KIDS GIGGLING)
Shh. You'll see.
If he jumps on my face, you are so dead.
- Do you feel anything?
- AMY: Yeah.
A toad. A fat, slimy...
Ew! Something just got wet!
- ALL: Toad pee!
- (LAUGHING)
- (AMY SCREAMS)
- (CROAKING)
- Gross!
- Don't wipe it on her!
- You are sick!
- Sick awesome!
And now you're a member of our club, the Toad Pee Club.
Which means you're toad-ally cool.
So...
...are you ready for my plan?
Introducing the one and only
Judy Moody Mega-Rare
Not Bummer Summer Dare!
I don't get it.
OK, you know how we always hate summer because it's boring with a capital "B"?
I don't hate summer.
I love summer.
Anyway, this'll solve all our problems.
I spent two days and 16 erasers figuring it out.
"Ride Scream Monster, surf a wave."
- Are these the dares?
- JUDY: Yup.
So we do these dares, and for each one, we get ten Thrill Points.
Plus Bonus Points if we do something crazy like, ride the Scream Monster with no hands.
Or Loser Points if we chicken out.
At the end of summer, we add it all up, and if we reach 100, then presto, whammo, we just had the best summer ever!
Is that thrilladelic or what?
Um, it's thrilladelic, only...
...I kind of forgot to tell you something.
Um... He forgot to tell you that...
...he's going away for the summer.
What?
Yeah. To circus camp.
I'm gonna learn how to walk on a tightrope, and do magic tricks and stuff.
And I won't be here, either.
I'm going to Borneo.
You guys!
I thought you were serious.
Borneo?
What even is Borneo?
It's an island in Indonesia.
And I am going with my mom.
- We leave in a week.
- Me too.
On Friday.
That is so not fair!
How am I supposed to have the best summer ever, if you're not even here?
I'm not going anywhere.
You can have fun with me.
Great.
Just great.
DAD: It looks like somebody's in a bad mood.
Really? Who?
She's mad because Rocky and Amy are going away for the summer.
Could you please not talk with ABC peas in your mouth?
DAD: ABC what? What?
MOM: Already Been Chewed.
- DAD: Oh.
- (MOM GROANS)
MOM: Guys.
Oh... OK, guys.
Mind your manners, please.
Anyway, I could care less about Rocky and Amy.
I mean, going to circus camp, that's lame.
Rocky's going to circus camp?
You know, that's a great idea.
You know, I think his grandparents used to run that, the famous Circus
- Zangzini. Right.
- Zangzini.
# A- B-C-D-E-F-G #
Can we please not talk about Rocky?
Hey, wanna know what
I'm doing this summer?
- I'm gonna catch Bigfoot.
- Bigfoot?
Where did you even hear about Bigfoot?
Hello! He's all over the news.
- Oh.
- DAD: In the newspapers, too.
Yeah, there have been Bigfoot sightings everywhere.
Sally Rottenberger saw him in the mall.
DAD: At the mall?
I thought Bigfoot lived in the woods.
But sometimes he has to buy stuff.
There's no such thing.
Is too. Wanna help me catch him?
I'd rather catch poison ivy.
- Oh, thank you.
- Mom?
Mm-hmm?
Can I please, with ice cream and sprinkles on top, go to circus camp? Please?
Honey, I'm sorry. It's just too expensive, you know? We can't afford it.
But if I learn how to do circus stuff,
I can quit school and you can loan me out to a circus
- and I'll make gobs of money. Please.
- OK, well...
You're not quitting school and we're certainly not loaning you out to a circus.
No one in this family has any imagination!
And Rocky is a circus-freak, leave-me-behind un-friend!
I am never, not ever speaking to him again!
But what if you hate circus camp?
Are you nuts?
Why would I hate circus camp?
Because it won't all be tons of fun.
I bet they make you shovel elephant poop.
Ha-ha. Good one.
Yeah, and did you know it weighs like 200 tons?
Plus, it smells worse than a corpse flower.
- (HORN HONKS)
- Are you ready for your send-off, Rock?
# For
# He's a jolly good fellow
# He looks like a bowl of Jell-O
# And all his teeth are yellow
# Which nobody can deny
# And now we're saying goodbye
# And now we're saying goodbye
# For he's a jolly good fellow
# But now we're saying goodbye #
Bye, guys! Miss you!
See you in a while!
Bye!
Think of me when you're on elephant poop duty.
I will. And also when I'm taming lions and juggling swords.
- You ready, kiddo?
- Yeah.
Bye.
ROCKY: Bye, guys!
Don't have too much fun while I'm gone!
Remember, if camp is super boring, you can always come home!
And don't say I didn't warn you about the poop!
ROCKY: Oh, I forgot! I...
I can't hear you!
So why are you going to Bored-eo?
Because of this lost tribe called the Penan.
They've lived in the rainforest since forever, but all their land is being destroyed because of logging.
So anyways, my mom's going there so she can write an article on them and hopefully we can save them.
You're so lucky.
I never get to save a lost tribe.
I wish you could come.
It's not that far away, you know.
It's only like 9,000 miles.
Lots of people go to Borneo for a vacation.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Does it cost like a zillion dollars?
I don't think so.
Then maybe we could go.
There's no reason we have to spend every summer at Grandma Lou's, right?
WOMAN: Amy? Are you packed?
We leave in an hour.
I'm ready!
Go ask your mom!
I will! See ya!
In case she says no, here's something to remember me by.
Sweet.
Oh, Borneo,
I long-e-o to visit you-e-o!
Mom! Mom!
- Oh, Mom! Guess what!
- Yeah?
I figured out how to save summer!
Save summer?
I didn't know it was in trouble.
Listen to this. Instead of going to Grandma Lou's, boring, let's go to un-boring Borneo!
Borneo? OK, you know that's like halfway around the world, right?
So? It's got a rainforest.
And lost tribes that need to get found.
OK, but do you have any idea how expensive it would be...
Oh, Stink!
We're going to Borneo!
But we need money-o, so let's have a yard sale!
I'll sell my pizza table collection.
MAN: That's right, five pizza tables,
only $9.99! Call now!
Ooh! You can sell your
World's Biggest Jawbreaker.
MAN: World's Biggest Jawbreaker, now
only...
No can do. Can't. I'm busy.
- Are these cranberries?
- Uh, yes.
OK. Bye.
What? Bye.
OK, sweetie, can you just, um...
You know what, sit down for a second.
I just wanna talk to you about something.
Um, so I was just on the phone with your other grandma, you know, my mom.
And you know how she and Gramps are moving to that retirement community?
Well, I'm afraid Gramps hurt his back, so he's gonna need a little help, so...
You mean we're flying to California to visit them?
- (GASPING)
- Now...
That's almost as good as Borneo!
- Yes! Yes!
- Hang tight for one second.
Um, let me get a little more specific.
- Thank you! Thank you!
- If I could just...
- Did you tell her?
- Uh, not, not quite.
- Honey.
- Listen, jelly bean.
Something's come up.
Your mom and I have to fly to California in a few days...
Yeah.
...and you and Stink...
...are staying here.
What?
You're going to leave me here?
To die of starvation and boredom and Stink-dom?
OK, kiddo, it is not gonna be that bad.
Your Aunt Opal's coming.
- Aunt who?
- My sister.
Judy, you've heard me mention her a million times.
- So? I never actually met her.
- You did when you were little.
She could be totally evil.
She could be a zombie for all I know.
- Oh.
- STINK: Do I look like a berry bush?
- DAD: Uh...
- I'm trying to fake out Bigfoot.
Well, in that case, absolutely.
- Oh, yes. 100 percent.
- Definitely.
Yes! Great! Bye!
So let me get this straight.
I'm not going to California.
I'm not going to Borneo.
I'm not going to circus camp. And now
I'm not even going to Grandma Lou's?
Then this is the way worst, double-drat, bummer summer ever!
This is supposed to be the summer of a hundred thrills.
- But instead...
- (HORN HONKING)
STINK: Judy, it's the ice cream truck!
I am so not in the mood!
Ow.
Dear Magic 8 Ball, could this summer get any worse?
"Without a doubt"?
- (GROANING)
- (GROWLING)
MOM: Stink! Judy!
Aunt Opal's here!
DAD: Opal, you're here!
- MOM: Opal! There she is!
- DAD: Wow, it's been forever!
MOM: Group hug!
JUD Y: "Dear Amy,
summerjust got way worse.
Aunt Awful has landed!
Can't you please come home?
Or else send me a ticket to Borneo?"
DAD: Judy? Come down and say hi to your aunt!
I can't! Not until September!
I bet she has warts, Mouse.
And evil, oogley boogley eyes.
- And makes us eat fish guts for breakfast.
- (MEOWS)
Dad says come now or you're in big trouble.
Can't you read the sign?
Where it says I'm spending the summer in my room?
Really? What about food?
I have a basket.
You can put food inside and I'll lift it up.
What about TV?
Check it out.
It's gonna be a periscope.
- I'll be able to see the whole living room.
- Cool.
What about going to the bathroom?
Stink, I'm a...
- (ALARM BEEPING)
- (MOM SCREAMING)
- JUDY: What's that?
- MOM: Dinner's on fire!
Don't worry!
I can put it out! Lobster!
I can save us!
I'll get water!
OK, hurry, hurry, hurry!
- (ALARM BEEPING)
- I have water! I have water!
I can put it out! Don't worry!
- DAD: Careful! Hot! Hot! Hot!
- MOM: Take it to the sink!
DAD: OK, watch it! Sink!
- Judy, you don't need to do that anymore!
- Hey!
JUDY: Don't worry, I can put it out!
MOM: It's OK, Judy.
Bull's-eye!
Wow, it's the famous Judy Moody!
You are so cute!
Opal, you've only been here five minutes, and already the house is on fire.
DAD: Unbelievable.
OPAL: Wow, you got so much bigger.
Do you remember this?
Kinda.
Wow. You've got more bracelets than my math tutor, and she's in college.
Here, you wanna have this one?
- It's made out of yak hair.
- Really?
I got it off a monkey for 500 rupees.
Wow. Cool!
Wow, thanks! Rare!
OK, but here's your real presents.
Stinker?
Awesome!
"So You Want to Catch Bigfoot?"
Look, look, look, look! Awesome!
Thank you, Aunt Opal!
Thank you! Thank you!
Yeah! Man, oh, man, oh, man!
Ye-ye-yeah!
I got a Bigfoot!
Yeah! Book.
Nice dance. OK.
And this is your present.
(GASPS) A mood ring?
How did you know?
I think you're a big hit, Ope.
- You like it?
- I love it!
- Thank you!
- MOM: (CLEARS THROAT) Guys,
I'm so sorry to interrupt, but what do you wanna do about dinner?
JUDY AND STINK: Pizza!
A large Hawaiian Surprise and a pepperoni with tuna fish.
Wanna go to Fur and Fangs while we wait?
Sure.
Yay, 'cause I wanna show Zeke my book and prove to you that Bigfoot exists.
Right.
- (HISSING)
- (ANIMAL SOUNDS)
- PARROT: Thank you.
- (DOOR OPENS)
Hey, Zeke! Check this out!
Hey, little dude.
Whoa.
Sweet.
- It's a first edition.
- (GASPS)
ZEKE: Who's the girl?
Are you a Bigfooter?
That's my sister Judy, who doesn't believe in Bigfoot.
Seriously?
Mega-total super seriously.
Uh-oh.
Show her, Zeke.
Show her the proof.
Do you think she can handle...
...the cave?
The what?
Bigfoot lives.
Bigfoot lives.
- (THUD)
- Ow!
(LOUD CLICK AND ELECTRICAL
WHIRRING)
MAN: Welcome to the headquarters
of the Bigfoot Believers Association.
Wow.
- You finished it! It's great.
- Thanks.
What is this, a clubhouse for bats?
Observe.
ZEKE: Yeti from the Himalayas.
Sasquatch...
- Sasquatch!
- ... man-beast of the great Northwest.
Momo along the mighty Mississippi.
In the outback of Australia, he's Bunyip.
Call him what you will,
one fact is clear:
(ECHOING) Bigfoot lives.
Is this cool or what?
In 1978, Appleston Morris
captured definitive proof
that the subgenus Gigantopithecus
thrives in the modern era.
ZEKE: That's his face.
Check that out.
Bigfoot, no longerjust for scientists.
MAN: This is why they call it the Bigfoot.
You see what I'm saying?
This is like size 44 for a man.
Now see it?
And I got that photograph right there.
Right there?
Y'all see it right there?
We've been meeting here for a year, ever since this guy up north spotted
Bigfoot, and caught it on camera.
Since then, we've been tracking down
Bigfoot's every move.
He is definitely headed our way.
And now for the proof.
- I keep it in cold storage.
- (WIND HOWLING)
Cold storage?
Hey, do you know a Mr. Todd?
Nope. Never heard of him.
And now, prepare to have your mind blown.
A rare certified photo of Bigfoot.
- Look, but don't touch.
- JUDY: Seriously?
- That's a guy in a sweater.
- STINK: You're nuts.
- That is Bigfoot!
- Agreed.
If you need more proof, come to one of our meetings.
Tuesdays at six.
Can't. I'm busy on Tuesdays.
From now until always.
Come on, Stink.
It's pizza time.
(SIGHING) She'll be back.
She'll be back.
MOM: Well, I didn't know what the backyard was missing until I saw it.
- DAD: It's Morocco in Virginia.
- She really doesn't travel light.
- Mm-mm. Right.
- But she travels with lights.
OPAL: I hope you guys saved room for my dessert!
MOM: Oh, wow.
Redecorated the patio and dessert.
Opal, you spoil us!
Hey, Stink.
Oh, honey, don't read at the table.
It's rude.
I know, but look at this.
Page 87. Bigfoot's bed.
See, he stomps down on all the grass.
Tah-dah! Tangerine fondue!
- Do you remember this?
- Uh-huh. You know...
(CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY) Yeah.
We're gonna...
We're gonna finish packing, so...
- Yeah.
- But thank you.
Enjoy, though, guys.
Hot dogs for dessert?
Yeah. I used to make this for your dad when we were kids.
Are those Froot Loops?
OPAL: Yeah. Dig in! Mmm.
- That doesn't count.
- But it's so oogley boogley!
This is nothing. When I was in Bali,
I ate grilled cockroaches.
Ooh. Gross.
I'll tell you what. If you take a bite, you can be in my club, the I Ate Something Gross Club.
JUDY: A club? Rare!
Just one bite and we're in?
- Yeah.
- Pass the hot dogs!
OK, one, two, three.
- Mmmm.
- Mmmm.
- OPAL: What do you think?
- This is good!
Needs more Froot Loops.
Triple high five, you guys.
- Club members! United!
- All right!
OPAL: So after the Peace Corps,
I trekked across the Sahara, and then I went to the Kunstschule in Berlin and I did all this really cool underground art stuff.
And then I moved to Bali, which is so beautiful and I lived there until about a month ago.
Mega-cool.
Is that where belly dancing's from?
It's Bali, not belly, silly.
It's an island.
That tickles!
So do you have any fun summer plans
I should know about?
Well, I was gonna have the best summer ever, but my friends ruined it.
(GROANS) I hate when that happens.
Seriously. We were gonna do all these dares and get Thrill Points.
But they left, so no dares.
I love dares.
When I was in Kenya, somebody once dared me to ride in an ostrich race.
My ostrich won, but I fell off at the starting line.
You know what, Aunt Opal?
You just gave me an idea.
I mean, what if we still did the dare chart but made it a race?
Me, Rocky, Amy and Frank?
We could each do our own dares and keep track of our points!
First one to get to a hundred wins!
- (SNORES LOUDLY)
- Whoa!
(GROANS) Aunt Opal!
- (CLICK)
- Whoa! Oh!
Oh, no.
- What is going on?
- Shh! You'll wake Opal!
She slept through that?
Weird.
I know, right?
Hey, did you know that Bigfoot's only scared of two...
Enough already with the Bigfeet!
You don't wanna hear?
Guinea pigs and...
JUD Y: "Dear Amy and Rocky,
uber-rare idea.
Let's do a dare race,
starting right now.
First one to get to a hundred points wins!
What do ya say?"
MAN: And the winner is Judy Moody!
It's from Rocky!
ROCKY:
A dare race? I am in.
Check out
what I did today!
That's ten Thrill Points
for sure, don't you think?
Just you wait, Rocky Zang.
Just you wait.
- STINK: Bye.
- DAD: I'm gonna miss you, buddy.
MOM: I'm sorry to go.
I love you.
JUDY: Can you bring us back some California bubble gum?
Ah, better yet, how about I chew some and I'll stick it on the wall in your honor.
- STINK: Can we have candy for breakfast?
- DAD: No. No.
- JUDY: Have fun in California!
- DAD: Listen.
- MOM: No for breakfast.
- STINK: Can I not take a shower?
DAD: Yes, you have to take a shower. I love you, buddy.
JUDY: Bye! Bye!
OK, synchronize watches.
As of 2:12pm,
Tuesday, July 7th, the thrill race is on!
So what's the first dare?
Scream Monster?
Nope.
This.
We're gonna dress in leotards?
No. Don't you see?
He's walking on a rope.
A tightrope?
Above the ground?
Death-defying.
Oh, yeah.
Where do we get a tightrope?
Perfecto!
What do you think you're doing?
I'm building a trap for Bigfoot.
I'm gonna lure him here with peanut butter.
He loves peanut butter.
That's on page 52.
And then boom!
A net will fall out of this tree and land on his head!
Not out of this tree.
It's mine. I called it.
- You can't call a tree.
- Really? Watch me.
- Mine.
- Mine.
- Mine.
- Mine!
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- Mine! Mine!
- FRANK: Guys, stop it!
- (SHOUTING CONTINUES)
FRANK: Let go! Let go!
Ice cream!
I scream! You scream!
We all scream for Old King Kold's ice cream!
- Yay! It's mine! It's mine!
- (ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC PLAYS)
Frank?
Where are you going?
To go get ice cream.
But now's our chance, before Stink gets back!
Come on!
What's more important?
Thrill Points or ice cream?
OK, all right.
- Thank you.
- Certainly.
JUD Y: And now, the high-flying,
death-defying Judy-a-rini
will cross...
... um...
... Niagara Falls!
One slip and she'll fall to her doom!
Rocky's only crossed a dinky grass field, but Judy is crossing the crashing cataracts of Niagara!
- Whoa!
- (AUDIENCE GASPING)
- My goodness!
- JUDY: Don't worry!
The great Judy-a-rini will not fall!
Whoa! Whoa!
Get off, Frank!
One at a time!
Hurry up then!
I wanna go get ice cream!
Ten Thrill Points.
Ten Thrill Points.
- Ten Thrill Points...
- (INSECT BUZZING)
Mosquitoes!
Incoming! Whoa!
Stop wobbling me!
I can't help it!
There's a mosquito on my...
Ha-ha, you missed it.
I got fuzzy navel.
Hey, Judy, ready for the Scream Monster?
Hey, Judy!
What's all this pink stuff?
My prom dress. I have to take it to the cleaners.
So first we go on the Tilt-a-Whirl.
After we get ice cream.
Right. And sno-cones.
And corndogs.
And gobs of gum.
Rare! We'll be ready for the Scream Monster, for sure.
- BOTH: Stop!
- (TIRES SCREECH)
FRANK: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
# You'll see me
at the mall #
BO TH: # The pool,
the park and by the sea ##
Mr. Todd!
FRANK: Mr. Todd?
I was sure he'd be in there.
Don't worry. We'll find him.
We have all summer.
- Yeah.
- Scream Monster!
Supercalifragilistic- expithrilladelic!
Geez, Louise!
How many Thrill Points is that?
Ten. Plus Bonus Points for no hands.
No food on the ride, kid.
What? I'm not throwing all this out!
MAN: Then step outta line.
Frank! We've been waiting in line forever!
Surrender the sno-cone!
But it's so good.
Seriously! We gotta start earning some Thrill Points because so far we have zero.
You guys coming or going here?
OK.
JUDY: Frank?
Frank!
- This is it!
- Thrill Points, here we come!
Hands up!
Every second counts!
I'm... not so sure about this.
What's wrong?
Don't you dare!
MAN: We now send you
out to Tammy
with this special
Bigfoot report. Tammy?
TAMMY: With one sighting
at the pier,
one at Colonial College
one on Main Street,
and one at Frog Lake,
that makes
five local sightings.
Five!
With me here
is Herb Birnbaum,
and he claims that Bigfoot
was in his yard.
Herb?
Herb, show us
what you've got.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- HERB: You see that?
He ripped the lid
right off that can
and went straight
for the peanut butter!
TAMMY: But couldn't
that be a raccoon?
Well, yeah,
but it could also be Bigfoot!
- But it could also be Bigfoot!
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
Rose Birnbaum, Herb's wife.
This is Tammy,
reporting live from...
Whoa.
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
Seriously.
Don't ask.
I told you not to ask!
I'm not asking.
I'm telling you.
- Telling me what?
- You got a postcard from Rocky.
Really? Can you read it?
Sure.
"Dear Judy, how are you?
I am fine."
Can you read it like a normal person?
You don't want me to sound like Rocky?
- Just read it, OK?
- OK.
"Dear Judy, how are you?
I am fine.
- Guess what?
- ROCKY'S VOICE: Guess what?
BOTH: I just learned how to saw someone in half!"
- No fair! I want to do that!
- (BUBBLING)
ROCKY: We even get to be
in a real circus.
BOTH: "You have to come, OK?
August 4th."
ROCKY: Just so you know,
I'm up to 37 Thrill Points!
(ECHOING)
How many do you have?
MAN: Please welcome
Rocky the Magnificent, who is merely the assistant to Judy,
- the Even More Magnificent!
- (CROWD CHEERING)
And now...
...let's watch the master
- (BOINGING)
...at work.
I warned you not to throw up on me.
Can you put me back together later?
I think so.
- What did you say?
- I said, I think so.
You think so what?
Nothing! Never mind!
Hey, you wanna go to my Bigfoot meeting?
It starts in 15 minutes.
Stink, I told you a bazillion trillion times,
Bigfoot is for bozos!
OK. Just don't be asking for my autograph when I catch him and get all famous.
Hmm. Let's see.
Ten points for riding the Scream Monster.
Minus five for blue throw-up, and five for prom dress equals...
You're right, Mouse.
A big fat donut.
Holy macaroni!
Whoa!
What's all that?
Hey. OK, I can't tell if this should be a hat, or a wheel, or...
...a shield.
Um...
I think it's the lid to the garbage can.
Yeah, I know, but what is it really?
Wow.
What is all this, anyway?
It's my traveling art studio.
Wow.
Cool.
You really are an artist.
Yeah.
I'm a guerrilla artist.
Gorilla?
As in monkey?
No, as in under the radar.
A guerrilla artist makes art out of everything, and puts it everywhere.
Why?
'Cause it's fun.
And it's daring.
(GASPS) I have an idea.
Ta-da!
Wow, I love it!
I told you it was a hat.
That looks great!
Look, we're beautifying the world with our amazing art!
- Great!
- Now all we have to do is sneak over to the library late at night and put our hats on the lions.
(GASPING) Rare!
That's ten Thrill Points for sure!
Guess what!
Zeke gave me homework.
He said to look for
Bigfoot scat!
JUD Y:
Scat: Noun.
Scientific term
for animal droppings,
also known as poop,
dung or doodoo.
But that's not
its only meaning.
(SNICKERING) Are you sure he wasn't telling you to scat?
Scat: Verb.
Slang term meaning to exit,
scram or go away.
Gotcha, Stink.
- (GROANING) Judy. Ice cream!
- (HORN BLARES)
- (EXCLAIMING)
- (ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC)
Wait! Help! Stop!
Hey, my hand is stuck!
My hand is glued to the table!
- (GASPING)
- Yeah, help!
- OK, I'll be right back.
- Stinker!
Buy me an ice cream!
Please?
I'm coming to save you.
This won't take long.
I hope.
OPAL: OK, this spatula is our last hope.
- Want some?
- An ABS?
Already Been Slobbered?
No, thanks.
It's gonna be OK.
OK, more leverage.
Hang in there.
More pressure.
Almost!
Almost...
- Almost...
- (POPPING)
(GIGGLING) Free! Free!
Free at last!
In only an hour and 17 minutes and 45 seconds.
(SIGHING) This was the worst day of my life.
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything you want.
Anything to make it up to you.
- Anything?
- Mm-hm.
Well, tomorrow night, there's a Cemetery Creep 'n Crawl.
Can we go?
I don't know.
Is it worth
Thrill Points?
Yes.
Then totally. Absolutely.
Yes, yes, yes!
Where should I put the scat in, Opal?
Fridge or freezer?
Whatever.
It's your animal poop.
OK. I think freezer.
Hey, Judy, we're gonna leave at seven, and then we're gonna eat our picnic at the cemetery.
- What do you think?
- Yeah!
Extra points for eating with skeletons!
And I need 'em, 'cause Amy just swam with sharks!
Lemme see, lemme see!
Whoa.
Wow, swimming with a shark.
That's cool.
You're gonna lose this race so bad.
Hey, look, your ring is green!
Green with envy!
Green like pond scum!
Green like boogers!
Stink, you're an intergalactic booger.
Hey, where are you going?
To the cemetery.
We're walking, right?
It's miles from here.
We have to take Humphrey.
Who's Humphrey?
That's what our dad calls our car.
No way! You know, your dad had a bike named Humphrey when we were kids.
Let's take bikes!
Not allowed after dark.
Oh.
(HISSING) Bummer.
Let's do this!
Oh!
OK.
Steering wheel, gas, brakes.
Ignition.
Frog.
You know how to drive, right?
- (ENGINE STARTING)
- Of course.
I drove across the Horn of Africa.
(BOTH YELLING) Watch out!
That was ten years ago.
I'm sorry.
R is for reverse.
Got it now.
- Whoa!
- You call that driving?
No worries.
It'll come back to me.
Is there a map or something?
'Cause I have no idea where I'm going.
Got one.
- GIRL: Ha-ha!
- (TOOTING HORN)
JUDY: Jessica Finch?
Can you get a ticket for driving too slow?
All right, backseat driver.
- (TIRES SCREECHING)
- (BOTH SCREAMING)
Watch out!
You're gonna hit the...
...bouncy castle!
Holy... crap!
You said crap!
Crap is a swear!
Crap is not a swear.
Yes!
- (PANTING)
- Sorry, little man!
And we are out of gas.
And way super lost.
Are we still in Virginia?
Of course we are.
Look, it's Larkspur Pier.
It's Virginia's number one tourist attraction.
Whoa.
JUDY: Looks more like Virginia's number one ghost town.
Can we eat? I'm starving.
Isn't it cool, Judy?
Wow, we're in the Un Zone!
How cool is that?
The Un Zone. Get it?
- It's cool.
- That's so funny.
Look, I have baloney for you.
And turkey for Stink.
Yummy, yummy.
Delicious sandwich.
- Ooh, I brought ketchup.
- Oh, yes.
I remembered the ketchup for you.
This smells funny.
Almost like...
Oh, look, a seagull.
I like seagulls.
- Bon appétit!
- Bon what?
- Oogley boogley!
- Ooh, what is that?
It's scat! Doodoo!
Dung! Poop!
- Disgusting!
- Gross, gross!
- Crap!
- That too.
Eww.
JUDY: "Dear Rocky,
Have you ever been on a poop picnic?
- I have and it stinks on ice!
- (CHATTERING)
Hardee-har-har!"
Be quiet, you guys!
I can't hear myself write!
Sorry!
So, the right is the gas, the left is the brake.
- Mmm.
- OK?
- OK. Vroom!
- (TIRES SCREECHING)
Not that fast!
Gentle, gentle.
- (LAUGHTER)
- (CRASHING NOISES)
"So what else stinks about this summer?"
Let's see.
JUD Y: "'Surf a wave' sounds thrilladelic."
Great! Good job.
"Just never try it with
Mr. Sponge Frank Squarebottom. "
- All right, Judy, ready?
- Ready!
- Frank, you ready?
- Ready, Frank?
- Look out for the wave!
- (FRANK GURGLING)
- Come back, Frank!
- No!
Come back!
JUD Y: "And remember
Mr. Todd's challenge?
Find him and get a prize?
I got a prize, all right. "
BOTH: Mr. Todd!
"The cuckoo-head prize.
And Amy can't stop sending
mega-thrill pics from Borneo.
If you ever go to ride
an elephant, Rocky,
be careful. "
"Ride an elephant, today only."
OPAL: Sorry.
"With my luck, you end up
giving the elephant a ride.
So Mr. Todd is supposed to be
somewhere cold, right?"
Mr. Todd?
"Well, he isn't working
in the bakery freezer,
that's for sure.
And he wasn't at the mall,
the pool, the park,
or by the sea.
Mr. Todd is nowhere.
You and Amy aren't even here
and you'll probably
find him before me.
I'm so desperado
for Thrill Points,
Aunt Opal tried to help me
put hats on the lions at the library,
but we missed the bus.
At the worst possible time.
- (LAUGHING)
- And all we got were Un-Points.
Aunt Opal says,
"When all else fails, dance."
So I tried to make that
into a Thrill Point game.
I love dancing, so that'd
be easy peasy, right?
- (NEEDLE SCRATCH, MUSIC STOPS)
- Wrong."
STINK: You lose Thrill Points.
- (NEEDLE SCRATCH, MUSIC STOPS)
- STINK: Freeze!
- Whoa!
- "I lost every round.
And how many Thrill Points
do I have
after one whole summer
of trying?
Nada, zip, zero,
zilch points.
So, Rocky, can you please think up more dares for me?
'Cause otherwise I'm gonna be a no-point, dare-doing loser!"
OPAL: Hey, Judy,
Frank's here!
JUDY: Coming!
Hey, Judy!
Ready for the evil creature double feature?
- Yup.
- Me, too. Let's go.
Who are you?
- Bride of Frankenstein.
- And I'm Frankenstein.
FRANK: We even have matching rings.
(SINGING) Judy and Frank, sitting in a tree!
K-l-S-S-l-N-G!
Do you want me to feed you to Jaws?
- Um-um-um-um.
- Then take it back.
G-N-l-S-S-l-K.
Let's go.
Bye, Aunt O... whoa.
- Are you making pancakes?
- No way.
This is plaster of Paris.
Wow. Mom and Dad would freak if they saw this mess.
Oh, yeah. You should really get out the vacuum and clean it up.
I think you should get out the fire hose. See ya.
Bye. You look great.
I love your costume.
- Two, please.
- I want to take your money!
How come you're wearing a ski jacket? It's August.
'Cause it's freezing in there.
The air conditioner's gone psycho.
Did he say freezing?
As in cold?
(YELLING) Mr. Todd?
Search everywhere.
Is one of you Mr. Todd?
Nope and nope.
Mr. Todd, is that you?
Mr. Todd?
- Mr. Todd?
- Mr. Todd?
I give up. Mr. Todd's probably training penguins in the North Pole or something.
Or something.
Remember, no being a wimpburger.
We have to stay to the end if we wanna get points.
Don't look at me.
You're the one who'll be screaming...
Holy eyeball!
Good thing he's dead already.
- (GASPING)
- Watch it.
It's true.
The dead are among us.
They have taken over the
small town of Pittsylvania.
Lock your doors.
Bolt your windows.
Head for the basement.
And if you don't
have a basement...
... build one.
Uh, you know what?
I gotta go home.
I forgot to feed my goldfish.
Sit down.
This is our absolute last chance to earn Thrill Points!
Airhead, Frankenstein, shh!
I come for dinner.
I come for you!
(GRUNTING) Hungry.
I hungry for you, Frank!
He said my name!
He said my name!
You are not leaving!
Let go!
You are dead,
Frank Pearl!
No! Zombies are dead!
I'm going home.
Great! Rocky and Amy are breaking the record for the funnest summer ever, and I'm stuck with
Franken-screamer.
Hey!
Rocky and Amy wouldn't bail after two seconds of zombies.
Rocky and Amy wouldn't knock me off a tightrope.
Rocky and Amy wouldn't puke all over me.
Well, look who's talking!
All your stupid points and dares and charts!
They suck the fun out of everything!
You're like a big, wet fun sponge!
Fun sponge?
Well, if I'm a fun sponge, then you're a fun mop!
Uh, hold on there, bridezilla.
- Where's your ticket?
- It's inside. It's in my backpack.
Sorry.
No ticket, no movie.
Fun sponge, my elbow!
What is that?
It's Bigfoot!
I'm a guerilla gorilla artist now, huh?
STINK: Check out the head!
Do you wanna help?
I'd love to, only I can't because I'm going to spend the rest of this bummer summer in my room!
Look out.
She's in a mood.
Am not!
Eighty-five points already? Rocky!
- (HORN BLARES)
- OPAL: Judy! It's the ice cream truck.
What?
Come back in September.
I think this is gonna be melted by then.
So you wanna spend the rest of the summer in your room?
I might as well.
It's already completely, for sure ruined.
Besides, Frank, my "used to be second best friend but now he's my enemy," called me a fun sponge.
Wow. That's bad.
Are you a fun sponge?
No way! He's the sponge.
It's his fault I can't get any Thrill Points!
Right. Thrill Points.
Well, they're important.
You can't have a not bummer summer without them.
Totally, duh. I mean, that's like the number one rule of summer.
We have to find a way for you to get the Thrill Points.
What about, you know, we didn't put the hats on the lions yet.
The hats got all ruined, remember?
There's gotta be something else.
It's impossible, Aunt Opal.
I've already thought of absolutely, positively everything.
There's gotta be more.
Let's go on Google.
- Let's Google "fun."
- (MEN CHATTERING)
What's that?
WOMAN: Testing, testing.
You got a close-up of Bigfoot, right?
- MAN: Looks great.
- (GASPING)
- And your name is?
- James Moody.
But everyone calls me Stink.
Stink is apparently building a statue of Bigfoot to commemorate the monster who may be lurking nearby according to 27 recent eyewitness reports.
Now, most people think
Bigfoot isn't real.
How do you answer that?
Well, people don't think giant squids are real, either.
Well, they are, and so is Bigfoot.
And I'm gonna catch him!
WOMAN: If you do catch him,
Mr. Stink Moody, you'll be the most famous kid in America.
You'll put this town on the map!
For years, people have searched for Bigfoot but only Judy Moody could find him.
How many Thrill Points is that worth, do you think?
A million. But who's counting?
In honor of your courageous actions we are renaming this town
Judy Moodyville!
- (CROWD APPLAUDING)
- Come on down, Judy, and put this town on the map!
REPORTER: Well, thank you,
Stink Moody.
As your quest for Bigfoot continues, we wish you luck.
This is WH2O, broadcasting live...
Don't forget me!
I'm a Bigfooter, too!
You are?
It's Judy Moody, with a J.
And a U-D-Y. Did you get that?
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh.
- (TIRES SCREECHING)
- JUDY: Bye!
Since when were you a Bigfooter?
Since one minute ago.
Listen, is Bigfoot really, truly, for absolute positive real?
Twenty-seven people can't be wrong.
Then I will help you find him.
Yeah! But how come?
Because this is my absolute last chance to get Thrill Points, and if we actually catch Bigfoot,
- I might even win the race!
- Huh?
Nothing, never mind.
Just tell me everything.
Got it.
And dogs always howl whenever they see him.
That's on page 37.
Zeke can tell you more.
He's like a Bigfoot encyclopedia.
OK, Bigfooters.
Tuesday's meeting is now called to order.
- Herb and Rose?
- Present.
- Stink?
- Present.
- New member?
- Judy Moody. Present.
ROSE: Oh, she looks like a smart cookie.
Where is everyone?
This is it.
This is our club.
- And we welcome you.
- Get a picture of that.
Better late than never.
- Rose? Do you have a report?
- Three new sightings!
That's the most we've gotten in one week.
Excellent! Give me the coordinates.
One saw Bigfoot taking laundry off her clothesline.
57 Ashbury Road.
It's a mile east of the mall.
Gotcha.
Another saw something large and furry at the dump.
The third swears he saw Bigfoot last night at the corner of Croaker and Jefferson.
Croaker and Jefferson?
BOTH: That's where we live!
- You live there?
- Yeah.
- Did anybody say anything?
- 117 Croaker.
This calls for an all-night surveillance!
- Are you guys up for it?
- You mean like a stake-out, with flashlights and secret codes and stuff?
- I got a whole book of codes.
- All right! Yes!
Thrill-o-rama!
Herb, Rose, you're in charge of equipment.
Troops, we've got everything you need.
Camouflage netting.
- Check.
- Check.
- Night-vision goggles.
- BOTH: Check.
- Camcorder with whistle.
- BOTH: Check.
- Check, check.
- Thermoses with coffee.
- Herb, they don't drink coffee.
- (GROANING)
Good luck, team.
- I will call with any sighting updates.
- Sir.
OK, that's the lot of it.
Now remember, if you need back-up, this van is at your service.
STINK: August 3rd, 8:06pm.
The trap is set, and the Bigfoot stake-out is on.
This is Stink Moody, reporting live.
You look like Owl Girl!
These don't work. I can't even see.
That's because it's not dark yet.
- Oh.
- OPAL: Hey.
Are you ready?
Let's go over the plan.
You two will sleep in the tent.
- Check.
- If you see or hear anything, you will contact me immediately on this walkie-talkie.
That's Stink's old baby monitor.
Whatevs. Let's call it the walkie-talkie.
What is the signal?
- (FEEDBACK)
- Code Red! Code Red!
Awesome.
What happens if you fall asleep and Bigfoot attacks us, and we're half-eaten before you get downstairs?
- (SCOFFING)
- He won't attack us.
I know Bigfoot sign language.
This means, "I am your friend."
And this means,
"Your head was delicious."
OK, Bigfoot's not gonna eat any heads, all right?
Because we're remembering this vow:
We will not...
ALL: Fall asleep!
JUDY: Stink, wake up!
Code Red. Code Red.
- Aunt Opal, Code Red! Code Red!
- (SNORING)
Geez, Louise!
Holy macaroni! It's... It's him!
Gotcha!
Bigfoot! Code Red! Code Red!
FRANK: Help.
- Frank?
- Judy?
What are you doing here?
Well, I got my dad to go back to the theater and pick up our packs, and I thought I could just drop it off in your tent or something so you'd find it, only I bumped into a jar and then you hair-netted me!
Sorry. I thought you were Bigfoot.
Why would I be Bigfoot?
(CHUCKLING) You scared
Judy's pants off, Frank!
- Did not.
- You were screaming your head off.
- JUDY: No, I wasn't. I was...
- (DISTANT MOANING)
Bigfoot?
- Bigfoot.
- Impossible. That was an owl.
That was an owl.
Or Bigfoot pretending to be an owl! Come on, let's go!
I have to get my camcorder!
Are you coming, Frank?
It's worth mega-mega-points!
Um, I'd love to,
- but, um...
- (CAR HORN HONKS)
Oh, that's my dad. Gotta go! Bye!
STINK: Set for night vision!
Maybe it really was an owl.
Nuh-uh. That was him.
Bigfoot is famous for his owl sounds.
Page 11.
- (HOOTING)
- (GASPS)
You go first. I'll hold the light.
You go first. I'm filming.
OK, scaredy pants.
But stay close.
JUDY: Not that close.
- STINK: Then go faster.
- JUDY: No way.
STINK: What was that?
Shh.
Stop. Look. There!
- Is that some kind of bed?
- Yeah, a Bigfoot bed.
Remember from the picture?
This must be where he sleeps.
Then where is he?
He must've heard us coming.
He's probably watching us. Mr. Bigfoot?
We come in peace!
Hello?
Can you hear me?
- (POSSUM SHRIEKS)
- (SCREAMING)
There! See?
That's his bed!
Whoa. Do you really think it's his?
He was there. I know it.
All I know is I got a face full of possum and zero Thrill Points.
Don't give up. You can do it.
It can take years to catch a monster.
But I don't have years.
I need Thrill Points now.
- (MOANING)
- Look! Look, it's Bigfoot!
Look, there are the dogs!
Quick! After him!
- There! After him, go! Go, go!
- (MOANING)
Whoa! Don't stop!
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on! Come on!
We have to catch him before he gets to Main Street!
The cars will drive him cuckoo!
BOTH: Page 73!
- Did you see that?
- He's hijacking the ice cream truck!
We'll never catch him now.
Stop!
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we need this bike...
- Jessica.
...Jessica.
This is a matter of extreme national emergency.
- Who are you?
- I am Opal, the special agent in charge of the apprehension of large unidentified creatures.
We are requisitioning all available bicycles.
Thank you for your service to your country.
JUDY: Watch out for the!
STINK: Get it off, get it off!
I can't see anything!
- (TIRES SCREECH)
- OPAL: Sorry!
- STINK: Get it off! I don't like this!
- JUDY: I'm gonna fall off!
I can't hang on! Take it off!
- OPAL: Oh, I can see!
- Look, the ice cream truck!
ALL: Stop!
STINK: Bigfoot, come back!
Now what?
Hey, we just got a report!
Bigfoot's in...
- The ice cream truck. We know!
- Get in!
Buckle up, everybody.
- Should I drive?
- JUDY AND STINK: No!
This is Herb Birnbaum reporting a large runaway man-gorilla known as Bigfoot who appears to have commandeered an ice cream truck.
- Left! Turn left!
- Go left, Rose!
JUDY: Faster!
I have to tell you, this is my first official car chase.
Really? We get in two or three of these a week.
HERB: Hit it! Hit it!
ROSE: Hang on, everybody.
Commencing infrared warning device!
- (SIREN BLARES)
- Is that legal?
When you're chasing a man-gorilla, son, anything is legal.
- Anything!
- (ROSE SHOUTS)
- HERB: Whoa!
- OPAL: Whoa!
It's a cloaking device! Like the movies!
Windshield wipers!
JUDY AND STINK: Go, go, go!
Oh! Wait till you see my supersonic tracking device.
That's really like the movies.
Wow, that's cool!
You, sir, are an artist.
I programmed it with 200 different Bigfoot sounds.
The minute it picks up the slightest...
- (CRASHING)
- (OPAL SCREAMS)
Herb, I told you to use a lag bolt!
- HERB: All right.
- JUDY: Look out!
- That's the news van!
- That interviewed me!
Follow that news!
- (HONKING)
- Look out! Watch out! Watch out!
Outta the way! Outta the way!
There!
Hey, look!
It's the poop picnic place!
Hey, kids, wait! Wait!
You'll need a protective suit!
Shh.
- Mr. Todd?
- MR. TODD: Judy!
(CHUCKLING) Long time no see!
What's going on?
- We were saving you from...
- Bigfoot!
- Get back! Get back!
- (MOANING)
Bigfoot.
Whoa.
- ALL: Zeke?!
- HERB: I don't believe this!
We received at least
76 calls this morning!
JUDY: It's my teacher!
STINK: It's Zeke!
- I can't believe he's the ice cream guy!
- Since when are you Bigfoot?
- Why didn't you stop for us?
- Well, when?
A madcap ride through town has led us to this pier.
Hey, I love your cool suit.
You look awesome.
Thanks.
- I'm Mr. Todd, Judy's teacher.
- Hi, I'm Opal.
And this is Bigfoot. I hired him to help me sell ice cream.
With all the Bigfoot mania around here, he'll really help me drum up business.
He's way better than the arrow-pointing guy.
Why didn't you tell me that you knew Mr. Todd?
- I've been looking for him all summer.
- Yeah.
Dudes, chill. I only met the Toddster this morning.
Yet there are two questions that still remain:
Is the real Bigfoot still at large?
And will he show up for the circus?
- The circus?
- Yup. It's today, right here at the pier.
And remember, you get a prize if you find me.
- (GASPS)
- Front row seats!
Wow, thanks! Are we the first ones to find you?
Not exactly.
Thanks for getting me a ticket to the circus.
Yeah, sure. Sorry
I was such a fun mop.
Sponge.
- Whatever. Want some?
- (GROANS)
ZEKE: Bigfoot loves cotton candy.
Look!
Hey, it's Rocky!
And he's sweeping elephant poop!
I knew it!
Hey, Rocky! Hey!
- JUDY: Hey!
- Hey, Judy!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the Zangzini Family Circus!
Let the show begin!
Do we have a volunteer from the audience?
Someone brave enough to get sawed in half?
Me, me, me!
Hmmm.
- OPAL: Pick Judy!
- JUDY: Pick me, me!
Pick the girl in the green.
You, young lady!
- Hey, Judy.
- Hey, Rocky!
Ooh, I missed you so much.
I missed you, too. Hop in.
Watch this.
Ta-da!
Wow, Rock!
Judy, that is uber-cool!
OK, could you put her back together now, please?
Yeah, 'cause we only just got home, and we'd like our little girl in one piece.
JUDY: Don't worry, Mom.
It really didn't hurt that much.
AMY: Can we try, Judy?
FRANK: "We"? You try it!
AMY AND JUDY: Frank!
Can I borrow Judy tonight?
They're way too serious. Don't you think?
Ta-da!
- You fixed them!
- Yup.
Wow!
JUDY: Yay!
We did it! We did it!
Yay!
Oh, I'm so happy!
Aren't you glad you didn't spend the rest of your summer in your room?
Oh, for sure and absolute positive.
I wouldn't have put a hat on a lion or gone on a stake-out
- or fallen off a tightrope.
- Or had a poop picnic.
Or found Mr. Todd.
Or been in a car chase.
Or gotten sawed in half.
Or met you.
Hey, I've got an idea. How about you don't leave tomorrow?
How about you come live with us?
Oh. (GROANS HAPPILY)
What about this:
Next summer, I'm thinking of wrapping the Eiffel Tower in 10,000 scarves.
- Do you wanna help me?
- For real?
That would be on-top-of-spaghetti rare!
I never thought we could top this summer, but Paris?
Wow!
Paris. Next summer.
Be there! I love you!
- MOM: Bye!
- JUDY: Love you back!
STINK: Bye!
See you next summer!
OPAL: Goodbye, Judy!
Bye, Stink! This was the best!
Bye!
OPAL: I love you!
Fifty cents to touch Bigfoot!
Fifty cents to touch this?
Are you nuts, Stink?
Do you have change for a dollar?
Yes! Sure.
- Hey, thanks for fixing my bike.
- Yeah, sure, no problem.
- (SQUISHING SOUND)
- Eww.
BOY: Awesome!
Fifty cents to touch Bigfoot!
Hey! This was my idea.
Aunt Opal says art belongs to everyone.
Besides, I have to earn money for the Eiffel Tower!
- Fifty cents a touch!
- (MEOWING)
JUDY: For a dollar,
Bigfoot will shake your hand!
DAD: Or better yet, for a hundred dollars we'll move him to your yard!
For a thousand dollars,
I'll tell you where the real Bigfoot lives!
(GASPS) Don't do that.
That's not in the script.
Mom! Whoa!
Just wait a sec.
- OK, OK.
- Cut.

This is Agent Leland Turbo.
I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile.
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.
You won't believe what I found out here.
This is bigger than anything we've ever seen, and no one even knows it exists.
Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry, it could blow the operation.
- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
- Let's go.
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.
All right, buddy, we're here.
Right where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?
I'm looking for a car.
A car? Ha!
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here.
Exactly where I want to be.
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.
What are you doing out here?
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.
Well, turn around and go back where you came from.
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?
- Incoming.
- All workers report to the loading dock.
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.
All right, fellas, you know the drill.
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.
Come on, guys. These crates aren't gonna unload themselves.
Too many cars here. Out of my way.
Professor Zundapp?
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to see this before we load it?
Ah, yes. Very carefully.
Oh, a TV camera.
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.
What are you up to now, Professor?
This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.
- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.
Yeah! This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong.
Agent Leland Turbo.
It's Finn McMissile!
He's seen the camera! Kill him!
- All hands on deck!
- All hands on deck!
Whoa!
Waargh!
What?
Get to the boats!
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!
He's dead, Professor.
Wunderbar!
With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now?
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who - is here to help you.
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.
I thought I could make it this time, but...
Smooth like pudding, huh?
- Who am I kidding?
- I'll always be a lemon.
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.
Hey, but look on the bright side.
This is your tenth tow this month, so it's on the house.
You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.
Don't sweat it. Shoot, these things happen to everybody.
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through.
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?
Not yet.
He must be crazy excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him, but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,
'cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for.
Just me and...
McQueen!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!
McQueen's back!
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.
Welcome home, soldier.
The place wasn't the same without you, son.
What? Did he go somewhere?
It's good to be home, everybody.
- Mater!
- McQueen!
Oooh!
Whoooa!
Hey, how far did you make it this time, Otis?
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!
I know! I can't believe it either!
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.
You too, buddy.
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe the things I got planned for us!
These best friend greetings get longer every year!
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.
Wow.
I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson.
I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!
I can handle anything.
Er... Mater?
Just remember, your brakes ain't going to work on these!
- Mater?
- Relax.
These train tracks ain't been used in years!
Aaaah!
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!
Faster!
Ooh. Wow.
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?
This is going to be good!
Did you see that?
Uh-oh.
- This ain't going to be good.
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir, this new dent.
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.
Wait till you see what I got planned for tonight!
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!
You, me and Miss Sally goin' out for supper.
Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally.
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
OK.
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.
See you soon, amigo.
Ah, this is so nice.
I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone, just the two of us, finally.
- You and me.
- Ahem! Good evening.
- Oh!
- My name is Mater, and I'll be your waiter.
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.
Mater? You work here?
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?
I snuck in here when nobody was lookin' and pretended to be your waiter so I could hang out with you?
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?
Can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple of drinks?
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.
Uh... Right. Your usual.
- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?
How should I know?
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...
His story gripped the world.
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS, ironically ran out of gas, and found himself trapped in the wild.
Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he distilled himself from the natural elements!
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel.
Now he claims to have done it with his allinol.
And to show the world what his new super fuel can do he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.
And we all know what happened to them.
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.
After seeing allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?
And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.
It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you.
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?
Of course we invited him, but apparently after his very long racing season he is taking time off to rest.
The Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco.
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.
In miles, that is like... way faster than McQueen.
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.
- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.
- Hello?
- Go ahead.
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.
That Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.
He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world.
- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,
"the bestest race car," then why must he rest? Huh?
'Cause he knows what's important.
Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!
This is not news to Francesco.
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.
After two laps, I am out cold.
That ain't what I meant.
What's going on over there?
He is afraid of Francesco.
That's that
Italian formula car.
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.
- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?
McQueen could drive circles around you.
Driving in circles is all he can-a do, no?
No.
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.
Any time, any track.
Mel, can we move on?
Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation, like a dump truck.
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.
Hey! Whoa!
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.
The Lightning McQueen, huh?
I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!
This is the difference between you and Francesco.
Francesco knows how good he is.
He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.
Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!
Not-a so fast, McQueen!
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?
Motto?
This sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course.
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.
I would love to, but my crew is off for the season, so...
Pit stop.
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby.
Ka-chow! Yeah.
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.
Mater's going to have a blast, though.
You're bringing Mater, right?
You never bring him to any of your races.
Ah.
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.
Come on, it will be the thrill of a lifetime for him.
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.
I didn't taste it!
How'd you like to come and see the world with me?
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.
- You're coming along.
- All right!
Ka-chow!
Ha-ha!
Hey!
Hey, excuse me!
Domo arigato!
Yeah!
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.
OK, now, Mater, remember, best behavior.
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!
Hey, McQueen! Over here.
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.
Can you believe this party?
Hey.
You done good. You got all the leaves.
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.
Ah... Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?
Ho-ho! Good job!
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
You're just realizing that?
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done a number on you.
Mater, things are different over here.
Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different, too.
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?
That's what a tow truck does.
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...
Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?
Anything for McQueen's friend.
Miss Sally is going to flip when she sees this.
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.
Hey, she has-a good taste.
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".
You're right. She's a huge fan!
She goes on and on about your open wheels.
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going on and on.
Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco.
Women respect a car that has-a nothing to hide.
Yeah, er...
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.
I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally.
Oh. Sorry.
I already dedicated my win tomorrow to her.
So, if we both do it, it's really not so special.
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks?
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?
I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race.
Yes, you will see Francesco, but not like this.
You will see him like-a this as he drives away from you.
Ha! That's cute.
You had one of those made up for all the racers?
No.
Okay.
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.
It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
From Brazil, Number 8...
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
That's because it's air-cooled.
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.
Try the canapes on the mezzanine.
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?
It appears to be a standard television camera.
They said if you could get closer photos next time that would be great.
This was London's message?
Oh, no. No, sir.
The oil platforms you were on, turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.
How did we miss that?
They've scrambled everyone's satellites.
The Americans discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that platform under deep cover.
He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.
Great.
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?
Nope, not yet.
The American is here tonight to pass it to you.
He'll signal you when he's ready.
Good, good.
Oh, no.
- What is it?
- Change of plan.
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?
Those thugs down there were on the oil platform.
If they see me, the mission is compromised.
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.
You are now.
I'll take one of them. Thank you.
Never know which one McQueen will have a hankering for.
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!
Er... little more, please.
It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more.
Come on, let's go. It's free.
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
My condolences.
And now our last competitor.
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
Ka-chow!
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.
You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition.
Somebody get me water! Aah!
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.
Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.
It has turned.
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.
This is the bloke that called in to the television show.
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.
This trip's been amazin'.
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.
I gotta go. Oh, er...
Er...
Sorry, ladies.
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!
I never leak, I never leak, never...
Wow-wee!
What in the...?
Hey, that tickles!
Waaargh!
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.
OK, so, the American has activated his tracking beacon.
Roger that. Move in.
Stop! Hey!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?
- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!
- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.
All right.
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!
No offense to your makes and models, but you break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the altar!
What the...? Whoa. Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!
We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Don't let me get in the way of your private business.
Oh, a little advice. When you hear a giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button.
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.
Get out of here!
All right, then. And when she starts gigglin', prepare to be squirted.
'Scuse me, ma'am.
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.
- This cannot be him.
- Is he American?
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.
- Extremely.
- Then it's him.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.
Perfect.
Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.
'Course, Karmann Ghias weren't the only ones.
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them there's the Type 2 buses.
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!
Erm... We should find somewhere more private.
Gee, don't you think that's a little...?
You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised.
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.
We'll rendezvous then.
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?
Mater, what's going on?
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.
Guido don't believe you.
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!
See you tomorrow!
Guido still don't believe you.
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.
What's so funny?
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.
So you think.
Allinol by itself is good for you.
But after microscopic examination
I have found that it has one small weakness.
When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous.
Smile for the camera.
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.
You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform.
Now, you will witness what it really does.
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.
Could I start it now, Professor Z?
Go 50% power.
This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter.
What about her? Did you give it to her?
The allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber.
How about him? Did you talk to him?
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.
You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse... unfortunately... there will be nothing to replace.
- How about him?
- Does he have it?
That's him. He's the one.
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!
Yes, sir.
We believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information.
I will take care of it before any damage can be done.
The project is still on schedule.
You will find the second agent and kill him.
Japan, land of the rising sun, where ancient tradition meets modern technology.
Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix.
I'm Brent Mustangburger with racing legends
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.
There's never been a competition like this before.
First, allinol, making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions.
Second, the course itself.
And it's like nothing we've ever seen before.
David, how exactly does this competition work?
All three of these street courses are classic round-the-house racetracks.
This means that the IMP and formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion.
Look for Francesco Bernoulli, in particular, to lead early.
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars, like Spain's Miguel Camino, should make up ground but I doubt it'll be enough to stop Francesco from absolutely running away with it.
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.
You forget the most important factor... that early dirt track section of the course.
The dirt is supposed to be the equalizer in this race.
French rally car
Raoul CaRoule is counting on a big boost through there.
And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time.
In my opinion, McQueen is the best all-around racer in this competition.
Really, Darrell, you need to clean your windshield.
You're clearly not seeing this
Francesco's race to lose.
- It's time to find out.
- The racers are locking into the grid.
Speed. I am speed.
Really? You are speed?
Then Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco is triple speed.
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.
It's-a really getting him into the zone.
He is so getting beat today.
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.
It must have cost him a fortune.
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.
As they head into the palace hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.
- Hang on, boys.
- Here comes the dirt.
Slipping and sliding, baby.
McQueen, it's time to make your move!
Get on the outside and show 'im what Doc taught you.
10-4, Mater.
Oh, boy! Francesco's brought to a screeching halt!
Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage.
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.
- Nice call, Mater.
- Keep it up.
Whoo-hoo!
McQueen looks happier than a roll bar at a demolition derby!
Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again.
Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt.
He's got serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race.
The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.
- It is time.
- Roger that.
- Oh!
- Miguel Camino has blown an engine!
- Very unusual, Darrell.
- He's been so consistent all year.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?
The one the American agent passed the device to.
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!
Not for long.
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?
The Pacer from the party last night.
I'm cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks.
Yep. His VIN numbers match.
- Anyone with him?
- He won't be alone.
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?
Get him out of the pits. Now!
Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud!
- Can you hear me? Over.
- What?
Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?
Hey. I know you! You're that girl from the party last night.
You wanna do our date now?
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.
Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!
Ha-ha-ha!
There's no time for messing about! Get out of the pits!
Is there going to be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?
- You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!
I'm trying. Get out now.
I usually like to have a proper detailin' done before I meet a lady friend.
Huh?
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.
Miss Shiftwell?
I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages.
Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
Hey, new lady friend, you like flowers?
What?
- No! Don't go in anywhere.
- Just keep moving.
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?
Whoa! McQueen suddenly moves to the outside.
I cannot believe what I saw.
That was a bonehead move to open up the inside like that!
That might have cost McQueen the victory!
This time, I'm going to make sure you stay dead!
- You're doing brilliantly.
- Now just stay focused.
What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus?
No! Don't go down that street.
Ohh!
Hi-yah!
Wow! A live karate demonstration!
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
Aaargh!
And here they come, the two leaders.
Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!
- It's close!
- Francesco's the winner!
McQueen's number two.
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?
Where'd he go?
Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe.
- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.
What was your strategy today?
Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.
It's-a very simple.
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.
You were in trouble for a while.
That dirt track section had you crawling.
To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high.
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?
Is the race over? You won, right?
Why were you yelling at me while I was racing?
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.
No, that's 'cause I seen these two fellers doing some karate street performance.
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.
Your date?
She started talkin' to me as a voice in my head, tellin' me where to go.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?
This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things.
Maybe if I, I don't know, talk to somebody and explained what happened, I could help.
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!
Hey, there he is!
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?
I made a mistake.
But I can assure you, it won't happen again.
Look, we know what the problem is and we've taken care of it.
Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix.
And three - count 'em - three cars flamed out leaving some to suggest that their fuel, allinol, might be to blame.
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.
There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out.
The jury may still be out on whether allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure,
Lightning McQueen blew this race.
Team McQueen can't be happy right now.
Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.
This is about my hook, ain't it?
I know I should have checked it, but I can't, really.
Look. It's attached to me.
Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration.
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.
I know some karate.
I don't want to brag or nuttin', but I got me a black fan belt.
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls.
I call it, "What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once. "
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!
Hang on!
Whoa-hah-hah!
This is first-class service.
You don't even have to go through the terminal!
Your karate partners is back there.
They look like they tryin' to catch up!
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Whoa...
Is everything okay back there?
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
Roger that.
'Member that whole thing about me not stoppin' no matter what?
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!
Thanks, old boy.
- You got it, mate.
- Hey, doggonit!
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!
Come on! Get in here!
I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya?
That's a no-quit attitude right there.
What the...?
- Aargh!
- Hold on, Sid.
Aargh!
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!
Hold on!
By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane flying home.
I'm so sorry for what I did.
"I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. "
"I want you to go prove to the world what I already know. "
"That you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. "
"Your best friend, Mater. "
I didn't really want him to leave.
Wait, there's more here.
"PS. Please tell the hotel"
"I didn't mean to order that movie. "
"I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it. "
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."
There are a few more pages of PS's here.
Well, at least I know if he's at home, he'll be safe.
That's how I like to start the day.
You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.
Whoa!
That's the closest I ever been to missin' my flight.
That was... Oh!
- Still in one piece? Great.
- I've got to go to a doctor.
I get these sharp pains in my undercarriage.
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomethin' or other.
He's a first-class VIP airport whatchamacallit.
And, Finn, this here is my date.
I never did get your name.
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.
It's Shiftwell. Holley...
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.
What is this?
That's one of the worst engines ever made.
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts.
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what.
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?
- But you took it.
- Holley.
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.
A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.
Agent? You mean, like, insurance agent? Like...
Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!
In how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?
It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period.
At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.
This seems like a dead end.
If there was something in the photo that could narrow this down, I'd be happier.
You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is.
See how he's had most of his parts replaced?
And see all them boxes over there?
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.
Exactly.
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.
I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife, but he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is.
What would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?
Wait. What?
You obviously have experience in the field.
Yeah, I live right next to one.
I don't know.
I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.
Well... Okay.
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?
Right. And I'm just in the import-export business.
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?
Paris. Tout de suite.
Yeah, two of them sweets for me, too, Sid.
I always wanted to be a spy.
Really? Me, too.
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?
Ha ha ha!
Once we're inside, stay close.
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.
Got it.
Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone, and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?
Why would I...
Dad-gum.
- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.
They got everything here. No!
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!
Wow. Whoa. He-he!
Do what?
Excuse me. What are you selling?
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?
- What in the...?
- Two for one.
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!
- There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.
- Mater, get back!
- Imbecile!
Hey, wait for me!
Ahhhhhh!
Ag-g-g-h!
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.
Sure thing.
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?
This is her first field assignment. She didn't know you were my informant.
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?
I never liked new car smell.
Tomber was doing 20-to-life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage, aren't you?
All right, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old.
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?
They should. I sold them.
- To whom?
- No idea.
He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone.
I was always wondering why he needs so many parts.
Now I know.
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.
Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter.
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.
Pull up the pictures from the oil platform.
I want to know what other type of cars were out there.
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.
Are these cars considered lemons?
Is the Popemobile Catholic?
Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.
And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov never get together, but they are having a secret meeting in two days.
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.
That's where the next race is!
There's a good chance our mystery engine will be there, too.
Your chances are more than good.
I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday. To Porto Corsa.
Contact Stevenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.
Good work.
That three-wheeled feller had to be right about a big meetin'.
You never see this many lemons in one town.
'Less there's a swap meet.
How'd you get all them pictures?
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.
Thank you... I think.
- That's a familiar sight.
- A Hugo being towed.
But he looks absolutely perfect!
Of course! They must be the heads of the lemon families.
Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day,
I'd hire me to tow me around all the time, too!
We've got to infiltrate that meeting to find out who's behind all this.
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
Thank you, Finn.
Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.
Guido, your eyes do not deceive you.
We are in Italy. We are home.
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?
What? No friend of mine will stay in a hotel in-a my village.
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!
Luigi! Guido!
How do they do it?
These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good.
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.
Hey, race car.
You look so down, so low.
Is like you have flat tires.
She said you look like you are starving, that she's gonna make you a big meal and fatten you up.
Oh, no.
Mama Topolino, please, you don't need to make a fuss.
Capisco. I understand.
Is a problem, yes, between you and a friend?
How did you know that?
A wise car hears one word and understands two.
That, and Luigi told me.
While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me.
I brought my friend Mater along on the trip and I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs.
This Mater is a close friend?
He's my best friend.
Then why would you ask him to be someone else?
What did I do?
I said some things during our fight.
You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything.
They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari, which one of them looked more like a Ferrari.
There were even some non-Ferrari fights.
So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight. "
"Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. "
"But you got to make up fast. "
"No fight more important than friendship. "
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.
Now, mangia. Eat!
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
Thank you, Stevenson.
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.
But everything's voice-activated these days.
What? I thought you was supposed to be makin' me a disguise.
- Voice recognized.
- Disguise program initiated.
Cool!
Computer, make me a German truck.
- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.
Make me a monster truck!
- Request acknowledged.
- What the...?
I vant to siphon your gas!
- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.
- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.
I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.
That's no good. Hm.
Hey. What are you doin'?
The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.
For a second there, I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents.
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.
I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody.
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?
I come by each one of 'em with my best friend, Lightning McQueen.
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.
Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.
But my line of work is towin' and salvage.
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.
- Oh...
- In the meantime...
.. you look a little light on weapons.
You are looking live at beautiful
Porto Corsa, Italy, on the Italian Riviera.
What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix!
Brent, they call this place the "Gem of the Riviera," and it's easy to see why.
With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos,
Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy.
And everyone who's anyone is here today, from the ultra-rich and super-famous to world leaders and important dignitaries.
You aren't kidding, David.
You can't do a three-point turn without bumping into some celebrity.
Welcome, everyone, to the second race of the World Grand Prix, where the big news continues to be allinol.
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety.
An independent panel of scientists has determined that allinol is completely safe, okay?
Safe. There it is.
So the race will go on, folks.
But the question everyone is asking:
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?
- He'd better.
- Talk about a home track advantage.
Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course.
Signore e signori, in the pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!
Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!
And your big mistake, McQueen!
In secondo position, numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?
If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe.
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.
Francesco understands, McQueen.
Oh, great, here it comes.
What do you got, Francesco?
For famous race cars like Francesco and, well, you, to be far away from home is not easy.
I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult.
Is-a no insult.
When-a Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama, just like-a you miss your tow truck amico.
Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly...
Of course, I am at home, and my mama is right here.
Mama!
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!
And there's the insult we were missing.
Darrell, the racers are settling in as they head to the Italian countryside.
Whoo, boy!
This is gonna be a great race.
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.
Look like someone stole their trunks.
My grand-a father has-a broken down.
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.
Sounds like you need some roadside assistance.
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.
Don't-a fight over me.
SignoreTow Truck, per favore.
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?
Impossible.
Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.
It's just that them guys look purty tough and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?
- That's how everyone sees you.
Isn't that the idea?
I tell you, that's the genius of it.
No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.
Brilliant!
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.
- Computer, disguise!
- Request acknowledged.
It's the boss. He's coming.
Ivan.
Oh, er...
Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait here?
He's in.
The racers are now making their way around the hairpin and headed downhill toward the casino bridge.
No more bets, please.
Come on, fuzzy dice!
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!
Air freshener. Antenna balls.
Spark-a plugs.
This place looks like it's made outta gold!
- That's because it is.
- Now, be careful what you say.
Why is that?
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?
You want me to stop talkin' to ya right now?
You are acting strange today, Ivan.
I have no idea what you're talking about,
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex. "
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But that makes sense, seein's how you's wanted in France, Germany...
Mater, stop it!
OK, OK, keep your voice down!
You gonna make me arrested!
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.
He's so good!
Victor!
Hey, Victor!
- There you are!
- Come in!
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.
It's good to see you.
Is the big boss here yet?
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.
Here we go.
Guten Tag.
It's just the professor.
Zundapp! When is he coming?
He's already here.
Welcome, everyone.
I wish I could be with you on this very special day, but my clutch assembly broke.
- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.
We know how you feel.
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.
Oh, it's too sophisticated.
We are here to celebrate.
Today, all your hard work pays off.
The world turned their backs on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts.
The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us.
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap, clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap, lemon.
But their insults just give us strength.
Because today, my friends, that all ends!
There's smoke on the casino bridge!
Oh, no!
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.
They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.
- Another crash!
- It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.
Embrace your inner lemon.
Let it drive you.
I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse.
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?
On the tower!
This was meant to be alternative fuel's greatest moment.
But after today, everyone will race back to gasoline.
And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve will become the most powerful cars in the world!
Get out of the way!
They will come to us, and they will have no choice, because they will need us.
Huh? Whoa!
We figured you might stop by!
And they will finally respect us!
So hold your hoods high!
After today, you will never again be ashamed of who you are!
No!
Long live lemons!
- Number 7 is loose!
- Shu Todoroki!
Finn?
Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!
They have no idea what happened behind them.
This is impossible!
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!
What happened?
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?
Oh, no!
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London still going to take place?
I suppose that...
The show must go on, as they say.
I can't believe this is really happening!
Quiet!
Will you require all the racers to still run on allinol?
I cannot, in good conscience, continue to risk the lives of any more race cars.
The final race will not be run on allinol.
There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use allinol for the final race.
A toast!
To the death of allinol and alternative fuel forever!
Mater, abort the mission.
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.
How is your grandfather?
Long live lemons!
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.
You are not leaving, are you?
Uh... of course I ain't leaving.
- I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?
Crashes are a part of racing, I know, but something like that should never happen.
You can choose your fuel for the final race. What it'll be?
Allinol.
After today?
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.
I didn't stand by a friend of mine recently.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen.
He will use allinol in the final race, despite what occurred today.
- .. Till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed!
No!
It's the American spy!
Dad-gum!
- Gatlinggun.
- Request acknowledged.
Down! Everybody, down!
- Shoot! I didn't mean...
- Request acknowledged.
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
Correction acknowledged. Deploying chute.
Whoa!
McQueen!
Whoa! What's this?
Whoa!
McQueen! McQueen!
Waagh!
Let me through! Let me through!
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.
We have a lunatic at gate 9.
I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting and my weapons system's done misinterperated what I'm saying!
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!
- You are the champion!
Thisway, signore.
- McQueen!
- Mater?
- McQueen.
- Give us a pose!
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!
Where you going?
Stop!
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...
Mater!
- Mater?
- Signore?
- McQueen!
- They're gonna kill you!
Mater!
Excuse me.
No, where are you going?
Scusi. Mater!
- McQueen!
- Scusi.
Mater! Mater!
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...
That was me. I said, "You killed out there today. You're the best. "
- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.
I really thought I heard my friend.
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.
Come-a with me, please.
Let me go!
You actually care about that race car.
A pity you didn't warn him in time.
- "Idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?
- That's how everyone sees you.
- I tell you, that's the genius of it.
No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.
At the fool...
Excuse me!
Domo arigato!
Yeah!
You done good. You got all the leaves.
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.
Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
Aargh!
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.
Mater!
But I never leak oil. Never.
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help.
Your help...
Bang the gong. Get it on!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things!
Holley! Finn! Where are we?
We're in London, Mater, inside Big Bentley.
Whoa!
Oh, this... This is all my fault.
Don't be a fool, Mater.
But I am, remember? You said so.
When did I... Oh.
Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.
I'm not a spy!
I've been trying to tell you that the whole time.
I really am just a tow truck.
Finn, he's not joking.
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen is 'cause I'm such a big one.
This is all my fault.
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.
Professor Z wanted you to have a front-row seat, for the death of Lightning McQueen.
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.
Whoa!
Huh?
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.
It never occurred to me he wouldn't be there.
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.
And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military.
You just need to focus on the race.
I know but, Sally with everything going on, I'm not sure...
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.
Because after Italy, I was finished, and then you gave me one last shot.
Listen...
I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I hope you win today.
You show the world that they've been wrong about allinol.
Mater would want you to race.
All right. For Mater.
Here he comes.
- What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?
- You broke it!
- Quiet!
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.
The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "ka-chow"... he's going to go "ka-boom"!
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.
Oh, wait, you could have!
- Dad-gum lemons!
- Request acknowledged.
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?
That's right! You got nothing!
Who's the lemon now, huh?
Nice try, Mater.
- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...
Mater!
I got to get y'all out of there.
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.
So, we'll be OK? Really?
He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth.
Argh!
Being killed by a clock.
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come. "
Time? That's it!
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.
If I can just reverse the polarity.
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.
What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?
Oh, no!
Drive! Burn rubber!
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to...
Done.
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.
Oh, no, that's Mater's.
I knew his escape was too easy.
Come back here! Stop!
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?
- Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.
When we were knocked out, they planted it in your air filter.
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!
- Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you OK?
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!
No, wait! Wait!
A tow truck has just raced onto the track, driving backwards!
Mater, wait!
Normally an emergency vehicle on the track means there's been an accident.
- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!
Stay back! If you get close to me, you're going to get hurt real bad!
I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters!
We're best friends!
And McQueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck.
I don't know who that truck is, Brent, but tell you what, he's got to be the world's best backwards driver.
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!
You've always been the bomb and you'll always be the bomb.
- Stay away!
- No! Never!
Almost there.
I'm not letting you get away again!
- Got to keep away from McQueen!
- Request acknowledged.
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening? It's a bad dream!
And Lightning McQueen just blasted away, hooked to the now rocket-propelled tow truck.
Gargh!
Aagh!
The Professor's on the run!
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!
- Holley, I'll get Zundapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!
What is happening?
Hurry, Professor.
You really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor?
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!
Give it up, McMissile.
- Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.
Oh, no.
Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you.
Bomb?
Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?
Death ray?
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.
Everything is voice-activated these days.
Deactivate! Deactivate!
Voice denied.
- Huh!
- Oops.
Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it?
- Say it.
- Deactivate.
Voice denied.
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.
I'm going out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct?
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.
But becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better.
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.
Pit stop.
Not today, boys.
Retreat!
Thanks for the help, Corporal.
Anything for one of Pop's mates.
What's he saying? What's wrong?
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.
I get it. I get it!
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!
What? No. I can't do it.
Nobody takes me seriously.
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.
Yes, it is.
Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs.
Be yourself here.
And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change, not you.
I know that because I was wrong before.
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.
Thanks, buddy.
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!
Oh, right. Hang on!
Where's he going?
- Computer!
- Yes, Agent Mater?
I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged.
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!
The second kind, not the first!
Deploying chute.
Who's winning the race?
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.
Okay.
Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurtin' the cars, and I know who.
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.
Bomb! It's a bomb!
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!
Get off the stage! Move it!
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
Mater, I don't know what you're doing, but stand down now.
This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.
Mater, just cut to the chase.
Okay. It's him.
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.
I figured it out when I realized y'all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts... the same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph.
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.
I remembered what they say about old British engines:
If there ain't no oil under 'em, there ain't no oil in 'em.
What is he talking about?
It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan.
You just blamed it on me.
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.
If we pop that hood, we'll see that engine from that picture.
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!
Stay away!
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?
To make allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil.
He said it himself with that disguised voice.
Disguised voice? What are you talking about? You're nuts, you are!
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.
One moment, I'd like to see where this is going.
Mater, he created allinol.
But what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else?
What if he came up with allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!
- Mater!
- Someone do something!
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!
- Bomb deactivated.
- Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.
How did the tow truck figure it out?
It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.
Now you're talkin'!
Hyeeugh!
Mater, let's go. You're on.
Your Majesty, may I present for the investiture of honorary knighthood of the British Realm...
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.
Go get 'em, buddy.
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir" business.
By the way, have y'all met each other?
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.
So there we was, my rocket jets going full blast,
McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowheres, guns drawed.
We was goners.
But then, out of nowhere this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!
That's a very entertaining story, young man.
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.
Holley! What are you doin' here?
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.
Finn!
Our satellites picked up an urgent communique.
So you got-a my email.
Y'all is going to have a great time!
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.
Don't tell nobody.
And this is Holley Shiftwell.
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.
It's so nice to meet you all.
Guido believe you now.
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in and you saved them in London?
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time.
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.
Those two are perfect for each other.
There's one thing I still don't get.
The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right?
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.
Our investigation proved that allinol was actually gasoline and Axlerod engineered it so when it got hit by the beam, it would explode.
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!
If you're implying that I switched that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel with my all-natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man!
It was him!
Once big oil, always big oil, man.
Tree-hugger.
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin.
All spectators, clear the starting line.
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!
We should do this every year.
Yeah, I just figured we never found out who the world's fastest car is.
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.
- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- SignorinaSally.
It is official.
Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world.
Why, thank you.
Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today!
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?
Just something I had made up for the occasion.
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.
Was-a funnier when I did it, but it's-a very funny.
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?
Try it. You'll like it.
So, he's not so good-looking.
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!
That's why I love you, Sally.
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!
And those open wheels.
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself some coolant.
Go, Lightning!
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!
Finn? Time to go.
Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly.
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.
Just stopped by here to pick something up.
Somethin' tells me you're not talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.
Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met.
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.
But as much fun as it was hangin' with y'all, this...
This is home.
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.
You still owe me that first date.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.
Actually, there is one thing.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! I'll be doggone!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thanks, Mater!
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!
Impossible!
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!
Not if I see you first!
Yippee!
