Once upon a time, a long time ago, a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed by a terrible curse.
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.
Only true love's kiss could lift her curse.
So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.
But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.
Whoa, there.
I don't know about this, Lillian.
Fairy Godmother said only true love's kiss could break Fiona's curse.
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.
Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.
But to put our daughter's life in the hands of this... person?
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...
Rumpelstiltskin!
Mrs. Highness.
How do you do?
Down, Fifi. Get down!
As you can see, everything's in order.
So you'll put an end to our daughter's curse?
And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me.
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?
Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long.
It's not like she's getting any younger.
But to sign over our entire kingdom?
Well, if your kingdom's worth more to you than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.
Jump, Fifi, jump!
Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!
Who saved her?
No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.
True love's kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!
The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace.
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!
Sir? You're gonna have to pay for that.
Maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?
Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!
I wish that ogre was never born!
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.
Better out than in.
That's my line.
Did my little Fergus make a...
...big, grownup ogre stink?!
Oh, that's diabolical!
And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop...
...and finally, into the castle.
Play date!
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
Happily...
- Ever...
- After.
Look! A shooting star!
So, what did you wish for?
That every day could be like this one.
Come here, you.
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.
Better out than in.
Did my little Fergus make a...
Cute. Real cute.
This lovable lug taught us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
Play date!
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After?
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...
- Play date!
- No!
Outhouse again!
Come on.
Undies!
Outhouse!
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After.
Roar.
Nice landing, baby.
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.
Happy birthday, niños!
Vamos a la fiesta!
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!
Mr. Shrek, would you sign our pitchforks?
And our torches?
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!
A real ogre?
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
Why does being your best friend entail me doing everything I don't want to do?
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?
Could you do that ogre roar of yours for my son?
He's a big, big fan.
Do the roar.
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.
- Do the roar.
- Honey?
Why don't you go check on the cake?
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.
Hold still.
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!
Your cake. Voilà!
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!
I'm in a great mood, actually.
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!
As long as you're not doing anything, how about one of those famous Shrek roars?
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.
An ogre only roars when he's angry.
You don't want to see me angry, do you?
Do it.
Hold it together. Just hold it together.
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.
Oh, good.
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.
- You licked it!
- No.
Just because you're an ogre, doesn't mean you have to eat like one.
Looks like you forgot the candles!
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.
Watch the cake?
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.
- Ya.
- What?
No, don't cry.
Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.
- Do the roar.
- Roar.
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.
No, I ate them.
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.
We need the cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake!
I love you, Daddy.
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.
Is this really how you want to remember the kids' first birthday?
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?
Let's talk about this after the party, at home.
You mean that roadside attraction we live in?
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, OK, maybe you're not the ogre you used to be.
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.
And the other half locked away in a tower.
Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace.
When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it!
Back when the world made sense!
You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?
Exactly!
Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you.
You have everything.
Why is it the only person who can't see that is you?
That's just great.
If she thinks I'm gonna slink back there and apologize, she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize for acting like one.
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!
Please, help!
Please, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
Oh, please, help!
Someone, anyone! Help me!
The pain! I can see a bright light. A tunnel!
Grandma? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Granny.
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre, please don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.
Look, move out or get crushed.
So you're not gonna eat me?
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?
Nowhere.
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.
But, seriously, letme give you a ride. I insist.
Come on. It's the least I can do after all you've done for me.
I got a hot rat cooking.
AII right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?
A liquid libation to ease that frustration?
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.
To live the life of an ogre... no worries, no responsibilities.
You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?
Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.
Why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty!
Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.
Hold on.
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.
You'll be, like, "Roar!"
And the villagers will be, like, "Get away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"
It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle.
- When the world made sense.
- AII right, what's the catch?
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
AII right, I knew it.
So what do you want?
- A day.
- A day.
Rat's done!
To make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something.
In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That's all.
I can't just pick up and leave my family.
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.
No one will even know you're gone.
And by the time this day is up, you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Still, I don't know.
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.
Do you like white meat or dark meat?
So what day would I have to give up?
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?
A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it didn't belong destroying your business and ruining your life?!
Just for an example.
How about the day I met Donkey?
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.
I don't know who that is.
I know. What about a day you wouldn't even remember?
Like a day when you were a baby.
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.
I guess there's nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.
Just 24 tiny little hours.
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!
I never needed to ask for anyone's permission before.
So why start now?
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it!
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!
You signed it.
So, tell me. What happens now?
Have a nice day.
I think I fell on my keys.
There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day.
Oh, great.
As we head over the river and through the woods...
Ogre!
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!
This is the part where you run away!
Sure is great to be wanted again.
Nice one.
Fiona?
Oh, no.
My home.
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you in there?!
AII right, Rumpel!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Rumpel!
Ogre!
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!
Who are you?!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Looks like a troublemaker!
Spread 'em!
Nice job, ladies!
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut your mouth!
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?
Donkey!
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.
I'm driving, so I'm in charge of the music.
Will you witches make up your mind?
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me in trouble and I need this job.
I am not going back to work for OId MacDonald.
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?
Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!
And how do you know my name anyway?
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?
A donkey and an ogre friends?
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!
Can you at least tell me where they're taking me?
To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!
Oh, no.
It's time to crumble!
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!
Yeah!
Gingy?
Gingy snap!
There's one!
Disgusting, filthy ogre!
Hideous monster!
Filthy, filthy creature!
Disgusting creature!
Move it!
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!
Mr. Stiltskin?
You got another customer.
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me my business wig.
Mr. Stiltskin, please!
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!
Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy.
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
Stiltskin!
Shrek!
There he is!
So close!
Have I been waiting for you!
Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?
AII right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.
They would never do that.
They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.
And then they disappeared!
They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter's curse.
I ended Fiona's curse!
How could you when you never existed?
You better start making sense, you dirty little man!
Here, letme spell it out for you!
You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn't even remember.
A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.
You took the day I was born.
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up...
But you haven't heard the best part.
Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.
Where's Fiona?
Where's my family?
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?
You see, you were never born.
You never met Fiona.
Your kids don't exist.
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?
Looks like you got exactly what you wanted!
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!
Get him, witches!
You know what'd help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.
Come on, girls!
Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! Do it!
I'll be right back, Donkey!
I don't know you! I don't know him!
I'm glad I'm not you.
Help me! Help!
Help!
No, not my pretty ball!
Watch out!
Wolfie?
My angry wig.
Help! I've been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!
Donkey! Get off of me!
Watch it with your pointy hooves!
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!
I'm being ass-napped!
Animal cruelty! Help!
You need to calm down!
I'm your friend.
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
Good. I'm gonna letgo...
...right... now.
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!
Donkey! You've got to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...
Because...
OK.
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?
I've never seen an ogre cry.
I'm not crying.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.
Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, or a little baby grandma kitten.
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.
It's none of my business why you're upset.
By the way, why are you upset?
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.
You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?
No. I signed this.
You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!
Yeah, I got that.
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.
Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I've read the fine print.
There's nothing about an exit clause in here.
Well, you didn't expect him to make it easy for you.
Here, letme show you how it's done.
I didn't spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks.
Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn't begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.
What are you doing?
Hey, I can't get my origami on unless you back off.
Thank you. OK, here's what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do. There!
"Try Lou's Bliss."
Who's Lou?
Give me that!
"True Love's Kiss."
You have to take me to dinner first.
"According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love's kiss will render this contract null and void."
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?
Well, that's just it, you see.
I don't know.
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.
So... where did you leave her last?
The last time I saw her,
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!
They keep dragons in there!
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!
I'm gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!
Fiona!
Oh, no.
If I didn't save Fiona...
...then who did?
This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.
Now smell it!
Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling.
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog, not Donkey!
And another thing...
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.
Luscious and tasty.
Hey! That's my wife you're talking about.
Donkey!
Yeah! Waffles!
And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story.
Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!
Donkey! Don't eat that!
There's a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest.
Don't you find that a wee bit suspicious?
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.
You did.
Look out!
Donkey!
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Donkey.
Help! Help me!
Help, Shrek! Help!
Watch your head.
Hey, it's a new guy!
Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.
He's really tiny, isn't he?
Yeah. Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Hey!
- Here you go.
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?
We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!
I didn't know we could do that.
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.
Trust me, you don't want to eat this one.
I go down smooth, but come out fighting!
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.
Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!
- She's back.
- There she is.
Fiona!
I'm so happy I found you!
Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me.
You don't know who I am, do you?
No.
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.
Gather the others and meet me in the war room.
Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
OK, I know you don't remember me, but...
...we're married. Hear me out.
And at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."
Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Right? Who's with me?
I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.
Fiona, I need to...
Witches! AII right, everyone, you know the drill!
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.
Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!
Some people like to look at the goblet as... as half empty.
Me, I like to look at it as half full.
We've gone from the bottom to the top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We're a family.
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?
Good.
Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres.
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Except... funny thing.
Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek!
And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it is the end of the world! Our world!
My empire!
But, as I was saying,
I like to look at the goblet as half full.
Yelling makes me so parched.
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...
...of agua purificada?
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?
Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it's going to take to get this ogre? You.
Faster brooms?
- No!
- Pointier hats?
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?
What a world! What a world!
You know, actually not a bad idea. Baba!
I need a bounty hunter.
And if music doth soothe the savage beast...
...then I think I might know just the person!
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.
Stiltskin is leading tonight's ogre hunt himself.
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?
I bet that's because of us.
If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest...
...he'll be vulnerable.
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route, they'll reach the river by midnight.
We'll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan.
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.
And then we attack!
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?
That's my chimichanga stand.
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, OK?
Go and finish your little speech.
AII right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears,
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten.
Far Far Away will finally be free.
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.
How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?
Actually, I was talking about the revolution.
Revolution?
Why don't you just tell her what you told me?
About how you're her true love and you came from an alternate universe.
Well, while I'm at it, why don't I tell her that you're married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.
I do?!
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
I'm a daddy?
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...
...then I can do it again.
Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?
Donkey...!
Hello?
Fiona?
You should not be here, señor.
Puss?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Feed me, if you dare.
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...
-...fancy.
- Do I know you?
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?
Your wee little boots?
Boots? For a cat? Ha!
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once.
But that is a name I have outgrown.
That's not the only thing you've outgrown.
Hey! I may have letmyself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life.
I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.
I'll get him later.
Puss, what have I done to you?
You've gone soft.
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.
Look, it's not too late to fix it.
AII you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?
Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be...
...rallying the troops, planning attacks, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension.
A gift basket?
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.
Heart-shaped box of slugs.
Skunk-scented candle.
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.
Look, I don't know what this is all about, but I'm trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,
I suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself useful!
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
An apologetic hug?
And a quick kiss goodbye.
Hey!
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?
Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?
I am.
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.
Honk.
AII right, Piggies, be gone!
Don't forget to take her little potty box with you.
This little piggy wants to go home!
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Good.
You call this guy a bounty hunter?
What's he gonna do, flute those ogres a lullaby?
OK, got it!
Make it stop!
AII right, that's enough.
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.
Griselda, seriously, it's time to pay the piper.
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!
Things are getting real sloppy around here!
Here, now make sure they eat up!
You can't end tyranny on an empty stomach! Go on! Go!
Din-din!
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?
AII right, but this is the last time.
Here it comes. Look at him.
I see you!
That's quite a friend you've got there.
I can see why you haven't eaten him.
Donkey! I hate to pull you away from your adoring public, but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.
Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.
That's a good one, Cookie!
Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain't gonna work on her.
Works on me.
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.
- To the cause!
- To the cause!
AII right!
Hello!
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational... op.
This one taken?
We use that to clean the toilets.
And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.
I knew that.
There you go, chief.
Hey... Scott?
My name is Shrek, actually.
You're going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...
Well, let's see about that.
Hey! Hey... Hey!
What the...?
Fiona?
I got it.
Give me your hand.
The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...
Into the castle.
Wow.
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!
AII right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed!
Preparation is half the battle!
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!
Ogre, ogre, un momento!
Just give me a minute.
Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.
I am not believing what I have just witnessed.
Back there, you and Fiona.
There was a spark... a spark inside her heart
I thought was long extinguished.
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!
I am her true love. I ended her curse.
You know of her curse?
By day, one way, by night another.
This shall be the norm.
Until you find true love's first kiss...
...and then take love's true form.
You even know the little rhyme!
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!
- How?
- Convince her!
Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know.
Know about what?!
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?
Excuse me. Coming through!
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.
Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick!
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!
And you are ri-donkey-lous!
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.
Secure your positions!
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!
Get back in position!
You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.
You are going to ruin everything!
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
How do you know about my curse?!
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.
I can explain everything.
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.
Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.
I know everything about you.
I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?
I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.
I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes...
...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.
But, most importantly, Fiona...
...I know that the reason you turn human every day...
...is because you've never been kissed...
...well...
...by me.
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!
No, I can't stop myself!
Please! Make it stop!
I can't control myself!
Yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!
Oh, no! It's the Piper!
I can't believe I letthis happen, and it's all because of you!
- If you'd just letme kiss you!
- What? You're insane!
We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!
Then it's up to me!
Hurry! We must get them away from the music!
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?
Say what?!
No. Hell...
I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.
AII right!
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.
Puss, say something.
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
That's how you knew so much about me.
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?
It's the only way to save your friends.
Get out of my way.
You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss was supposed to fix everything!
Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too.
True love didn't get me out of that tower.
I did. I saved myself.
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!
How would you know?
Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep?
Did you live all alone in a miserable tower?
Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!
But... But I'm your true love.
Then where were you when I needed you?
Maybe you kissed her wrong?
No.
The kiss didn't work...
...because Fiona doesn't love me.
Don't despair, fellow ogres!
They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!
Shrek and Fiona are together?!
Yeah, I've heard enough of your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!
Wolfie! My speech wig.
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.
Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...
...shepherd of your dreams.
Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.
And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!
That is why I come to you, dear citizens.
For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.
Just think of it! Total and
- complete happiness.
- Ya!
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
AII your greatest wishes.
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.
So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Go back where you came from!
It seems that we are safe.
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There's no day after that, and there's no day after that day after that!
My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!
If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?
Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! AII right?
I didn't know what I had.
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!
Gingy?
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?
Collecting my bounty!
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?
Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?
Where all your wishes come true.
Wait a minute.
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
Were you going to eat that?
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
AIso not Shrek.
That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try.
- And that...
- Roar.
...is just sad.
And what is that supposed to be?
I'm just a frightened old man.
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!
That is your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek! Honest!
Take them away!
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!
Stiltskin!
I hear you're looking for me.
AII right! Finally!
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?
- I do.
- What? But...
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.
That means you have to give me anything I want.
No! Only true love's kiss can break your contract!
So if you thought you were just gonna...
-...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.
Then what do you want?
The ogres. They are all free.
But where is Shrek?
This is not good.
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.
The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.
AII that matters is that they're free...
...and Fiona is safe.
I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that.
But, hey...
...I guess you can tell her yourself.
Fiona!
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!
Oh, yeah.
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.
Nobody's smart but me!
That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek.
Thank you.
No, you were right.
I wasn't there for you.
And not just at the Dragon's Keep, but...
...every day since.
Well...
...you're here now.
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!
Don't be a fool, mule!
She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter
- than OId Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.
Hey! We can hear you!
Sorry!
We must get into the palace.
Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!
But how?
The same way we're gonna bust in.
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?
I guess it'll have to do.
Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past behind us once and for all,
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!
Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...
...Dragon!
- Donkey?
- And Puss!
In Boots!
Get them, get them, witches!
Incoming!
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?
Your wife!
Uh-oh.
I'll call you! We're in love!
Fiona, hold on!
Hey, you!
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!
Jump!
Now!
The dragon goes under the bridge!
Through the loop!
And finally...
Into the castle!
Run!
Foo!
So long!
Come on, Fifi, go!
Go! Witches, close up the floor!
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!
Come on, go! FIy away! Up, up! Go!
Fifi, no!
Victory is ours!
Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
You have no idea.
Shrek?
His day is up. His day is...!
Shrek?
It's all right.
There has to be something I can do.
You've already done everything for me, Fiona.
You gave me a home and a family.
You have kids?
We have kids.
Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...
-...Felicia.
- Felicia.
I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.
And someday...
...you will.
You know what the best part of today was?
I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.
Fiona, the sunrise!
You're still... an ogre!
- True love's form.
- Impossible!
The kiss worked.
What?!
Fifi!
Puss!
No, no, no!
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!
I love you, Daddy!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona. I've never been better.
Roar!
Happy Birthday, Farkle.
Fergus, my little man!
And Felicia, sweetheart.
I believe this is yours.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!
Please, señor, letus have it!
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.
You did.
No. It was you that rescued me.
Yummy!
English .srt Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
This is Berk.
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a few degrees south of freezing to death.
It's located solidly on the meridian of misery.
My village. In a word, sturdy.
It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new.
We have fishing, hunting and a charming view of the sunsets.
The only problems are the pests.
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.
We have...
...dragons.
Most people would leave. Not us.
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.
My name is Hiccup.
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls.
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
Morning!
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!
That's Stoick the Vast, chief of the tribe.
When he was a baby, he popped a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.
What have we got?
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.
Good.
Hoist the torches!
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.
They wouldn't know what to do with all this.
They need toothpicks, don't they?
The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber.
I've been his apprentice since I was little. Well, littler.
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.
Hurry! 
See? Old village, lots and lots of new houses.
Fire!
Let's go!
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...
...and...
...Astrid.
Their job is so much cooler.
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.
You've made plenty of marks, all in the wrong places.
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.
You can't even throw one of these!
OK, fine, but this will throw it for me.
See? Now this right here is what I'm talking about!
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!
If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons...
...you need to stop all this.
But you just pointed to all of me.
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.
Oh, yes.
You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.
Keeping this much raw Vikingness contained?
There will be consequences!
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...
...is everything around here.
A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed.
Gronckles are tough.
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.
A Zippleback?
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.
They found the sheep!
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.
- Hurry up!
- Fire!
And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.
Only the best Vikings go after those.
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.
Reload! I'll take care of this.
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!
Get down!
Jump!
This thing never steals food, never shows itself and...
...never misses.
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.
Stay. Put. There.
You know what I mean.
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!
Let's get him!
Mind yourselves!
The devils still have some juice in them!
Come on. Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!
Did anybody see that?
Except for you.
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!
You're all out.
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know.
Sorry, Dad.
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...
Stop!
Just stop.
Every time you step outside, disaster follows.
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding.
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just kill it.
It's who I am, Dad.
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.
I have his mess to clean up.
Quite the performance.
I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped.
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.
When he does, it's with this disappointed scowl, like someone skimped on meat in his sandwich.
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side.
This here, this is a talking fishbone."
You're thinking about this wrong.
It's not so much what you look like, it's what's inside that he can't stand.
Thank you for summing that up.
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.
I just want to be one of you guys.
Either we finish them or they'll finish us!
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!
One more search before the ice sets in.
Those ships never come back.
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me?!
Count me out.
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.
All right. Those who stay will look after Hiccup.
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!
That's more like it.
I'll pack my undies.
No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits.
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades, lots of time to himself.
What could possibly go wrong?
What am I going to do with him, Gobber?
Put him in training.
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.
He'd be killed before the first dragon is out of its cage.
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.
No, you don't.
Listen, you know what he's like.
From the time he could crawl, he's been... different.
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for trolls!
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.
But only the left ones.
What's with that?
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.
...my father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it.
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.
That rock split in two.
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas!
Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become.
Hiccup is not that boy.
You can't stop him, Stoick.
You can only prepare him.
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't always be around to protect him.
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.
Oh, the gods hate me.
Some people lose their knife or their mug. Not me.
I manage to lose an entire dragon.
Oh, wow. I did it.
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!
I have brought down this mighty beast!
I'm going to kill you, dragon.
Then I'll cut out your heart and take it to my father.
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!
I did this.
Hiccup.
Dad...
...I have to talk to you, Dad.
I need to speak with you, too, son.
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.
- What?
- What?
- You go first.
- No, you go first.
All right.
You get your wish. Dragon training... you start in the morning.
Oh, man, I should have gone first.
I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?
You'll need this.
I don't want to fight dragons.
Come on. Yes, you do.
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.
But you will kill dragons.
No, I'm really very extra-sure that I won't.
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?
This is serious, son.
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.
Which means you walk like us, you talk like us...
...you think like us.
No more of... this.
You just gestured to all of me.
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.
Deal?
Deal.
Good.
Train hard.
I'll be back. Probably.
And I'll be here.
Maybe.
Welcome to dragon training!
No turning back.
I hope I get some serious burns.
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or back.
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
Yeah, no kidding, right?
Pain. Love it.
Oh, great. Who let him in?
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?
Don't worry. You're small and weak... that'll make you less of a target.
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.
Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight!
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.
The Hideous Zippleback.
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.
Can you stop that?!
And the Gronckle.
Jaw strength 8.
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?
I believe in learning on the job.
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...
...you're dead!
What's the first thing you'll need?
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield!
If you must choose between a sword or a shield, take the shield!
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!
Take that one. It has a flower... girls like flowers.
Oops, this one has blood on it.
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?
Shields are good for another thing.
Noise! Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim!
All dragons have a limited number of shots.
How many does a Gronckle have?
- Five?
- No, six!
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!
Fishlegs, out!
Hiccup, get in there!
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.
You look like you work out.
Snotlout! You're done!
So it's just you and me, huh?
Nope, just you.
One shot left!
Hiccup!
And that's six.
Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!
You'll get another chance, don't you worry.
Remember, a dragon will always, always go for the kill.
So... why didn't you?
This was stupid.
Why don't you just fly away?
All right, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.
Where did Hiccup go wrong?
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.
He's never where he should be.
Thank you, Astrid.
You need to live and breathe this stuff. The dragon manual.
Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
No attacks tonight. Study up.
Wait, you mean read?
While we're still alive?
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one...
Yeah. That sounds great.
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.
Another one has spines like trees.
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...
...tomorrow.
Dragon classifications.

Fear class. Mystery class.
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous.
Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.
Night Fury.
Speed unknown. Size unknown.
The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
Never engage this dragon.
Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you.
I can almost smell them.
They're close.
Steady.
Take us in.
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.
Hard to port!
Steady!
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies.
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!
Today it's all about attack!
Nadders are quick and light on their feet.
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods!
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.
Find it, hide in it and strike!
Do you ever bathe?
If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.
How about I give you one?
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.
Hey, so, how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
No one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Get in there!
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!
Get down.
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
What do you want me to do, block out the sun?
I could do that but I don't have time!
They probably...
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.
Has anyone ever seen one napping?
Hiccup!
Love on the battlefield.
She could do better.
Let me... Why don't you?
Well done, Astrid.
Is this some kind of a joke to you?
Our parents' war is about to become ours.
Figure out which side you're on.
Toothless.
I could have sworn you had...
...teeth.
No, no, no.
I don't have any more!
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole!
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg.
Isn't it weird to think your hand was inside a dragon?
Like if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from inside by crushing his heart.
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.
It's the wings and the tails you really want.
If it can't fly, it can't get away.
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.
Tomorrow we get to the big boys, slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare.
But who'll win the honor of killing it?
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?
Your mom let you get a tattoo?
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.
OK, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me from the left side.
Hey, Toothless.
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.
OK, that's disgusting.
We've got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod...
...and a whole smoked eel.
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.
Yeah, I don't really like eel much, either.
That's it.
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.
It's OK.
OK.
That's not too bad. It works.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my! It's working!
Yes, yes! I did it!
Yeah!
Today is about teamwork.
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.
One head breathes gas, the other head lights it.
Your job is to know which is which.
Razor-sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion.
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims...
Will you please stop that?!
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...
There!
Hey, it's us, idiots!
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.
Not that there's anything wrong with a dragonesque figure.
Wait.
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Chances of survival are dwindling to single digits now.
Wrong head.
Fishlegs!
Now, Hiccup!
Oh, come on.
Hiccup!
Back, back, back!
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got some things I need to...
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.
Meet the Terrible Terror.
It's like the size of my...
Get it off!
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Wow! He's better than you ever were.
Oh, great.
Hiccup.
Hiccup? Are you in there?
Astrid. Hey.
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.
Well, weirder.
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.
Excellent.
I hope you had more success than me.
Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over, yes.
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!
Out with the old and in with the new, right?
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!
- Come over here.
- Hurry!
He's gone?
Most afternoons, but who can blame him? The life of a celebrity's rough.
He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.
Hiccup?
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.
Here we go. Here we go. Position...
...three... no, four.
All right, it's go time. It's go time.
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!
Yes, it worked!
Sorry!
It was my fault.
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.
Three.
Yeah! Go, baby!
Yes!
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!
Stop!
No!
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!
All right, OK, you've gotta kind of angle yourself.
OK, no, no, no. Come back down towards me! Come back down...
Yeah!
Come on.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?
Here you go.
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...
I know.
- I came looking for you.
- You did?
You've been keeping secrets.
I have?
Just how long did you think you could hide it?
I don't know what you're...
Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
So...
...let's talk...
...about that dragon.
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.
I just didn't know how to...
You're not upset?
What?! I was hoping for this!
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!
Wait till you spill a Nadder's guts the first time!
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.
And all the while you were holding out on me!
Oh, Thor Almighty!
With you doing so well in the ring...
...we finally have something to talk about.
Here, I brought you something, to keep you safe in the ring.
Wow. Thanks.
Your mother would have wanted you to have it. It's half of her breastplate.
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.
Thanks for stopping by...
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.
Well... Yep. Good night.
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.
Please, by all means.
This time, this time for sure!
No! No, son of a half-troll,
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.
- So, later.
- Not so fast.
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!
Late for what, exactly?
Quiet down! The elder has decided.
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!
That's my boy!
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...
...leaving! We're leaving.
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.
Forever.
Oh, man.
What the?!
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on.
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?
Training?
It better not involve this.
I know this looks really bad, but you see...
You're right. You're right.
You're right.
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.
Why would you do that?!
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.
Oh, man.
Get down!
Run, run!
It's OK! It's OK.
She's a friend.
You just scared him.
I scared him?!
Who is "him"?
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.
We're dead.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!
Hiccup, get me down from here!
You have to give me a chance to explain.
I am not listening to anything you have to say!
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.
Please, Astrid.
Now get me down.
Toothless, down. Gently.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.
Toothless!
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!
And now the spinning.
Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile.
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.
Just get me off of this thing.
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.
It's amazing.
He's amazing.
So what now?
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.
You know you'll have to kill...
...kill a dragon.
Don't remind me.
Toothless, what's happening?
What is it?
Get down!
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.
What does that make us?
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.
It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
They're not eating any of it.
What is that?
All right, bud, we got to get out of here... now!
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.
They're the workers and that's their queen.
It controls them. Let's find your dad.
No! No.
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.
We have to think this through carefully.
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest, the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here, and you want to keep it a secret?
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?
Yes.
OK. Then what do we do?
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.
OK.
That's for kidnapping me.
That's for everything else.
What are you looking at?
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I can show my face in public again!
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks
Hiccup would go from, well, being Hiccup to placing first in dragon training, well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad!
And you know it!
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised or more proud than I am.
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.
Today, he becomes one of us!
Be careful with that dragon.
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?
Put an end to this. I have to try.
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.
I will. Just promise me it won't go wrong.
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I would have gone for the hammer.
I'm ready.
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!
What is he doing?
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
I'm not one of them.
What's he thinking?
- Stop the fight.
- No!
I need you all to see this.
They're not what we think they are.
We don't have to kill them.
I said, stop the fight!
Out of my way!
Hiccup!
This way!
Night Fury!
Toothless, go. Get out of here.
Go, go!
Stoick, no!
Dad, he won't hurt you!
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!
Toothless, stop!
No! No!
Get him!
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him.
Put it with the others.
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.
- Dad?
- We had a deal!
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.
So everything in the ring, a trick? A lie?
I screwed up. I should have told you before now. I just...
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?
Not the people you almost killed?
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.
They've killed hundreds of us!
And we've killed thousands of them!
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.
There's something else on their island. It's a dragon like...
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.
Only a dragon can find the island.
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.
Dad, please. I promise you, you can't win this one!
No, Dad. No.
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me?!
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.
You're not my son.
Ready the ships!
This way.
Set sail!
We head for Helheim's Gate.
Lead us home, devil.
It's a mess.
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:
Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
Thank you for summing that up.
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods?
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.
So why didn't you?
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
Because I want to remember what you say right now.
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
You said "wouldn't".
Whatever! I wouldn't!
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.
First one to ride one, though.
So?
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.
I looked at him and I saw myself.
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.
Then something crazy.
That's more like it.
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.
- Here!
- One length to your stern.
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here. Not me, of course.
I know you're always the man with the plan. But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.
Of course. Send them running.
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.
Step aside.
Bear to port.
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.
It's me.
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...
You're crazy. I like that.
So, what is the plan?
That's not really encouraging.
I was wondering where that went.
Stay low and ready your weapons.
We're here.
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.
It's OK. It's OK.
Where are you going?
You'll need something to help you hold on.
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose.
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.
No matter how this ends, it ends today.
Is that it?
We've done it!
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!
Get clear!
Beard of Thor! What is that?!
Odin help us.
Catapults!
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.
Lead the men to the far side of the island!
Gobber, go with the men!
I think I'll stay, in case your thinking of doing something crazy.
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt!
Then I can double that time.
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!
Come on! Fight me!
No, me!
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!
Move, Fishlegs!
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!
Up! Let's move it!
Every bit the boar-headed stubborn Viking you ever were!
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing!
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot, make noise, keep it confused!
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!
That's my specialty!
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!
- Troll!
- Butt elf!
Bride of Grendel!
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!
There!
Go help the others!
OK, hold on. Hold on.
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!
I'm OK!
Less OK!
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?
Yeah! You're the Viking!
Dad?
You got it, bud.
Hiccup!
I'm sorry... for everything.
Yeah. Me, too.
You don't have to go up there.
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Thanks, Dad.
He's up!
Get Snotlout out of there.
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.
No, this way.
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!
I can't believe that worked!
Night Fury!
Get down!
Did you get her?
Go.
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!
You think that did it?
Well, he can fly.
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.
Come on, bud!
Here it comes!
Watch out!
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.
Hold, Toothless.
Now!
No.
No!
Hiccup!
Son!
Hiccup.
Oh, son.
I did this.
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.
Hiccup!
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.
Thank you for saving my son.
Well, you know... most of him.
Hey, Toothless.
I'm happy to see you, too.
I'm in my house.
You're in my house.
Does my dad know you're here?
What? OK, OK.
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.
Toothless! Oh, come on.
OK. Thanks, bud.
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!
Hold on tight! Here we go!
What?
I knew it. I'm dead.
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!
It's Hiccup!
Turns out all we needed was a little more of this.
You just gestured to all of me.
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?
I might make a few tweaks.
That's for scaring me.
What is it always going to be this way? 'Cause...
...I could get used to it.
Welcome home.
- Night Fury!
- Get down!
You ready?
This is Berk.
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.
The people that grow here are even more so.
The only upsides are the pets.
While other places have ponies or parrots...
...we have...
...dragons.

Special 1-1-8-3.
Hello, Elena.
How are you today, hmm?
How are you feeling?
Have you had... any headaches?
You can tell me.
Your readings are relatively stable.
Very good.
That's very, very good.
You know, this is always the highlight of my day.
Rosemary.
Rosemary.
Oh.
Barry.
I didn't hear you come in.
Been sleeping long?
No...
Um...
- I wasn't sleeping.
- Hmm.
I was... meditating.
Oh, you were meditating, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
If you're hungry, there's some brown rice and steamed asparagus in the refrigerator.
Wow, that sounds really good.
No, I'm not hungry... thank you.
Okay.
It's been a long day.
So, um,
I'm just going to hit the hay early.
Okay.
Good night, Barry.
Good night, Rosemary.
Night Mode.
Rest peacefully and reflect.
Aah-ah-ah!
I am so sorry that you were never able to meet your mother.
She was a very beautiful woman.
She was a very desirable woman.
Oh...
Hey, would you, uh... would you like to have a photo of her?
Would you like that?
Because you may just find one in your room, hmm.
You know, you are looking more and more like your mother every day.
You look tired today.
It's easy to become disillusioned when you don't know who you are... or what you are.
I know who I am.
That's what gives me my confidence... and my power.
And I know who you are, too, Elena.
I can guide you towards that achievement... to find your inner strength and your inner power.
We all have other forms... and your inner self... needs another to complete it.
I... can help you do that.
Oh...
You just... have to let me...
I... want... to see... my... father.
Oh.
Please.
Oh, Elena. Elena, Elena, Elena.
Elena, you know you can't.
You're a very sick girl, Elena.
You're not well.
This... world... is in chaos, Elena.
These are... times of, uh, great uncertainty and terrible danger.
And you are not ready.
You're just not well.
Don't worry, Elena, you'll see him again one day.
I promise.
Piece of shit.
What?
Rosemary.
Yeah.
We do have a system in place.
Yes, a comprehensive list has been compiled.
Mm-hmm. I see.
That's fine.
Rosemary, why don't you answer the fucking phone?
Margo.
Yes, Dr. Nyle?
It's come to my... attention, Margo...
Yes, Dr. Nyle?
It's come to my attention that...
Elena may be hiding an illicit object from us.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
So...
Keep your eyes peeled.
Yes, Dr. Nyle, I certainly will.
Good.
Very good.
Oh, Dr. Nyle?
Yeah.
Uh, how do you think she would have come into possession of the object?
I don't know, Margo.
I don't know.
But I'm looking into it.
Day Mode.
Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow.
Good morning.
Hope you're hungry.
Looks better than usual today.
What have you got there, a special picture?
Let me see.
Oh, come on, I'm just curious.
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?
Who is this?
Is it your mother?
Where is she?
Did she die?
Good.
Enjoy your dinner.
Stop.
Please stop.
Mercurio.
Are you awake?
Dr. Arboria.
Barry?
B-Barry, is that you, my friend?
Yes, Dr. Arboria, it's me.
Ah, oh...
Wonderful.
Come closer so I can see you.
It's wonderful to see you again.
You're looking well, my friend.
Thank you, Dr. Arboria.
So are you.
Oh, Barry, there's... no need to flatter an old man.
I know I-I've... seen better days.
Besides... the trappings of the mortal world are... but a distraction, wouldn't you say?
Of course, Dr. Arboria.
Yes.
What really matters... the part of ourselves we must nurture the most... is here.
I couldn't agree more.
Would you mind... assisting me?
Of course, Dr. Arboria.
Aren't these videos of the nature, ha, beautiful, Barry?
They make me remember a simpler time.
Yes, Dr. Arboria.
Me too.
You are about to embark on a great journey.
Are you ready, my friend?
I am ready.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Bring home the mother lode, Barry,
Barry, Barry, Barry.
Your mother's reabsorption into the cycle of life won't be for nothing, my darling Elena.
You will be the dawning of a new era for the human race and the human soul.
Let the new age of enlightenment begin.
No, Barry,
I don't like to see the... on my arm.
Of course.
How is my darling Elena?
Well, Dr. Arboria.
She's very well.
That's wonderful.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Yes, yes.
Oh, that's wonderful, Barry.
Yes.
That's so... wonderful.
Isn't it... beautiful?
Yes.
It is.
The dormant volcano,
Haleakala Crater.
Mark Tain described sunrise here as "the sublimest spectacle
I have ever witnessed."
To the west of Maui lies Molokai.
Except for a few beautiful resort hotels, the modern world has touched Molokai less than any of the other vacation islands.
Aloha means welcome.
It also means love... and all too soon... farewell.
Rocket launchers, while the Soviets have produced more than 13,000, a staggering 14-to-1 ratio.
They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability, and they haven't stopped now.
But today they're building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own.
As the Soviets have increased their military power, they've been emboldened to extend that power.
They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies.
The following aerial photographs, most of them secret until now, illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home...
The Devil's Teardrop.
Barry?
Barry!
Oh.
Barry, you startled me.
I thought you were an intruder.
What are you doing?
Barry, you're not wearing your appliances.
I don't want to wear them any more.
But...
It's just you haven't let me see you... without them in a long time.
Where did you get that outfit?
Has something happened?
Sometimes...
Sometimes I... l forget... how hard it is for you.
I'm sorry.
I...
I...I should have been there for you more.
Barry?
Are... Are you okay?
I...I'm not...
I'm... I'm not... I'm not okay.
I went to another world, Rosemary.
I see what others cannot see.
Please.
I looked into the eye of the god.
It looked right back through me.
It looked through everything.
Rosemary, it was so, so, so beautiful.
Like a black rainbow... and it chose me.
It chose to reveal itself to me.
You're nothing.
You're less than nothing.
Just... spit in the wind.
Let go of me.
I'm not going to let you go.
I'm going to set you free.
Elena...
Elena?
Elena?!
You are doing so good.
Julie comes walking up, and, um... like, I can tell just by looking at her she totally, fuckin', she totally wants to pork me.
Oh, you're so full of shit.
What would she want with that two-inch little blood bat?
Fuck, my left ball hurts a little.
I gotta take a leak.
Thanks for telling me.
Get bent, you fat fuck!
Ohh...
What the fuck?
Yo!
Yo?
Where is she?
I don't know.
I don't...
I don't know.
I don't know.
You fucked her.
No, I...
No...
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't fuck...
You fucked her.
No, I didn't! I didn't.
You fucked her.
No...
No...
You fucked her.
No, no!
Shut up!
You look so beautiful when you sleep.
Sweet, sweet Elena.
Well, I found you.
It's okay.
Come to me, okay?
Elena, come on.
Come here.
Come on.
Elena, come to me.
Elena?
Elena.
Come to me.
Come.
Come to me.
Come to me!

Charles, you have finally lost your senses.
This venture is impossible.
For some. Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
That kind of thinking could ruin you.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Imagine trading posts in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...
The nightmare again?
I won't be long.
I'm falling down a dark hole, then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
Well, there's a dodo bird, a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.
I didn't know cats could smile.
(SIGHING) Neither did I.
And there's a blue caterpillar.
Blue caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.
But if you get too frightened, you can always wake up. Like this.
(LAUGHING) Ow!
Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
What if it was agreed that "proper" was wearing a codfish on your head?
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.
To me, a corset is like a codfish.
Please, not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
It's always the same, ever since I can remember.
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There. You're beautiful.
Now, can you manage a smile?
At last. We thought you'd never arrive.
Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you. Go.
You do realize it's well past 4:00.
Now everything will have to be rushed through.
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!
Forgive my wife. She's been planning this affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here...
My condolences.
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes.
Of course not. I'm pleased that you purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance.
Charles thought so, too.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC
CONTINUES PLAYING)
Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.
Do I amuse you?
No.
I had a sudden vision of all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses.
I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself.
When in doubt, remain silent.
Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.
Where's your head?
I was wondering what it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking about such an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast.
(SOFTLY) Come along.
Alice, meet me under the gazebo in precisely 10 minutes.
We have a secret to tell you.
If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret.
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.
But now you've brought it up, you have to.
- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.
I wonder if your mother knows that you two swim naked in the Havershims' pond.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.
There's your mother right now.
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.
You've ruined the surprise!
I could strangle them!
Everyone went to so much effort to keep the secret.
Does everyone know?
It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...
But I don't know if I want to marry Hamish.
Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.
You don't want to end up like Aunt Imogene.
And you don't want to be a burden on Mother, do you?
No.
So you'll marry Hamish.
You will be as happy as I am with Lowell, and your life will be perfect.
It's already decided.
Alice, dear.
I'll leave you to it.
Shall we take a leisurely stroll through the garden, just you and me?
Do you know what I've always dreaded?
The decline of the aristocracy?
Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.
You're bound to produce little... Imbeciles!
The gardeners have planted white roses when I specifically asked for red.
You could always paint the roses red.
What an odd thing to say.
You should know that my son has extremely delicate digestion.
- Did you see that?
- See what?
- It was a rabbit, I think.
- Nasty things.
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods, he could get a blockage.
Did you see it that time?
- See what?
- The rabbit.
Don't shout.
Now, pay attention.
Hamish said you were easily distracted.
- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.
I couldn't be more interested, but you'll have to excuse me.
Aunt Imogene.
I think I'm going mad.
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.
I can't be bothered with your fancy rabbit now.
I'm waiting for my fiancé.
- You have a fiancé?
- Hmm.
There! Did you see it?
He's a prince.
But, alas, he cannot marry me unless he renounces his throne.
It's tragic, isn't it?
Very.
Lowell?
Alice. We were just...
Hattie's an old friend.
I can see you're very close.
Look, you won't mention this to your sister, will you?
I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.
Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.
You don't want to ruin her marriage, do you?
Me?
But I'm not the one who's sneaking around behind her back.
There you are.
Alice Kingsleigh...
Hamish.
What is it?
You have a caterpillar on your shoulder.
Ew.
Don't hurt it.
You'll want to wash that finger.
Alice Kingsleigh, will you be my wife?
Well, everyone expects me to, and you're a lord.
My face won't last, and I don't want to end up like...
But this is happening so quickly. I...
I think I...
I think I...
I need a moment.
Hello.
It's only a dream.
DODO: You'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
MALLY: You've brought the wrong Alice.
McTWISP: No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
MALLY: She's the wrong Alice.
McTWISP: Give her a chance.
Curiouser and curiouser.
I told you she's the right Alice.
I am not convinced.
McTWISP: How is that for gratitude?
I've been up there for weeks, trailing one Alice after the next, and I was almost eaten by other animals.
Can you imagine?
They go about entirely unclothed, and they do their shukm in public.
- I had to avert my eyes.
- Doesn't look anything like herself.
That's because she's the wrong Alice.
- lf she was, she might be.
- lf she isn't, she ain't.
- But if she were so, she would be.
- But she isn't, nohow.
How can I be the wrong Alice when this is my dream?
And who are you, if I might ask?
Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee.
We should consult Absolem.
Exactly. Absolem will know who she is.
- I'll escort you.
- Hey, it's not being your turn.
So unfair.
- Hey, leave off!
- Let go!
- Are they always this way?
- Family trait.
You can both escort her.
- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's absolute.
He's Absolem.
Who are you?
Absolem?
You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is, who are you?
(COUGHING) Alice.
We shall see.
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.
Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.
The Oraculum, being a calendrical compendium of Underland.
- It's a calendar.
- ABSOLEM: Compendium.
It tells of each and every day since the Beginning.
Today is Griblig Day in the time of the Red Queen.
Show her the Frabjous Day.
Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the day you slay the Jabberwocky.
Sorry? Slay a what?
Oh, yeah. That being you, there, with the Vorpal sword.
No other swords can kill the Jabberwocky, nohow.
If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.
That's not me!
I know!
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?
Not hardly.
- I told you.
- McTWISP: Oh, dear.
- I said so.
- I said so.
TWEEDLEDUM: Contrariwise, you said she might be.
No, you said she would be if she was.
(SCOFFING) Little impostor. Pretending to be Alice. She should be ashamed.
I was so certain of you.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be the wrong Alice.
Wait, this is my dream.
I'm going to wake up now and you'll all disappear.
That's odd.
Pinching usually does the trick.
I could stick you, if that would help.
- It might, actually. Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Ow!
- Bandersnatch!
- Bandersnatch!
Wait.
It's only a dream. Nothing can hurt me.
What's she doing?
Can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.
Run, you great lug!
This way, east to Queast.
No, south to Snud.
No. No, no. This way.
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.
- Did you?
- No, Your Majesty.
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.
(WHISPERING) Did you steal my tarts?
No, Your Majesty.
(WHISPERING) Squimberry juice.
- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to!
- Off with his head!
My family! Oh, please, please don't!
No! I have little ones to look after!
Go to his house and collect the little ones.
I love tadpoles on toast almost as much as I love caviar.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Drink!
Majesty?
Ilosovic Stayne, you knave, where have you been lurking?
Majesty, I have found the Oraculum.
That? Looks so ordinary for an oracle.
Look here, on the Frabjous Day.
I'd know that tangled mess of hair anywhere.
Is it Alice?
I believe it is.
What's she doing with my darling Jabberwocky?
She appears to be slaying it.
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?
Not yet, but it will happen if we don't stop her.
Find Alice, Stayne. Find her!
Find the scent of human girl and earn your freedom.
For my wife and pups, as well?
Everyone will go home.
Dogs will believe anything.
It looks like you ran afoul of something with wicked claws.
And I'm still dreaming.
What did that to you?
- Banner or Bander...
- The Bandersnatch?
Well, I'd better have a look.
What are you doing?
It needs to be purified by someone with evaporating skills, or it will fester and putrefy.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.
At least let me bind it for you.
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.
The Alice?
- There's been some debate about that.
- I never get involved in politics.
You'd best be on your way.
What way? All I want to do is wake up from this dream.
Fine.
Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.
Coming?
Watch what you're doing!
Hey, watch it!
Okay, okay. All right.
It's you.
No, it's not.
McTwisp brought us the wrong Alice.
It's the wrong Alice!
It's absolutely Alice.
You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.
I'd know him anywhere.
HATTER: Well, as you can see, we're still having tea.
And it's all because I was obliged to kill Time waiting for your return.
You're terribly late, you know. Naughty.
Well, anyway, Time became quite offended and stopped altogether.
Not a tick ever since.
- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.
Yes, yes, of course, but now you're back, you see, and we need to get on to the Frabjous Day.
- Frabjous Day!
- Frabjous Day!
I'm investigating things that begin with the letter "M."
(WHISPERING) Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- What?
- Down with the Bloody Big Head, the Bloody Big Head being the Red Queen.
Come, come. We simply must commence with the slaying and such.
Therefore, it is high time to forgive and forget or forget and forgive, whichever comes first or is, in any case, most convenient.
I'm waiting.
(CHUCKLES) Hey.
It's tick-tick... It's ticking again.
All this talk of blood and slaying has put me off my tea.
Ah.
The entire world is falling to ruin and poor Chessur's off his tea.
What happened that day was not my fault.
Oh, dear.
You ran out on them to save your own skin, you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering shukm juggling sluking urpal.
Bar lom muck egg brimni!
Hatter!
- Thank you.
- (EXCLAIMING) Meow.
I'm fine.
What's wrong with you, Tarrant?
You used to be the life of the party.
You used to do the best Futterwacken in all of Witzend.
- Futter what?
- Futterwacken!
It's a dance.
On the Frabjous Day, when the White Queen once again wears the crown, on that day,
I shall Futterwacken vigorously.
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
(GASPING) The Knave.
Goodbye.
MARCH HARE: Hide her!
Drink this quickly.
Quick! Hide her!
Oh, dear.
Aye.
Mind your head.
Let me out!
Well, if it's not my favorite trio of lunatics.
MALLY: Would you like to join us?
You're all late for tea!
We're looking for the girl called Alice.
Speaking of the Queen, here is a little song we used to sing in her honor.
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat
- How I wonder where you're at
- How I wonder where you're at
- up a...
- up a...
If you're hiding her, you'll lose your heads.
(HOARSELY) Already lost them.
All together now!
- up above the world you fly
- up above the world you fly
- Like a tea tray in the sky
- Like a tea tray in the sky
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Oh!
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
Would you like some cream?
- Would you like a slice of Battenberg?
- Follow the bloodhound.
- MALLY: Sugar?
- Yes, please.
- Oh, that's lovely.
- You're all mad.
Thanks very much.
- (CUP SMASHING)
- (ALL LAUGHING)
MALLY: Pass the scones, please.
- MARCH HARE: That one there.
- Oh! Pardon.
MALLY: Yes.
MARCH HARE: Yep, aye.
One moment.
There. Yes.
Try this on for size.
Oh.
I like it.
Good thing the bloodhound is one of us, or you'd be...
What do they want with me?
(EXCLAIMING) Wait a minute, best take her to the White Queen.
She'll be safe there. Spoon...
Your carriage, milady.
- The hat?
- Of course.
Anyone can go by horse or rail, but the absolute best way to travel is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?
(MALLY AND MARCH HARE
LAUGHING)
Oh, I love traveling by hat.
Mally. Just Alice, please.
Fairfarren, all.
What do you mean? Wait. Gae!
"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
"All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe"
Sorry, what was that?
What was what?
"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Jaws that bite and claws that catch!
"'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
And the frumious Bandersnatch! '
"He took his Vorpal sword in hand
The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
"He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back"
It's all about you, you know.
I'm not slaying anything.
I don't slay, so put it out of your mind.
Mind.
Wait! You can't leave me here!
You don't slay.
Do you have any idea what the Red Queen has done?
You don't slay.
I couldn't if I wanted to.
You're not the same as you were before.
You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.
My "muchness"?
In there. Something's missing.
Tell me what Red Queen has done.
It's not a pretty story.
Tell me anyway.
It was here.
I was hatter to the White Queen at the time.
Hightopp clan have always been employed at court.
Hatter? Hatter!
I'm fine.
Are you?
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.
What?
Oh! Red Knights.
Go south to Trotter's Bottom.
The White Queen's castle is just beyond.
Hold on tightly.
Down with the bloody Red Queen!
You were supposed to lead them away!
The Hatter trusted you!
They have my wife and pups.
- What's your name?
- Bayard.
Sit!
Would your name be Alice, by any chance?
Yes, but I'm not the one that everyone's talking about.
The Hatter would not have given himself up just for any Alice.
Where did they take him?
To the Red Queen's castle at Salazen Grum.
We're going to rescue him.
That is not foretold.
I don't care.
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.
You must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.
From the moment
I fell down that rabbit hole,
I've been told what I must do and who I must be.
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and stuffed into a teapot.
I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice, but this is my dream.
I'll decide where it goes from here.
If you diverge from the path...
I make the path.
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard, and don't forget the hat.
There's only one way across.
Lost my muchness, have I?
Bayard! The hat!
Your Majesty.
So sorry.
Splendid shot!
Where's my ball? Page!
Yes, Your Majesty.
(SHUSHING) I want to help you.
Well, if it isn't the wrong Alice.
What brings you here? Mmm?
I've come to rescue the Hatter.
You're not rescuing anyone being the size of a gerbil.
Well, do you have any more of that cake that made me grow before?
Upelkuchen?
Actually, I might have some left.
Not all of it!
Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!
Page!
Oh, dear.
And what is this?
It... It's a "who," Majesty. This is, um...
Um?
From Umbradge.
What happened to your clothes?
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.
So I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like.
My dear girl, anyone with a head that large is welcome in my court.
Someone find her some clothes!
Use the curtains if you must, but clothe this enormous girl.
I need a pig here!
I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet.
- Would you like one, Um?
- No, thank you.
Sit!
Sit!
Go away.
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.
Fat boys!
Oh. There they are.
Aren't they adorable?
They have the oddest way of speaking.
Speak, boys. Amuse us.
Go on.
(MOUTHING) No.
Speak!
- Is that being...
- No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.
Contrariwise, I believe it's so.
No, it ain't so, nohow!
I love my fat boys. Now, get out.
- He did pinch me.
- He did pinch me.
And who is this lovely creature?
Um, my new favorite.
- Well, does she have a name?
- Um.
I believe your name has slipped the Queen's mind.
Her name is Um, idiot!
From Umbradge.
Any luck with the prisoner?
He's stubborn.
You're too soft. Bring him!
We know Alice has returned to Underland.
Do you know where she is?
I've been considering things that begin with the letter "M."
Moron, mutiny, murder, malice.
We're looking for an "A" word now.
Where is Alice?
Who, that wee little boy?
(LAUGHS) I wouldn't know.
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?
Stop that.
What a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
- Hat it?
- Yes.
I used to hat the White Queen, you know.
Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear.
Her head is so small.
It's tiny. It's a pimple of a head.
But this...
What I could do with this monument, this orb...
Nay, this magnificently heroic globe.
What could you do?
Unbind him, Stayne.
How can he work if his hands are bound?
Well, then, shall it be a bonnet or a boater?
Or something for the boudoir?
Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif, snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke, cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau, bongrace, fan-tail, night cap,
Garibaldi, fez...
Hatter.
Fez?
Leave us.
The trees seem sad.
- Have you been speaking with them?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Perhaps a bit more kindly.
Would you all excuse me for a moment? Thank you.
- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.
- Where is she now?
- In Salazen Grum.
Forgive me. I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
No, no, no, no. But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
We have our champion.
Rest now. You've done well.
ALICE: Have you seen a hat around here?
You must find Alice, Stayne.
Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me.
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?
STAYNE: I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN: I know.
But Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
Men, women, even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it. He would have left me.
Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?
Not certain anymore.
Oh, let her have the rabble.
I don't need them.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be working at my trade again.
It's just a pity you have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
Hatter.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
I'm frightened, Alice.
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
Here.
That's better. You look yourself again.
RED QUEEN: Hat man!
Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.
The rabbit will help you.
Find it, Alice.
Take it to the White Queen.
We'll go to the White Queen together.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?
- Tweedles.
- Alice.
- How do you do, again?
- Where's the rabbit?
How is it you're being so great big?
She ain't great big, this is how she normal is.
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.
No, she drank the pishsalver to get through the door, recall it?
Oh, yeah.
- Where's the rabbit?
- BOTH: Over theres.
- MALLY: What are you doing here?
- I'm rescuing the Hatter.
I'm rescuing the Hatter.
He told me that the Vorpal sword is hidden in the castle. Help me find it.
I don't take orders from big, clumsy, galumphing...
Shoo!
- What is it, McTwisp?
- I know where the sword is.
The sword's hidden inside.
Be careful, Alice.
I know that smell.
I'm not going in there.
Look what that thing did to my arm.
Dear, oh, dear.
Why haven't you mentioned this?
It wasn't this bad before.
Hatter? Where are you?
Hatter?
Mallymkun.
Do you still have the Bandersnatch eye?
Right here.
- I need it.
- Come and get it.
Hey! Give it back!
I like you, Um.
I like largeness.
Get away from me.
I have your eye.
No.
Hmm.
MAN: You look stunning in that hat.
Yes. Next.
Your Majesty has never looked better.
Hmm. Another.
Oh!
I don't wish to alarm you, but it smells as though you might have dropped something.
Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.
Stayne!
(BANDERSNATCH
BREATHING HEAVILY)
I suppose this makes us even now.
Um forced herself on me.
I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me.
Off with her head!
Stand back, Mallymkun.
How's this for muchness?
No, no!
It mustn't be used for anything...
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
- Take it to the White Queen.
- I'm not leaving without you.
Go!
Run, Alice!
Alice?
Run!
Seize her.
Alice.
Of course. Why didn't I see it?
Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then.
- Give me the sword.
- Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
- Oh, Alice!
- Bayard! To Marmoreal.
Majesty, Alice has escaped on the Bandersnatch, with the Vorpal sword.
How could you let this happen?
I may have underestimated her, but we have her conspirators, the Hatter and a dormouse.
Off with their heads!
WHITE QUEEN:
Welcome to Marmoreal.
I believe this belongs to you.
Mmm.
The Vorpal sword is home again.
The armor is complete.
Now all we need is a champion.
You're a little taller than I thought you'd be.
Blame it on too much upelkuchen.
Oh.
Come with me.
Is the March Hare here?
(EXCLAIMING) You're late for your soup, you wee besom.
- You're late for your soup.
- Could use some salt.
Come here, you!
Give me that here.
Choppy, chop, chop, chop.
Leek and potato. Yes. That would be...
Pishsalver. Let me think.
A pinch of worm fat, urine of the horsefly, buttered fingers.
My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.
Tell me, how does she seem to you?
Perfectly horrid.
- And her head?
- Bulbous.
I think she may have some kind of growth in there, something pressing on her brain.
Three coins from a dead man's pocket, two teaspoons of wishful thinking.
You can't imagine the things that go on in that place.
Oh, yes, I can.
But when a champion steps forth to slay the Jabberwocky, the people will rise against her.
That should do it.
Blow.
- Feel better?
- Much, thank you.
There's someone here who would like to speak with you.
- Absolem?
- Who are you?
I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.
- How do you know?
- You said so yourself.
I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now.
In fact, you're almost Alice.
Even so,
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.
It will.
So I suggest you keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
You seem so real.
Sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.
Will you stop doing that?
I've always admired that hat.
Hello, Chess.
Since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.
I would like to look my best, you know.
It is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
I was rather good at it, was I not?
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
I love a morning execution, don't you?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself.
As long as I can get at your neck.
I'm right behind you.
Off with his head!
I can't watch.
Good morning, everyone.
Chess, you dog.
- (GASPS)
- Madam, you are being heinously bamboozled by these lickspittle toadies you surround yourselves with.
What is that?
I'm not the only one, Majesty. Look!
A counterfeit nose.
You should be ashamed.
Me? What about that big belly you're so proud of?
Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!
Off with their heads!
The abused and enslaved in the Red Queen's court, all of you stand up and fight!
Rise up against the bloody Red Queen.
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- ALL: Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
Release the Jubjub Bird!
You're right, Stayne, it is far better to be feared than loved.
Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!
Hatter!
Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on. Come on.
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.
It is against my vows to harm any living creature.
We have company.
Have a look, Bayard.
BAYARD: Bielle.
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...
So did I. But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece.
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size.
And it's a good size. It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!
- Hatter.
- Size. Fez. I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?
All healed.
Goodbye, sweet hat.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
Let me think about it.
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?
Frabjous Day. How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
- Still believe this is a dream, do you?
- Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
Yes, yes. But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
I must be, then.
I'll miss you when I wake up.
Who will step forth to be champion for the White Queen?
That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.
I'll do it.
- No, me.
- No, me.
No other slayer, nohow.
If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.
Alice, you cannot live your life to please others.
The choice must be yours, because when you step out to face that creature, you will step out alone.
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears.
Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
- You're going to die?
- Transform.
Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl.
I'm not stupid.
My name is Alice. I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.
He had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him.
I'm his daughter. I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
Alice, at last.
You were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
You called it "Wonderland," as I recall.
Wonderland.
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.
The Alice?
Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.
McTWISP: She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please.
Have some tea.
You're not Absolem,
I'm Absolem, stupid girl.
- What is this?
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee.
DODO: You'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
Cur iouser and cur iouser.
It wasn't a dream at all, it was a memory.
This place is real, and so are you and so is the Hatter.
And the Jabberwocky.
Remember, the Vorpal sword knows what it wants.
All you have to do is hold on to it.
Fairfarren, Alice.
Perhaps I will see you in another life.
- Hello, Iracebeth.
- Hello, Mirana.
On this, the Frabjous Day, the Queens Red and White shall send forth their champions to do battle on their behalf.
Oh, Racie. We don't have to fight.
I know what you're doing.
You think you can blink those pretty little eyes and I'll melt, just like Mummy and Daddy did.
Please.
No! It is my crown! I am the eldest!
Jabberwocky!
This is impossible.
Only if you believe it is.
Sometimes I believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
However, just at the moment, you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky.
Where's your champion, Sister?
Here.
Hello, Um.
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.
One, there's a potion that can make you shrink.
Two, and a cake that can make you grow.
So, my old foe, we meet on the battlefield once again.
We've never met.
Not you, insignificant bearer.
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.
That's enough chatter.
Three, animals can talk.
Four, Alice, cats can disappear.
Five, there's a place called Wonderland.
Six,
I can slay the Jabberwocky.
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!
Off with your head!
Kill her!
We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head.
How dare you? Off with his head!
Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against Underland are worthy of death.
However, that is against my vows, therefore, you are banished to the Outlands.
No one is to show you any kindness, or ever speak a word to you.
You will not have a friend in the world.
Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will.
Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne, you are to join Iracebeth in banishment from this day until the end of Underland.
At least we have each other.
Majesty, please! Kill me! Please!
But I do not owe you a kindness.
- STAYNE: Take off my head!
- He tried to kill me.
- Majesty! Please! Please!
- He tried to kill me.
- I offer you my head!
- He tried to kill me!
Oh, the Frabjous Day! Callou! Callay!
- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
- Will this take me home?
- lf that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.
But I can't.
There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do.
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will. How could I forget?
Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Fairfarren, Alice.
She left me standing there without an answer.
A case of nerves, no doubt.
- Alice.
- LORD ASCOT: Good Lord.
- Are you all right?
- What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.
I'll decide what to do with it.
You're lucky to have my sister for your wife, Lowell, and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.
There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.
You need to talk to someone about these delusions.
I happen to love rabbits, especially white ones.
Don't worry, Mother,
I'll find something useful to do with my life.
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream.
- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.
You and I have business to discuss.
Shall we speak in the study?
Oh. And one more thing.
My father told me he planned to expand his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo, but I don't think he was looking far enough.
Why not go all the way to China?
It's vast, the culture is rich, and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.
To be the first to trade with China, can you imagine it?
You know, if anybody else had said that to me,
I'd say, "You've lost your senses."
But I've seen that look before.
Well, as you're not going to be my daughter-in-law, perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company.
Hello, Absolem.
Tripping out, spinning around
I'm underground
I fell down
Yeah, I fell down
I'm freaking out
Where am I now? upside down and I can't stop it now
Can't stop me now
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I found myself in wonderland
Get back on my feet, the ground
Is this real?
Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
Oh, Alice, dear, where have you been?
So near, so far, so in between
What have you heard?
What have you seen?
Alice, Alice, please, Alice
Oh, tell us, are you big or small?
To try this one or try them all
It's such a long, long way to fall
Alice, Alice, oh, Alice
How can you know this way, not that?
You choose the door
You choose the path
Perhaps you should be coming back
Another day, another day
And nothing is quite what it seems
You're dreaming
Are you dreaming?
Oh, Alice
Oh!
Oh, how will you find your way?
No time for tears today
No time for tears today
So many doors, how did you choose?
So much to gain, so much to lose
So many things got in your way
No time today, no time today
Be careful not to lose your head
Remember what the dor mouse said
Alice!
Did someone pull you by the hand?
How many miles to wonderland?
Please tell us so we'll understand
Alice, Alice, oh, Alice
Oh, how will you find your way?
My name is Red Doc and I can whip any men in the house and ride any filly in the place.
Give me a fresh bottle, the good stuff and don't keep a tip
I don't like you.
Big Boy. I am Madame Lorraine.
I'm ready to see you got the guts.
But it will cost you.
On a horseback hanging from my chandelier you name it!
I hope your aim improves.
You think I'm too drunk, don't you honey?
Come over here and sit by me.
I'll show you what I can do.
Let's make it comfy first.
Get rid of him. And make sure noone sees you.
Like always boss.
- I know who you are. You are the Jonah Hex.
- Congratulations.
I can shoot six bottles off a fence and not miss a one.
Who gives a damn?
I could take it!
- seen him?
- Can't say that I have.
Are you sure?
A-Ha
Put a drink on the bar and go away.
- I have seen him.
- Talk.
I'll help you. Will you help me?
What kind of help? Enough money to leave town.
Got me a little paper round.
Madame Lorraine, she picks the well-heeled ones they go upstairs...
...they are never seen again.
Take your reward.
Hey bartender...
Set up the house.
Hey, cowboy. How would you like to trade that drink for some real fun water upstairs?
- You ask me because I'm so handsome?
- Cos I think you can afford a good time.
- How about we both get comfortable?
- I'm looking for a dead man named Red.
Oh, a dead man!
Now Why would I know anything about a dead man?
- You wouldn't hit a lady?
- You ain't no lady.
Drinks are on the house.
- You hit me.
- Hard as I could.
Only gonna ask this once:
Where is Red?
He's gonna be a little wraith.
Oh man,
You and your rats smart bussiness, ain't you?
Wait! We could be partners.
I don't mind splitting the take.
- You can't leave me here alone!
- You ain't alone. You got plenty of company ...
... And you know hell everybody there.

Come on, get up.
You need to buy gifts for your kids before we leave.
I'll pick up something at the airport.
No way.
Airport gifts suck.
Marie, please let me sleep another half hour.
Fine.
If you won't buy the gifts for your kids, I will.
Can you ask the front desk to prepare the bill...
...and have some breakfast sent up?
You know what?
The posters are up, all over Paris.
Apparently, you can't miss them.
How many have you seen?
Really?
Good morning.
Could you prepare the bill for 321?
- Sure.
- And could you send up some breakfast...
...coffee and fruit?
- Okay, I'll call room service.
- Thank you.
They said there would be
120 across Paris.
Can you sum up the headlines for me?
I won't have time to go online.
That's good.
Big kisses, bye-bye.
Hello.
Oh, I like this one.
You have more like this?
Yes?
Yes. Take this one. Yes.
- How much?
- One dollar.
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me your hand! Give me--
Give me your hand!
Can you reach me? Take my hand.
- All right, hold on.
- She's not breathing.
Think she's gone, dude.
- Get back, get back!
- Everybody get off the boat!
Come on.
Roll her over on her side.
- Breathe, breathe.
- Vomit it out. Good, vomit.
Turn her back around.
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yeah.
- You're okay.
- We got you.
Slow. Slow down.
Marie.
Come in and have a seat.
I'll go talk to my brother, okay?
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay. Sit, sit, sit.
- Hey.
- How could you do this to me?
- What?
- You know I don't do this anymore.
Just one time. This guy's a real important client of mine. I need this. Come on.
- This is it.
- I know.
- This is it.
- I know.
Okay. Mr...?
Andreou. Christos.
Christos. Okay.
I'm gonna hold your hands just until
I get a connection, and then...
...just for the purposes of the reading, confine your answers to yes or no.
Give me your hands?
A woman close to you has passed?
Yes.
- In her middle age? Was she in her fifties?
- Yes.
Was this woman your wife?
Yes.
And I'm picking up you were together for a long time.
Yep.
- But it wasn't always easy.
- No.
- Now I'm picking up she was sick.
- Yep.
She was sick for a long time.
Did she have difficulty moving?
Yes.
Was she bedridden?
Yes. She had multiple sclerosis.
I'm sorry.
She wants to apologize to you for ruining the marriage.
That's not true.
She feels bad that you had to care for her, even as a young man...
...and wishes that you'd find someone now, before it's too late.
Because you're not getting any younger.
Or slimmer.
No.
She's got quite a sense of humor.
- Yeah.
- She's really funny.
Okay, wait. Now she's telling me to pay attention.
Okay, she has something important she needs to say.
Okay, she's trying to give me some kind of a date. June.
In June?
Did that mean anything to you?
- No.
- Is that when you were married? June?
- Is that when she passed?
- No.
I mean, she's being very specific about June.
Yeah, June.
Hm. Well, maybe I'm wrong.
That happens.
I don't even do this anymore.
Guess I'm rusty.
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.
- Hey. Thanks, baby brother.
- Okay.
I owe you.
That was incredible.
Your brother, I'm telling you, he's for real.
- I know.
- No, no, no. He's really for real.
I gotta tell you I was skeptical before I came. All this psychic shit is...
...mumbo-fucking-jumbo as far as I'm concerned.
He was telling me things
I'd never told anybody.
-He could make money.
- He did. Good money.
Had an office, website, newspaper articles, even had a book written about him.
Yeah? So, what happened?
Couldn't cope.
Turned his back on the whole thing.
He told me, he said, "A life that's all about death is no life at all."
He works at a factory and makes 2 grand a month. He says he's happy.
Who knows?
He wasn't gonna do this again.
I had to persuade him to make an exception.
Well, I appreciate it, man.
I mean, this was....
I owe you. All right,
I'll talk to you Monday about that thing?
Yeah. Great, Christos, thanks.
Hey. What was with June, if you don't mind me asking?
June Menendez was my wife's nurse.
Took care of her for 15 years.
For 10 of those years,
I was in love with her.
And I felt so guilty
I couldn't tell anybody.
Least of all June herself.
Right.
All right, I'll see you.
We might have gone about half a mile...
...and my pocket handkerchief was quite wet through...
...when looking out, to my amazement,
I saw Peggotty burst from a hedge.
She jumped up into the carriage.
Not a single word did she speak.
She squeezed me until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful...
...crammed some pieces of cake into my pockets...
...and a purse, which she put into my hand.
Then she got down and ran away.
Presently, I noticed one of her buttons rolling around on the floor.
I picked it up and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.
Okay, you two. Yeah.
Oh, lovely. Come on, you guys.
Which one of you two is the oldest?
- Twelve minutes.
- Really? Do you know, I think I could tell.
- And you're Marcus?
- No, he's Marcus.
- Right.
- The quiet one.
Uh-huh. Oh. Aw.
- I was gonna say the handsome one.
- I'm Jason.
Jason, yeah, all right.
The oldest. The chatterbox.
The smartass.
Lovely. Think we're done.
Okey-dokey. What did you guys do, rob a phone box?
- Thank you.
- Go on.
- Bye.
- Cheers, bye-bye.
- What's the matter?
- I don't understand it. Can I copy yours?
- No.
- Please. It has to be in tomorrow.
Tough bananas.
She can see it in the morning.
Good night, Jase.
Good night.
Shit.
Jackie? Are you in there?
Come on, open up.
Come on, wake up.
Open up, please!
Boys, it's no use.
We know you’re covering for her.
Wake her up. Make her look better.
Social Services.
Mom! Mom, wake up!
Jackie, you in there?
She's not here. She's gone to the shops.
Mom, come on!
We're gonna wait.
Boys, it's no use.
We know you're covering for her.
Come on, Mom. Get up, please!
Come on. You're wasting our time.
If she's not here in five minutes...
...we'll call the Police Child Protective Unit.
Come on. Open up.
He means that! Five minutes!
Thanks. I've got it.
Jason, open the door.
You can come in and wait for her if you want.
Have a seat.
Thanks.
Hope she won't be much longer.
I'm home!
Hello. I didn't know you were gonna be here.
Hi.
I completely forgot you were gonna be here.
Jason, go put the kettle on.
Marcus, go and get a plate.
Let's get these biscuits out.
- Have you been here long?
- A while.
Sorry.
It's all right, Jackie.
Why don't you sit down?
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking that is the best present in the whole wide world.
Absolutely love it. Thank you.
Thank you.
My boys.
- Marcus, will you do something?
- Yeah.
- Get the red box in the cupboard.
- Yes, Mom.
Thank you.
Now, I want you to go down to the chemist.
Give this to the nice man.
Then he'll know what to do, okay?
- Yes, Mom.
- Thank you, baby.
- I'll do it.
- Why?
Marcus hasn't done his homework yet.
- Go on, then.
- Call me on this and I'll talk you through it.
Yeah, but not long, okay?
I haven't got any credit.
Take care, Jason, okay?
- I will.
- I'll see you later.
And why haven't you done your homework?
Come here, you.
Look at your silly little face. An angel.
Okay. It's okay. Forget about your homework. You can copy mine.
I want you to look up naltrexone and hydrochloride.
Okay. Hang on a minute.
Found it. I think this is it.
"Naltrexone blocks the effects of heroin and of opiates.
Detoxification can last between a week and a month."
Does that mean she's stopping?
Yeah, I think that's exactly what it means.
This is great. She's never done this before up till now. It's just been promises.
- Yeah, I knew it was just a matter of time.
- There you are.
Thank you.
Just think. It'd be like living in a normal family for once.
That kid's got a mobile.
Hey, little one.
Hey, come here, lad.
Leave me alone!
Give me your phone, mate.
Give me that back!
Jase?
What do you got pills for?
You're a little freak.
Get your phone, brother.
Get your phone.
- Grab him!
- Wait a minute, little prick!
- Come here!
- Little prick!
Come on, little prick!
Come on, you little dickhead, where you going?
Jase?
Marcus!
Jason?
Jason?
Please, Jason.
Jason, come on. I need you.
Please.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Jason!
Jason, come on. Please, Jase.
Jase.
I feel bad.
I should've stayed on to cover the story.
After what happened to you?
They've sent a crew from the Hong Kong office.
I've never done that...
...run away from such a story.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Should I come up?
- No, I'll be fine.
I almost forgot...
...the gifts for your kids.
I love you.
The estimated figures are at several billion dollars.
But of course, we're going to talk about the survivors...
...because we hope there are survivors.
The number of victims is estimated at several hundred thousand.
It is a horrific scene here, as this tsunami...
...has devastated the population.
Good evening, everyone.
Marie, can you hear me?
Mm-hm.
Everybody, break a leg.
Ready and on the air in...
...five, four...
...three, two...
...and cue, Miss Lelay.
Good evening, and welcome to a new edition...
...of Window on Events.
Tonight, our guest is
Guillaume Belcher...
...CEO of famous clothing manufacturer Soucil.
We're going to present to you a shocking investigation...
...on child labor in their factories in Southeast Asia.
Cyril Guignard reporting.
Here in the West, it's easy to criticize Third World labor practices.
But the truth is...
...these factories...
...play a vital role in industrial development...
...and evolution of poorer countries.
And let's be clear about this, the wages we are paying...
...are substantially higher than local wages.
Marie, go at him!
Marie, do you hear me?
Pull this guy apart!
You hear me, get him!
But will this kind of justification satisfy
French customers...
...Mr. Belcher?
If they were aware of the conditions under which the clothes are produced...
...do you think you would still be profitable?
Go there and you'll see how much these people need us.
Thank you for watching.
That's all for now, see you next week.
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.
We'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.
And it was my fault.
A defensive CEO was a tough start for the new season.
Do you want to get something to eat?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I think something happened to me out there.
You had a close call.
No, something really happened to me.
When I went underwater...
...I had visions.
I don't know.
You had a concussion.
You hit your head.
Hm?
You're right.
Two right-wing newspapers claim Sikhs were out in the streets...
...burning cars, looting shops.
Others say the unrest was triggered by elements within the nationalist parties...
...to cast negative suspicion on racial minorities.
What do you think about the story on the Sikhs?
What?
The story on the Sikhs, what do you think?
It's very good.
Listen, I've got to work late and finish some things.
See you tomorrow.
Can I say something...
...you might find difficult to hear?
I think you came back to work too soon.
Physically, you're fine.
But since the accident....
Take some time off to get over what happened.
Just a couple of weeks.
To "get over"?
You've always said you wanted to write.
Your book idea, Michel would jump on it and pay good money.
But that would take time.
This will all be here waiting for you.
What matters is that you feel better.
We need you too much.
I'll think about it.
Hey.
You see that meeting going on?
On the first floor?
- The head office guys and the union?
- No, no, I didn't.
Yeah, well, they were in there all afternoon.
Kind of makes you think the rumors are true, huh?
What rumor?
That they're gonna let 30 percent of the workforce go. You heard that, right?
Yeah, right. Right.
What's the matter with you today?
No, I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
Well, see you tomorrow, all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you.
- Yeah.
Down the end of the hall, on your left.
Hi there.
Welcome, all of you, to this 10-week course in Italian cuisine.
My name is Carlo.
Some of you know me already.
You've done some of my other courses.
Those of you that don't, buonasera, and you can call me "Chef."
We'll be working in pairs throughout the course...
...so one of the first things I want to do today is to pair you all up.
All right? Don't be shy. Grab a partner.
I see some of you have come in twos already.
Others have worked together before.
Okay. Now who's left?
Excuse me. God. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The roads were closed for some reason...
...plus this jerk in registration took an age processing my application.
Am I too late?
No. No, no. Not at all.
What is your name?
- Melanie.
- We were just pairing people off.
Why don't we put you with....
- What is your name?
- George.
Melanie with George.
And, Alice, you're with....
Tony.
How you doing, Tony?
- Sorry.
- All right.
Now, in exercise class, you warm up with stretches.
We're gonna warm up with a glass of Barbaresco...
...a beautiful wine from the Piedmont region in northwestern Italy...
- ...made from the Nebbiolo grape.
- Hi. George.
Take a sip.
Mm. Mm.
And some music.
Because cooking is all the senses, right?
The nose, the eyes, the palate and the ears.
And tonight, we're gonna start at the beginning.
The cornerstone of so much of Italian cooking...
...the classic tomato sauce from Toscana.
And in preparation, we're gonna need chopped tomatoes, so let's get chopping.
Take your time. Doing all right?
Look at these beautiful tomatoes, huh?
Ah, the music. Is this beautiful?
God, some of them are really good.
Is this your first time?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, mine too.
I read in the brochure that the course builds to a competition.
I saw that. To be judged by a local restaurant critic.
Yeah. I don't think we should get our hopes up. Heh, heh.
Well, we still have 10 weeks.
- Well, that's true.
- And we haven't cut our fingers off yet.
That's a good attitude.
Which one of us is using the wrong knife?
Am I using the wrong knife?
Yeah. You're using that.
The woman next to me brought her own knife.
- Really?
- Very intimidating.
So I'll see you next week.
Great. Yeah. See you next week.
- George Lonegan?
- Yeah.
I hate to bother you.
I'm Mr. Andreou's neighbor.
The Greek guy, mid-fifties, who lost his wife.
I believe you recently did a reading for him.
- I'm just gonna stop you.
- Candace.
Okay, Candace,
I don't do readings anymore.
You did one last week for Mr. Andreou.
He's an associate of my brother's.
It was a one-time thing.
Please, I give you my word.
I won't tell anyone.
- I'm sorry.
- Listen, listen, listen. I brought money.
- I don't want your money.
- Everything I have.
I lost my child.
My only child. Just a baby.
I just wanna talk to her.
Please, I wanna talk to my baby.
I can't help you. I don't do that anymore!
- Please!
- Mr. Lonegan! I got money!
Mr. Lonegan. Please.
I wanna talk to my baby.
Go, girls! There you go! Kick it!
So another person came to see me for a reading.
Thanks to your friend Mr. Andreou.
- What?
- Yeah.
Told that Greek jerk to keep his big mouth shut.
Go, girls! Kick it back!
You gotta kick it back!
Well, obviously he didn't.
I'll talk with him, make sure nothing like that ever happens again.
Okay.
And?
- And what?
- Did you do it?
- What?
- The reading.
- Did you do the reading?
- You still don't get it, do you?
You think just because I can make money doing this...
...just because I can that I should do it.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I also think you have a duty to do it because you have a gift.
It's not a gift, Billy. It's a curse.
You have no idea. It ruins any chance
I have at a normal life.
Feel like a freak.
Freak?
Freak or not, Georgie, it's who you are.
It's what you are, you know.
You can't run from that forever.
To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject...
...I informed Mr. Micawber that I relied on him for a bowl of punch...
...and led him to the lemons.
His recent despondency, not to say despair, was gone in a moment.
I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself...
...amid the fragrance of lemon peel and sugar, and the smell of burning rum...
...as he stirred and mixed and tasted...
...and looked as if he were making, instead of punch...
...a fortune for his family to last for all posterity.
Death is not final.
It is merely the beginning.
Gateway to an afterlife that reflects our conduct here on earth.
God, in his infinite generosity, has created heaven...
...which is where Jason is now...
...surrounded by all the angels and saints, looking down at us.
And so we commit Jason's body to dust, his soul already in God's care.
Jason's ashes will be available at the back...
...but if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like you to leave through the front door.
Morning.
Please come in.
Thank you.
Morning.
Good night, Jase.
It won't be for long.
It's a short-term placement.
Just until your mum feels better.
The couple we have in mind have a lot of experience and live close to where you live.
Of course you'll stay at the same school.
I don't wanna go with anyone else.
I wanna stay with you.
Where are you going?
Just give us a minute, will you?
Look, I need a little time to sort myself out.
But I'm not running away, I promise.
I could stay with you now, and I want that so much.
But chances are I wouldn't make it, because I'm not strong enough.
I don't expect you to understand.
And I know for me to leave you now...
...it must feel like the worst thing in the world.
But I promise you I'm not gonna let you down, okay?
I promise you.
I'm so sorry.
I love you. Come here.
Come here.
Be a good boy.
Come on.
Summing up France's postwar history, only two statesmen counted:
De Gaulle and him.
On de Gaulle, everything's been written.
On Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.
There are fascinating elements.
The abolition of the death penalty, the European Union.
Coming from a right-wing family, he seduced the left.
And what's more, converted it to liberalism.
Amazing! It was a revolution, right?
Plus the darker sides of his character that have never been explored.
He's been dead for 10 years.
The timing is right, we can dig deeper.
I want to dig into his past.
Vichy, the Elf scandal....
What part did he play?
The Taiwan frigates, the Papon scandal...
...Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.
These stories were never really addressed.
They've all been buried.
I'm going to tell who knew, who didn't talk.
Isn't that going to bring us too much controversy?
I don't think so.
What I want is a book that can be read by all.
Mitterrand was not just a politician.
Mitterrand was an icon.
He's "Tonton," our uncle!
Maybe that's what we should use as the title!
- Tonton.
- Heh, heh, heh.
I'm not sure we can keep that title.
Of course not. It was a joke.
I'll welcome your suggestions for the title.
How about Chipping Away at the Myth or The Vacillating Statue?
I look forward to your suggestions.
We'll make a list.
Congratulations.
The timing couldn't be better.
Politically, there's nothing going on now anyway.
You'll write the book you've always wanted to. You'll get some rest.
Come this summer, you'll be back on the air...
...with a bestseller under your belt, and a big renegotiated contract.
Stronger than ever.
Exactly.
Adapting and turning misfortune to your advantage.
That's what I've always loved about you, never a victim.
That's right.
Never a victim, never vulnerable, never complains.
Excuse me. Your table is ready.
Great. I'm starving.
Can I ask you something?
What do you think happens when we die?
That's a strange question!
Tell me.
When you die, you die.
The lights go out, that's it.
Why?
That's it? Just blackout?
Totally black, the plug's pulled out.
The eternal void.
Don't you think it's possible that there is something?
Like what?
I don't know, something....
A hereafter.
No, I don't.
If that were the case, wouldn't someone have discovered it by now?
And there would be proof.
I guess.
Do you have a lot of questions like that?
More champagne?
Huh?
Okay, does everyone have their blindfolds on?
Okay.
Now, if you wanna be a good cook, first we need to work on your palate.
To stimulate your imaginations, your senses.
No good being an expert chopper, dicer, roaster, toaster...
...if you can't give names and colors, and even shapes, to flavors.
Okay. Now, spoon number one.
Now, look, this isn't easy. So don't worry if you don't immediately identify it.
Let's start by trying to describe it.
What is the texture?
Okay, you ready?
- What is the consistency?
- Open.
Very good.
What?
I have no freaking idea what this is.
"No freaking idea." Okay.
But, um....
It's not a fruit.
It's kind of nutty.
- But it's kind of sweet too. I think.
- Okay.
"A little nutty."
"Kind of sweet."
- Did she get it?
- Yeah.
So how are we gonna do this?
What?
Well, we could make up a whole load of crap, or we could...
...cut to the chase and be honest with one another.
About?
About why we're both doing night-school classes?
- All right.
- Open.
Everybody okay? How we doing?
Mm.
There's, um....
There's something oaky about that.
"Oaky." Okay.
- Yeah. Nutmeggy? I think.
- Okay.
You're not gonna tell me it's because you wanna make...
...the perfect spaghetti vongole, right?
No, not entirely.
Okay. I'll jump in.
I'm doing this because
I'm new to San Francisco.
Because I'm looking to make new friends.
And who knows? If I'm lucky, maybe even meet the man of my dreams.
- Here, open.
- Okay.
So why'd you move to San Francisco?
Uh....
Because I got dumped by someone in Pittsburgh.
Sorry.
Not quite at the aisle, but pretty close.
Down payment on the wedding dress, honeymoon booked. That kind of thing.
I mean, it's okay. You know, I'm....
I'm over it, just about.
Not at all, actually.
What'd that taste like?
Oh. Um....
I don't know.
I mean, I really-- I don't....
- Wanna try again?
- Yeah, okay.
Okay.
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
Okay.
- Is that a bean?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You know what color it is?
It's like....
Tastes like a black bean.
- Am I right?
- Yes.
How we doing? Don't be shy.
- Here we go.
- Oh, well...
...like you, I recently made a big change to my life...
...and I just wanted to reevaluate things and change my priorities.
What was--? What was the change?
Divorce or...?
Oh, no, no, nothing like that. No.
A job that I needed to put behind me.
It was making any kind of life impossible.
Definitely a nut.
You're not gonna tell me, you know, what the job was?
Would you mind if I didn't?
I mean, don't worry,
I wasn't like a criminal or anything.
- Okay. So open up.
- Okay.
No hitting on Alice.
- Peppers.
- Yeah.
- Wasn't that great?
- Yeah, fun.
God, it's made me so hungry.
Yeah, me too.
Do you wanna get something to eat?
Yeah. There's actually a place nearby that everyone's talking about.
Place nearby, are you kidding me?
We're practically experts ourselves.
- I can drive.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, great, okay.
So you been in San Francisco long?
Born and bred, yeah.
Oh, nice.
You can just leave all that. I'll get it.
You just get comfortable.
No, I'm your partner. Remember?
I have to....
-We have to do this together.
-Okay.
Oh, my gosh. Are these...?
- This is you? As a kid?
- Yeah, that's me and my brother, Billy.
Let me tell you, you got the looks.
Well, he got everything else.
Are these his kids?
Yeah. My nieces.
Hm.
Who's this?
Is this some kind of ancestor?
No, that's Charles Dickens.
- Oh.
- I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan.
You know, people go on and on about Shakespeare and it's--
I mean, he's great, of course, but Dickens....
No, no, I'll get that. I got it.
There's a-- There's a little trick.
Hey. It's Billy.
Just to say I finally caught up with our Greek friend.
Told him to keep his mouth shut. Okay?
Just relax. There shouldn't be any more freaks...
...knocking on your door asking for readings, you know?
I gotta say though, this guy...
...he made a big point of saying how brilliant you were...
...and with so many fakers out there, someone who had a genuine gift.
I don't know--
Sorry about that.
Uh....
- What gift?
- Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.
No, I mean, I'm interested.
Well, the job I had before, it was as a psychic.
I know, but....
- What?
- But it's true.
I had an illness as a child...
...and I had an infection, which turned into a fever...
...which turned into inflammation of my brain and spinal cord.
It's called encephalomyelitis.
And they had to operate, in the back, here.
It was a complicated procedure. It was eight hours. And they nearly lost me.
Actually, technically, they did lose me...
...and bring me back on a number of occasions.
Anyway, they cured the illness...
...but they must've messed up something else while they were back there, because...
...not long after,
I started to have these migraines.
And then nightmares.
And then these connections.
And one day I'm sitting with a friend, and I had a vision of a woman...
...a crystal-clear vision.
And I described her to him.
And turned out it was an exact description of his mother, someone I'd never met...
...who'd died the previous week.
And you're not laughing yet.
No, I'm not.
Well, anyway, I assumed it was some kind of a coincidence.
But as time went on, I began having more and more of these things, connections.
So the doctors ran a bunch of tests.
They told my parents that I'd developed something called passive schizophrenia.
They gave me a bunch of pills and, you know, the pills stopped the visions...
...but they pretty much stopped everything else also...
...so I had this choice.
I was either gonna live my life with these hallucinations...
...with apparently no way of switching it off.
Or I could have no life at all.
Oh, my God.
See, there, now I've been neglecting my duties.
Could I ask you a question?
You know, these are probably ready to go in.
George?
Would it be okay if I told you the answer was no?
You don't even know what I was gonna ask.
Yes, I do. You're gonna ask me if I can do a reading for you.
Look, Melanie, I barely know you...
...but I like you a lot.
Really, a lot.
Is there any way we could pretend that maybe we go back in time...
...and just forget about the phone ringing, and my brother's message...
- ...and we never had this conversation?
- Why?
If we open the door and go down that road...
...any chance that we had of having something normal will just be gone.
It just will.
Believe me. I have enough experience of that now.
I mean, sometimes, I mean....
You know, knowing everything about someone, it's--
You know, it seems nice, but, really...
...maybe it's actually better to hold stuff back.
I hear you.
But you can understand. I'm curious.
No, of course. I mean, yeah. Yeah.
Please?
Okay.
Come on.
Here, take a seat.
Okay.
I'm gonna take your hands for a second, to get a connection...
...and then I'll let go, and I'll just ask you a couple questions.
All right.
Okay. Give me your hands.
Okay.
Okay.
There's a woman. And she's tall.
Thin. She has brown hair.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Is this woman your mother?
Yes.
And I'm feeling a pain in my chest.
Yeah. That's how she died.
Of a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
Okay. You ready to eat?
There's not something else?
- No, there's nothing--
- No, no, no, I can tell.
Please, there is, I can tell.
I mean, what's the matter?
You don't think I could handle it?
All right, um....
When you touched me before, there was a....
There was a man.
Dark hair.
My father.
He passed away not too long ago?
- Last year.
- And....
All he kept saying, all I kept hearing was--
Was what?
How sorry he was.
What for?
For what he did to you all that time ago.
And he hoped that you could one day forgive him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
...for pressing you like that.
Maybe we shouldn't have gone there.
I don't know what to say.
Except if I....
If I go now...
...if we draw a line under this...
...pretend it never happened...
...we'll be okay.
I'm sure.
Good.
Good.
We still have the competition to win. Right?
Right.
I should've listened to you.
You know, too much knowledge and all that.
I'll see you next week.
Yeah, you betcha.
MAN [OVER SPEAKERS] The old, unhappy feeling that had once pervaded my life...
...came back like an unwelcome visitor, and deeper than ever.
It addressed me like a strain of sorrowful music...
...a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost...
...all that I had ever loved.
And all that remained was a ruined blank and waste...
...lying around me, unbroken to the dark horizon.
All right, son, out you get.
All right. Lovely, thanks.
- Hello.
- Hi, Marcus!
Hi. I'm Angela. This is Dennis.
All right, mate?
I call him Dennis the Menace.
Now, I'll show you the kitchen.
Just keep walking through there.
So this is where we eat our breakfast in the morning.
What do you like to eat in the mornings?
We're porridge eaters in this house.
Do you like porridge?
Or cornflakes?
This is your room.
Our last boy, Ricky, moved out about a month ago.
Just turned 18.
Got his first job, security guard.
Go on, mate. It's all yours now.
Do you think it's possible to get another bed?
Two secs, Marcus.
We're gonna need another bed.
Upstairs? Should I take yours?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Good night, Jase.
Who agrees? A and D. "Rowan is an old Roman word for a mountain ash."
"A mountain ash lives over 100 years."
And does anybody else think it's anything else?
Marcus, could you take the hat off, please?
Thank you.
So now let's move on to number six.
On the next page.
So you're gonna need to look at the extract, "Wings of Courage."
- Thank you very much for coming in.
- You're welcome.
And....
We'll be in touch when we've made the appointment.
Yeah. Okay, great.
Let's get it sorted as soon as possible.
Thanks.
All right, Marcus? See you soon, mate.
Be a good little man.
It's lunchtime, Marcus. You gonna go?
The angel of death comes to you...
...and will find you, no matter where you are hiding.
Even if you are hiding in, like a rich man in a castle...
...the angel of God will find you.
Hello.
A number of us are probably too frightened to ask:
"What happens to us when we die?"
But the good news is, if you believe in Christ, you have nothing to fear.
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Ah. What wouldn't we give to know exactly where she's gone?
But from what you wrote in your letter, perhaps you know already.
- Claudia Rousseau.
- Marie Lelay.
- I'm so happy to meet you.
- You too.
You know, I really need to talk about the vision I had.
- Sure, go ahead.
- Yeah.
It was a very peaceful sensation.
Everything was quiet.
Darkness everywhere.
And a light was catching my eyes.
And I was hearing the sound of a gentle wind.
Mm-hm.
A feeling of weightlessness?
Yes.
A 360 perspective?
No sense of linear time or motion?
Yes.
But all-knowing, all-sensing?
Exactly.
- Would you care for some tea?
- Thank you.
You know, as a scientist and atheist...
...my mind was closed to such things.
Oh, absolutely.
Afterlife, near-death experiences.
Like everyone else,
I thought people saw bright lights...
...Eden-like gardens and so forth...
...because they were culturally conditioned to do so.
But after 25 years in a hospice...
...working with people, many of whom were pronounced dead...
...but then miraculously survived...
...the account of what they actually experienced were so strikingly similar...
...it couldn't just be coincidence.
And add to that the fact that when they had these experiences...
...they were almost all unconscious...
...a state in which my enemies agree the brain cannot create fresh images.
So you think I really did experience something?
Oh, yes.
I think you experienced death.
It's all here.
I'm afraid if your journey is anything like mine, it won't be an easy one.
It's a lonely field to plow.
People get quite irrational around this subject. Quite hostile, even.
But the evidence is irrefutable.
I tried.
You know, perhaps someone like you...
...in your position, and with your influence, can change that.
I hope you can.
Thank you.
Good luck.
I'll send it back when I'm done.
Good evening.
Following a joint statement by Vivendi and electricity giant VFM...
...announcing higher than expected quarterly profits...
...we wonder if evoking France's economic downturn might be premature?
Like to see you upstairs.
George, have a seat.
You're probably aware there's been a lot of talk about cutbacks.
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah. Anyway, seems the suits got together with the unions...
...and came up with packages for anyone willing to consider voluntary redundancy.
Voluntary redundancy?
Look, if you ask me, the deal is pretty good.
You get six months' pay in your pocket with health insurance for two years.
So, what does this have to do with me?
It's a freaking scandal.
You worked there three years?
You never missed a day, never called in sick.
- He said it was nothing personal.
- That's B.S.
He's trying to protect the guys who have wives and kids.
- You should hire a lawyer.
- I can't afford a lawyer.
If you need help getting another job,
I'll help you with that.
I'll make calls. I'll make it happen. But you know what I think you should do, right?
Yes, I do.
You know, the website's still up.
Waiting.
It'd be different this time, George.
We could control it.
That's how it would be different.
We'd only do two clients a day, three, tops. Keep it small.
Don't give out your phone number.
We won't talk to the media.
We learned our lesson with that the last time, right?
Just think about it, all right?
- Doing all right, George?
- Yeah.
Look a little bummed out.
Listen, I'll step in and partner with you.
Me and you could win this thing, you know?
- Why not?
- Yeah.
Great.
Watch your fingers there.
- Hello?
- Clare?
Dennis. I think you should come over.
Yeah, of course, Dennis. I'll come now.
- How much was in here?
- Two hundred pounds.
We called the school. He never got there.
What happens now?
Well, we don't want to involve the police.
No, that's really a last resort.
Will you let us know if he comes back?
We will be in touch.
I'll see you out.
There you go.
I'm afraid our sensitive,
Mr. Hewitt, is very busy.
Earliest he could see you is six weeks' time.
Oh, dear.
Mrs. Joyce, our senior sensitive...
...is doing a public reading tonight if you're interested.
In the lecture hall.
All right. I'll try my luck. Thank you.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm getting a strong feeling over this side of the room.
Someone whose name starts with a "J."
Does the letter "J" mean anything to anyone? Anyone?
Anyone?
Oh.
Don't be shy.
Tell us your name, please.
Marcus.
Marcus. Marcus. Come on.
Come up here where I can see you.
Good boy.
There's a good boy, Marcus.
That's right. I'm not going to hurt you.
That's lovely.
Now, Marcus, you've lost someone recently.
Was it someone very close to you?
He's telling me his name.
It's Joe, or Jack.
- Jason.
- Jason, that's it.
He was very close to you, wasn't he?
Was he part of your family?
Is it your dad?
Well, Daddy says please don't be sad...
...and to look after Mummy for him, will you?
Will you do that for him?
Give Marcus a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.
Lovely boy.
And as I go into a trance...
...my spirit guide will speak to you through me.
Oh.
Who summons me from the spirit world?
Say your name.
- Marcus.
- Marcus.
Welcome, Marcus. My name is Yoshi.
What I'm doing is I'm adjusting the level of the microphones.
Do you do physics at school?
Good. Then you know that all matter vibrates at different speeds.
But in the spirit world, operates at far higher levels.
So we can't hear them.
Not with our normal hearing.
So, what we really need is an omnidirectional...
...supercardioid condenser microphone.
Like this beauty.
Right. I think we are ready.
And....
Jason? Are you there?
Your brother, Marcus, is here.
Is there a message for him?
It was the ancient Greeks who first discovered it.
"Psychomanteum," they called it.
The reflective surface being the conduit to the afterlife.
Nowadays, we call it "mirror gazing."
You might not be able to speak to him, but you will see him...
...if you really want to, that is.
Did you see him?
No.
Hello. Clare speaking.
There's no sign of him.
I'm gonna call the police.
- But that will not help.
- Well, I don't care what--
Hang on. He's here.
I'll call you right back.
I'm sorry.
Ah--
Leave him be.
Watch out!
Excuse me.
Sorry, we are running a little late.
Come in.
Everyone is upset by the events.
Sit down.
Marie, to be honest with you,
I'm a bit confused.
I thought we commissioned a book about Francois Mitterrand.
Instead, you give us the first three chapters of...
...Hereafter:
The Conspiracy of Silence.
I realize it's not what you were expecting.
You always said there weren't enough surprises in publishing.
Well, this is certainly a surprise!
I don't know where to begin.
Did you at least find it interesting?
Of course.
You've always had a nose for a good story.
But we're a political publisher--
This is political!
This kind of material, however fascinating, is for a specialized market.
This morning, in London, six bombs went off in the heart of the city.
Apparently coordinated, the bombs exploded at the height of the rush hour.
Why are you all against this?
Why are you so afraid of this?
This is real!
This is scientific evidence...
...from well-known researchers forced to work in secret.
A Nobel Prize winner, hounded by the religious lobby. That's a story!
Better than a philandering, dishonest old politician.
But a book like that would probably have to be written in English...
...for the American market.
It happened to me, Michel.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Where we're going.
What we'll experience.
Each and every one of us.
That doesn't interest you?
Now listen, we commissioned a book about Francois Mitterrand.
Either we agree on this and you start writing it...
...or else I want my money back.
That's all I can say.
It was so humiliating.
They looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.
Six months ago they begged me to write about anything.
Anything by the great Marie Lelay.
You'd better give me my job back.
I've had enough with being humiliated.
Today, they even took down my posters.
Why didn't you tell me?
And your book?
I'll finish it in my spare time.
It's caused me enough trouble as it is.
What's the matter?
Look...
...getting your job back...
...might not be as easy as you think.
Why?
It was a temporary break.
And on your advice.
I know, but--
What we couldn't have foreseen is...
...you'd be talking in public about these experiences.
- That you'd lose your credibility.
- But I didn't want to write this book!
It was your idea!
It was my idea you should write about Mitterrand.
So, what are you saying?
I'm saying take some more time.
Finish the book, get it out of your system, then come back.
It's that girl, isn't it?
My replacement?
I've watched her a few times.
She's good.
Yes, she is.
But not as good as you.
You're sleeping with her?
How can you say such a thing?
You always told me to ask the tough questions.
It's funny....
Who'd have thought it?
A few months ago I was famous.
Rich.
A success story.
I was happy.
Fulfilled by my work.
By you.
All this happened because you didn't buy your kids their gifts.
Because of what?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
It's Michel.
Listen....
I feel terrible about our meeting earlier today.
This book is obviously very important to you.
I think everyone was a bit on edge because of the events in London.
But I made a few calls. There are two publishers who might be interested.
One American, one English.
Do you have a pen?
I'm listening.
Anyways, I thought this would be a good group reading room.
Group reading?
Yeah, where you could read more people at once.
Up to 20 people or more, it's up to you.
They'd pay lower rates that way.
This would be your personal consulting room.
And right next door, George, this is gonna be my room.
I'm gonna make sure everything gets taken care of.
You won't have to worry.
I don't understand.
What about your other businesses?
Oh, yeah, of course. They're gone.
Once this thing takes off, forget it, you know?
Let's get you home. You need rest.
You got a big day tomorrow.
You already have three appointments.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Come on.
- You Billy Lonegan?
- Yes.
Before he went, your brother asked me to give this to you.
Went? Went where?
I have no idea.
Dear Billy...
...I'm sorry.
I guess there's nothing I'll ever be able to say to persuade you...
...that what I have isn't a gift, but a curse.
I know you feel what I have comes with a duty to help others.
But right now, the person
I most need to help is myself.
So I've decided to take some time out.
I don't know what the future will bring or when I'll be back.
So don't wait up, so to speak.
Love to Jenni and the kids.
Your baby brother, George.
You know the recovery rate in substance abuse cases like this.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Very low.
So, what's the best way forward?
Are you okay for a little bit longer?
Yes. But not too long, please.
We're running out of ideas, and it's beginning to take its toll.
Taking him to see our previous child, Ricky.
Who knows, you know?
One kid talking to another.
- Marie Lelay?
- Yes?
This is Richard Aronson of Aquarius Books in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Excuse me?
Aquarius books in Santa Fe?
A few months ago, you sent us your book.
I'm just ringing to say how much we liked it.
Sorry it's taken so long, but we loved it, and we'd like to publish it.
- Really?
- In fact, we'd like to print it...
...in time for a book fair in London in the spring.
- You're based in Paris?
- Yes.
So, if we were to ask, going to London wouldn't be inconvenient?
No. No, no, no, not at all.
That would be a good opportunity to do some publicity.
Maybe a reading. It's an incredible story.
Thank you.
And here we are.
48 Doughty Street.
Charles Dickens' home in London...
...where he lived with his wife Catherine and their children.
Anyone know how many children?
Here we are in the main hallway.
- This is the view that greeted the author...
- Ten.
...as he walked in each time.
Everything has been preserved exactly as it was.
So just follow me up the stairs.
We'll start at the top of the house.
Now we move in to Dickens' study.
And directly in front of you, you'll see an original copy of A Christmas Carol...
...arguably one of Dickens' most famous books.
But over here, the thing I expect most of you have come to see.
Dickens' desk, where he wrote most of his books.
On this wall we have several illustrations for The Mystery of Edwin Drood...
...the novel Dickens was writing at the time of his death.
And on the far wall here, a painting loved by Dickens fans.
It shows the author asleep at his desk...
...with characters from his novels floating in the air around him.
Anyone know its name?
Dickens' Dream.
It's called Dickens' Dream.
This way, please.
Just gather again at the front of the building.
Does anyone have any questions?
What is the date today?
- Fourteenth.
-It is the 14th. Yeah, okay.
I think you'll like Ricky.
He was about your age when he first came to us, and just as shy.
Now he's a grown man.
With a job and his own flat.
- He's in here somewhere.
- He said he'd meet us at the front.
Where is he?
- Where is he?
- Hey. Look at this.
- Hey.
- Heh, heh, heh.
Oh, my God, I hardly recognized you.
- You gonna arrest us?
- Yeah. Not if you behave yourself.
Marcus, this is Ricky.
You all right, mate?
Fancy a coffee first?
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Yeah, great idea.
It's an amazing place, isn't it?
Can I have a look around?
Yeah. But meet us back here in one hour, yeah?
- Good lad.
- Okay?
It's been nearly a year.
He hardly speaks to us.
Neither did I, remember?
This one's different. He's not like you.
- Let's have that coffee, yeah?
- Yeah.
Oh, lovely.
"'She is,
I do assure you, the winegariest person.'
Mr. Plornish, with a modest disavowal of his merits...
...opened the room door for her readmission...
...and followed her in with such an exceedingly bald presence...
...of not having been out at all...
...that her father might have observed it without being very suspicious.
In his affable unconsciousness, however, he took no heed.
Plornish, after the little conversation, took his leave.
Making the tour of the prison before he left...
...and looking on at a game of skittles...
...with the mixed feelings of an old inhabitant...
...who had his private reasons for believing...
...that it might be his destiny to come back again."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, if any of you wish to purchase a CD,
I am at your disposal.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi. George.
- To George.
- Yeah. George Lonegan.
To George.
I'm a-- It's-- This is an honor, Mr. Jacobi.
I'm a really big fan. You have no idea.
Thank you.
You're a long way from home.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Did you enjoy it?
- Very much, yes.
- There you are. Thank you.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
"I felt connected to another world...
...a place of utter peace and tranquility.
Whether what I saw was a genuine glimpse of the afterlife...
...or just a concussed fantasy,
I'll probably never know.
I arrive at the end of my journey with as many question as I started with.
I certainly never imagined
I would be exposed...
...to that kind of prejudice and close-mindedness.
We obviously still have a long way to go...
...before we will be able to deal with death and what follows...
...in anything approaching a sensible fashion."
Okay, so if you want to buy my book,
I can sign it.
You're welcome. Thank you.
- Hello. What's your name?
- Hello.
- Maria.
- Maria.
- Thank you, Maria.
- Thank you very much.
- Michael.
- Michael. Okay.
Thank you.
Honora.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- My name's George.
- George.
- To Penny.
- Sorry?
- Penny.
- Penny.
Wait a minute. I recognize you.
Sorry?
You're that psychic.
No, no. Um.... No, you got me mistaken with someone else.
Yes, you are. You're George Lonegan.
- I don't even know who that is. No, I'm not.
- You are George Lonegan.
- You got me--
- I need to talk to you.
No, you got me mixed up with someone else.
Please, I need to talk to you.
You're a psychic.
I'm not. I'm not who you think I am.
I saw it on the Internet.
You are a psychic.
What? What is it? What do you want?
If it's a reading, I have news for you.
I don't do it anymore.
Now leave me alone.
"When I look back on this, it was insane.
The rudder cables became useless and I lost my ability to steer.
I was helpless amid the swirling maritime mass of industry.
The sea had turned malevolently dark.
What had once seemed friendly was now a violent monster trying to kill me."
Did you see a Frenchwoman who was here just a few minutes ago?
She's gone. She left already.
"You realize you're in danger...
...and dwell on how things might end.
I spent every second...."
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.
Come on, please. Move along.
Hill cuts it back nicely, perhaps almost too far.
But it's gone in! It's gone in!
Andy Fisher!
You have to question that play....
Okay.
We better get you inside.
Come on.
- What's your name?
- Marcus.
Okay. Couple of ground rules before we get started.
I'm sorry about the woman.
What woman?
The woman at the book fair.
I could tell you liked her.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
So I'm sorry for taking you away.
I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Here, sit down.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Okay, I'm gonna grab your hands because it seems to help...
...and then I'll let go.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna go into any stupid trance or anything like that.
I just gotta grab them to get a connection, then I'll let go. Okay?
Now, I want you to answer yes or no to everything I ask.
- You understand?
- Yes.
Okay.
Let's see them.
Okay.
Okay, someone close to you has passed away?
Yes.
A male?
Yes.
He was young when he died.
Yes.
This person your brother?
Older brother.
But not by much, he says.
Only by a few minutes.
I'm sorry, kid.
I gotta concentrate.
This guy.... This guy talks a lot.
Talks fast.
Got a really weird laugh.
Okay. Ahem. He says...
...there's so much he wants to tell you.
You wouldn't believe how it is.
How you can be all things...
...and all at once.
And the weightlessness.
He says that's cool.
Now he's laughing.
He's got a funny laugh.
Um....
Okay.
He says how you always looked up to him...
...and relied on him to make the decision...
...how maybe you used that as an excuse.
Is that true?
Okay. He says can't do that anymore.
Now you're on your own.
Okay, now, hang on, okay, now.
Now he's saying something about a hat.
The cap?
A cap. Okay.
He says to take it off right now.
Take it off.
He doesn't--
He's telling you not to wear it again...
...because it was his.
And that's why he knocked it off your head that day?
At the tube? Do you know what he's talking about?
Okay.
He says good thing he did too.
And that's the last time he's ever looking out for you.
I'm sorry. I'm, uh....
I'm sorry, I'm losing him now.
He's leaving. He wants to leave.
No, Jase.
Don't go.
You can't. Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be here without you.
Please, Jase, don't go. I miss you.
Okay, he came back. He's here. He says...
...if you're worried about being on your own, don't be.
You're not.
Because he is you and you are him.
One cell.
One person.
Always.
I miss you.
Please, Jase, don't go.
Please come back.
I miss you so badly.
Okay, wait. He's leaving again.
Hold on, hold on. I'm sorry.
Well, where's he gone?
I'm sorry, kid. I don't know.
But you've done all those readings.
I still don't know.
Sorry.
Okay. We better get you home.
- Hello?
- May Fair.
What?
The hotel where she's staying.
The woman you like?
What are you talking about?
Well, I rang up the publisher and said I heard her speak...
...wanted to drop off a letter saying how interesting it was.
Anyway, that's the name.
May Fair.
Okay, well, that's really interesting, but what does that have to do with me?
Hello?
Well, I'll be.
I must be crazy.
Morning, sir.
Okay.
- Here's your room key. Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm looking for a guest. Marie Lelay?
Okay. Okay.
No, there's no answer from the room,
I'm afraid, sir.
Would you like to leave a message?
No.
Actually, you know what? I would, I would.
Do you have a pen and paper?
Sure.
- Pen, paper.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
This is it.
Marcus? Good luck.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
Oh, Marcus.
Come here. I missed you so much.
Marie?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hurry!
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated...
- ...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...
...were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.
Are you seriously suggesting that we evacuate the entire planet?
No. Everybody here is already dead.
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.
There is still hope.
I have held that hope in my hands.
This council has been disbanded.
On whose authority?
Mine.
The rest of you will be tried and punished accordingly.
- What are you doing, Zod? This is madness.
- What I should have done...
...years ago.
These lawmakers...
...with their endless debates...
...have lead Krypton to ruin.
And if your forces prevail...
- ...you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.
Help me save our race. We'll start anew.
We'll sever...
...the degenerative bloodlines that led us to this state.
And who will decide which bloodlines survive, Zod?
You?
Don't do this, El.
The last thing I want is for us to be enemies.
You have abandoned the principles that bound us together.
You've taken up the sword...
...against your own people.
I will honor the man you once were, Zod...
...not this monster you've become.
Take him away.
Sir? Is everything all right?
Out of the way.
I said...
Get me Lara.
Jor. Behind you.
Lara, you have to ready the launch.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
H'Raka!
Hyah!
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.
But I'm compelled to warn you.
Breaching the genesis chamber is a Class-B crime...
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.
Jor-El, by the authority of General Zod...
...surrender the Codex.
Unh!
Ahhh!
Easy, H'Raka.
Did you find a world?
- We have.
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...
...just as you said it would.
A young star.
His cells will drink its radiation.
It's a seemingly intelligent population.
He'll be an outcast.
A freak.
They'll kill him.
How?
He'll be a god to them.
What if the ship doesn't make it?
He'll die out there...
...alone.
I can't do it.
I thought I could, but...
- Lara.
...now that he's here...
Krypton is doomed.
It's his only chance now.
It's our people's only hope.
What is it, Kelex?
Five attack ships converging from the east.
Citadel's defenses are being scanned and evaluated.
I'll upload the Codex.
No, wait.
Lara.
Just let me look at him.
We'll never get to see him walk.
Never hear him say our names.
But out there...
...amongst the stars...
...he will live.
Goodbye, my son.
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.
Concentrate fire on the main doors.
Lady Lara.
- The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.
General.
We have identified an engine ignition within the citadel.
A launch.
Hold this platform, commander.
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.
Surrender it...
...and I'll let you live.
This is a second chance for all of Krypton...
...not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.
What have you done?
We've had a child, Zod.
A boy child.
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.
And he will be free.
Free to forge his own destiny.
Heresy.
Destroy it.
Ah!
Lara...
...listen to me.
The Codex is Krypton's future.
Abort the launch.
No!
Your son, Lara...
...where have you sent him?
His name...
...is Kal...
...son of El.
And he's beyond your reach.
Bring that ship down.
Target locked.
Lay down your weapons.
Your forces are surrounded.
General Zod...
...for the crimes of murder and high treason...
...the Council has sentenced you and your fellow insurgents...
...to three hundred cycles of somatic reconditioning.
Do you have any last words?
You won't kill us yourself!
You wouldn't sully your hands!
But you'll damn us...
...to a black hole for eternity!
Jor-El was right.
You're a pack of fools, every last one of you.
And you.
You believe your son is safe?
I will find him.
I will reclaim what you have taken from us.
I will find him.
I will find him, Lara.
I will find him!
Argh!
Lady Lara, shouldn't you find refuge?
There is no refuge, Kelor.
Jor-El was right.
This is the end.
Make a better world than ours, Kal.
Watch it, dumb-ass!
Keep your eyes open or you're gonna get squashed.
Where the hell did they find you, greenhorn?
Let's get this trap in the air.
Gentlemen, secure the deck.
We just got a distress call from a rig due west of us.
Secure the deck.
All civilian boats, stand clear.
The sub-sea valves failed and the rig is about to explode.
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn...
...fetch me my binoculars.
Greenhorn.
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't know how much longer we can hold out.
This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass then get out.
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.
Right here!
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Get that last guy loaded.
We have got to go.
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?
Go! Go!
Argh!
Argh!
...when Kansas became a territory?
Clark.
Are you listening, Clark?
I asked if you could tell me who first...
...settled Kansas.
Are you all right, Clark?
Clark.
Clark.
Clark!
Clark, come out of there.
Leave me alone.
Clark, I have called your mother.
Clark?
Ah!
I'm here.
Clark, honey, it's Mom.
Will you open the door?
- What's wrong with him?
- He's such a freak.
Crybaby.
His parents won't even let him play with other kids.
I know.
Sweetie.
How can I help you if you won't let me in?
The world's too big, Mom.
Then make it small.
Just, um...
...focus on my voice.
Pretend ifs an island...
...out in the ocean.
Can you see it?
I see it.
Then swim towards it, honey.
What's wrong with me, Mom?
Clark.
Clark.
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.
Hold it, hold it.
Hey, ass-wipe.
What do you think? You see the game?
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?
I wanna hear what he has to say.
Come on...
...dick-splash.
My son was there.
He was in the bus.
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was...
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.
This was providence.
I think you're blowing it out of proportion.
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.
And the Fordham boy.
This isn't the first time...
...Clark's done something like this.
I just wanted to help.
I know you did, but we talked about this.
Right?
Right? We talked about this. You have...
Clark, you have to keep this side of yourself a secret.
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?
Maybe.
There's more at stake here than just our lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us.
When the world...
When the world finds out what you can do it's gonna change everything. Our...
Our beliefs, our notions of...
...what it means to be human.
Everything.
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?
She was scared, Clark.
Why?
People are afraid of what they don't understand.
Is she right?
Did God do this to me?
Tell me.
We found you in this.
We were sure the government was gonna show up on our doorstep...
...but no one ever came.
This was in that chamber with you.
I took it to a metallurgist...
...at Kansas State.
He said whatever it was made from didn't even...
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.
That's another way of saying...
...that it's not from this world, Clark.
And neither are you.
You're the answer, son.
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"
I don't wanna be.
And I don't blame you, son.
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.
But you're not just anyone, Clark, and I have to believe that you were...
That you were sent here for a reason.
All these changes that you're going through, one day...
One day you're gonna think of them as a blessing. When that day comes...
...you have to make a choice.
A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?
You are my son.
But somewhere out there you've...
You have another father too, who gave you another name.
And he sent you here...
...for a reason, Clark.
And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself...
...to find out what that reason is.
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
Wait a second.
Aren't you here for the exercise?
No, there was a change in the plans.
Somebody found something strange on Ellesmere.
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. It's crazy.
The Americans are there too, lots of them.
Anything else? They're calling it an anomalous object.
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.
- Sit down.
- Let me go.
Hey. Leave her alone, man.
Or what, tough guy?
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I think I'll probably just leave when I'm good and ready.
Ooh.
Oh, there he is.
It's not worth it, sweetie.
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.
Strike.
Thanks.
Hi.
Miss Lane. How you doing?
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.
How far to the station?
- Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over.
- Great.
Joe can take your bags. Joe.
Help her out.
Careful with those. They're heavy.
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...
...I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.
But those pieces you wrote when you were embedded with the 1st Division were...
Well, they were pretty impressive.
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.
Miss Lane.
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton...
...from DARPA.
- You're early.
- Hi.
We were expecting you tomorrow.
Which is why I showed up today.
Look, let's get one thing straight, guys, okay?
The only reason I'm here is because we're on Canadian soil...
...and the appellate court overruled your injunction to keep me away.
So if we're done measuring dicks...
...can you have your people show me what you found?
NASA's EOS satellites...
...pinged the anomaly first.
The ice shelf plays hell on the echo soundings.
- But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe?
Soviet-era?
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.
Considerably larger than anything we know they built back then.
But herds the spooky pan.
The ice surrounding the object...
...it's nearly twenty thousand years old.
Miss Lane?
Try not to wander.
Temperatures drop to minus 40 at night around here.
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.
And there you go.
What if I need to tinkle?
There's a bucket in the corner.
Where the hell are you going?
Hello?
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right.
You're hemorrhaging internally...
...and if I don't cauterize this bleed...
How can...?
I can do things that other people can't.
Now hold my hand.
This is gonna hurt.
What Colonel Hardy and his team surmised...
...was a Soviet-era submarine...
...was actually something much more exotic.
An isotope analysis of the surrounding ice bores suggests that an object...
...had been trapped in the glacier for over 18,000 years.
As for my rescuer?
He disappeared during the object's departure...
A background check revealed that his work history...
...and identity had been falsified.
The questions raised by my rescuer's...
...existence are frightening to contemplate...
...but I also know what I saw.
"And I have arrived at the inescapable conclusion...
...that the object and its occupant...
...did not originate on Earth."
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.
What about the contractors who corroborated...
- ...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.
Of course they are. They're supposed to.
It's the Pentagon.
Perry, it's me we're talking about.
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.
You're under contract.
I'm not running a story about aliens walking among us.
Never gonna happen.
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.
I'm sending you the article.
My editor won't print it, but if it leaked online...
Got it.
But didn't you once describe my site...
...as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?
I stand by my words, Woodburn, but I want this story...
- ...out there.
- Why?
Because I want my mystery man to know I know the truth.
Recursive diagnostics complete...
Guiding presence authenticated.
All systems operational.
To see you standing there having grown into an adult...
If only Lara could have witnessed this.
Who are you?
I am your father, Kal.
Or at least a shadow of him.
His consciousness.
My name was Jor-El.
And Kal?
That's my name.
Kal-El. It is.
I have so many questions.
Where do I come from?
Why did you send me here?
You came from Krypton.
A world with a much harsher environment than Earths.
Long ago...
...in an era of expansion...
...our race spread out through the stars...
...seeking new worlds to settle upon.
This scout ship was one of thousands launched into the void.
We built outposts on other planets... musing great machines to reshape environments to our needs.
For 100,000 years, our civilization flourished...
...accomplishing wonders.
What happened?
Artificial population control was established.
The outposts on space exploration were abandoned.
We exhausted our natural resources.
As a result, our planet's core became unstable.
Eventually, our military leader...
...General Zod, attempted a coup.
But by then it was too late.
Your mother and I foresaw the coming calamity...
...and we took certain steps to ensure your survival.
This is a genesis chamber.
All Kryptonians were conceived in chambers such as this.
Every child was designed to fulfill a pre-determined role in our society...
...as a worker...
...a warrior, a leader and so on.
Your mother and I believed Krypton lost something precious.
The element of choice, of chance.
What if a child dreamed of becoming something... mother than what society had intended for him or her?
What if a child aspired to something greater?
You were the embodiment of that belief, Kal.
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.
That's why we risked so much to save you.
Why didn't you come with me?
We couldn't, Kal.
No matter how much...
...we wanted to.
No matter how much we loved you.
Your mother, Lara, and I...
...were a product of the failures of our world as much as Zod was...
...tied to its fate.
- So I'm alone.
- No.
You're as much a child of Earth now as you are of Krypton.
You can embody the best of both worlds.
A dream your mother and I dedicated our lives to preserve.
The people of Earth are different from us, it's true.
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.
They won't necessarily make the same mistakes we did.
Not if you guide them, Kal.
Not if you give them hope.
That's what this symbol means.
The symbol of the house of El means hope.
Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief...
...in the potential of every person to be a force for good.
That's what you can bring them.
Why am I so different from them?
Earth's sun is younger and brighter than Krypton's was.
Your cells have drunken its radiation...
...strengthening your muscles, your skin, your senses.
Earth's gravity is weaker, yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.
You've grown stronger here than I ever could have imagined.
The only way to know how strong...
...is to keep testing your limits.
Unh!
Uh... Oh.
Whoa!
You will give the people of Earth an ideal lo strive towards.
They'll race behind you.
They will stumble.
They will fall.
But In time...
...they will join you in the sun, Kal.
In time...
you will help them accomplish wonders.
How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks?
You start with the urban legends...
- ...that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe.
The friends of a friend...
- ...who have seen him.
- He worked here.
For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher...
...a ghost who never quite fit in.
Well, I was saying we were...
...coming towards the oil rig.
As you work your way back in time, the stories form a pattern.
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...
Pete Ross?
I'd like to talk to you about an accident when you were younger.
A school bus that went into the river.
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.
Mrs. Kent?
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.
Quiet.
I'm from the Daily Planet and I'd like to talk to you about your son.
I figured if I turned over enough stones you'd eventually find me.
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?
Let me tell your story.
What if I don't want my story told?
It's going to come out eventually.
Somebody's going to get a photograph or figure out where you live.
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear...
...is to stop helping people altogether, and I sense that's not an option for you.
My father believed that if the world found out who I really was...
...they'd reject me...
...out of fear.
I'm tired of safe.
I just wanna do something useful with my life.
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?
I didn't say that.
Our family's been farming for five generations.
Your family, not mine.
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.
You're just some guy who found me in a field.
Clark.
It's all right, Martha.
He's right. Clark has a point.
We're not your parents.
But we've been doing the best we can.
And we've been making this up as we go along, so maybe...
Maybe our best isn't good enough anymore.
Look, Dad...
Hold on.
Go for the overpass.
Go for the overpass!
Take cover! Take cover!
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.
She's stuck.
Hank's still in the car.
Hank's in the car.
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.
Get your mom to the overpass.
Hank! Hank! Come!
Jonathan!
- Mom, ifs okay.
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.
Dad!
I let my father die because I trusted him.
Because he was convinced that I had to wait.
That the world was not ready.
What do you think?
You better watch out, Lois.
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.
He knows you're Woodburn's anonymous source and cannot wait to rip you a new one.
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.
I told you not to run with this, and what do you do?
You let Woodburn just shotgun it all over the Internet.
Now the publishers want me to sue you.
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.
Whoa, just like that?
Yep.
What happened to your leads?
They didn't pan out. The story is smoke.
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?
Two weeks leave...
...no pay, that's your penance.
You try something like this again...
- ...you're done here.
- Fine.
Let's make it three weeks since you're so willing to agree.
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.
I believe you saw something, Lois.
But not for a moment do I believe that your leads just went cold.
So whatever your reasons are for dropping it...
...I think you're doing the right thing.
Why?
Can you imagine how people on this planet would react...
...if they knew there was someone like this out there?
Go get him.
Well, look at you.
A reporter came by here.
She's a friend. Don't worry.
Oh.
Mom.
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What?
- I found them.
- Who?
My parents.
My People.
I know where I come from now.
Wow.
That's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you, Clark.
- What?
- It's nothing.
When you were a baby I used to lay by your crib at night...
...listening to you breathe.
It was hard for you.
You struggled.
And I worried all the time.
You worried the truth would come out.
No.
The truth about you is beautiful.
We saw that the moment we laid eyes on you.
We knew that one day, the whole world would see that.
I'm just...
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.
I promise.
General Swanwick, sir.
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?
Comets don't make course corrections, general.
Wanted you to see this before some amateur with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.
The ship appears to have...
...inserted itself into a lunar synchronous orbit...
...though I have no idea why.
Have you tried... communicating with it?
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.
I'm just speculating, but I think whoever's at the helm of that thing...
...is looking to make a dramatic entrance.
Anybody know where we keep the toner?
- What's going on?
- It's all over the news.
You gotta see this.
Clark.
Yeah?
Coming.
This is a breaking news. An unidentified...
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.
You are not alone.
It's on my phone too.
My name is General Zod.
I come from a world far from yours.
I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you.
For some time, your world has sheltered one of my citizens.
I request that you return this individual...
...to my custody.
For reasons unknown, he has chosen to keep his existence...
...a secret from you.
He will have made efforts to blend in.
He will look like you.
But he is not one of you.
To those of you who may know...
...of his current location...
...the fate of your planet...
...rests in your hands.
To Kai-El, I say this:
Surrender within 24 hours...
...or watch this world suffer the consequences...
Ah!
We hardly know anything about him, isn't that right?
If he truly means us no harm...
...he'll turn himself in and face the consequences.
And if he won't do that...
...then maybe we should.
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane knows who this guy is. She's...
...the one we should be questioning.
- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane...
- Hello?
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.
The entire world is being threatened here.
This is not time for you to fall...
...back on journalistic integrity.
This is serious, Lois.
The FBI is here. They're throwing around words like "treason."
I gotta go.
FBI. Hands up.
Drop the bag. Now.
Regarding the visitors themselves we know...
...very little.
According to government officials...
...the visitors do not represent a threat...
...despite the ominous tone of their message.
Then of course there's the question on everyone's mind:
"Who is this Kai-El person?
Does he actually exist?"
"How could he have remained hidden from us for so long?"
Come on, Kent.
Come on. Fight back.
Get up, Kent.
So is that it?
Is that all you've got?
Come on, Kent.
Come on!
Did they hurl you?
You know they can't.
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him bad.
I know you did. I mean...
...part of me even wanted you to, but then what?
Make you feel any better?
You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark.
Because whoever that man is, good character or bad, he's...
He's gonna change the world.
What's on your mind?
I don't know where to start.
Wherever you want.
That ship that appeared last night.
I'm the one they're looking for.
Do you know...
...why they want you?
No. But this General Zod...
...even if I surrender, there's no guarantee he'll keep his word, but...
...if there's a chance I can save Earth by turning myself in...
...shouldn't I take it?
What does your gut tell you?
Zod can't be trusted.
The problem is...
...I'm not sure the people of Earth can be either.
Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first.
The trust part comes later.
All right. You've got our attention.
What is it you want?
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.
What makes you think she's here?
Don't play games with me, general.
I'll surrender, but only if you guarantee Lois's freedom.
Why are you surrendering to Zod?
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.
You let them handcuff you?
Wouldn't be much of a surrender if I resisted.
And if it makes them feel more secure...
...then all the better for it.
What's the S stand for?
It's not an S.
On my world it means hope.
Well, here, it's an S.
How about...
...Super...
Sir?
- Hi, my name is Dr. E...
- Emil Hamilton.
I know, I can see your ID tag in your breast pocket.
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.
I can also see the soldiers in the next room...
...preparing that tranquilizing agent of yours.
You won't need it.
Sir, you can't expect us to not take precautions.
You could be carrying some kind of alien pathogen.
Been here for 33 years, doctor.
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...
...security concerns. You revealed your identity to Miss Lane over there.
Why won't you do the same with us?
Let's put our cards on the table here, general.
You're scared because you can't control me.
You don't, and you never will.
But that doesn't' mean I'm your enemy.
Then who is?
Zod?
That's what I'm worried about.
Be that as it may...
...I've been given orders to hand you over to him.
Do what you have to do, general.
Thank you.
For what?
For believing in me.
Didn't make much difference in the end.
It did to me.
They're coming.
You should leave now.
Go, Lois.
Kal-El.
I'm sub-commander Faora-UI.
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.
General Zod would like this woman...
...to accompany me.
You asked for the alien.
You didn't say anything about one of our own.
Shall I tell the general you're unwilling to comply?
I don't care what you tell him.
It's all right.
I'll go.
The atmospheric composition on our ship is not compatible with humans.
You need to wear a breather...
...beyond this point.
Kal-El.
You have no idea how long...
...we've been searching for you.
I take it you're Zod?
General Zod.
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.
He's a stranger to our ways.
This should be cause...
...for celebration, not conflict.
- Unh.
- Not conflict.
I...
...feel strange.
Weak.
What's happening to him?
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.
Clark.
You've spent a lifetime adapting to Earth's ecology...
...but never adapted to ours.
Help him.
I can't. Whatever's happening...
- ...has to run its course.
- Clark.
Help him.
Help him.
Hello, Kal.
Or do you prefer Clark?
That's the name they gave you.
Isn't it?
I was Krypton's military leader...
...your father our foremost scientist.
The only thing we agreed on...
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...
...to protect our civilization...
...and save our planet...
...I and my fellow officers were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.
And then the destruction of our world...
...freed us.
We were adrift, destined to float...
...amongst the ruins of our planet...
...until we starved.
How did you find your way to Earth?
We managed to retrofit the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.
Your father made a similar modification to the craft that brought you here.
And so the instrument of our damnation...
...became our salvation.
We sought out the old colonial outposts...
...looking for signs of life.
But all we found was death.
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...
...withered and died long ago.
We salvaged what we could...
...armor, weapons...
...even a world engine.
For 33 years we prepared...
...until finally we detected a distress beacon...
...which you triggered...
...when you accessed the ancient scout ship.
You led us here, Kal.
Now it's within your power...
...to save what remains of your race.
On Krypton...
...the genetic template for every being yet to be born...
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.
Your father stole the registry's Codex...
...and stored it in the capsule that brought you here.
For what purpose?
So that Krypton can live again...
...on Earth.
Where is the Codex, Kal?
If Krypton lives again...
...what happens to Earth?
The foundation has to be built on something.
Even your father recognized that.
No, Zod.
I can't be a part of this.
Then what can you be a part of?
No!
Zod!
No!
No!
Your father acquitted...
...himself with honor, Kal.
You killed him?
I did.
And not a day goes by where it doesn't haunt me.
But if I had to do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people...
...and I will not allow anyone to prevent me from carrying it out.
What's the sit-rep, major?
DSP pinged two bogeys launching from the alien ship.
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.
There it is.
Re-task IKon-4...
- ...and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.
Command, the word...
...of the day is trident.
We have two alien craft on aggressive approach.
Ikon-4 coming online.
Air speed?
380 knots, entering Kansas...
...airspace.
Not responding to our hails.
You're wasting your efforts.
The strength you derived from the Earth's sun...
...has been neutralized aboard our ship.
Here...
...in this environment...
...you are as weak as a human.
Unh!
Unh!
Where did you come from?
The command key, Miss Lane.
Thanks to you, I'm uploading to the ship's mainframe.
Who are you?
I am Kai's father.
Can you help us?
I designed this ship.
I can modify its atmospheric composition...
...to human compatibility.
We can stop them.
We can send them back to the Phantom Zone.
How?
I can teach you.
And in turn, you can teach Kal.
Will you help me?
The ship's crew are alerted.
We need to move quickly.
Retrieve the command key.
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.
What's happening?
To your right.
Fire.
Behind you.
Secure yourself inside the open pod.
Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely...
...we'll see each other again.
Remember, the phantom drives are essential in stopping them.
Move your head to the left.
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?
Strike that panel.
We wanted you to learn...
...what it meant to be human first...
...so that one day, when the time was right, you could be the bridge...
...between two peoples.
Look.
Lois.
You can save her, Kal.
You can save all of them.
You'll be safe here.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna tell them anything, but they did something to me.
- They looked inside my mind...
- It's okay, Lois.
They did the same thing to me.
Clark!
The craft he arrived in...
...where is it?
Go to hell.
There.
Unh!
The Codex is not here.
Argh!
Ah!
Where has he hidden it?
I don't know.
Where is the Codex?!
Ahh!
You think you can threaten my mother?!
Ah!
What have you done to me?
My parents taught me to hone...
...my senses, Zod.
Focus...
...on just what I wanted to see.
Without your helmet...
...you're getting everything.
Unh!
And it hurts...
...doesn't it?
Argh!
Get away from the window.
Get inside. It's not safe.
All players, this is
Guardian. I am airborne mission commander.
I have previously encountered and observed...
...the beings we're about to engage.
They are extremely dangerous and we have been authorized...
...to use deadly force.
Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target.
Cleared hot. Weapons free.
Copy, 11. Weapons free.
Thunder 11...
...tally three targets.
Unh!
Thunder 11...
...good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.
Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run...
...on a heading of 212 degrees.
Thunder 11, eject!
Eject!
Thunder 11, eject!
I have a bogey incoming!
Oh, shit.
Argh!
You are weak...
...son of El.
Unsure of yourself.
The fact that you possess a sense of morality...
...and we do not...
...gives us an evolutionary advantage.
And if history has proven anything...
...it is that evolution always wins.
Ragh!
Unh!
CCT, we're approaching...
...LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.
Let's go. Go to the LZ.
Roger, sarge. let's go!
All rangers, I need you...
...to engage the targets.
Guardian, this is Badger 01.
What about the guy in blue?
I said engage...
...all targets.
Contact. Contact.
Ah!
You okay?
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.
Brace for impact.
Brace for impact.
We're going in hard!
Fallen angel. Fallen angel. Guardian is down.
I repeat, Guardian is down.
Guardian, do you read?
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.
- Do you read?
- Thunder 12...
...this is Guardian.
Put down everything you've got north of my position.
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.
Good luck, sir.
A good death is its own reward.
You will not win.
For every human you save...
...we will kill a million more. Unh!
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?
Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team.
Do you copy? Alpha team.
This man is not our enemy.
Thank you, colonel.
Mom?
I'm all right.
Nice suit, son.
I'm so sorry.
It's only stuff, Clark.
It can always be replaced.
But you can't be.
Mom, Zod said this Codex...
...he's looking for can bring my people back.
Isn't that a good thing?
I don't think they're interested in sharing this world.
Clark.
Clark.
I know how to stop them.
What happened down there?
He exposed a temporary weakness.
It is of little consequence...
...because I have located the Codex.
It was never in the capsule.
Jor-el took the Codex...
...the DNA of a billion people, then he bonded it...
...within his son's individual...
...cells.
All of Krypton's heirs...
...living hidden in one refugee's body.
Does Kal-El need to be alive...
...for us to extract the
Codex from his cells?
No.
Release the world engine.
What just happened?
The ship just split in two.
Track one is heading east, track two to the southern hemisphere.
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching...
...Mach 24 and accelerating.
It's gonna impact somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
The rest of the ship is descending.
Put it on the board now.
Yes, sir.
Oh, my God.
Bring the phantom drive online.
We are now slave to the world engine.
Initiate.
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity...
...weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.
Somehow they're increasing the Earth's mass...
...clouding the atmosphere with particulates.
Oh, my God.
They're terraforming.
What's that?
Planetary engineering...
...modifying the Earth's atmosphere and topography.
Turning Earth into Krypton.
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...
...there won't be an "us."
General Swanwick, sir.
I'm on with the control tower.
Colonel Hardy's on his way and he's got Superman in tow.
Superman?
The alien, sir.
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.
We have a plan, general.
Is that what I think it is?
It's the ship he arrived in.
This ship is powered by something called a phantom drive.
It bends space.
Zod's ship uses the same technology, and if we can make the two drives collide...
A singularity can be created.
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.
So if we open up this doorway...
...they should be pulled back in.
So you want us to bomb them with that?
General, that craft maxes out...
...17,000 pounds, we can drop it from a C-17.
It's a viable plan.
If I don't stop that machine over the Indian Ocean...
...the gravity field will continue...
...to expand.
If that thing is making Earth more like Krypton...
...won't you be weaker around it?
Maybe.
I'm not about to let that stop me from trying.
You might want to step back a little bit.
Maybe a little bit more.
Faora.
Take command.
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...
...and pay my respects to an old friend.
Guardian en route to Metropolis...
...package in tow.
Be advised,
F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.
You should have visual contact now.
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.
Stop this, Zod...
...while there's still time.
Haven't given up lecturing me, have you, even in death?
I will not let you use the Codex like this.
You don't have the power to stop me.
The command key I have entered is revoking your authority.
This ship is now under my control.
Northcom, Lightning 1, request...
...permission to unleash the hounds.
Lightning 1...
...you are clear to engage. Send battle damage assessment when able. Out.
Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field...
...is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.
All right, everybody...
...we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.
I just lost my wingman.
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Everybody, this way! Come on!
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.
Jenny!
Oh, my God.
Perry!
Go! There! Go!
Our people can co-exist.
So we can suffer through years of pain trying to adapt like your son has?
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.
We're both ghosts, Zod.
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.
Ship, have you managed to quarantine this invasive intelligence?
- You'll fail.
- I have.
Then prepare to terminate it.
- I'm tired of this debate.
Silencing me...
...won't change anything.
My son...
...is twice the man you were.
And he will finish what we started.
I can promise you that.
Tell me...
...you have Jor-El's memories, his conscience.
Can you experience...
...his pain?
I will harvest the Codex from your son's corpse...
...and I will rebuild Krypton...
...atop his bones.
Argh!
Jenny.
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm stuck.
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.
No, no, no!
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.
- Okay.
- Lombard!
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.
Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay?
Go.
- Push!
- Oh, my God.
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?
Negative, Guardian.
Come on! Push!
Ahh!
Argh!
He did it.
Northcom, this is Guardian.
We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.
Godspeed, Guardian.
Arm the package. You are cleared hot.
We're lining up for the final run.
It's up to you and Hamilton now.
You gotta be kidding me.
Loadmaster, is the package...
...ready to drop?
Negative, Guardian.
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.
What's it supposed to do?
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.
Co-pilot's aircraft.
Co-pilot's aircraft.
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?
We've had a setback.
Target that aircraft.
Target locked.
Stop!
If you destroy this ship...
...you destroy Krypton!
Krypton had its chance.
Argh!
Miss Lane! It's not safe for you...
...over there!
Miss Lane!
Ah!
Move now! Go!
A good death...
...is its own reward.
Ah!
Ah!
Argh!
Are they gone?
I think so.
He saved us.
You know, they say it's all downhill after the first kiss.
I'm pretty sure that only counts when you're kissing a human.
Look at this.
We could have built a new Krypton...
...in this squalor.
But you chose the humans over us.
I exist...
...only to protect Krypton.
That is the sole purpose for which I was born.
And every action I take...
...no matter how violent...
...or how cruel...
...is for the greater good...
...of my people.
And now...
...I have no people.
My soul...
...that is what you have taken...
...from me.
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...
- ...one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...
...and I'm gonna stop you.
Argh!
Argh!
There's only...
...one way this ends, Kal.
Either you die...
...or I do.
Unh!
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.
Trained my entire life...
...to master my senses.
Where did you train? On a farm?
Argh!
If you love...
...these people so much...
...you can mourn for them.
Don't do this!
Stop!
Stop!
Never.
Ahh!
Are you effing stupid?
It's one of your surveillance drones.
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.
It was.
I know you're trying to find out where I hang my cape.
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask...
...the obvious question:
How do we know you won't one day act against America's interests?
I grew up in Kansas, general.
I'm about as American as it gets.
Look...
...I'm here to help...
...but it has to be on my own terms.
You have to convince Washington of that.
Even if I were willing to try, what makes you think they'd listen?
I don't know, general.
Guess I'll just have to trust you.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing, sir.
I just think he's kind of hot.
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.
He always believed you were meant for greater things.
And that when the day came...
...your shoulders would be able to bear the weight.
Yeah, I just wish he could have been here to see it finally happen.
He saw it, Clark, believe me.
What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.
I gotta find a job where I can keep my ear to the ground.
Where people won't look twice...
...when I want to go somewhere dangerous and start asking questions...
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?
Courtside seats to the game tonight.
- What do you say?
- I say...
...you should go back to trolling the intern pool.
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.
Courtside?
- Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.
Good luck, kid.
Hey. Steve.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
Hi.
Lois Lane.
Welcome to the Planet.
Glad to be here, Lois.
Now, the Book of
Revelation tells us the Rapture is the literal, physical bodily coming of
Christ in the clouds to snatch out of this world all believers, the dead and living who were in Christ our Lord, amen.
Those sinners who remain on Earth shall face torments and suffer beyond their wildest nightmares.
Who are these people?
Well, we all know them.
Musicians, gays, gay musicians, the entire 1997 Denver Broncos, and all of Hollywood.
Um, it was incredibly freaky, to me, anyway.
I always say that Ben sort of saved the world.
He's that amazing.
Well, he says that I saved the world, but he's probably just being nice.
It doesn't matter.
That's me, looking fairly shocked.
But honestly, not that shocked, because the truth is, a lot of crazy stuff had already gone down.
Wow.
Maybe I should back up a little.
See, it all started with the Rapture.
It was league night.
I had just gotten a strike.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God!
And Ben was even more excited than me.
He usually is.
Which is why I love him.
Anyway, um...
Then, all of a sudden, half the world was totally gone.
The people who went to church and prayed and missed out on a lot of fun stuff got sucked straight up to Heaven.
And the rest of us, well, we were screwed.
We weren't believers, so I guess that's why we weren't taken.
Both my mom and Ben's mom went to church religiously.
Well, that's the only way you can go to church.
The point is, they both got raptured.
But, in the only recorded case of such a thing happening, my mother was sent back the very next day.
Mom?
Oh.
Laura.
What happened?
I don't know.
I was in Heaven.
Wait.
You got sent back?
So God, like, returned you?
Well.
I guess so. Yes.
Aw!
I was just in line.
Uh-huh.
And they were giving out massages.
And a guy butt in front of me.
He probably didn't butt.
He barged right in front of me, and he said,
"I need something in the shoulder."
Were you in the right line?
I was in the right line.
Honey, you are almost never in the right line.
Listen to me. It was unprofessional.
It was poorly organized.
You have this backwards.
You go up there to be judged.
You don't do the judging.
Mom. Aw!
I don't want to be here.
I'd hug you, but you smell like shit.
Did anybody vacuum while I was gone?
We all vacuumed.
We all vacuumed all the time.
Lots of vacuuming.
And then the torments started.
First came these little locusty things.
Ow!
I hate those little things.
Suffer! Suffer!
I am suffering, you little buttwipe!
Suffer!
You're not going anywhere, you little fucker!
If you're wondering, they were impervious to most bug sprays.
Suffer!
I got an idea!
How about you suffer?
Suffer!
Suffer!
This apocalypse is killing me!
Why? Why?
I don't know why, you Jesus freak!
Why don't you ask God?
Oh, yeah, I forgot!
He doesn't like you!
That's my parents, you guys.
I can't stand it any longer!
Good times.
Then God, in his infinite wisdom, did this really gross thing.
It just seemed so unsanitary, you know?
What is that?
Is that...
I think it's raining blood.
Blood? It's raining blood.
That's not disgusting.
What the fuck is the point of that?
There's no point!
I know.
Wipers don't work for shit.
Try the sprayer thing.
Sprayer thing.
Well, that's great.
Now it's all smeared.
The wraiths showed up about a year ago.
They went all around the world wrecking everything, and killing people.
Holy cow!
Monsters, man.
Real monsters.
Without the costumes.
Because the costumes are real, you know.
So, a lot of people died during the apocalypse.
The only one I know who came back was my neighbor!
Mr. Murphy.
We all thought it was weird that instead of chasing us around, trying to eat our delicious brains, all he did was mow his lawn.
Maybe it was on his mind when he died.
Uh, I don't know.
Finally this neighbor got so sick of it that he stole the mower.
But then Mr. Murphy just walked around without the mower.
This is sad.
Hello, Mr. Murphy.
Your lawn looks really nice.
Have a good day,
Mr. Murphy.
And just as the Bible predicted, the Antichrist finally showed up.
Nobody thought his name would be Earl Gundy, though.
Certainly not that he'd be from Idaho.
I might take you to rock bottom, but I'm going to bring you back up...
And I guess not really a surprise that the Antichrist was a politician first.
...because I'm Earl Gundy, and we can make it.
And then he gets invited to the White House.
He poisons everyone's sandwiches, and then just starts using our missiles
...evacuation of Chicago has not been fast enough.
He blew up a bunch of cities.
Chicago, Tokyo, London.
You know, just to make everybody scared of him.
We go now to Orlando.
Oh, come on!
Not Orlando!
Oh, man! Come on!
Think of all those ride operators.
They're just kids!
Oh, and he makes everyone call him "The Beast," because he thinks it makes him sound cool.
Everyone thought he was going to live in some palace in the Middle-East, but he settled right here.
In my home town.
Not biblically referenced,
Seattle.
Overall, I'd say the Book of Revelation's got most of what has happened pretty much right.
There were some things that happened that weren't predicted.
Like the foul-mouthed crows, for instance.
Strawberry jam.
Oh, nice.
That's right.
Hey, you!
Yeah, you.
Fuck you! Caw!
Ben, baby, just ignore that.
Man, I hate those guys.
I mean, why do we just let them insult us like this?
I know.
Eat shit, fucker.
Hold on. No. Mmm-mmm.
Not worth it.
Hey! Blow me!
And don't forget my balls. Caw!
Yeah, don't forget my balls, you stupid crow.
I'm sorry. You're right.
It's not worth it.
Yeah! Walk away, pussy!
Caw!
Felch me! Caw!
I just don't think that that bird knows what he's saying. Yeah.
It's just a noise coming out of their mouth.
Fuck them!
No, no, no.
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Caw!
Ben and I had this idea of starting our own sandwich cart.
Because people appreciate a good sandwich, even when the world is ending.
Maybe, especially when the world is ending.
That one is better.
That's the horseradish.
Mmm.
I couldn't find any mustard, so...
I think it goes well with it.
Yeah, it's really...
Kind of makes up for it.
Stay calm.
It's okay.
After a while, you just get used to the locusts and the blood rain, and...
Oh! And the fiery rocks falling from the sky.
Is that Trevor Burdick?
Oh, yeah.
I think it is.
Trevor, get inside, man.
I ain't scared!
Bring it on!
Wow, he's so dumb.
An idiot.
Trevor...
Mmm.
That was horrible.
Yeah. Well...
What?
No, it was horrible.
It's terrible.
What were you going to say?
Nothing.
What were you going to say?
I mean, come on, the guy is standing there with his hands up, yelling,
"Bring it on." He's stupid.
He's an idiot.
Am I wrong?
No. That's not funny. That's a...
It's human life, you know.
Dumb, dumb human life.
No, that's not funny, Ben.
That's sad.
He's a dummy.
You want to, uh...
Yeah. Later, baby. My parents are going to be home any second.
Later, like...
No.
No?
See. Home.
Kill me.
Is the therapy helping your mom at all?
Yeah. She seems to be crying a lot less.
She still says
"why" a lot, though.
Oh, that's good.
Rocks. Baby.
Come on.
Sounds close.
You go up there and he kicks you right back down.
You might as well have had the sugar.
Dad!
No!
Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why?
My eggs.
My eggs.
That day was the worst day of my life.
Which is saying something in the apocalypse.
I didn't know how to feel.
The apocalypse was hard and stressful for everybody.
My brother Clark and his idiot friend Fry were actually into it.
But I think that's because they were idiots before the Rapture, so...
Where are you going, Clark?
Oh, uh, Fry and I are gonna kayak the blood river.
I don't think that's a good idea, Clark.
Whatever.
Clark!
Hey, Clark.
Hey, buddy. Be careful out on the river, okay?
Because your mom could seriously not handle anything bad...
Dude, suck it.
Keep any open wounds covered.
Later, asswipe.
Asswipe!
Be careful of the wraiths, Clark.
The wraiths have been here a while now, and they're still bad,
I guess.
Like, some of them still work for The Beast.
But a lot of them are basically unemployed, and they don't really have anything to do.
So, a lot of them have become serious potheads.
You know, joints or a bag.
Dude, forget it.
You still didn't pay for the last bag.
Look, I'll pay you.
No. Forget it.
I will destroy you.
We will destroy you.
Wow, I'm so scared right now.
Just one joint, man.
Fuck! Fine, here you go.
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks, bro.
Do you ever fucking bathe?
Are you still seeing Catherine?
Yeah, she's intense.
You shouldn't let bitches push you around.
Everyone was struggling to get by now, except the people who made a deal with the devil.
I mean, they were on his payroll.
And you've recently split from your wife of eight years, Kimberlee, why?
Well, she's kind of a stupid, vapid whore, Liz.
I'm just kidding.
And now she's off in Los
Angeles trying to be an actress.
Good luck.
I prefer to be right here in Seattle.
Go Mariners.
Are there any romantic prospects for The Beast?
The problem with most of the women
I meet is that they are all sluts, you know.
And I'm looking for somebody who is, uh, old fashioned.
The girl next door.
With a nice rack and a nice round...
See. Right there.
I can't see you.
I'm right there behind him.
Right there with the mustache.
Oh, yeah.
Not bad, huh?
Your old man's on global
TV there, Benjamin.
If you ask my opinion, the guy has gotten a bad rap.
He's the Antichrist, Dad.
"He's the Antichrist.
He's the Antichrist."
I'm just saying, he has done a couple of good things, so sue me.
Like what?
Seriously, like what?
Okay, well, for instance, um,
He is the most evil individual who has ever lived, Mr. H.
"The most evil individual who has ever lived" is paying the bills around here.
I'm just saying, he's not as bad as everybody says. That's all.
He blew up Chicago, Mr. H.
I am not saying I support everything he has done, Lindsey.
I was totally against that, and I said so at the time.
There is no good reason to blow up Chicago.
Except for the food, the weather, and the people.
Okay. Now, you are defending him blowing up Chicago.
No, I'm not, Ben.
I'm just providing context.
You know what?
You guys should come work with me.
Then, you would see the deal.
No, we are not going to be
Beastly Guards, Dad.
You don't have to be a Beastly Guard.
You could work in the shop.
And you could do the kitchen with the other gals.
Yeah, a couple of guys just quit.
Well, they didn't quit, per se. They were laid off.
Let go. Killed.
Look, they were working against him, Ben.
I mean, what's he supposed to do?
Give them a raise?
You are so morally lost.
Hey! Kiddo, I'm just saying that's the way the world works, and you are not exactly raking in the dough at the homeless shelter.
Somebody has to help those people, Mr. H.
Are you trying to be good or something so that you get raptured?
Because,
I'm telling you, kids, that was a one-time dealy, okay?
And this one up here, forget about it.
You are not going anywhere with all the carrying on in your room.
You'd think masturbating powered the lights around here.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere either, Ben, okay?
Your mommy is going to be up there all by her lonesome.
I miss you, babe.
We are going to work on the sandwich cart. Uh-huh.
Hey, health insurance.
Dental.
They cover acupuncture,
Lindsey.
Thanks for the pizza.
"Thanks for the pizza."
I never liked you.
Kids.
World's Most
Embarrassing Raptures.
Ha! The rapture show is on.
What the fuck?
This guy is on a toilet.
I saw it coming and I still laughed.
You know, I was thinking, if this goes well, and we make a little money,
I think we should move out of our parents' and get a place together.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Maybe get married and start a family.
I mean, would you really want kids?
In a world like this?
Things are bound to get better at some point, right? So...
Maybe that point is right now.
Just humor me.
I'll humor you.
Come on.
Come inside.
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck?
I'm fucking done with this shit!
No. Come on. Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
I really, really loved that food cart idea, Ben. I did, I did. I did.
I very much wanted to see you kids succeed at that, but let's not kid ourselves here.
It is not easy to make money these days.
Well, we're only going to do it until we have enough money to rebuild the cart, Dad.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
A month, max.
But people will tell you cardio all the time.
And...
There he is. Hey.
How is it going today?
Oh, let's see.
Oh, this is yours.
Yeah.
"Dickhead."
Says it right there.
No. That's not what it says.
Who are these?
This is my son and his girlfriend.
Just bringing them to work today.
Your father's an asshole.
Just so you know.
We have fun.
No, we don't.
He's just having fun.
No, I'm not.
A real joker this one.
Not with this guy.
We've got a minivan coming in.
It's not a minivan.
Soccer mom coming through.
Not a minivan.
Okay. Well, fuck you.
Oh, really? Fuck me?
Fuck you!
A real asshole.
Now, The Beast isn't here, so everything is kind of chill.
Pretty cool of your old man to be showing you around on his day off, huh?
I am going to put you kids by the pool area.
It's a very kick back assignment.
You are going to love it.
Hey, Margie, flowers look great.
Don't look anybody in the eye, okay?
I'm serious.
Don't look anybody in the eye.
This is it. This is the pool.
Gorgeous, huh?
Now, you gotta be careful, because there are landmines all over the place.
Holy dick and balls.
What is it?
The Beast.
He's coming down.
What for?
I have no idea.
Okay, but listen. Whatever he says, you just say yes.
Let's go, guys.
Line it up.
So, don't say anything.
Don't even say yes.
Okay, I'll say yes.
Walt.
Hey, Morgan.
No matter what happens, you say yes.
I know the deal.
"I know the deal."
All clear here, boss!
Well, what a treat for me.
Delightful to meet you, young man.
A real chip off the old block.
And you are handsome and intelligent...
Little Beast has some special requirements for the pool area.
Uh... I'm sorry?
The pool area.
You heard me say pool area, right?
Yes.
Where are we standing right now?
The pool area.
Yeah.
The motherfucking pool!
Shut up!
Okay.
But I'm not...
Yeah.
Are you dumb or just stupid?
Yeah, of course.
The pool area.
What can I do you for?
Tell him what you want,
Little Beast.
- The Beast.
- Hey, Earl!
You never call me back!
Kim. Slow down.
Tell him what you want.
I want a big slide.
Okay.
Hey, Earl...
My name is not Earl, okay.
It's Beast.
I don't give a shit what you call yourself.
You're still an asshole.
I will fuck your shit up!
Goodbye, Kimberlee.
Don't you fucking hang up on me! Don't you...
I hate you!
I wish you were dead.
Very funny.
Right back at you, kid.
We need this done by next week. You got it?
Yes. Of course.
Go back to the cart,
Little Beast.
Next week.
Who's your assistant, contractor? Huh?
Oh! Nobody.
That's my son, Ben.
No. Not Rachel Maddow.
That is his girlfriend,
Lindsey.
I'm a pool contractor now?
Shut your mouth.
What am I supposed to do?
This is what I deal with every day.
Welcome, Lindsey.
Uh, thank you.
Can I get you anything?
Some iced tea?
Mocha? Latte?
Hot dog?
Corn on the cob? Sausage?
Other dick-shaped food?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Yes. Yes, you are.
Mmm.
He's a children's asshole, but he's an asshole.
You son of a bitch.
Thanks for leaving me out to dry.
Do you want to go for a walk around the premises?
Oh...
I just...
I'm not a man you want to say no to, my dear.
Oh.
Come on.
Come. Come. No pun intended.
Okay, pun very much intended.
I won't bite you. Come on.
Okay.
Back to work, contractor.
Yes, sir.
Back to the house,
Little Beast.
But, Dad!
Get the fuck back in the house now! Fucker.
Fuck!
We are traveling.
We are traveling.
Fuck!
Fuck!
No, this is bullshit.
Don't.
Don't.
No, but...
Don't.
Listen, these people will kill you as soon as look at you.
I'm not going to let the Antichrist steal my girlfriend, Dad.
Oh, come on.
What are you going to do?
Challenge him to a fight?
I don't know.
But I'm going to do something.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
Look, they're just talking.
You need to believe in me, Dad. Oh.
Believe in you, Ben?
Really?
Yes!
Come on!
You are delicious.
You know that?
I bet your vagina tastes like pistachio mint ice cream.
Low fat.
Tell me, Lindsey, what's a gorgeous girl like yourself doing in a job like this?
Well, my boyfriend,
Ben, and I...
Ex-boyfriend.
I'm just kidding.
Not really. Go ahead.
Yeah, we were starting this sandwich business and, um, our cart got crushed by one of those falling rocks.
Ooh.
Bad luck.
Right. So, now we're just working with his dad.
Bad luck for you, but good luck for me. Huh?
You look like a cross between
Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank.
Did anyone ever tell you that, Lindsey?
No.
You got to be kidding me.
What did you say? Scarlett Johansson,
Hilary Swank. Fucking, yeah...
Shut up.
Both lovely ladies with lovely racks, like yourself.
I have a wonderful, spontaneous idea.
Let's have sex in these bushes right here.
What?
Yeah. What do you think?
Don't fight the impulse now, Lindsey.
Uh... No, I don't...
That's okay. No, thank you.
I really don't want to do that.
What?
I don't want to do that.
Why not?
I think you do.
No, I don't.
Come on. Why not?
So many reasons. I, uh...
I just don't do that.
You don't what?
What are you, a virgin?
You are?
Really?
Well, yeah.
Whoa! A virgin?
Whoo! Did you hear that?
They are hard to find.
Winner! You a virgin?
That's great.
Honey need a little slap.
Girl's going to give it up to you, sir.
Shut your mouth!
I'm so sorry.
Where are your sunglasses?
Mine fell in the koi pond.
It's not a big deal.
No, it is to me. Yeah.
You got to take it to the hole, sir.
Mmm-hmm.
I probably shouldn't have said anything.
No, I get it. You want your first time to be special, beautiful.
Yeah.
And so it will be.
I promise you, your first time, no anal.
This way, my dear.
I don't care, Dad.
I'm going to punch that guy in the face.
Ben, come on.
Be reasonable.
No, I am.
Ow!
Oh, shit.
We just met though, so...
And at first, I swear, I thought you were just another hot piece of ass, but a virgin! Ohhh!
That is really something.
Fuck you all.
That's rude.
You know, I'm no good at this type of thing, but...
Fuck it. Marry me, Lindsey.
Marry me and become the mother of my evil offspring.
What?
I know!
Call me impetuous.
Call me an incurable romantic, but something in my gut tells me you're the one for me.
Okay, you already have a son, though.
Little Beast is a dud.
I need more children, a mini-bus full, you know?
You all right, Ben?
You hit me with a shovel?
Only a little bit.
You are having reservations, aren't you, my dear?
Yes.
I can tell.
This is a horse.
It's big.
I want to show you something, Lindsey.
Not that. Not yet.
You will see my penis later.
Oh.
I am going to get that guy.
Ben, come on!
What? Are you going to hit me again?
Shit. Shit.
I gotta get him out of here.
I know exactly what you are worried about, Lindsey.
You do?
"But, Mr. Beast.
"As much as I'm attracted to you, and I am.
"The truth is, I'm scared.
"If I marry you and become your evil queen,
"won't people despise me?
"Won't I become a target, just like you?
"And unlike you, if I'm killed,
I won't return as 'Satan.'"
Why am I using air quotes?
I will be Satan.
Yeah, um, actually...
Hey, hey, hey...
You will become a target, but there is a weapon here that very few people know about.
That's a...
Yes.
A real live
XGLTLGL laser beam.
Or something.
All right.
See, there's this rumor going around, this prediction of sorts, that before long, someone who shall remain nameless,
Jesus, is going to come down from the sky and vanquish me.
Oh.
Yeah. But I don't think so.
Oh! Oh, wow!
Do you see that crow?
Hey, fuckers. Toss my salad!
Okay.
Primer set.
Whoo!
Yeah! Bam!
Yeah! Toss my salad, crow! Suck my balls!
That big motherfucker up there has no idea who he is dealing with.
I call it my you-know-who buster.
Uh-huh.
Excuse me.
Oh.
So, you see, my dear, you will be perfectly safe here with me.
So, what do you say?
No!
Thank you.
Fine. All right.
I understand. Um...
Of course, I've got to kill everyone you know, starting with your boyfriend and his father.
What?
Your choice, my dear.
No, wait! Uh...
If I could just have a little time to think about it.
Of course.
You have eight hours.
And in that time, if you are not back here, ready to marry me and bear my evil children,
I will kill everyone you know.
Sound fair?
Okay.
Ohhh! I feel so good about this, don't you?
Take the rest of the day off, Lindsey.
Get ready for tonight.
Paint your toenails, trim your bush, bleach your asshole, douche, whatever.
Eight hours, remember?
Ohhh.
Don't trim your bush too much now.
Okay.
Adieu, Lindsey, adieu.
Bye.
Toodle-oo!
Slow this bitch down!
It's fucking with my vertigo, motherfucker.
Jesus, Dad.
I'm not saying it's good or right, Benjamin.
I'm just saying he's the Antichrist, here, and you are you.
Thank you.
You know what I'm saying.
He's like a god.
Which is ironic, if you think about it.
Maybe Lindsey will like it. Huh?
Lindsey is not going to like it.
How do you know?
Because she likes me. Right?
You don't like him.
Hey, how do we know anything?
No! I know she likes me!
"I know she likes me."
That's what you sound like right now.
Why would you mock me?
You are such a terrible father.
Hey, Linds.
Um...
I just wanted to say that you know, ever since your father was squashed by a big giant rock,
I feel like a father to you.
You know?
And as your father,
I feel like
I just have to say
I just think you have to go with The Beast here.
Thanks for the advice.
And of course, if you don't, and he kills Ben and I, and not to mention your mom and your brother, and who knows who else, then as long as you are happy with that, that is all that matters.
You know?
Because that means your honor was more important to you than we are.
She is not going to go with The Beast, Dad.
I know, Ben.
I know.
Your mom is going to have a meltdown.
We're cursed,
Lindsey! Cursed!
Why! Why, Lindsey?
Why are we so cursed?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Maybe because you are so annoying?
I am not annoying, Clark.
I am a woman with feelings.
Oh, my God! I'm going to be in-laws with the Antichrist.
Poor me. I like to cry all the time.
I hate Clark.
Mom, just deal with it, okay? God!
Why!
Clark, be nicer to Mom.
Okay, Linds, what's your problem?
This is what you gotta do.
You go with this Beast guy, you have a great night out, and at the end, you fucking knife the shit out of him.
If I knife him he comes back as Satan.
Okay, then fucking knife Satan, too.
I don't know.
Just keep on knifing him, don't stop.
That's not going to work.
Oh, uh, my sister's supposed to marry The Beast.
Oh, congrats, Linds, that's great.
No, we're going to kill him.
Yeah, I just said that.
She should fucking knife him.
Fucking knife him.
Just grab a knife and...
Just fucking knife him in the chest and watch his insides pour out.
Vick, I told you not to come here before 2:00.
You got a serious problem with pot.
You know that, wraith?
What? Me? Come on, guys.
It's me! Vick!
When was the last time you went one day without weed?
Um... Yesterday.
Really?
If you are going to do this much you should get a vaporizer.
Okay. I know.
It's a cry for help and you know it.
Mom, are you okay?
Honey, I just...
Do it, Lindsey.
Go with The Beast.
Please. Please. Please.
Mom!
Please. Please.
I can't stand another bad thing happening to this family.
I can't stand it. I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
I am not marrying that evil idiot, okay?
He's not killing everybody I love.
There is a plan to deal with this and Ben and I are going to think of it.
Okay. Okay.
If you're going to stand there at least do it while you're making us coffee, okay?
Okay.
I love you.
I'm sorry I hit you.
Bye, Ben.
I'm going to make coffee!
What about that guy you knew?
Uh...
The mob guy,
Gina Pagano's cousin.
It's a good idea.
He got raptured, though.
He did?
I'm starting to think that maybe we should have just gone to church with our moms.
Believed. You know?
Yeah, but if you don't, you don't. You know?
What if we really are cursed?
We're not.
But what if we are?
We're not.
We have gotten through a lot.
We are going to get through this.
Uh-huh.
Because we just are. kick the Antichrist's ass myself, I will.
I know. I know.
I'll do it.
Did you find anything?
We definitely can't kill him, because of the whole
"possessed by Satan" thing.
Right. The only ones who can kill-kill him are Jesus and God, right?
Right, but it does seem like he could be locked up.
Yeah. That is what's going to happen, apparently.
He is going to be locked up for a thousand years.
By God.
Yes.
Why for just a thousand years?
Why not forever?
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
It makes no fucking sense at all.
You have him, why would you let him go?
I don't know.
This shit!
It just seems so pieced together.
Did anyone think it through?
Wait. Why couldn't we do this?
Do what? Lock him up?
Sure.
How?
Okay, well, do you remember how
Buster was a total escape artist, and my dad had to build him that completely escape-proof kennel?
Yeah.
Wouldn't he yell?
Fuck you!
You will suffer forever!
Even if he did, you know, nobody likes him, he's the Antichrist.
Who would help him?
That's true. That's true.
What if he got out, though?
We'd just have to be incredibly careful that he didn't.
Remember to always, always keep the Antichrist locked up.
Yeah.
Maybe over time we could turn him good.
How?
We could get him a little pet.
Oh.
Have you been chewing on my books?
You adorable little scamp.
I think after 50 years, he's not even going to be that bad.
Chocolate chip cookies, kids?
Thank you, Uncle Beast.
You hungry little motherfuckers.
Wait, Linds, no.
How are we going to do this?
What do you mean?
Think about it, I mean...
I'd have to get on to the property, right?
Past all the wraiths.
And the Beastly Guards.
Right. And the Beastly Guards kill everybody they see.
Everybody! We'd need someone who couldn't be killed.
And who can't be killed?
Excuse me, Mr. Murphy.
Hi.
We were wondering if we could just talk to you for a minute?
I'm just mowing my lawn here.
Right, and it looks great.
As always.
But, we were wondering...
Well, we actually need your help, sir.
What?
Yeah, see, you're really the only one who can help us, because you're dead.
Dead?
Who is dead?
Nobody.
He doesn't...
Aw!
I'm just mowing my lawn here.
Right, but we were wondering...
Just mowing my lawn here!
Dude, you're dead.
You're dead. Plus, you have no lawnmower. You're pushing nothing.
Mr. Murphy?
Okay?
I don't think it's helping.
You're dead, if anybody's dead...
Wait. Stay here.
I have an idea.
Hi.
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?
Can I borrow the truck, Dad?
Yeah. What for?
To take Lindsey to The Beast's.
Yeah. She's going with him.
Ohhh!
Ben!
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so relieved.
I'm so relieved she is going to fuck him.
Yeah.
Good for her.
So, uh, what's all this?
Oh.
The thing is, he's demanding a dowry.
A dowry?
Yeah, isn't that weird?
Yeah, well, it's old-fashioned for sure.
Uh... But nice in a way.
Exactly.
Hey, Ben?
Yeah?
So, you're going to give him the mower?
Well...
What do you get the guy who has everything?
Yeah.
What's really going on here?
Nothing. Like, I mean...
The dowry.
Yeah, I don't believe you.
We are going to fight him.
Oh, God! Ben!
Don't be ridiculous!
No, listen. We have a plan.
Aw...
Aw! Aw! You have a plan!
What is it?
We are going to lock him in a kennel.
You can do that. You can keep him prisoner for a thousand years.
Aw!
I didn't know.
I didn't know that you could lock the Antichrist in a fucking kennel for a thousand years!
You dumb, empty, retarded, mongoloid, idiot child!
What if it doesn't work? Huh?
Do you have a backup plan?
It won't work.
You don't have a backup plan!
I don't need one.
Stupid!
I can't let you do this, Ben.
You are going to have to.
I'm going to have to, huh?
Yeah.
Put down the shovel, Ben.
Are you going to hit me with a rake now?
Come on. Put it down.
He got really freaked out after you left and just started doing that.
Mr. Murphy, sir.
No. Not talking to you.
Can I show you something?
Nope.
I think you will like it.
Nope, nope, nope.
Fuck it.
Nope, nope, nope.
He smells really bad.
Do you like it?
It's yours if you want it.
All you have to do is keep mowing.
Oh. Nah.
Unnecessary.
Oh, he's super gross.
He's really gross.
This was our plan.
Number one,
Clark and Fry help Ben get past the wraiths with their pot.
Number two,
I use The Beast's obsession with my lady bits to distract and drug him.
Ow!
Number three, get our zombie neighbor to draw away the guards.
And number four, bring the drugged out Beast back and lock him up in Buster's kennel.
Good plan.
Almost nothing can go wrong.
Oh, my God!
You look so slutty.
Thanks.
Wow. Okay.
Um...
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Well...
What else are we going to do, Ben?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Are we sure this is a good plan?
Yeah. It is.
And it's the only one we have, besides me having sex with him, which is not going to be the plan.
No.
You know.
So, I'm going to take care of him and the guards.
All right.
I'll deal with the wraiths, and, um, we will use Mr.
Murphy to deal with the perimeter guards.
By 9:00, for sure.
Can you handle him for that long?
Oh, yeah. Totally.
He is so dumb, Ben.
Good.
Okay. We can do this.
Right?
Yeah, we can.
Right?
I love you.
I love you.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Okay.
Awesome.
I love you, Mom.
I love you too, honey.
Have fun.
Call or text if you're going to be really late.
Yeah.
So when do we leave,
Benjamin Franklin?
Five minutes.
If we run into a problem, here's what we do...
Let me guess. Knife him?
Yeah, totally.
Stab him in the fucking gut, right?
Or in the back of his neck.
Can't you guys fucking stop?
This is extremely important, and you are acting like morons.
Revelations tells us what's going to happen next.
Spoiler alert. Jesus is going to come down on a white horse and smite the Antichrist before God sets up his kingdom here on Earth.
Blow me!
Assholes! Rim job! Fucker!
Who is a sexy Beast?
I am a sexy Beast
Who is a sexy Beast?
I am a sexy Beast
Who is a sexy...
Turn the mirror.
I am a sexy Beast
Who is a sexy Beast?
I am a sexy...
Ooh! You a sexy Beast.
You a sexy Beast.
Yeah. You a sexy Beast.
You.
Is that a turn on, turn off?
That's a turn on, sir.
You like that?
Fuck yeah.
I'm going deep tonight.
I'm going deep tonight.
Oh, shit.
You want to do it?
Did that get you wet?
My pussy's so wet.
What?
I didn't say that.
I didn't say anything.
Wow.
Lindsey, you look...
Look at those titties.
So lovely.
Thank you.
Did you, uh...
Yup.
Trim bush!
Aw!
Sorry?
That was me getting an erection.
Oh.
That's nice.
Thank you.
Service it? No!
Now is the time for romance.
These are from him.
Carnations.
Thank you.
You have such good taste.
I know.
Lindsey, I cannot imagine a lovelier receptacle for my evil seed than you.
So much seed.
Just wait here for a second.
If you break his heart,
I'll be super pissed.
All right, let's go.
He will join you in the parlor.
Yup.
Welcome to where we are going to do it.
I want to touch your booty
All night long
I want to touch your booty
And stick my dick in you, girl
Stick my
Stick my dick in your
Stick my dick in your
Stick my dick in your yeah, booty
Hmm, stick my dick in your booty
That was so good.
That was something
I was working on for you.
Oh! Actually, I would love to pour this for you, sir.
Of course, my dear.
So, you like eggs?
I fucking love eggs.
They remind me of titties.
Good to know.
Chocolate eggs, Easter eggs.
Any type of eggs.
You put some eggs in that,
I am eating that shit.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I love jelly beans, too.
But I hate Peeps.
I despise them.
I'm putting those assholes out of business. I promise.
Sure.
I fucking hate them.
Put them out of business.
Tomorrow, as a matter of fact.
Marshmallow ass chicken.
Feel the power of the fucking Beast.
Peepco.
I kick so much ass my feet need condoms.
So, how's the gay boyfriend taking all of this, my dear?
You know...
Badly. Like a bitch.
"Please don't leave me."
"No. I'm with The Beast now, tiny, little, tiny boy."
"But please, I love you."
"Get away from me with your chicken baby penis."
"Oh! Lindsey, please."
"I want Beast cock."
"Please." "Beast cock!"
"Please." "Beast cock!"
Something like that?
It was just like that.
What can I say?
I'm The Beast.
I know these things.
This is for you.
Thank you much.
I...
I feel so silly, this is so embarrassing.
What?
I was hoping that...
Yes?
Maybe we could get all the
Beastly Guards in here.
Freaky.
Anyway, and have them come in this room and propose a toast to me, please.
I thought you had a challenge.
Beastly Guards.
You will now come to me and join me in toasting your new queen.
This is Morgan on the PA system.
All Beastly Guards please report to the dining area.
I'm not drinking any of that shit.
- I tell you one thing.
- Noxzema...
Well, well, well.
The prodigal asshole returns.
Uh, I'm here to make a delivery to Walt House, the asshole.
Yeah, well, you are not on my list.
He promised me that I would have no problem getting this in.
Oh, God, that is so sad.
That's a sad story.
So, you're just going to be impossible about this.
We are. Get your vehicle, turn it around and get the fuck out of here.
All right. Fine.
Wait.
What's that smell?
What smell?
You know that smell?
What's happening, bros?
Do you want some?
No.
How much of this do you have?
I got a fucking pillow.
He's got a fucking pillow.
Come with me.
Leave the car running.
Come on.
Come on.
Come, Beastly Guards.
Get your fat asses in here.
Drink the nectar of eggs.
Toast your new queen.
Make sure everybody gets some.
Go, go, go.
To you, my dear.
God damn it!
I promised Little Beast
I would go say goodnight.
He will be crying all night if I don't.
Don't you want the drink, though?
It looks so good. I made it.
Don't worry.
We will fuck soon. Duty calls.
Get your fucking ass into bed, Little Beast!
No!
Don't be a dud, little fucker.
Kids.
Did I say anything that deserves that?
So much.
What a dud.
That's not a nice thing to say about your son.
Oh, my sweet, protective, mother hen.
He's still a dud, though.
He won't be like our children.
Here's a naughty idea.
Let's have sex on his bed right now.
Let's wait until after dinner.
Of course.
Okay.
I gotta take a poop anyway.
Oh!
This is going to be fantastic.
Aw!
That's excellent weed, guys.
Fuck!
Are you sure I can't make that delivery?
Really quick.
Hold on one second. I forgot.
What did you want to do?
You are so high.
I am.
What do you think?
Yes.
Yes?
No, I think that's a bad idea.
No, dude, don't be so fucking paranoid, man.
Am I being paranoid?
Yeah, what if it's a fucking great idea, man?
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying it's a good idea.
Get out of here.
Yes. Do it. Just do it.
Okay.
Do it.
Do any other wraiths want to party, man?
You should call them up.
Let's go to highville.
Do you want to blow up something?
Let's blow up Helsinki.
Um.
Buenos Aires?
Listen, I want to blow up the whole world tonight.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Kind of.
Ooh. That is sexy.
It is sexy.
You're not the girl
I thought you were.
No.
You little vixen.
You gonna blow up the world with me?
Yeah, I'm going to do that tonight.
We are going to the bust the world up.
Hell, yeah.
I'm going to bust all over your face.
Uh-oh.
Was that too much?
Are you ready to cut some grass,
Mr. Murphy?
Yup.
Now remember, there is a lot that needs to be cut.
So don't stop until you get all of it.
No.
And don't let anybody stop you.
No.
You do know how to drive one of these things, right?
No.
- Hey, you!
- Shit!
Shit.
All right, just mow.
Ow!
Fuck.
Use your push mower.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, asshole!
What are you doing?
I will kill you with murder!
I'm just cutting the grass.
All right, take him out.
How do you like that?
Ow!
Go check him.
I'm just mowing the lawn here!
I'm mowing the lawn here!
I need everybody at gate two.
Right away!
Everybody at gate two!
I got some sort of undead, lawnmowing, dead, zombie motherfucker.
Stop your vehicle!
Oh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh.
What was that?
Did you guys hear that?
Dude,
I don't hear anything, man.
Yeah, dude, you are being paranoid.
Am I being paranoid?
Yeah.
Dude, turn the fucking music up.
Damn, this is good. Shit!
Nothing like a shrimp and mushroom omelet, am I right?
Um...
Where was I, my dear?
Your ex-wife.
God, I can't even believe I did that.
I was young and stupid and seduced by a natural blonde.
Do you know what I mean?
I think I do, yeah.
Her pubes were blonde.
My pubes are black.
As you will find out.
You know the secret to shrimp is to take out the dark line in the back.
That's their poo.
Three to four times a day.
That's why I'm so healthy.
Good. That's impressive.
I'm glad you told me.
Thank you.
Uh...
Do they have any more of that eggnog left? I'm so thirsty.
So, where do you want to go for our honeymoon?
Um...
Not that it matters, because you'll be getting face fucked the whole time, am I right?
Hey.
Let's stay here and just have intercourse.
And watch movies.
I love intercourse.
I love movies.
Are you a Vin Diesel fan?
I love Vin Diesel.
Fucking The Chronicles of Riddick, are you kidding me?
It's the best.
It's so underrated.
See. You see?
I do.
We are connected.
Right here with you.
Let's go make the beast with two backs.
Get it? The beast with two backs, because I'm The Beast and I got a back and you got a...
It's not that funny.
Come on, let's go.
Um, yeah, we could...
We should...
We should go to the Jacuzzi.
Jacuzzi?
Sounds sexy.
It's going to be.
What the shit?
Dude, what the fuck are they doing?
I think I saw them take some 'shrooms, bro.
What is going on with your hands?
We should fucking knife them.
Fucking knife them?
Yeah.
Fucking knife the shit out of them.
Stop your vehicle!
Oh, shit!
Ah!
If I was a dinosaur, guess what kind of dinosaur I'd be.
What?
A Lickalottapuss.
Do you get it?
That's so funny.
I do get it.
Because I would be licking your vagina all the time.
Ohhh.
What are you looking for, baby?
I'm right here.
Um...
Ben?
Are you calling your boyfriend?
Come on, Ben.
Baby!
I thought we had something.
This hurts.
I thought we had a moment.
Ben!
That's cool.
I didn't really like you that much.
Whatever.
Okay, Ben, seriously!
Ben!
Let her go, Antichrist!
This is who you are screaming for?
This Frodo-looking motherfucker?
He even walks gay!
I'm The Beast, baby!
Beastly Guards.
Most of them are chasing a dead guy on a lawnmower.
Okay, what does that mean?
Wraiths, come to me.
Fucking useless potheads.
Just let her go, man.
Or what?
Or I will kick your evil ass.
Baby.
That's...
That's a good one.
Hey, I got a good one, too.
How about you do like this to my booty-hole.
I'm warning you, Earl.
My name is Beast.
What are you going to do to me, anyway, huh? What, you going to kill me?
I'm going to lock you in a dog kennel.
I don't even know how to respond to that.
But you know what?
Seeing as how I have better things to do, like make it with your lady, how about I shoot you?
No!
God damn it.
Back off.
Give me that.
Fuck!
I killed Jimmy Neutron.
Baby.
Back up.
What?
What are you going to do, huh?
You don't want to shoot me.
Unless you want me to come back as Satan.
Don't push me. Okay, Earl?
I'm really sick of this crap.
And honestly, you in particular.
You are so lame.
I'm lame?
You're dating Peter Brady.
I've been letting you say this gross shit to me all night.
The fact that anybody is afraid of you is incredible.
If they knew what a child...
It doesn't matter,
I will shoot you.
I will totally shoot you.
Whatever.
That's for being an asshole.
Let's party, baby.
Fuck!
See you later, baby.
Oh, shit.
Oh! Baby.
Baby, wake up.
Are you okay?
Why do I keep getting hit in the head?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, baby. I shot him.
Hmm?
Baby, I killed him.
Where?
I'm serious. Right here.
Fuck. I am unstoppable!
Ow!
Now what do we do?
Just keep killing him.
Until what?
Maybe it will take at some point.
Baby, I'm going to need more guns.
Okay, I'm on it.
- That really hurts...
- Damn!
Ben?
Yeah.
Will you stop shooting...
Fuck you!
This can't be legal.
Ben?
Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.
Ow! Bitch!
Quick question.
I'm getting pretty good at this, baby.
I'm coming!
Motherfucker!
What are you going to do now, fool?
What time is it?
You don't seem like the type.
No.
No, that won't work either.
Go to bed, Little Beast.
Little fucker.
But I have an idea.
How does this go down?
I need a screwdriver or something.
What is that?
It's coming right at us!
Ben, wait!
Ben, wait!
Oh, no!
Oh, no.
This is so bad, baby.
I didn't know, Linds.
I thought it was a rock. Fuck.
This is incredibly bad, Ben!
Okay, okay.
Can we do CPR? Maybe?
You laser-beamed him, baby!
I don't think CPR is going to work.
I can't believe I did this.
Aw!
How could I have been so fucking stupid?
I feel really sick, Ben.
My dad's right!
I'm a fucking idiot!
Is that...
What?
Is that him?
Idiots!
What have you done?
Um...
Okay.
Well.
Yeah.
Answer me!
We sort of killed the Antichrist at first.
We did.
It was not nearly as hard as you might think.
Right. Yeah. We just shot him with a regular gun, and then Ben was hitting him with a shovel.
Just bonked him.
That was it.
You barbecued my son.
I...
I saw this thing coming from the sky,
I had no idea what it was.
It could have been bad.
He didn't know.
It could have been bad.
I panicked...
And I...
Yeah. I laser-beamed him.
I beamed Jesus. I'm so sorry.
It was a total accident, though.
Yeah, total.
Do you two have any idea what you have done here?
Um...
Well...
No.
There was a plan.
A rather detailed and specific plan involving the final chapter of all human existence!
Do you understand that that plan is completely ruined?
We didn't mean to.
We are so just incredibly sorry, sir.
It was a gaffe.
Ugh!
It was a mistake.
It's all I needed to hear.
You're sorry.
I forgive you.
It's kind of what I do.
It's all good.
We will just start over.
It's no big deal.
It's not like I spent a lot of time on this.
Only 4,000 fucking years!
You proud of yourselves?
You pathetic little shits.
Fuck you, dude!
Don't, no.
You don't have to be so mean.
I'm sorry, but you don't have to be so mean.
What did you say, whore?
You heard me, man. I said,
"Fuck you." You are being a dick.
Not to God.
You're a dick!
You're like a bug to me!
You made her.
Yeah. Good call, baby.
"You made her, so..."
He doesn't talk like that.
I'm not Southern.
You talk exactly like that, Ben!
That is how I made you!
He doesn't have a pinched nose.
What is that?
You sound exactly like that.
No, I don't.
Give me that sweater.
Don't do it.
Just give me the fucking sweater!
Because I'm fucking God.
Give it to me.
Don't do it, baby.
Do it!
Don't, he has a jacket.
Don't.
I want a sweater!
God, wait.
Look behind you.
You actually expect me to fall for that trick?
No, no, it's not a trick.
"It's not a trick."
You're so stupid.
Argh!
Oh! Earl!
What the fuck, man!
That's right, big boy!
This isn't about you, Earl.
Okay?
Oh, it's all about me.
And my official name is Satan.
So, none of this
"Earl" bullshit.
Okay, let me smite these fuckers down and then we can talk.
All right?
Do you think I want to talk?
No, no, no.
All I want to do is kick your candy ass.
What the fuck did you say?
You want to go,
Fat Prince?
Let's do it.
Thou shalt whoop your ass!
It's on.
Ow!
Come on, bitch.
That's all you got?
You want some? Happy Meal?
Happy Meal...
You like that?
Whoo-hoo!
Bitch.
Time-out?
No, you're fresh out of time-outs, bitch.
Who are we rooting for?
They both want to kill us.
Right.
Revelations, bitch!
It is a pretty unusual thing to be watching, when you think about it.
Yeah!
You win.
Ow!
Get the fuck off me, Tattoo!
Who the fuck do you think you're fucking with? Abraham?
I am the Lord!
Ow!
Suffer!
Not me, you little fucker!
I'm gonna fuck your shit up!
Come on, Confucius.
I'm gonna bottle you, motherfucker.
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Argh!
Fuck you, Earl!
Almighty, my ass!
You are a terrible father!
You are one to talk.
Touche!
Earl...
My name is Satan!
I had enough of this shit!
Shit!
Wow.
I definitely didn't think that was possible. Right?
You would have thought that God would have seen that coming.
Yeah. Maybe he did?
His plan was to get electrocuted in a Jacuzzi?
Most of it didn't make a lot of sense to me, so it's possible.
They shot at me!
You fucking idiots!
I should spank you both!
Wow! You did it!
You killed him.
I knew you could do it.
No, you didn't.
You just had to apply yourself, Benjamin.
That's all.
You're not a loser anymore!
Good for you.
And who's that right there?
Is that...
Yeah.
He's tiny, huh?
So...
Wow.
I mean, huh, right?
A lot of questions.
There he is!
Dead zombie motherfucker.
Stop that fucking lawnmower!
Stop it!
What the fuck?
You killed him?
Oh, thank God.
It's over.
Right.
We did it! We killed him!
No more beatings.
No more rapings.
I guess that means
I'm in charge.
I wouldn't take that leap.
That's a big leap.
I'm the leader of the world.
Bow down before me!
No.
What? No.
How come all of a sudden you're in charge?
There's as much reason for me to be in charge as for you.
You? Fuck, no!
He thought you were the pool guy.
He used to rape you.
You have a massive head wound.
That is a brain injury.
So what?
You look like a jerk.
You guys. Um...
Look at your mustache.
Most world rulers look like jerks.
Who cares? What?
You guys, um...
Um, I just feel like, probably, nobody is in charge.
Or, well...
Everybody's in charge.
Everybody's in charge.
So, it's a good thing.
Uh...
We're all in charge.
We can be grown-ups.
Everybody okay with that?
Yeah.
You are definitely not in charge, though.
So what do we do now?
Just live.
That's what we're gonna do.
Right?
That's deep, baby.
Yeah.
Just live.
Let's go make out.
All right.
You kids be safe.
We're gonna live.
Yeah. I might, uh...
I might go back to school.
Yeah!
Yeah.
I never went to college.
I know. I know.
It's over.
Okay!
It's so nice to be held.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, you're so strong.
Okay.
I like those big arms.
Don't make this into something it's not. Okay?
Huh?
Don't make this into something it's not.
You didn't feel anything there?
No. Let's just live.
Live our lives.
Right.
All right.
Okay.
I thought with the mustache and everything, you...
No.
No.
You're sending a real message there.
No.
"Put a dick in here."
Ohhh.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Hmm.
Life goes on, man.
Ohhh!
Life goes on.
After that night, things went back to normal.
Good Sandwiches went from a smashed lunch cart to a popular lunch destination.
Overall, I'd have to say the future looks really, really bright.
Okay, that sounded really corny, but...
Whatever. I killed God and the Antichrist, man.
I'll do whatever I want.
The rocks stopped falling out of the sky.
The wraiths were still around, but Mom made some new friends and calmed down a little bit.
If you guys are hungry later,
I made an amazing pot of beans last night.
It's, um... They've been hanging out in a Crock-Pot for almost 12 hours at a low setting, and I'll tell you what,
I soaked those guys overnight, and, uh...
It's better than the quick soak.
Some things didn't go back like before.
Like Mr. Murphy.
Still dead... Undead.
But Ben and I stole his lawnmower back for him.
He loves it. Doesn't seem to notice we broke the motor, either.
This used to be the Devil's mansion!
It's ours now!
Ben's dad now lives at The Beast's mansion.
I'm not sure that he should, but who's gonna kick him out?
I put PCP in the salsa!
This is gonna get fucking crazy!
Fucking crazy!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
Let's go to Mexico!
GRANDMOTHER: ...her hair as red as the setting sun.
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
Hey, look who's up.
Hey. What are we doing here, Nathan?
NATHAN: Uh, I think I took a wrong turn a couple miles ago.
I'm just trying to get a signal on the phone for the GPS, but, uh, nothing.
I know the way from here.
We should get going.
Okay, sure.
Whatever.
You had a good sleep?
Yeah, thank you for driving.
Hey, look at that.
Keswick.
Sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you.
Just call Agent Walker, okay?
He's handling my caseload while I'm away. Thank you.
I thought you were gonna turn that thing off.
It's off. It's off.
Look, I promise, this weekend is all about me meeting your family.
No work, no phone.
No gun.
I don't think my family is gonna be that intimidating.
NATHAN:
Promises, promises.
Wow. This place is in the middle of nowhere.
VIRGINIA: A perfect place for us to forget about our jobs.
NATHAN: Don't worry, my phone doesn't wanna work up here anyway.
Wow. Now, that is a house.
I didn't know
I was marrying into money.
Don't get any ideas. The house has been in the family for generations.
It's amazing.
GRANDMA: Welcome home, Virginia.
Ha-ha-ha.
You're too skinny.
You say that every time
I've been away.
It's true.
JAKE: Hey, you're here.
Jake. Look at you.
Ha-ha-ha.
JAKE:
Welcome home, Red.
Where's Marcus?
GRANDMA: Uh...
At work.
He'll be home tonight.
You guys,
I want you to meet Nathan.
A pleasure to meet you.
Hey, you must be Jake.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Jake will help you get your bag, show you to your room.
Get you settled. Uh, I don't mean to be an ungracious hostess, but I would like to spend some private time with my granddaughter.
NATHAN:
Understood.
So you're the guy that's, uh, banging my sister, huh?
If you knew anything about your sister, you'd know it's the other way around.
I heard you call her "Red."
Everybody in the family call her that?
Yeah. It's a name of honor given to the first-born daughter in each generation of our family.
So it's not because of the red hair?
Heh. No.
Well, what does it mean?
Uh...
Uh, you'll have to ask Virginia.
It feels good to be home.
So nice to have you here.
Everyone sleeping under the same roof again, if only for a little while.
How's that, uh, job?
Keeping my skills sharp.
Any activity within the den?
No, they're behaving quietly, adhering to the truce.
That's good.
I need to talk to you about something.
I wanted to wait until we were face-to-face.
I wanna tell Nathan about our family history.
What we do is difficult for people who were not born into it.
Just as difficult on those who are.
It's a lot to trust to someone.
I've never brought anyone home to meet you before.
It's important to me that he knows me.
All of me.
I don't wanna have to lie to him for the rest of my life.
It'll have to be a family decision.
Of course.
Virginia, are you sure he's the one?
Well, I'm so glad that we finally get to meet you.
I was starting to think you guys didn't actually exist.
I'd like to see my granddaughter more often.
She just doesn't want you to know what we really do out here.
Remember, you're talking to two federal agents.
Ooh.
So how did you two meet?
Um, actually, we met at the academy.
NATHAN: Yeah.
I, uh... I was, I guess, sort of top dog for a little while and your granddaughter showed up and kicked my butt.
No, I did not.
NATHAN: Yes, you did, Virginia.
That reminds me, um, why do you guys call her "Red"?
Yeah, why is that?
Nathan, why do you want to marry my granddaughter?
Well, let's not embarrass him.
Oh, no, that's okay. That's okay.
Um...
Well, I, uh...
Well, I guess she challenges me.
You like challenge?
I do.
Dude, you have no idea.
Okay, I think we should unpack before dinner.
Um, I just have to run out to the car quickly for something. Thank you.
Play nice.
Nathan, you better not be on the phone!
You have to keep your mouth shut.
Whoa. Here we go.
Wow. Reception here really stinks.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ga... Ga...
Gabriel.
What? What?
Hey. Hey! Hey!
I'll go get help.
Stay with me.
I'll be right back.
Help!
Somebody call the police!
Hurry up!
VIRGINIA: Nathan, what's wrong?
NATHAN:
I don't understand.
What the hell happened?
GRANDMA: It's Xavier.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
You know who this is?
GRANDMA: Yes.
Did he say anything to you before you left him?
He said a name.
Gabriel.
Am I the only one bothered that I was talking to this guy five minutes ago and now, he's basically incinerated?
It is physically impossible for a human body to burn this fast.
Finally.
Sheriff.
Agent Keswick, FBI. What...?
That's him?
Yes, Marcus. This is Nathan.
Am I missing something here?
JAKE:
This is our brother Marcus.
Jake, get a shovel and a bag out of the truck.
Let's move this stuff before anyone sees.
NATHAN: Whoa, whoa
. There's protocol here.
We gotta get the medical examiner to check this out first.
Virginia, you brought him here, you deal with him.
I am gonna have to tell him.
We've been left with no choice.
Tell me what? Virginia, what the hell is going on here?
I need to show you something.
We have a problem.
Yes, we do.
I need you to keep an open mind.
My family is not only involved in law enforcement, we are also hunters, of a sort.
Okay, so you hunt.
What does that have to do with the dead guy?
It's what we hunt.
Okay, what am I looking at?
VIRGINIA:
It's what we hunt.
NATHAN:
But... But these are...
Werewolves.
Oh, come on.
Give me a break.
JAKE:
What's going on?
Nathan.
I just need some time.
Nathan. Nathan.
Whoa, whoa. Virginia, let him go.
Whoever killed Xavier is out there.
Hey, hey, hey.
He's a big boy, he can take care of himself, right?
It's not a full moon tonight, he's gonna be fine.
Go. Come on inside.
Come on inside.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Go.
Oh, come on.
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?
This is Agent Nathan Keswick.
Can you hear anything I'm saying?
Argh...
Son of a bitch.
Anybody there?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Somebody here?
MAN:
Are you lost?
Who the hell are you and what are you doing out here?
MAN: I was just out here taking a stroll.
NATHAN:
A stroll? In the rain?
I prefer to be out here in nature.
NATHAN:
Well, it's not safe.
There's a killer on the loose.
MAN: Ooh. What kind of killer would that be?
I'm not sure.
Some kind of animal.
Could it have been a wolf?
What kind of wolf would rip a man apart?
Something like this.
My name is Gabriel.
MARCUS:
You going somewhere?
Nathan's been gone too long.
We need to go after him.
With Xavier dead, I've got more important things to worry about.
Fine, I'll go alone.
I'll send Jake.
That's impossible.
It's not a werewolf.
It's not a full moon.
VIRGINIA: I'll go ahead.
Jake, come on.
Let's go.
JAKE:
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan!
VIRGINIA: Nathan!
Nathan, where are you?
JAKE: Nathan!
VIRGINIA: Nathan!
Nathan, answer me!
Nathan?
Nathan!
JAKE: Red, wait.
Nathan. Nathan, are you all right?
Nathan, get up. Get up.
Get up. Are you hurt? Nathan.
Unh.
Answer me.
Are you hurt?
Everything you said was true.
There was a werewolf.
Yeah.
We followed his trail directly to you.
You're lucky to be alive.
He said his name was Gabriel.
I watched him turn.
How did you get away from him?
I don't think I did.
VIRGINIA: Did he bite you?
No, I don't think so.
I'm sorry. I have to be sure you weren't bitten.
NATHAN:
If I was?
You'll turn into a werewolf and then I'll have to kill you.
VIRGINIA:
You're bleeding.
What?
Did he bite me?
No.
No, you're okay.
He's okay.
He just hit his head.
I'll radio Marcus, tell him we found Nathan, and meet you back at the house.
I'm gonna see if I can track this thing.
Be careful.
We're dealing with something we've never seen before.
Here, let's go.
Okay.
Come on.
Slow. Slow.
One, two, three.
Unh. Aah.
Okay. Okay. I'm okay.
VIRGINIA: All right. You're okay.
NATHAN: I'm okay.
VIRGINIA: Just take it slow.
Come on.
What's wrong?
Hold on. Let me just...
Okay. Are you okay?
Stay right here.
I was looking for you.
What happened?
Nathan had a run-in with a werewolf that can phase at will.
Is he okay?
GRANDMA: Is he bitten?
No. No, thank God.
Okay, let's get him in here.
The wolf's name was Gabriel.
That must be the wolf that killed Xavier.
Okay, did he have any special markings?
Did he have any markings?
I just watched a man turn into a werewolf.
That may be a common-day occurrence for you people, but not for me.
What the hell's going on here, Virginia?
The dead man at the end of the driveway, he was the leader of one of the last wolf packs.
Our family had a truce with him.
As long as they stayed in the deep woods, kept themselves locked away during the full moon cycle, we agreed not to hunt them.
Okay, Nathan, what did he look like in human form?
I don't know. He's, um, middle-aged, 6 foot...
We're not dragging him into this.
He is in this. You brought him into it.
We have a dead pack leader and a wolf who can phase at will.
He can help me.
I won't allow it.
You wanna marry this guy?
Want him to understand what you do?
He needs to see if he can stomach it.
Jake is tracking the werewolf.
We can find it without putting Nathan in danger.
Let the man make up his own mind.
NATHAN: Look, the only thing that I wanna make my mind up about is going upstairs and getting some sleep.
This is all insane.
I'm impressed he survived a werewolf on the first encounter.
Few people do that.
I don't know. Maybe he is cutout to be part of this family.
Or maybe somebody wanted him to survive.
MARCUS: Where's Nathan?
VIRGINIA: Still in bed. Exhausted.
East perimeter's clear.
I think we should...
MAN: Marcus!
Virginia! I'm okay.
Heh-heh-heh.
JAKE: Hey. It took all night, but I tracked that wolf to just outside
Tanner's River before I lost it.
That town is outside the designated territory.
You think the clan's about to go rogue?
It's possible.
If even one of them set foot inside the town, that's a clear violation of the truce.
So? We going hunting?
We are.
All right.
Hey.
That thing I saw last night, how do we kill it?
VIRGINIA: There's only one way to kill a werewolf.
A silver weapon through the heart, bullet or blade, doesn't matter.
It's an involuntary transformation triggered by the full moon.
It ends at dawn.
This Gabriel seems like a different kind of animal.
You get bitten by a werewolf, you will turn into one on the next full moon.
The effects can be reversed, but only if you kill the wolf that bit you and only if you do it before you make your first human kill.
You kill a human, you're cursed for as long as you live.
So, basically, don't get bitten.
No. Once you're bitten, you're never the same.
It's like a disease or a drug addiction you can't kick.
The wolf is always a part of you.
You ever turn one back?
A werewolf, I mean.
Grandmother did.
Once.
Who was it?
Our grandfather.
That's our family's dirty little secret.
If we're hunting during the day, how do we know they're not wolves?
MARCUS: They may not look like wolves, but they are.
NATHAN: How do we make sure we don't kill a human?
Werewolf test.
It's a pellet filled with silver halide paint.
Burns the flesh, marks them, and causes a mild transformation.
Mild transformation?
What does that mean?
You'll see.
Okay. Okay. All right.
VIRGINIA: Tanner's River is the edge of their territory.
MARCUS: Anyone from the pack caught within the town is fair game.
JAKE:
And "fair game" means dead.
What the hell happened here?
It was before the truce.
Over the course of three nights, practically everyone was turned.
Our family had no choice.
They had to be put down.
An entire town?
That's why it's so important that we never let them out of their territory.
Never let them get close to the rest of civilization.
Truce or no truce, we should have wiped them all out a long time ago.
Go. Go, go, go.
Looks like we got a couple of rogues.
MARCUS:
Shooter in position?
Affirmative.
Nathan, you see your wolf from last night, you let us know.
Virginia!
I love this.
GABRIEL:
Nathan.
JAKE:
What are you doing?
You all right?
Yeah, thanks to Nathan.
You okay?
I'm good, yeah.
Is this your wolf?
No.
Please, don't hurt me!
Grab her.
JAKE: Come on. Come on. Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
You're safe now.
Did they hurt you?
No.
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.
Just tell us what happened.
I was running out of gas, and I pulled off the highway and it said there was a gas station, but there wasn't.
There was just dead end.
And that's where they put me.
You and Virginia take her to the hospital.
Tell them I'll be by to file a report.
Virginia will know what to say.
Okay. Where are you gonna go?
Jake and I will make sure there's nothing else.
Jake! Let's go.
NATHAN:
Is she okay?
Are you sure they didn't hurt you?
They said they were gonna use me in their next game.
What game?
WOMAN:
I don't know.
But from what they were saying, once you go into the game, you never come back.
Come on.
Come on.
Your ancestors were strong.
Their blood is in your veins.
They were unstoppable.
Your ancestors roamed free on this earth.
But now the hunters define us.
They've driven us to this rotten little patch.
They say we're ruled by the moon!
I say it's all a lie!
We can change at will.
Well, no one here but us humans.
So it would seem.
Do you see the way they look at you?
You should have killed Xavier much sooner.
To survive, we must evolve.
NATHAN:
Hey.
You okay?
Thank you.
For what?
For keeping our secret.
Not saying anything to that girl's parents at the hospital.
Well, it's all about family, right?
I'm not sure my family has been the best thing for you.
Is there a reason that you never talk about your parents?
I didn't really know them.
I was so young when they died.
How did they die?
Killed by a werewolf.
I'm sorry.
What's bothering you?
Nothing, I'm fine.
I...
I liked killing that werewolf today.
I enjoyed it.
I felt no sense of remorse whatsoever.
Made me feel powerful.
Is that wrong?
No.
Tonight, you will learn what it's like to be like us.
To live in a primal state.
If you will it, you will survive.
Set them free. Let the game begin.
WOMAN: No.
I want you to turn me.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
I wanna be like you.
Come on.
Let's move.
Come on.
Move it.
Just relax now.
I'll end this quickly for you.
Don't move, don't move!
Stay calm.
MAN: Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
MARCUS: Stay calm.
MAN: Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
VIRGINIA: It's okay.
It's okay. Believe me.
You're safe with us.
MAN:
No, we have to go.
The wolves, they're coming.
They're coming.
It's okay, we've been hearing things about a game.
Is this it, the game?
They hunt humans?
Yes.
How did you know that wolf was there?
Instinct, I guess.
Okay, there's no record of any wolf being able to transform at will.
Nothing.
So, what, this Gabriel is some kind of new breed?
Being able to transform at will, it changes everything.
Especially if he's teaching the rest of his pack to do the same.
The guy at the farmhouse, he's been with them for weeks.
He said this wolf is also telepathic or something.
He said that Gabriel can somehow communicate with those he's turned.
Is that even possible?
I don't know, Red.
I'm seeing things that I never thought I'd see in my lifetime.
We have to wipe them out now, every last one of them.
No more excuses, no more truce, no more mercy.
You guys go upstairs, get some rest.
In the morning, we start at Tanner's River, work our way to the farmhouse, see if we can pick up their trail.
Gran.
Something about Nathan that bothers me.
What?
I don't know, it's just a feeling I get.
Keep an eye on him.
JAKE:
Still clear.
VIRGINIA:
Nothing up here to report.
I can't see anything out here either.
We've been looking all day, we must have missed something.
VIRGINIA: We should lock up here for the night.
Maybe wait till after the full moon.
Check that.
NATHAN: Trip wire is gonna keep those things out?
MARCUS:
It'll buy us some time.
JAKE: The full moon should bring them out.
MARCUS:
I'm looking forward to it.
MARCUS: Jake, make sure the perimeter is tight.
There can't be gaps.
JAKE:
Yeah, okay.
MARCUS: Virginia will have eyes both directions.
We can tie to this tree over here.
MARCUS: All right, hang on a second.
I just gotta finish this.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan?
Nathan?
MARCUS: Do you need that?
Shh. Wait a second.
MARCUS: Virginia, move!
Don't kill him!
JAKE:
Hit him before he moves!
You put us all in danger.
We need to lock him up.
What happened?
You've been infected, Nathan.
Last night, you turned into a werewolf.
Did I hurt anyone?
No. No. Thank God.
How did this happen?
Gabriel must have bitten you.
I should have looked more closely.
You said...
You said that if
I turned into a werewolf, you were gonna have to kill me.
Wait here.
I'll get you some clothes.
You should have let me kill him.
Not everything is black and white.
It is to me.
That's your problem. If you could see anything outside of being a hunter...
I don't wanna see anything outside of being a hunter.
This is what I am. I'm good at it.
I like being good at it.
Your narrow view of the world is a liability.
No, I'm not the bad guy here.
You're the one who's wrong.
Flat-out wrong.
First responsibility is always to protect this family.
Always. You shouldn't have brought him here.
Nathan is family, as far as I'm concerned.
Forgive me for wanting to have some sort of life outside of being a hunter.
Marcus, if it had been
Jake, Virginia or me, would you have been able to kill so easily?
We all make mistakes, Marcus. No one got hurt, that's the important thing.
It is time to forgive and move on.
We have to stick together, now more than ever before.
We know who infected him, right?
He hasn't killed anyone.
We can turn him back. We gotta hunt Gabriel anyway, right?
It's not that simple, Jake.
There's repercussions.
They're manageable.
It's not gonna turn out well for you and him.
That'll be my problem to deal with, after we turn him back, not yours.
I got him into this,
I'm gonna get him out, with or without your help, Marcus.
MARCUS: I'll help.
I'll help.
Only because I wanna hunt that son of a bitch down and kill him myself.
For the record, if that does happen to me,
I would want one of you to kill me rather than let me live like that.
I'll make a note of it for future reference.
That's it.
You can do it.
Yes, you can.
There is a beast in all of us just waiting to be summoned.
Feel it coursing through your veins.
You've got to give in to it.
Get rid of that painful human side.
Unh. It's just too hard.
Really?
Perhaps you should lie down.
Take a nap.
I'd like that.
GABRIEL:
Sleep tight.
So... shall we try again?
You know, it's an amazing feeling when you are in the throes of transformation.
It is such joy.
Such ecstasy.
And to think that you can have that sensation whenever you want it.
That's what you desire.
That's what you thirst for.
Now, let that desire drive you.
MAN:
It's happening.
GABRIEL:
Well done.
Well, if he can do it, who's next?
Hey!
How's he doing?
Nathan?
He's strong.
He's a good man.
Yeah. He is.
Any activity?
Uh, it's all quiet.
I plotted out their movements over the last three days.
Given what the guy at the farmhouse said, they must still be hiding out in Tanner's River.
I wish he could have given us more information.
He was hysterical. Whole thing must have been like a bad dream.
Oh, this is a bad dream.
Do you agree with Marcus?
About Nathan?
I...
I don't know, Red.
I just want all this to be over.
NATHAN:
Hey.
So is it time?
MARCUS: It is.
The wolf stays here.
The license plates. We should have noticed before.
Noticed what?
They're all out of state.
They've been luring people off the highway for quite a while.
Go. Go. Go.
One, two, three.
There's gotta be a way in.
Where can they be?
Shh. Shh, shh.
JAKE:
We've been here. It's clear.
VIRGINIA:
Got something here.
Looks like someone's been busy.
This should make you sleep right through it.
It's for the best, believe me.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for being so concerned with my safety.
Oh, it's not for your safety, it's for my own.
Hm.
Is it true? That you were able to turn your husband back after he'd been infected?
It's true.
Was it the right choice?
That's a difficult question,
Nathan.
Please.
I would really like to know the answer.
He liked being a wolf.
He resented that I took the choice away from him.
On more than one occasion, I found him trying to turn himself back.
Eventually, he did, and so I had to kill him.
I'm sorry for what happened to you.
I know that you are a victim in all of this.
But I will not let my granddaughter go through what I had to.
Not if I can help it.
Okay, you and Jake head down that way, I'll go down here.
Splitting up is not a good idea.
We've gotta make sure none of them get past us. I'll be fine.
What is this?
Welcome. I've been looking forward to this.
Get some rest.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan!
Gabriel, I presume?
After I've had a bad dream,
I find it's helpful to get a good stretch.
Where are my brothers?
Well, worrying about their future, I hope.
Our newbies are eager to make their first kill.
And me?
I intend to kill you myself.
The last female warrior of the hunter bloodline.
You're a monster.
You and all your kind.
Now... we're the perfect match.
Mm.
I am gonna kill you, Gabriel.
Once upon a time,
I would have run.
Jake.
Jake!
Come on, Jake!
Hunters, we honor you.
For our newcomers, you will be their first kills.
You will give them the opportunity to show what they're made of.
The chance to become permanent members of the clan.
Set them free.
Jake. Jake, we've gotta stick together!
Always.
MARCUS:
Jake!
MARCUS: Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Jake.
We gotta find someplace to make a stand.
We're never gonna outrun them.
Find a weapon or something.
Aw, shoot Marcus
They never checked my boots.
Our odds of survival just improved dramatically. Let's go.
Come on, Jake.
Come on. Come on.
Drop back.
I'll pull them to bridges.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
JAKE:
Where'd they go?
Jake!
Where'd they go?
I don't know. Jake.
Go back...
Go back to town and get Virginia.
Get Virginia, Jake.
What about you?
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
I just...
I'm gonna find them.
Okay, go. Go, go, go!
You sure?
Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?
Well, we got rid of some of the weaker ones.
Did you expect them to kill this many?
No.
I did not.
Lyra!
Where's my sister?
Done.
They're not back yet.
Something must be wrong.
I'm going after them.
I'll come with you.
No.
You'll only slow me down.
Oh, man.
They'll pay for this.
I promise you.
GABRIEL: Don't fool yourself, Nathan.
You're with us now.
Look deep inside yourself,
Nathan. You know it's true.
You wanna be a wolf.
GABRIEL:
Nathan.
Their death was inevitable.
Yours doesn't have to be.
Welcome.
Don't be afraid.
It's just me, in your head.
Oh, yeah? Well, then come out and face me.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan! Nathan!
GABRIEL:
If you kill me, you'll change back.
Think of what I've given you.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan!
Nathan!
Nathan.
Nathan!
NATHAN: Virginia. Oh.
Virginia, are you okay?
Just get me down.
Okay.
Just get me down.
Where are my brothers?
Gotta get you down.
Nathan, where are my brothers?
We don't have time for this.
No. No.
GABRIEL: Should you choose to remain with her, she will kill you.
That is, of course, unless you turn her.
You could have it all, Nathan.
Turn her and it's all yours.
Tonight, I will be coming for her.
When I was a little girl, all I wanted was to grow up so I could hunt.
Carry on the family tradition.
It seemed so grand, so exciting.
It made us special.
The secret we couldn't share.
Knowing something about the world no one else did.
It was magical.
I felt the same way.
We all did.
Now it's all come down to you.
You mustn't let a single one of them live.
I don't plan to.
Here, wear these.
We don't want you touching any silver.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna head back down, all right?
VIRGINIA:
Hey.
You forgot these.
Got it.
Okay, I think that's the last of the guns.
And all fully loaded with silver.
Good.
Then we're ready.
I think we're running out of time.
I'm gonna end this tonight.
Yeah.
I think we better get me in my cage.
I can feel it starting.
I'm gonna make this right.
Virginia, it's time.
You go,
I'll put him in his cage.
GABRIEL:
Hello, Virginia.
You gotta try a bit harder, Virginia.
Aren't you the slippery one?
Too bad about your brothers,
Virginia.
I wish I could tell you they died well.
But in the end,
I find all pure humans are cowards.
You missed the heart.
No!
I'm so sorry, Nathan.
I told you I'd kill you, Gabriel.
You'll never kill all of us.
No.
Nathan.
VIRGINIA:
Nathan?
Nathan?
Nathan?
Nathan!
Nathan?
VIRGINIA:
Nathan.
You're bleeding.
It's okay, it's not my blood.
Gabriel's dead.
I think the rest of the pack too.
Good. That means it's just me, then.
It wasn't supposed to end this way.
It doesn't have to end.
I wanna have a life with you, Virginia.
That would be nice.
Well, you just lock me away for the full moon.
That doesn't work.
Virginia, you've been bitten.
Hey, this gives us a choice now.
We can do this. It doesn't have to end this way.
I was so stupid.
I wanted a normal life.
I wanted everything my family fought to protect.
I'm sorry I ever brought you here.
Hey, I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry.
Okay, we can do this.
Trust me, everything's gonna be okay.
I promise I will find a way to control the change.
Okay?
I love you, Nathan.
I always will.
"Her parents warned her not to venture beyond the edge of their village, for within the forest lived an unspeakable evil.
An evil so powerful, the elders only dared to speak of it in whispers."
Auntie!
You go on ahead.
Put it over there.
Over there.
How about this one?
Put it over here.
The weather is really good.
It sure is.
It's very clean here, no dust.
Jaai helps out.
He's the chief worker.
That's what I thought.
He's the one who called me?
Yes.
Where did you get him?
From Laos.
He crossed the Mekong river.
Is he legal?
I don't know.
What's that?
Tea leaves... a Chinese man gave to me.
Aren't you afraid of illegal immigrants?
They can rob you, kill you and disappear.
Don't worry.
The Lao are more hard-working than Thais.
Shhh...
What?
Crazy man!
I should send you back to the hospital.
Why is it so bitter?
You'll soon get used to the taste.
I know this man Dang who was paralysed.
He drank this tea.
Now he can walk fine and his piss is as clear as water.
Jaai!
Tell Buapan she's not needed tonight.
Okay, but shall I come back?
Yes, of course.
My kidney still needs you.
I can't get by without him.
He tried to talk to me but I don't understand the Isaan dialect.
Not Isaan, Tong.
It's Lao, remember?
Lao?
Jaai is single.
Help find him a girl, Jen.
I'm also single...
And lonely too.
I thought you said Laotians were smelly.
They are smelly. What are you thinking?
- What do you want for dinner?
- What?
What do you want to eat?
What can't you eat?
A lot...
Don't say that.
I brought him out here to cook for you.
That's right.
Water?
No.
The water isn't running.
Oh, now it is.
Is it a lot?
A quarter full.
15 minutes left.
It's flowing.
Did it hurt when I dressed your wound?
Not really.
Soon you will get better.
In not too long.
You think?
You'll stay with me to the end?
Come on. You'll be fine.
I'd like to ask about Auntie Jen.
Was she pretty when she was a teenager?
Well, she was in a temple beauty contest.
Don't say that. I'm embarrassed.
I was almost a beauty queen.
Are you all full?
Yes.
Shame to waste my glass noodles.
Taste some, won't you?
My mouth's watering just looking at it.
I completely forgot.
He said he can't eat egg yolk, but I put in two yolks.
It's alright.
Your kidney will be drained tonight.
Try some.
I really can't.
Look at my feet. They're swollen.
The doctor said I try too many things.
So many restrictions...
Even so, my condition hasn't improved.
This stir-fried chilli is very good, Tong.
- I ate a lot of it.
- Thank you, sir.
Have you seen your bedroom?
Will you be able to sleep there?
Sure, no problem.
I built the concrete room downstairs to sleep in myself.
It's much cooler.
But I don't sleep there.
I'm used to my old bedroom.
So I just use it for storage.
I'll sleep fine.
It's nice and cool.
You like it cool, don't you?
No mosquitoes, right?
Huay?
Is that you?
Yes, it's me.
Huay...
Boonmee, I'm sorry.
Why sorry?
It's been so long.
I have no concept of time any longer.
It's been 19 years, I think.
Auntie Jen, is that your younger sister?
My older sister.
Huay, you're older than me but you look so young.
Jen, I'm preserved this way.
You remain 42, right?
Boonmee, I know that you're sick.
I often wonder where you are.
If you are alright.
If you have enough to eat.
If you have clothes to wear.
I'm fine, but I know you are not well.
Here, have some water.
Maybe you have travelled from far away.
Huay, did you get the things
I sent you via the temple?
Yes, sister.
Thank you very much.
I could feel them.
I could hear your prayers.
It comforted me on those cold nights with only the whispering wind.
I heard familiar voices...
Boonmee's voice...
Perhaps... they were being replayed from my dying consciousness.
Huay...
Are you here to take me away?
Don't say things like that.
What's that sound?
Do you hear it?
Jaai, is that you?
Who are you?
I'm Boonsong.
Boonsong?
Boonsong, my son?
Mother.
It's Boonsong.
I recognise his voice.
Come here, child.
Come...
Do you remember me?
Sit here, child.
Why did you grow your hair so long?
There are...
There are many beings outside right now.
So I had to come and see you, Father.
What beings?
Spirits.
And hungry animals.
Like me... they sense your sickness.
Boonsong...
I want to recognise you but I can't.
Huay...
Six years after you died,
Boonsong disappeared.
I looked for him all afternoon.
The workers searched all over the farm.
When dusk arrived we lit up the mountain, hoping he could see his way back home.
I saw you and the men searching for me.
I saw the sky change colour.
I saw the lights.
But the night before
I'd made up my mind.
I practised with your Pentax camera.
I tried to understand... that thing.
What did you call it?
"The art of photography."
I took lots of photos wherever I went.
One day...
I made a trip to the mountains.
I searched for that thing in the photo.
Excuse me.
Auntie...
I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery.
In fact... the film was not even developed.
I was obsessed with this new creature.
I tried to chase it down while it leapt from branch to branch.
I tried to communicate with it.
I'm talking about the Monkey Ghost.
The Monkey Ghost?
Yes.
The ones we heard when we were young.
I couldn't have experienced this if I hadn't mated with a Monkey Ghost.
My hair... was growing longer.
My pupils... were slowly dilating.
After I acquired my wife, we migrated north, across the river.
By then,
I had forgotten the old world.
From my outsider's point of view, you should be rejoicing that these two have returned.
I am.
So why such a face?
How should my face look?
Have you eaten yet?
You can eat the leftovers.
Boonsong, I have something to show you.
Jen.
Sister.
How is Hans? Is he alright?
I chased him out with a butcher's knife.
- What happened?
- We clashed all the time.
Son, earthly matters never cease to surprise, right?
There are a lot.
Look at them.
Remember this?
Can I?
I turned this land into a bee farm, as you always wanted.
These pictures...
I took by myself.
Aren't they nice?
Sister...
Look at this.
My funeral...
I can't see well in this bright light.
I'll take care of it.
Isn’t it too dark?
Tong, fetch the light in my room.
- Where is it?
- By my bed.
I see you started taking pictures again.
I've kept myself busy.
The workers come and go.
Sometimes, I envy them.
They can go wherever they want.
But I...
I can't go. I just stay here.
You've been here all along?
Auntie Jen always says she wants to stay in one place.
But she's always on the move.
It's not by choice.
It must be my karma from being stubborn.
Jen.
Yes?
Will you take over this farm for me?
A few years from now, both your daughters will have their own families.
Who will take care of you?
Please don't...
Tong, see?
I'm not the only stubborn one.
How am I stubborn?
I've already prepared my will.
Why live in a cramped apartment in that "city from hell"?
How can you expect me to live here?
With all the ghosts and migrant workers?
Jaai is a good man.
You'll be fine.
After I've died,
I'll find my way back to help you.
How will you do that?
I'll be able to.
Living here doesn't mean you're stuck here.
There's a temple about 30 minutes away.
You can learn to meditate there.
Once you've mastered it, you can travel anywhere.
Uncle, Jaai's here.
Uncle!
What is that?
It's my son. He's called Boonsong.
Don't be afraid of him.
Uncle, it's a monkey.
I said he's my son.
And this is my wife, Huay.
I feel like the strange one here.
Jaai, thank you for taking care of him.
It's okay, ma'am.
It's my job.
In fact, I'm here to clean his kidney.
Is it already my bedtime?
Auntie Jen, you're deliberately stepping on these poor insects.
I'm not.
All these bugs and moths...
I know it's a country house, but it's too full of...
Too full of what?
Jaai.
To protect you from pesticide.
Thank you.
Auntie, I'm leaving soon.
- Where to?
- To register in Laos.
With a woman?
Of course.
I thought you might register a car or a house instead.
You can flirt with girls from here?
We telephone and trade photos.
Does Boonmee know you are leaving?
I think so.
Auntie, a squash.
It's very big.
Does Boonmee pay you too little?
Jaai, you don't have to be polite with me.
I didn't realise you were such landed gentry.
But I'm the real worker.
What are you doing?
Taking care of the tamarinds.
There are a lot of pests lately.
These grey worms eat the fruit and the leaves.
Dung beetles too.
See?
- A wormhole.
- The white one?
Our tamarinds are not as good as those in Petchaboon.
What is it, Jaai?
This is Jen, Boonmee's sister-in-law.
Hello, hello everyone.
Nikom, come here.
Bonjour.
Why don't you speak?
Jen, this is Nikom.
He can speak French.
He swam over when Laos fell apart.
Right?
Yes.
He taught me a lot of French words.
Vous pouvez aller travailler maintenant.
- That's enough.
- How come?
- Interesting farm you have, Boonmee.
- Indeed.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
- Can we steal some honey?
- Go ahead.
There are still so many bees.
So many.
Run along.
See?
The local honey tastes like tamarind and maize.
It is both sweet and sour.
- That's your idea?
- Of course.
Taste it.
Don't scrape the bottom.
The larvae are there.
The best parts are on top.
I made a mess.
It's as chewy as bubblegum.
After a long walk, this is heaven.
Yummy.
Come wash your hands.
Luckily, I'm using an anti-UV cream.
Jaai?
I'm at the honey shack.
Come over.
Need help?
It's okay. Jaai is on his way.
It's a burden, isn't it?
That's why I built this shack.
To lighten the burden.
- Where are you going?
- Be right back.
Hungry?
Are you hungry?
Come here.
Have some.
Tasty?
Fetch.
Good.
Jen.
You know, this is a result of my karma.
What is?
This illness.
I've killed too many communists.
But you killed with good intentions.
And I've killed a lot of bugs on my farm.
It depends on your intentions.
You killed the commies for the nation, right?
Like my father.
For the nation? Or what?
What a pain in the ass.
I miss my father.
You do?
Back then, the army sent him into the jungle to hunt people.
But he hunted animals instead.
He stayed there until he could speak with the animals.
Did he visit you after his death?
No, once he was dead he was gone.
He didn't become a ghost.
- You have dog spit on your hands.
- Just eat it.
Deep down,
I know that reflection is an illusion.
Is it an illusion?
You're the same person
I've always revered.
That's an illusion too.
Were I not a princess, would you say that?
Stop!
Come back to me!
You didn't look at me.
You imagined kissing the woman in the reflection, right?
Leave me alone, please.
Princess, don't waste your tears.
Let me share in your sorrow.
I've watched you ever since you first graced this place.
Why?
Why look at me?
There's nothing worth noticing.
Nothing? Your beauty is enchanting.
Your view from underwater must be so distorted.
It's not. You saw your beauty in the water, didn't you?
Who are you?
Are you some kind of ghost?
I'm not a ghost. I'm a catfish.
You created the reflection, didn't you?
Without you, I couldn't have done so.
She seems to have everything I don't.
Most women don't have what you have.
But they have love.
Wait! Come back!
Will you turn my body white and pretty like that reflection?
These are my offerings.
For you, Lord of the Water, to whom I am so grateful.
Wait.
Huay...
I haven't much time left.
When I was a student, giving presentations to my class made me so nervous
I'd forget and leave my meal unfinished.
When you're excited, you can't operate fully.
In my case,
I'm reduced to 20%.
And it's happening now.
Are you excited?
Or afraid?
It's like when I gave the presentation.
How about you?
Did you feel the same way when you were dying?
I did.
But I didn't dare let you know.
Huay...
I love you so much.
I was so embarrassed when you appeared last night.
Embarrassed?
Look at my hands, my arms.
I'm not the same.
Not as I was 19 years ago.
Your hand is like ice.
I don't know how
I will find you after I'm dead.
Where should my spirit go to look for you?
In heaven?
Heaven is overrated.
There's nothing there.
Where are you then?
Ghosts aren't attached to places but to people, to the living.
But what if I'm dead?
Fah went to Nok Island.
Didn't she tell anyone?
No, she didn't.
Have you and Fah had an argument?
No, we haven't...
Suddenly, she disappeared like that.
Jen!
What is it?
- I've something to show you.
- What?
Come and look.
Come quickly.
Look at what?
What is it?
These things are all I have left.
Why are you showing me?
I don't want them.
It's time for me to go.
Go where?
Well...
I don't know, myself.
Come with us.
Tong...
Boonmee has gone mad.
Huay, you're a ghost gone mad.
Are you okay?
Tired?
Don't sit like that.
Can I...?
Auntie Jen? What's that sound?
Auntie Jen...
So many...
What's wrong with my eyes?
They are open but I can't see a thing.
Or are my eyes closed?
Maybe you need time for your eyes to adjust to the dark.
This cave...
It's like a womb, isn't it?
I was born here in a life
I can't recall.
I only know that I was born here.
I don't know if I was a human or an animal, a woman or a man.
Last night,
I dreamt of the future.
I arrived there in a sort of time machine.
The future city was ruled by an authority able to make anybody disappear.
When they found "past people", they shone a light at them.
That light projected images of them onto the screen.
From the past, until their arrival in the future.
Once those images appeared, these "past people" disappeared.
I was afraid of being captured by the authorities because I had many friends in this future.
I ran away.
But wherever I ran, they still found me.
They asked me if I knew this road or that road.
I told them I didn't know.
And then I... disappeared.
Please have some boiled rice.
Ms Arunee Srisuk.
150 baht.
Yingbuaban family.
50 baht.
Such a big envelope!
And then...
No name.
Oh, here it is. Roong Arpon.
300 baht.
- How much was it?
Anonymous.
- Auntie Jen.
- 100 baht.
When are we going to sleep?
In a few days.
No! You... That's money!
Arrange those envelopes for me.
Manop...
There's no funeral book, is there?
I don't know if Boonmee has much money in the bank.
If he has a lot,
I should make one for him, no?
U p-country people don't need that luxury.
No one took photos at the funeral?
A book...
I didn't know him that well.
What would I write about him?
Just make something up.
Brother Tong...
Excuse me, Roong.
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?
I can't sleep.
As a monk, you shouldn't be here.
What if people see?
See you.
See us.
What would we do?
So let me come in then.
Can I put it here?
Brother, you shouldn't be near us.
Why not?
You are a monk, not a man.
Stop joking.
The air conditioning is too cold here.
Don't change the subject.
That's because you have no hair.
But it's blowing directly on my head.
And you think you can sleep here, son?
It's too scary at the temple.
It's too pure for you perhaps.
You like to be near the action and in the way of temptation.
But, Auntie, I kind of understand him.
My room doesn't even have a radio.
Some monks have computers to check emails, chat on Hi-5.
My room is dead quiet.
Be patient.
You'll be out in a few days.
Oh, Auntie.
Where are you going?
Can I take a shower?
I want a warm shower.
As you wish.
I'll just think
I'm earning future merit.
I'm freezing.
Feel refreshed?
Don't look. He's half-naked.
Don't peek.
Come on. Let's go eat.
Roong.
Let's check out the 7-Eleven.
I'm not hungry yet.
I'm hungry.
Let's eat first.
Before I go back to the temple.
I thought you quit monkhood.
You're not afraid any more?
No. I've showered.
Now I'm hungry.
You smell like lemongrass.
- My shoes?
- No, your body odour.
The soap is old-style.
Good.
It'll help chase away mosquitoes.
But it makes you smell like tom yum soup.
I'm edible.
Tong, let's go and eat.
Tong, let's go eat.
Come on.
- Want to sing?
- No.
- Pick a cue.
- Why don't you sing?
Zeus.
Poseidon. lt's been many years.
What do you see?
Thunderclouds.
But no lightning.
Stolen.
What? You think l took it?
Omnipotence has blinded you, brother.
We are forbidden from stealing each other's powers.
-But our children aren't.
-You're accusing my son? l haven't seen him since he was a baby.
He doesn't know me
-or even know who he is because of you.
-lf your son is the thief, l will send him to the depths of Tartarus. lf you touch him, you will have the fight of your life.
He must return the bolt to me in 14 days, by midnight on the summer solstice, or there will be war.
And he's alive!
Percy Jackson is a beast!
You're a beast, man! Give me some.
-How long was that?
-Seven minutes.
Seven minutes?
That's crazy, man. That's ridiculous.
How do you do it? l just like being in water. lt's the one place l can think. l wish l could spend all day underwater instead of this place.
Right. lt's like high school without the musical.
Every day it's the same thing. Look at this.
Good morning. l'm Mrs. Dodds, your substitute English teacher.
Would someone please explain what Shakespeare was trying to convey in this line from Othello?
Percy Jackson?
Well? l'm sorry, l don't know.
Anybody else?
-Hey, Mom, l'm home!
-l'm up here, honey!
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.
-How was school today?
-The usual. l think this dyslexia thing is getting worse.
Why do you think that? l don't know. Maybe it's the ADHD.
You know, l thought this school was supposed to make things better.
Percy, l know how hard this is for you.
-But someday it'll all make sense.
-Really?
When?
Tonight? Tomorrow? When?
Woman!
Hi, Gabe.
Where's my beer?
-lt's in the fridge.
-So, what, it's supposed to magically float from the icebox and into my hand?
Hustle.
Come on, man.
You have to do that right here? lt's disgusting. We're in a kitchen.
Yeah, real charmer you got there. Really.
Show some respect, all right?
That's my mom right there.
This is my house.
You show some respect.
Come on.
Why do you stay with that pig?
He smells like a sewer.
He sleeps till noon every day and he can't even hold a job.
Why do you stay with him?
He's been good to us, Percy, in ways you don't understand.
You're right. l don't understand. l don't get it.
Be prepared.
Everything is about to change, Percy.
Everything is about to change.
There are 12 Olympian gods.
The big three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.
They attained power by overthrowing their father, Kronos, chopping him into little pieces.
The three gods have been rivals ever since, always arguing, always threatening war.
On several occasions, they would come down to Earth and.. .
-How shall l put this?
-Hook up?
They would hook up with mortals.
The children of these unions were half god, half human.
Can anyone tell me what they were called?
Percy.
Percy. l'm sorry. What? What, Mr. Brunner?
What is the proper name of the offspring of a human and a god?
-Demigod.
-Exactly.
And many became great heroes, like Hercules and Achilles.
Can you name another? l'll give you a hint.
You have something in common.
Percy.. .
Perseus?
Correct.
Now, over here, we have a depiction of Hercules defeating the Nemean lion.
Hercules killed the beast with his bare hands and took the skin as a trophy.
Percy?
Yes, Mrs. Dodds?
We need to talk.
Okay.
The next 1 1 labors would become increasingly difficult. lt would take Hercules three months.. .
So, did l do something wrong?
Mrs. Dodds?
Hello?
Where is it?
Hey! Hey. How did you get up there?
-You stole the lightning bolt!
-l don't know what you're talking about!
Give it to me!
Give it to me! Now!
Or l will bite your heart out!
Percy!
-Release him !
-You!
Release him or l swear l'll tear you to pieces! l'm going crazy! l should be on medication.
Percy, calm down, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay!
Oh, God, wait! Did that really just happen?
She just turned into that thing?
A Fury concealed in our school. l should have known.
Wait, a Fury? What's a Fury?
And why did you say you could tear her to pieces?
-What did she want from you?
-She said something about me stealing a lightning bolt.
They found him.
-He's in danger.
-Who found me?
-He's no longer secure here.
-Where should we move him?
We have no choice. The Camp.
What camp? Look, l'm standing right here. lf they think he's the thief, there's nowhere safe on heaven and Earth for him now.
Percy, take this to defend yourself. lt's a powerful weapon. Guard it well.
Only use it in times of severe distress.
This is a pen. This is a pen!
Take him to his mother, and don't let him out of your sight.
Okay. Percy, come on. Come on, man.
Come on!
-Are you guys crazy?
-Let's go!
This is a pen, man.
-What do you want me to do with this?
-Come on!
-Look, man, what's going on?
-Look, don't trust anyone, okay?
Don't look at anybody, just keep walking!
Why did Mr. Brunner ask you to watch me?
-Because l'm your protector.
-Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
My protector? Are you kidding?
What, you think because l'm like this, l'm not capable of keeping you safe?
Maybe you're not seeing what l'm seeing.
You have crutches!
Look, l would give my life to secure your well-being.
What are you talking about?
What's going on?
We got to warn your mom.
Come on, Perce.
Come on!
-Sally! More beer!
-Mom !
Hey, Mom. Mom ! Mom !
Look, we gotta talk, okay?
Hey!
Can't you see she's servicing me and my friends?
Hey. Hey! Don't talk about my mom like that, you bald-headed freak.
No, Gabe! Gabe!
Calm down!
-Hey, nice one.
-Like l said, l'm your protector.
Yeah.
Sally, Percy has to leave now.
Like, right now.
Okay.
Look, what is happening?
Okay, l swear, l didn't steal anything!
Honey, l believe you. l believe you.
Where are you taking me?
What is this camp? lt's a camp for really special people,
-like you.
-''Special people''?
-What, am l crazy or something?
-No, honey, no.
Percy, this is about your father. l was just out of school and working at the Jersey shore when we first met.
Your father was unlike any guy l'd ever seen. He was just dazzling.
They're always dazzling.
We were really in love, Percy.
And then you came along, and then it was just perfect.
But he had to leave.
So he did abandon us.
No, honey, he was forced to. He loved you.
Leaving you, it was probably the most difficult thing he ever did.
Why did he have to go?
-Because he's.. .
-Sally, watch out!
Mom ! Go straight!
-Percy?
-Mom, you all right?
-Yeah, yeah.
-Grover, you all right? ls it me or is it raining cows?
What is that?
Get out! Come on! Come on!
Why are you taking your pants off?
What are you doing?
My job!
-You're half donkey?
-l'm half goat.
Go, Grover!
Guys, watch out, there's glass!
Come on, get out of the car!
That thing's getting closer!
-You don't even need these.
-Look, man, those are just for show.
Follow me!
This way, guys! This way!
Come on! Come on! Come on, run! Run!
Come on! Come on!
We're here!
-Mom ! What are you doing?
-This is as far as l can go.
-Come on!
-l can't go through! l'm not like you!
-Look, l'm not leaving without you.
-You have to!
You're meant to!
Put my mother down!
Percy, go! You're safe inside the gate!
-What can l do?
-Listen, use the pen!
-What?
-Use Brunner's pen and click it!
Perce, are you okay?
Percy, behind you!
-Perce, you okay?
-l'm not feeling.. .
Percy!
Perce, l'm sure glad you're alive.
-Where am l? What is this place?
-The infirmary.
-You've been unconscious for three days.
-Three days?
So, Perce, what do you remember?
Some crazy dream. l don't know.
There was a monster. My mom was there.
You were there, too, but you were some weird hybrid man-goat thing!
Yeah. The politically correct term is Satyr.
No.
No, no, no, no!
All of it was real? My mom's gone? l'm sorry, Percy. l try, man, l really do.
But, frankly, l'm just a junior protector. l don't have my horns yet. lt was my fault. lt was my job to protect you.
Both of you.
So this is Camp Half Blood.
-''Half'' meaning what?
-l think you know.
''Half'' meaning ''half mortal, half god."
-Fire!
-Guys! Watch the arrows!
Newcomer! Hello!
Look, man, remember all the myths about Greek gods and goddesses?
Well, they're not myths.
Look, remember what Mr. Brunner said?
Sometimes they come down to Earth and they fall in love with mortals?
And then they have kids?
-No way.
-Yes way.
Yep, you're a demigod!
Two points for Percy Jackson!
Look, don't worry. But you're not alone.
There's hundreds in the world.
Some lead normal lives, and some, l'm not allowed to divulge their names, are very famous. l'm talking about, like, White House famous.
See, man, this place right here, this is the place where you'll learn to harness your powers.
You'll train to become leaders, warriors and heroes. l think you have the wrong guy, all right? l'm not a hero. l'm a loser. l have dyslexia, ADHD.
And those are your greatest gifts.
When you try to read, the words float off the page, right?
That's because your brain is hardwired for Ancient Greek, not English.
Like at the museum, l could read.
Yeah. And your ADHD?
You're impulsive, Percy. You can't be still!
Those are your natural battle reflexes, man.
They kept you alive in your fight.
Look, no pitiful loser can defeat a Minotaur.
Your blood is special. lt's the blood of a god.
This is a lot to process.
Yeah, a lot. A lot.
This is where you'll do most of your battle training.
What's her name?
-She will squash you like a bug.
-Her name.
Annabeth. Daughter of Athena, the goddess of wisdom.
Hey, no staring. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.
There's someone l want you to see.
Check this out.
What are those things?
They're Centaurs.
-Wait a minute. ls that Mr. Brunner?
-Come on.
Mr. Brunner? ln my world, l'm known as Chiron.
-Are you recovered?
-Am l recovered?
You, you're not in a wheelchair. You have.. .
A real horse's ass. l apologize for hiding my true form, but l needed to keep an eye on you. l hope you'll forgive me.
Come.
Hey, Grover!
The daughters of Aphrodite.
Okay. All right, guys.
You guys got a lot of catching up to do.
Their mother is the goddess of love, so you know where that leads.
Hey, baby!
Satyrs.
What is this place?
Welcome home.
Your father built this for you.
This whole place is mine?
This thing's got some weight to it.
My father is Poseidon!
God of the seas.
Why didn't anybody tell me? lt was for your own safety. lt's exceedingly rare for a child to be born to one of the big three.
You're very powerful.
A threat.
A threat? Who am l threatening?
Poseidon's brothers, Zeus and Hades.
That's why your mother married your stepfather.
His pungent odor masked the smell of your blood
My mother put up with that creep to protect me? l wish l'd known.
She sacrificed so much for me.
Now she's gone.
Why am l even here?
You're here because you're in jeopardy.
Everyone thinks you're the lightning thief.
Look, l didn't steal it.
Zeus' bolt is the most powerful weapon ever created.
And if it's not returned by the summer solstice, in 10 days,
-there will be a war.
-This is your problem, all right? Not mine.
-This is about your world, not mine.
-This is about all worlds!
Olympians would be forced to choose sides.
Earth would become a battleground.
Mountains erupted, earthquakes, raging fires!
The end of life as you know it.
What can we do? l want to take you to Olympus, convince Zeus of your innocence.
Someone's using you to start a war.
What are we doing here? Let's go now.
Your boldness is commendable, but outside those gates you would be in danger at all times.
The Fury and the Minotaur were only the beginning.
First, we must train.
This is always a fun game to watch.
God, how do you guys wear this stuff? lt weighs more than me.
Look, trust me. Wear it or you'll get killed.
Wait. What? What? Wait.. .
Heroes! Warriors!
Fall in!
Hustle, hustle!
Dylan, Paris, stop lollygagging!
Percy. Step forward.
This is Percy Jackson!
And he's going to need a team.
We'll take him. l'm Luke. Son of Hermes and camp leader.
Not necessarily in that order.
Where's your helmet?
No one gave me one.
Chiron, you still got your wheelchair?
Kid's gonna need it.
You're a goner, man. l'm messing with you.
Smile a little bit. lt's good for you, kid.
Anybody got an extra helmet?
Please pass it up.
Try it on.
That'll protect you. So will all of us.
Welcome to the Blue Soldiers, my friend.
All right! Everyone in position for Capture the Flag!
First team to capture the enemy's banner wins.
Dismissed!
Steady, steady!
Now!
Percy, l know where the flag's at.
Come on!
Keep your eyes open. Don't get killed. l'm coming, buddy, l'm coming!
Sons of Ares. Watch out!
Whoa, that's a sword! That's a sword!
You guys take camp way too seriously.
Go!
Percy, get out of here! Go look for the flag!
How did l just do that?
No. l won.
Did you really think it would be that easy?
My mother is goddess of wisdom and battle strategy.
Do you know what that means? l always win. l always lose. Maybe we're both wrong.
Okay, Chiron, shouldn't we get in there and stop them?
-She's killing him, man.
-You've got to be kidding.
This is the best part!
Stand up and fight, hero.
Come on, Perce. Come on, Perce.
Go to the water.
The water will give you power.
Yeah, Perce!
-Get up there.
-All right! Yeah!
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Ladies and gentlemen, the son of Poseidon is coming through.
A hero is coming through! Move it!
Hey, no dirty looks. Stop that.
-Sorry, l'm trying.. .
-Hey, Percy?
We're having a party at our place later.
And we would really love it if you came. l'd love to come. That'd be great.
-That would be amazing!
-Awesome. l would love to come, too, to the party.
You know? Thanks for inviting me, ladies.
Beat it, nymphs.
Wait, don't leave. Ladies.. . l'm available.
Wait, come on, don't leave. l'm available! What time's the party?
-Feeling like a hero?
-More like a mutant. l'm not gonna grow a fish tail or gills or anything like that, am l?
Not likely.
Although a huge ego isn't out of the question.
You know you could have killed me out there? l could have died, if l was normal.
But you aren't. l get the sense that you don't like me very much. lt's possible. l mean, our parents hate each other.
Wait. They do? l definitely have strong feelings for you. l just haven't decided if they're positive or negative yet.
Well, you let me know when you figure it out.
You'll be the first.
Percy Jackson, show yourself!
Hades! Stay back!
Percy Jackson, bring me the bolt!
Be a good boy.
Hand it to me and l will exchange it for your mother.
Percy! Don't listen, Percy!
My mother's gone!
No, your mother is still alive. l sent the Minotaur to abduct her.
She is here with me in the Underworld.
Mom?
Percy?
What have you done with my mother? lf you ever want to see your mother again, you will bring me the bolt!
-Chiron, l have to go get her.
-Percy, you don't have the bolt.
Look, l'll tell him the truth!
When he realizes l'm not the thief, he'll release her.
No. You cannot negotiate with Hades.
When he finds out you don't have the bolt, he'll kill you and your mother.
-This is her only chance.
-No.
Stick to our plan.
Travel to Olympus, bargain with Zeus.
Once you convince him of your innocence, we will do everything in our power to bring back your mother.
Okay.
Going somewhere?
Yeah. Yeah, l'm going for a walk.
-For a walk? l'm coming with you.
-No, no, l'm going alone.
-No, l'm coming with you.
-No!
You're being followed.
-You're stressing me out.
-Leave me alone.
We got a 1 :00 demigod curfew, okay?
Leave me alone. Go to sleep or something.
No.
-Come on.
-One small victory and you're ready to fight Hades?
-Double team.
-Really? You, too?
Look, l just found out my mother is still alive. l'm gonna get her back.
-From the Underworld?
-Whatever it takes.
Yeah, well, maybe you'll outsmart Hades.
-Maybe l will.
-Look, man, l can't let you do this, okay?
Look, l'm not asking for your permission.
Okay. Well, according to regulations, if l can't stop you, l must accompany you,
'cause l'm your best friend and your protector.
Junior protector. ls that really necessary? l don't need your help. Okay?
This is something l have to do on my own.
Yeah, well, we weren't asking for your permission.
Come on, all right?
Today you tried to kill me.
-Now you want to defend me?
-That wasn't real.
-That was just training.
-Yeah.
Percy, that's all l've ever done, is train and train and train. l've grown up here. l've only been in the outside world a couple of times.
And l've never had the chance to go on an actual quest.
Besides, you've won one battle and l've won hundreds.
-You're gonna need my experience.
-Good point.
You two really want to come?
-Yes!
-Yeah!
Okay. l guess we're all going.
So who knows how to get to the Underworld? l did not think of that one. l think l know someone who might.
Friendly Harriers inbound!
Luke?
Hey, guys.
Percy. l figured you'd stop by sooner or later.
Everybody does, just to get away from all that
Renaissance fair stuff out there, you know?
But welcome to the modern world.
Cool. New stuff.
-What are you guys up to?
-We're going to get my mom back.
Your dad is the messenger of the gods, one of the only ones who's gotten in and out of the Underworld.
Do you have any idea how?
My dad's a jerk. l've never met him.
-You, too?
-Guess we all got Daddy issues, huh?
That's because all gods are the same.
Selfish.
They only care about themselves.
But l once broke into my dad's house.
Got some cool stuff.
For you.
Flying shoes?
They're my dad's.
He has hundreds of these little guys.
He won't even miss them.
Look underneath the other one.
You see, people have gone to the Underworld before without having to be dead.
Hercules did it. Orpheus did it.
My dad does it all the time.
Getting in's the easy part.
Getting out, now that's tricky.
This is a map to Persephone's pearls.
Persephone? You mean Hades' wife?
Yeah, he forced her to marry him.
Keeps her prisoner.
Needless to say, she hates it there. lt's hot, he's a weirdo.
So she has secret visitors.
She keeps pearls hidden for them all over the world, and these pearls, they provide a quick escape from the Underworld.
You could use them to get out.
-So, how do the pearls work?
-Easy.
You take a pearl, you step on it, you crush it, visualize where you want to be taken.
Right now, there's three pearls in the United States.
This map will guide you there.
Right here is your first location.
''Auntie Em's Garden Emporium."
Once you find the first pearl, the map will show you the next one, and the next one, and then you're off to Hades.
Which reminds me. You guys might need some extra protection, so.. .
My favorite shield.
You might want to take a step back.
-Hey. Thanks, Luke.
-Don't mention it.
But you're gonna have to promise me one thing. lf you see my dad on the highway to hell.. .
Yeah?
Kick his ass for me.
This place definitely needs an extreme makeover.
Hello!
Hello? Anybody home in Auntieville?
Check this out. They got free sodas.
Okay. That's nasty.
The Health Department needs to give this place an F.
Hey, guys, check this out.
Look at this.
Nice.
-Gold drachmas.
-That means we're on the right track.
Here.
How are we gonna find the pearl in this place?
That's a good question.
Okay, let's split up. Check everything.
-Good idea.
-Yeah. l'm gonna go this way.
Hello?
-Get out! She's coming!
-What? Who?
We stopped.. . Directions.. .
My poor husband! Help me!
Please, help me!
Check this out.
He looks just like my Uncle Ferdinand.
That's crazy.
He got the mole in the same place.
No. lt's not my Uncle Ferdinand, because Uncle Ferdinand was killed by
Medusa.
Percy! Annabeth!
-We're in trouble!
-Grover?
Please! We have to leave before she finds us!
-Who?
-She's turned my husband to stone!
Grover! Where are you?
Percy! Annabeth!
-Annabeth, where are you?
-Grover!
-Come on, man, watch where you're going!
-Perce! Listen.
-Where are we?
-We're in Medusa's lair.
-Annabeth!
-Annie!
We're lost! We'll never leave!
Don't move.
Well, this is a fabulous surprise. lt's so heartening to have such young visitors.
We get so lonely here.
Don't we?
That's why l create my statues.
They're my only company, daughter of Athena.
-How do you know me?
-You have such beautiful hair. l once had hair like that. l was courted, desired by many suitors.
But that all changed because of your mother, the woman who cursed me.
Who turned me.. .
-Don't look!
-.. .into this!
They say the eyes are windows to the soul. l hope you find my eyes attractive.
So rude, not looking people in the eyes.
Come on.
Sneak a peek.
How are we supposed to fight something we can't look at?
We can look at a reflection.
Okay, wait. Check this out.
All right. Good idea. l'm gonna go get Annabeth.
-Okay, l'm gonna take care of Medusa.
-Okay.
You'll make a wonderful addition to my collection.
We'll be friends forever.
Do you mind?
No, no.
Sooner or later you will open those eyes.
The temptation to look at me is too hard to resist.
Don't look, Annabeth!
Don't open your eyes!
Who's that?
Another demigod? l can sense you.
Son of Poseidon. l used to date your daddy.
-Need a hand?
-Grover. Help.
-Thanks. Okay.
-Come on. Let's go. l hear you have the lightning bolt.
May l see it? l don't have it!
Let me see your eyes. l hear they're bluer than the Circassian Sea.
Open them, or my hungry babies will have to open them for you.
But it would be such a pity to destroy such a young and handsome face.
Stay with me, Percy.
All you have to do is look.
Are you okay?
Yeah, l'm okay.
Son of Poseidon!
Heads up.
Hey, guys! lt's cool to open up your eyes!
Annabeth, that was great, great demigod driving.
Thanks.
-We should take it with us.
-The head? Oh, no. That's sick. lf you open the eyes, they still work, dead or alive.
You never know when something like that might come in handy.
Yeah, you're right. But l'm not touching it.
Come on, man, just take off your jacket.
We'll wrap it up until we get some ice.
Why do l got to take off my jacket?
Because you're the protector.
Yeah, you're right. l am the protector.
So l'm gonna give you my hoodie, not my jacket. Okay?
Come on, you baby.
Disgusting.
Yeah, just toss it up. Come on, don't.. .
Hey. Hey. Guys, wait.
The pearl.
One down, two to go.
Would have been nice if Luke had warned us about Medusa.
Maybe he just didn't know.
GPS from the gods. Where to next?
Let's see.
The Parthenon in Nashville.
Nashville? Oh, great.
Home of my least favorite music.
-Let's stop for the night!
-Yeah.
-Let's stop for the night!
-Yeah.
-Good idea.
-Oh, my God.
Percy.
Hey.
-Hey.
-Nice work today. Thanks.
What happened to you?
That poor lady who turned to stone, she.. .
She had a tight grip.
Check this out.
Cool. Very cool.
So, why do our parents hate each other?
They both wanted to be patron god of Athens.
And the people chose Athena.
And our parents have hated each other ever since.
-What's your mom like?
-l don't know.
-l never met her.
-What? ls it like this for everybody?
-Don't any gods see their kids?
-lt's forbidden.
Right after we were born, Zeus decreed that the gods couldn't have physical contact with their mortal offspring.
-That's a stupid law.
-l agree.
Although, between us, l think my mother speaks to me sometimes. ln times of trouble, l hear her voice
-giving me advice.
-That's happened to me!
Yeah. That's your father talking to you.
Yo, Percy! Get in here, man! This is ugly!
Right.
Hey, hurry up!
Perce, check this out, man.
You're on TV.
...surrounding the missing boy,
Percy Jackson,
and his mother, Sally Ugliano.
But their relatives have
some interesting theories.
So, Mr. Ugliano, talk to me
about your son, Percy Jackson.
No, he's not my son. He's a stepson.
He did not come from these loins.
Ever since he started with the drugs
and the alcohol,
-he's never been the same.
-Oh, no.
Five nights ago, he tried to kill me
and he threw his mother on the ground.
And his cripple friend then attacked me
from behind and knocked me out.
When l woke up, Sally was gone.
She was kidnapped by Percy.
-She would never leave with that...
-Shut up, Gabe.
Great. Now l'm a fugitive.
See? That's what l'm talking about, man.
Gabe's always running his mouth.
He's just mad because l busted him up with my crutches.
Guys, l can't pee with her watching me.
Sorry, guys. l messed up. l should have closed the curtains.
Come on, guys. Let's hit the road before Homeland Security shows up.
That's amazing.
A complete replica of the Parthenon in Nashville.
All right, guys. Let's go get the pearl.
Hey. That's your mom. l wonder if she really looks like that.
We'll find out.
Guys, check this out. Oh, man. lt's the pearl.
-That was easy.
-Easy? lt's 30 feet in the air and this place is filled with tourists. l got an idea.
We'll come back after the place closes.
Come on, follow me.
Or l can just throw my crutch up there.
-l'm saying, the pearl would fall out.. .
-Grover!
Perce, l'm saying.. . lt's not a bad idea !
The park's been closed for an hour.
Let's move.
Yes, sir!
-All right, this will be easy.
-Okay. l'm gonna fly up. l'm gonna use Luke's flying shoes.
-l'm gonna grab the pearl, and.. .
-Cool.
Okay, so what are we going to do?
All right, guys. l got this.
You got what? Hey, yo, hey, listen!
-You're going to kill the janitors?
-Chill.
Those are working-class Americans!
Oh, man.
-Why did you do that?
-They're not dead, they're unconscious.
-Now, we have 30 minutes. Come on!
-Cool.
-Y'all, what's cracking?
-Hey.
-Luke!
-Annabeth!
How do you turn on the shoes?
Tell Percy he's got to
break into a run, okay?
He's got to build up speed,
kind of like a jet on a runway.
lt's gonna take some practice.
Okay. l got this. lt's gonna take some practice!
-l got it!
-Yes!
-Yeah, Percy!
-There we go!
-There it is.
-Yeah!
-That's what l'm talking about.
-Way to go.
All right, let's grab everything.. .
Oh, man.
Look, l got this, okay?
Hey, guys, l'm with Park Recreational Services.
You guys have been caught sleeping on the job. You better be happy l'm not writing you guys up, okay?
This is the last time.
We've been expecting you, Mr. Jackson.
Not again.
Just give us the lightning bolt and we'll let you go.
Look, l don't have the lightning bolt.
Okay. This is bad.
Hydra !
Guys, watch out!
The middle one spews fire!
You got a sweet tooth? All right! Try that!
Percy, stop! No!
How flipping awesome was that? l just killed that thing!
Killed it? You only made it worse.
-What are you talking about?
-Percy, when you cut off one Hydra head, two more grow back.
Get back!
Distract that thing! l'll get the pearl!
Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!
Go! Open the door!
The door won't open!
Grover!
That's nasty.
We interrupt
our regularly scheduled programming
for this special report.
Scientists are baffled
by what now appears to be
a single storm cloud that is expanding
over much of Europe and Asia,
moving towards the United States.
Savage winds, rain and mammoth waves
are being reported along the coastlines
of several continents.
So far, no casualties, but countries
everywhere are preparing for the worst.
The gods are angry.
We need to get the last pearl.
Where's the next location?
Yeah.
Well, let's see.
Well, guys, we got ourselves a good one.
We're going to Vegas!
Yo!
There it is.
Lotus Casino. l've been looking forward to this!
Look, guys, remember, always split the eights, never the tens, okay?
We're not here to gamble, remember?
-We got poker, we got blackjack.. .
-Grover, we're not here to have fun.
We just need to grab the pearl and go, okay?
All right.
This is nice!
Okay, this place is officially dope.
Here's your complimentary
Lotus Fun Book.
Thanks, but we're not staying.
Please, l insist. lt's good for everything in the hotel and casino.
Don't comp us. We're not checking in.
-Okay, that guy was persistent.
-Yeah!
Yeah, we're here for one thing and one thing only.
That is really awesome.
Where would we find a green pearl in this place?
Maybe on a cocktail waitress or a showgirl.
We should start there.
Can l get you something?
Try a lotus flower. They're so good.
-lt's our signature dish.
-Really? Signature? ls it good?
-Thank you.
-Yo, do we have to pay for this?
-l guess we don't.
-lt's free.
That's really good.
This is the most delicious thing l've ever consumed!
Guys, why don't we stay here for a while?
-Yeah!
-That sounds like an amazing idea.
But we're on a time-sensitive mission right now.
-Aren't we.. .
-l can't remember. l totally forgot what l was gonna say. l think l figured it out. l think l know why we're here.
-Why are we here?
-To have fun.
Okay. Let's never leave!
-Yeah!
-Let's stay here!
Yeah!
You're awesome!
-Thanks.
-Thank you! Thanks.
No, Percy. Don't eat the flower.
lt dulls the senses,
keeps you prisoner here.
Hey, l think l'm gonna go get some air. l'll be right back.
Okay.
-Another lotus flower?
-No, l'm good. Thank you.
Look around you. Focus. Focus!
-Another lotus flower?
-No, thank you.
-Would you like another one?
-l'm fine.
-The French Connection?
-Yeah. You seen it yet?
Yeah, yeah, l think so, on DVD.
What's DVD?
Seriously?
Whatever. l think it's the best movie of the year.
What? Wait. This year?
Yeah, this year. 1971 .
Percy, wake up.
You need to escape.
-Wake up!
-You could really use a lotus flower. l really don't want one.
-Thank you.
-Just one.
No!
Another lotus flower?
-No.
-We insist. l really don't want another lotus flower, so please, leave me alone. ls there a problem, Mr. Jackson?
No. Thank you.
Percy Jackson's awake.
Excuse me. Annabeth. Annabeth!
What're you doing with that?
Don't eat that.
-What?
-We have to go. Now.
What do you mean?
We're having so much fun!
No, no, no, we're not having fun.
Grover! Grover! Wake up!
Grover! Come on, we got to go!
What? Look, Perce, your timing is terrible, okay?
Dude, we're heading to the chapel.
We're getting married!
-How romantic!
-No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, which of y'all did l propose to?
-Wake up!
-Yo, man, you're such a buzz kill.
Percy, what's wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?
Both of you need to wake up, now!
Look at me. Look at me.
You're in a trance, okay? We're trapped!
Listen to me. lf you eat the flowers, you're never gonna want to leave. Okay?
We're gonna be stuck here forever!
Oh, no. We got to go.
-Okay, l see your point! Okay.
-Let's get the green pearl!
Hold it right there!
Stop right where you are.
Move, James Dean! Out of the way!
Let's go, guys! Car! Car!
Come on, guys! Car!
Get in!
Come on, come on! ln the car, in the car! Let's go!
-Keys! Got the keys.
-Come on! Go!
-Drive! Drive!
-They're coming! They're coming!
-Come on, start driving!
-l got this.
Go!
Now, that's how you get out of a casino!
That's how you drive!
Of course. Now that all makes sense.
-What?
-That was the lair of the lotus eaters.
They've been luring people into their trap since ancient times.
Guys, look. Tomorrow is June 21st.
No. No, no. lt can't be. Today's the 15th.
No, tomorrow is the 21st.
We were in there for five days.
-lt felt like hours.
-Then tomorrow's the solstice.
Our deadline is tomorrow at midnight.
Okay, look, we've got to move it.
Where's Hades? lt's in Hollywood.
All right. l can get us there in four hours.
Maybe three.
And now,
the latest breaking news from KZL Y.
An unprecedented storm cloud has grown
to cover most of North America.
Authorities in several states
are ordering evacuations,
reporting severe weather conditions.
Don't slip. Watch your step.
Wait, wait. Hold it.
''Woe to all depraved souls."
Well, l guess there ain't no turning back now.
-Yep. Looks like we're stuck in here.
-Yeah.
Hey, Perce, who's that creepy guy with the hoodie? l don't know. Let's find out.
Who are you?
-We need to see Hades.
-The living are not permitted here.
Die and come back.
Okay, we won't die and come back, but.. .
You know what? l think l know what he wants.
-What?
-You got to pay the ferryman.
Watch this.
Yo, my friend! What up?
Okay, guess not.
Look, you like dead people, right? l got a few dead people you might recognize.
Check this out. Jackson, Grant.
And look who's joining the party.
Benjamin Franklin.
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
Look, you give us a boat ride, you take the money and you get an interior decorator,
'cause it is too depressing in here.
All right? Here you go.
That was $170!
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The drachma. The drachma !
Climb aboard.
Thanks for telling me, man, you're burning money. We're in a recession.
-That's treason.
-Just shut up. Shut up, man. Go on.
Welcome to the Underworld.
What is all this?
The scrapheap of human misery.
Lost hopes and dreams.
Wishes that never came true.
All lives end in suffering and tragedy.
This is as far as l go.
Guys, do you hear that?
-Yeah, what is that?
-l don't know.
-Annie, stab that thing!
-What are we gonna do?
Back!
-What were those things?
-Hellhounds.
Yeah, well, maybe you should feed them.
They sensed the presence of another animal.
-Great, they smell goat.
-A Satyr. l haven't had a Satyr
-visit before.
-Persephone!
What could possibly be taking so long?
Don't ignore me!
Or what? What will you do? l'm already in Hell.
We have visitors.
Nephew.
Welcome.
You have your father's looks.
Always the lucky side of the family.
Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
-You're Hades?
-Yes.
Sorry. l just didn't expect you to look like this, man.
Kind of stylish. l like it.
Would you prefer that l looked like this?
No! No! Look, stick to the Mick Jagger thing! lt works for you!
You're very brave coming here.
Come closer.
Hey. Perce. l can see the look of disgust in your eyes, but this existence was not of my choosing. l was banished here by Zeus and your father. l am damned.
My only chance of getting out of this place is to defeat my brothers and take control of Olympus. But, of course, l'll need the bolt.
-And l need my mother.
-Then we have an understanding.
You give me the bolt and l'll give you your mother. l need to tell you the truth. l'm not the lightning thief. l don't have the bolt. l never did.
Why did you come here, then?
Well, l was hoping that when you saw that l wasn't the thief, you'd let my mother go.
Yes. Yes, but do you think l'm an idiot? l'm Hades!
Now, give me the bolt, or say goodbye to your mother!
Percy! l thought l'd lost you forever.
No.
Zeus' master bolt.
Liar. l swear, l don't know how that got there.
-That's not even my shield!
-No!
Luke rigged it!
He put the bolt in his shield and used us.
Luke stole the lightning bolt. l think we're done here.
Feed them to the souls.
We had a deal, all right?
You have the bolt! Just let us go!
Summon the hounds.
-Ella tho!
-No. No ella tho.
Lassie, sit! Sit!
No! No! l am going to be king of the gods.
Stay back! Stay!
Stay!
All right, come on.
Go on, give it back.
Bad dog!
He won't remember a thing!
Why did you do that?
Because he's cruel and abusive!
The only thing l look forward to is my allotted time away from this hellhole.
A war of the gods would put an end to that.
And l'd be alone, with only him, forever.
Go. Take the bolt, and your mother.
Only three?
Oh, no.
There are four of you.
Each pearl transports only a single person.
One of you will have to stay.
-All right, l'll stay. You three go.
-What? No.
No, no, no. l've achieved
-my quest. l'm staying here.
-No. No! l've trained for situations like this.
Guys! Guys. Knock it off.
-l'm staying, because l'm the protector.
-Grover, come on.
Look, man, l don't want to hear it. Just go. lt's my duty. lt's what l'm meant for.
We'll come back for you. l'll take very good care of him.
All right. Now move it, guys!
Each of you, step on a pearl and concentrate on where you want to go.
Take this.
To Olympus.
Hey. Look.
Zeus and Poseidon preparing for battle.
No, no. This isn't the right place.
This isn't Olympus. This is.. .
This is the Empire State Building!
Percy! The entrance to Olympus is there!
Well, there's 10 minutes till midnight.
Let's move.
Percy Jackson!
Well, you weren't supposed to make it out alive. l can't let you take that bolt to Olympus. l'm the lightning thief.
You hid the bolt in my shield. Why?
Well, when you said you were going to the Underworld, it hit me.
''That is the perfect opportunity to get the bolt to Hades."
Why would you do that?
To bring Olympus crumbling down.
Percy, let's go.
Let's go!
Well, it's too late, 'cause l'm returning the bolt to Zeus right now.
Not before midnight.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Luke! Why do you want a war of the gods?
Control.
They've been in power for too long. l say it's time for our generation to take over.
Remold the world in our image.
-A world of new heroes.
-You're no hero.
-Mom, are you all right?
-Yeah.
Stay here.
Luke!
Maybe they were wrong.
Maybe you're no son of Poseidon.
Yeah. l think l am the son of Poseidon.
He's got the bolt! Come on!
Let's move! We've got two minutes!
Olympus.
Percy, l can't get through.
You've got to go!
Silence!
-lt is almost midnight.
-This was predestined!
-You wanted this battle!
-You have only yourself to blame!
Please! Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!
Time has run out.
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
My name is Percy Jackson, and l think you might be looking for this.
Give me the bolt, lightning thief.
You're wise to betray your father. l didn't steal it.
And l have no connection to Poseidon.
But tell me, if you didn't steal it, then who did?
Luke, son of Hermes.
You see, he was angry at you.
All of you.
He wanted you to destroy yourselves.
You have done well.
Let there be peace.
Hi, Mom.
Annabeth, l am so proud of you.
Zeus, l have a good friend.
He's a Satyr named Grover.
He's my protector, and the only reason why we escaped the Underworld is because he stayed behind.
And now you expect me to bring him back.
Very well. l believe this assembly's business here is finished.
Brother, please. l need to speak with him.
Just this once. l'll meet you outside. l'm not expecting you to forgive me.
But l want you to know that l'm grateful. l didn't do it for you. l did it to save Mom.
Please. We don't have much time.
How old was l when you left?
Seven months.
Look, l didn't need you there all the time, but.. . l would have liked to have seen you just once.
Why didn't you ever come back? l wanted to.
When l was with you and your mother, l became less concerned with my responsibilities. l was becoming human.
-And that's a bad thing?
-For a god? Zeus thought so.
That's why he passed the law preventing gods from ever having contact with their children.
That was because of you?
But l was always watching over you.
Just because you didn't see me doesn't mean that l wasn't there.
When you were troubled, l tried to help. l heard you. l know l'm not the father you always wanted, but if you ever need me, l'll be there for you, in your thoughts and in your dreams. l'll stand by you, Percy.
Always.
You can come visit me anytime.
Just promise me that l don't have to see that loser Gabe ever again. l kicked him out.
Yeah, he's gone.
He's out of our lives forever.
Finally.
-l'm going to miss you.
-Me, too.
Percy?
This is where you belong.
-Good job, man.
-Thanks, Perce.
Ready! Aim !
-Hey, whoa, Perce.. . Watch it!
-Hey!
You guys gonna kill the man who saved the world?
Great job. All you guys, take a lunch break.
Thank you!
So, the conquering hero returns, triumphant.
-Grover.
-Hey!
-You notice anything different about me?
-No.
You sure?
Anything that's improved about me?
No. What, you've been working out?
What, you get a new cologne?
You smell good.
-Look, man. l got my horns!
-l was seeing them the whole time. l mean, look at that thing.
You got little horns in your head.
-Right?
-Crazy.
Zeus came through, and now l'm Senior Protector, First Class, baby.
Congratulations. Definitely earned them.
Thank you, man.
Keep moving, keep moving!
Don't lose interest!
One foot in front of the other, and the next thing you know, you're running!
Percy.
You left the camp.
You disobeyed my orders.
Yeah, about that.
Which is why you're my favorite student.
You can receive all the training in the world, but ultimately, you have to follow your instincts.
Grace under pressure.
All right. Time to train. Go suit up.
You might be a big shot on Olympus, but down here, you're still just one of my students.
Move it.
Nice horns, Grover. l'm serious, man.
We talked, we wooed, we dined,
-we had a great time!
-Well, l'm happy for you, you know?
Persephone might really like me. l'm serious. l think you can handle this one on your own.
All right, Perce.
-Hey, Perce, awesome job, man.
-Hey, thanks.
-Good job.
-Thanks.
Good job.
Who's next? l think l'd like to give it a shot.
Welcome home.
Wait!
First rule of battle strategy.
Don't ever let your opponent distract you.
Sally, open the door!
Open up!
-You changed the locks?
-Yes.
So, here's your junk.
-You can let yourself out.
-Well.. .
How am l supposed to move all this stuff by myself?
Deal with it. l need a beer.
What? ''Do not open.. ."
That little brat.
Well, l may not live here anymore, but l'm still the king of this castle.
English - US
It's funny how you wake up each day
and never really know if it will be one that will change your life forever.
But that's what this day was.
The day I left the city to spend a week in the house where my mother grew up.
A day I'll never forget.
So many years have passed
Almost there. Feeling all right?
I'm okay.
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And look at the trees
I used to play there when I was a child
Oh, Hara.
How many times have I told her?
Wait here. All right? I won't be a minute.
Okay.
Hara! Your car's blocking the driveway again.
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Shawn? Where are you?
Shawn?
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.
Come meet Hara!
Supper is done and night has come
Let's have tea together near the fireplace
Nice try.
My house, my home ls so small, so pretty
My mom, my dad We are family
Joy everywhere
Hey, back off!
Hey! Go get your own!
Arrietty!
What?
You went outside again, didn't you?
How many times have I...
What happened to your room?
It's my own little garden.
If you ask me it looks more like your own little jungle.
Is that a bay leaf?
Where did you get that?
I wanted to wait and give it to you on your birthday, but...
Happy birthday!
This will last me all year.
But the bay tree is so far away.
If a bean saw you it would...
Beans don't scare me.
The beans should scare you.
That's what worries me.
The world is a dangerous place for a Borrower.
Your Aunt Eggletina wasn't scared either and she...
Was eaten by a toad. I know, I know.
If you don't like your gift
I can put it in my room.
No, no, I should keep it.
I have just the recipe for these.
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.
Oh, you don't have to.
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.
What?
Don't tell me you forgot!
Tonight's my first borrowing!
Look, Papa's home.
Papa. Papa, I made it all the way to the bay tree today.
And I used the leaves over my head just like you said.
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.
So, what I'm trying to say,
- if there was any doubt...
- There's a new bean in the house.
What?
- I know. I saw him.
- Arrietty, I told you to be...
Yes, Mama, I was careful and he didn't see me.
And he's much smaller than other beans.
Papa, you just have to let me come borrowing tonight.
We know nothing about this new bean.
But you promised this would be my night.
And I've seen him.
Papa, please, I am telling you, he's just a child.
And the children are more vicious than the grownups.
I'll be fine.
Well, the young beans do go to bed early.
Oh, thank you, Papa!
Pod!
The boy is very sickly and weak.
She'll be fine.
But...
Oh, and don't worry, Mother.
I'll get Papa back safely.
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.
She'll need to know how to take care of herself out there.
Without our help.
Sometimes I worry that we are the only Borrowers left.
What'll become of us?
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.
Your heart needs rest. No excitement.
- Is that clear, Hara?
- Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.
Whatever you need, Shawn, you ask Hara,
- and she'll get it for you, all right?
- Yes, Aunt Jessica.
Make him feel at home, Hara.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.
Don't you think you should wear something a little darker and longer?
No, I think this one's perfect.
So, I need you to get me some tissue paper and some sugar.
Oh, and promise, dear husband, you won't let our daughter get eaten or squashed like a bug.
Oh, please God. Please help them.
Don't worry about me. Everything's fine.
Okay, bye, Mom. I love you.
Oh, goodbye. Love you, too.
Stay close to your father.
I will
Do I get one of those?
Nope? Okay.
Arrietty!
Did you see that?
That's my girl.
Don't look down.
One step at a time.
All right. You need to hold this for me.
Okay.
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.
Arrietty!
- Let's go.
- Right.
It's so big.
Papa, what is this place?
This is where beans store all their food.
The sugar is over there.
When you get down there, wait for me.
Yeah!
Papa, you are great!
Yay!
There. That wasn't so hard.
- Where to now?
- Tissue paper. Then home.
Papa, look what I found.
Looks like someone got their first borrowing.
Careful with it, it's sharp.
Okay.
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!
Look down there.
Filthy rats.
You want to stay away from those things.
I'm not afraid.
I will cut them down to size with my sword.
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.
What is this place?
I've heard human beans call it a dollhouse.
Dolls are toys for beans.
And we are not toys.
These things are not for borrowing.
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.
Don't you think Mother would absolutely love that dresser over there?
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.
Borrowers take only what they need.
Don't be afraid, okay?
Hey.
I know it was you in the garden.
I knew I saw you.
My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.
Was it you?
Was it?
Please don't go.
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
He might have seen me out in the garden today.
We all make mistakes.
So we'll just have to be extra careful now.
Best not to tell your mother about this.
You know how she worries.
Right.
I'm very proud of you.
A lesser Borrower would've panicked and run away.
Well, we're home.
Safe and sound.
Is everything okay?
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.
This old light gave out halfway to the kitchen.
No.
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up on the sugar.
That's okay.
I'm just happy you made it home.
It wasn't a total loss.
Arrietty, why don't you show your mother your first borrowing?
What a beautiful pin.
Okay. Off to bed.
Night, Mama, Papa.
She looks so worn-out.
Should I make us some tea?
Shawn, come inside.
You'll catch your death of cold.
What did you say?
Why would he do that?
I think he was just being nice.
It's the same cube of sugar
I dropped in his room last night.
Pod, what does she mean, she dropped it?
Do not touch it. Do you understand me?
It's a trap.
I just know it. They're going to trap us like cockroaches.
Homily, let's try not to get hysterical, okay?
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!
We'll probably have to move now.
Goodbye, old table.
We had so many fun times together.
Let's not say goodbye to anything just yet.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I told you that young bean would be trouble!
But no one ever listens to me.
Thank you, Arrietty.
Smart girl, doing this when the sun came out.
Or maybe I have a smart mama who taught me.
You're a good girl.
If you've got this,
I think I'll go lie down a bit.
Okay.
Is that you from last night?
No, wait. Don't go.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Please leave us alone.
We don't need your help.
But can I please just talk to you?
No! Human beans are dangerous.
Whenever we're seen, we have to move.
My parents said so.
So you have a family. That must be nice.
You don't have a family?
Yeah, I have one.
But they sent me here to get the care and attention I need.
Because they're both very busy with their work.
Sorry to hear that.
Anyway, my name is Shawn.
What's your name?
What do they call you?
Not that it's any of your business, but it's Arrietty.
Arrietty. Arrietty.
That's a beautiful name.
Maybe we could be friends?
Could you at least come out so I can see you?
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.
I won't hurt you, I promise.
Help me! Help me!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What in the world? A crow!
Oh! Attack! OW!
You get out right now!
What got into that bird?
Don't think I've ever seen one behave like that.
Maybe it's nesting season or something.
I don't know.
Looks me to like it was after something.
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.
Which I'll have to replace, of course.
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?
Your aunt said for you not to get too excited!
Should I get your medicine?
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.
Nesting season?
Well, Shawn, you have a nice, long rest now.
Papa!
I hear you visited the young bean.
I'm sorry.
I went to ask him to leave us alone.
But I really don't think he intends to hurt us.
Many Borrowers have lost their lives thinking the same.
It must never happen again.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
We'd better start looking for a new home.
The boy knows that we're here.
Are we safe?
Delivery. Package for you, ma'am.
Thanks for the drink, Hara.
It's pretty hot today.
Do you happen to know of any good pest control companies?
Pest problem?
Here's one.
"Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination."
1-800... Oh, hang on.
So you got yourself a mouse problem?
Maybe it's mice, maybe it's little tiny people.
Strange things have been happening here and I know why.
That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I mean, when Hara told me,
I just couldn't believe it.
Why on earth would a crow try to fly into your room?
Were you frightened?
No, I wasn't scared.
Hara came and chased it away
And it's a good thing I came in when I did.
That bird had huge wings and claws...
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara, considering Shawn came here for a little peace and quiet and tranquility before his operation.
Yes, ma'am. Forgive me.
I'm sorry, Hara.
I don't mean to be short with you.
But why his mother chose this time to go away on business is just beyond...
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother here to look after you.
You know, not so much lately.
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped, but honestly, why couldn't she be here when her son needs her so?
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing that miniature house in my room.
And the detail's amazing.
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.
That beautiful little house belonged to your mother.
She had to leave it here when she moved away to go to college.
It was Mother's?
Your grandfather had it specially made because he was hoping it would be a lovely home for the little people.
What?
That's right.
Little people who lived in the walls.
He was quite obsessed with them.
People laughed, of course, and called him mad.
But your mother, she believed him.
They worked on that house together for hours.
And he told her they would come, but of course, they never did.
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any tiny little people in your room?
Can't say that I have.
I think it's why your mother doesn't like to come here any more.
Too many memories of wishes that never came true.
Can we look inside it?
Yes!
You know, I haven't looked inside it in quite a long time.
Hara, could you be a dear and turn off the lights?
Ma'am.
So many years have passed
This is the living room.
Your grandfather had all of this handmade by a real furniture maker in England.
Isn't that just insane?
Look at the attention to detail.
They really were preparing it for someone to live in.
And just in case you don't believe what I'm saying is absolutely true, have a look at that room right there.
Come in the garden
What a kitchen!
And look at the trees
Everything in it a miniature of the real thing.
That oven actually works.
You could bake real cookies.
Some really little cookies.
What a pity their dream never came true.
It really would've made a lovely home.
Settled down there long ago
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And sit on the grass
I used to sit there when I was a child
Ivy and moss
Little daisies
Covered the lane long ago
You know, Mother, we've had these same pictures for years.
Wouldn't you like some new ones?
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.
And I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.
Besides, there's no point in changing them now.
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.
Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?
What's wrong with me?
There he is!
Does he look eaten?
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?
I slipped and twisted my leg.
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.
Well, what is going on down...
Pod, you're hurt!
It was the cat, wasn't it?
See, I'm not crazy.
Get up here!
Does it hurt, Papa?
It's just a sprain. Go calm your mother.
I'll get some cold water. I'll be right back.
Everyone relax!
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.
Who's that?
I wonder if he has news about any of the other Borrowers.
Okay, I leave now.
Can't you at least stay and have some tea?
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.
Why don't you see if Spiller would like a cup of tea?
Won't you please stay, Spiller?
I've never met another Borrower before.
We can't thank you enough for your help.
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?
We're all alone here and we're starting to believe we're the only ones left. Are we?
This many.
Oh! Then cousin Lupy could still be alive.
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it? Can I see it?
You use this for your borrowing?
Give that back, Arrietty, before you shoot someone's eye out.
Okay. Go now.
Oh, but couldn't you stay a little bit longer?
I'll cook dinner.
Already got this.
A cricket leg!
Want some?
- Very fresh.
- No, thanks.
Bye.
Thank you, my friend.
I'll go with him. To see him out.
What were you doing out there in that storm?
I was looking for a safe route for our journey.
And now I know which route not to take.
Oh, Pod.
Spiller knows of more Borrowers a few days journey away.
There's a small river past the forest.
He's offered to take us on it.
That's great.
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.
And I'm sure it will almost be as nice as this.
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.
Or that I met anyone.
Hey, maybe next time you could bring your whole family with you.
No family. Only Spiller.
Well, we... We could be a family.
And when you come back you could stay for a family dinner.
Hara?
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.
You'll have to start over.
Why do we need such a big bag anyway?
Are we putting the whole house in here?
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.
Papa, can I come in?
- How's your leg?
- Well, better than that cricket's.
I'm serious.
Papa, why do we have to move?
Once a Borrower has been seen, the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.
Well, isn't it possible that not every human bean is dangerous?
Arrietty, before you were born there were two other families who were living in this house.
One family went missing, they just disappeared.
The other one moved away.
They were seen by humans.
And so, we have to do whatever it takes to survive.
But, Papa...
Oh! Oh, no!
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?
Mother!
It won't open!
Frame is buckled!
The wall!
Homily!
Homily, are you all right?
Pod, remember how I always said
I wanted a new kitchen?
More bills.
Remember, take only the things we need.
We can't possibly carry all of this.
And, Homily, don't take anything from the dollhouse.
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.
- You stay with your mother.
- Okay.
So you finally came.
Did you like your new kitchen?
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.
But it doesn't matter.
Because I came to tell you goodbye.
Can I turn around?
You're beautiful.
My papa said we have to move now.
We've been seen, and Borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.
What are Borrowers?
My mother, father, and I are all Borrowers.
We borrow things that beans won't miss if they are gone.
Just little things, soap, cookies, and sugar.
All things that we need to survive.
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.
I think my grandfather saw one of you once.
It's possible.
And it's my fault that you're leaving.
Niya! Niya!
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.
So, in my aunt's house, how many other Borrowers are there who are living with you?
It's just my father and my mother and me.
What about in other houses?
I'm sure there are some.
But I've only met one other so far.
You must be afraid you'll be the only ones of your kind who are left.
What?
Every year there's fewer and fewer of you, right?
Aren't you scared that soon you'll all be gone?
What a horrible thing to say!
I know that there's more of us because Spiller said so!
Who's Spiller?
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest, and he said that there are hundreds more of us.
That might be true.
But, you know, none of us can live forever, can we?
We all have to die sometime.
Why would you say something like that?
Because it's true.
I guess so.
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes things happen to us that are just beyond our control.
And when these things happen, there's really nothing you can do about it.
You just accept it and prepare for the worst.
I wish it wasn't that way.
But you can't live a life that's built on nothing but wishes.
It isn't practical.
Sometimes you just have to accept the hand of fate.
Oh, no, you don't.
Sometimes you have to stand up and fight for the things that are worth fighting for.
You have to survive.
That's what my papa says.
And so we're leaving even though it's dangerous.
And we are going to survive.
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.
We always have.
As long as we have each other to live for, we'll keep on living.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm actually the one who's going to die.
What?
There's something wrong with my heart.
They're gonna operate next week but it probably won't help.
That's terrible.
I've always been sick and I've had someone looking after me.
And that's why when I saw you,
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.
But I guess I messed up.
I made it worse. I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.
Now what on earth is this doing here?
Now how did you get in there?
There you are!
Mom!
What? What's wrong?
My mother, I think she's in danger.
No!
Give me that, you little thief!
Now we'll see who they call crazy.
And I bet there's more of you, aren't there?
Wait, no! Wait, wait! Wait!
I have to go help her.
But...
Oh, no! Help! No, no, please! Help!
Pod! Arrietty!
Let me out of here!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!
Arrietty! Help!
Watch it!
Let's see.
Now to find the others.
Let me out! No! No!
Something terrible has happened.
- Squeaky Klean.
- Yes, hello.
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.
Could you get out here right away?
I have a very unique pest problem.
- Is it mice?
- Oh, much worse than mice.
Do you want them exterminated?
No, I need you to trap them.
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!
Shawn! Shawn!
Arrietty!
My mother is missing.
Someone took the roof off!
I think a human bean got her.
Oh, Mama.
We will find her.
What?
Someone's locked us in.
There's a room next door. Hold on tight.
One step at a time.
Right.
It's stuck!
Wait.
I can get us in.
Oh, no, no!
Keep going.
What do you mean you're lost?
How can you possibly be lost?
It's the only road!
- Is it before the bridge?
- What bridge? There's no bridge!
Hara must have found it and opened it.
This is what I was afraid of.
Mother's been taken.
Are you okay?
Be careful. Shawn, please.
Where are those idiots?
Mother! Where are you?
Be wise.
They're supposed to catch pests.
But... HOW did you...
Hara.
Could I have some warm milk?
Okay! Wait just a minute.
Thank you, Hara.
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?
Cookies? Now he wants cookies.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Arrietty!
Over here!
Arrietty! Here I am! Here I am!
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Arrietty.
Oh, good. There they are.
They finally found the road.
The only road.
Another bean!
It's okay, Mother. He's a friend.
Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.
See what we see.
Yes, of course.
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?
Hara? Hara!
Oh!
What's going on here?
It's finally happened.
I found the little people.
Little people?
Yes! And what little robbers they are.
I wouldn't have believed it either unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.
It's remarkable!
It's the eighth wonder of the world.
And they're so teeny!
And they have a whole house full of things they've stolen.
Are you sure you didn't find the sherry again?
All these years you thought I was losing things.
But it wasn't me. It was them!
You didn't mention little people to the exterminators, did you?
No. I didn't want to scare them off.
Because I'm sure the house is just full of them.
You'll see when I show you.
This is their nest.
Nest?
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.
What?
It was here! It was here!
Where's that little teapot?
Okay, Hara,
I'm sending the exterminators away.
No! No, no! Wait just a minute.
Oh. Oh! I'll clean that up later.
Oh, please!
Hello, Shawn.
Can we come in for a minute?
It's open.
You'll see.
Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.
I don't know how they did it, but the whole thing is gone.
Not gone.
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait! I can prove it!
I've got one of them in a jar!
Poor Hara.
I think she's finally gone bonkers.
Do I smell fresh herbs?
Someone's been making tea.
It's just as my father told us.
There really are little people living here.
Yes, there are.
Your mother really should be here to see this.
She waited so long for some proof of them.
But they're not thieves like Hara said.
They're just Borrowers.
What?
I mean, they must be very frightened.
I just hope they're still here.
I hope so, too.
Excuse me. Ma'am!
Where would you like us to start looking?
Oh, are you all right?
Where did she go?
Who took my lady?
There are little people! There are!
Easy, 68$)'
And, no, I'm not losing my mind!
If I collapse, leave me behind.
With my tea kettle.
You're doing great. It's just a little further until we break for food.
Can't we just head back?
We can live with the rats in the compost heap.
Oh, no!
Let's hurry.
I can't do it.
Arrietty, you really should eat something.
We're gonna be walking at least until morning.
What?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like maybe it's all my fault that we had to leave such a wonderful house.
That's in the past.
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us, together.
I'm going outside for a bit.
Arrietty, don't go too far.
Niya.
Niya.
Just a little further.
Spiller!
That's the last of it.
Come on, we should keep moving.
Okay.
Mother, are you all right?
Arrietty!
Arrietty!
Shawn.
Arrietty.
We have to leave.
But Spiller says there's more of us not too far from here.
A two-day's journey, at most.
He thinks it might be my mother's family.
You won't be the last of your kind.
But how did you find me?
Niya here showed me the way.
Thank you, Niya. Take care of him.
I brought you something.
Now think of it as a gift from one friend to another.
Thank you, Shawn.
I have to go.
When is your operation?
Tomorrow. But I'm not scared.
Because someone taught me how to be brave.
So you'll remember me.
How can I forget you?
You protected me after all.
Arrietty.
I hope you have a happy life.
Goodbye, Shawn.
Arrietty, my heart is strong now because you're in it.
And you always will be.
Forever.
I never saw her again.
But the following summer I returned
and was happy to hear the people in the house down the road
talking about how many things in their home had gone
missing.
I'm 14 years old, I am pretty
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady
I live under the kitchen floor
Right here, not so far from you
Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams, oh, I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky and the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Now I know there's another world
Butterﬂies floating in the air
There is someone out there for me
Walking down, picket fence
Run my hands along the edge
And music plays in my head
Hear the song before I go to bed
When stars are bright outside my window
Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow
And I remember Oh, I remember
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I'd fly to you
All the way across the states
I'd fly to you
Hear me, the winter day
Oh, I'd follow the sun and come right to your door
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I will miss you in summer again when
I will miss you in summer again when
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[WOMAN CACKLING]
FRED:
Come on.
Split up.
SHAGGY: Hey, come on, Scoob.
SCOOBY: I'm right behind you, Shaggy.
[SHAGGY SCREAMS]
Change of plans.
WOMAN:
Stay out.
[GRUNTING]
Time to unmask the person behind this mystery.
- It's you?
- What?
Like, it can't be.
MAN: Remember, people, just because this is the last day of class...
...doesn't mean this test doesn't count.
Huh?
No.
Yes.
Cowabunga.
- Hot dog.
- Hot dog.
GIRL 1:
Let's dance.
Yeah.
[GIRL 2 WHISTLES]
Uh, guys, what are you doing?
I know you're excited the school year's over...
...but our seasonal employment awaits.
Already? Like, I didn't even have time to get a tan.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
[CHEERING]
Well, it sure is lucky that Daphne's uncle...
...is opening his new country club this summer, hey, V?
Indeed. Without these summer jobs, we'd never able to pay back...
...Old Man Frickert for the damage we did to his barn.
Say cheese.
[GIGGLES]
- What is he...?
- Oh, Scoob's got a new hobby.
Scrapbooking.
- What happened to gardening?
- It didn't work out.
Everything he planted, he'd just dig right up.
VELMA:
Hm.
Daphne said we should hit the road right after school.
Any sign of her or Fred?
Uh-uh.
[VELMA GASPS]
- Like, huh?
VELMA: Jinkies.
Ooh.
Perfect.
Well? I for one think we deserve an explanation.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
There's always been an undeniable chemistry between you two, but...
When did the transformative reaction finally occur?
I guess it started that night at Old Man Frickert's.
Yeah. Remember, Velma?
We followed the trail of the vengeful
scarecrow up into the hayloft.
This is impossible.
We'll never find anything in here.
Yes, if I wasn't so pun averse...
...I might even say it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
[MAN ROARS]
MAN:
Didn't scare you, did I?
[VELMA & DAPHNE SCREAMING]
Daphne.
Are you okay?
I am now.
SHAGGY: Like, run!
- What is it, Shaggy?
- This one's gonna be a real barn burner.
FRED: Shaggy.
Look out!
DAPHNE: And thus, we're stuck paying for a new barn.
Again, just for the record...
...nowhere on those bales of hay did it say flammable.
SCOOBY: Yeah.
- Anyway, that was also the night...
...that Fred and I realized we were just meant to be.
It's a lovely story.
But I do feel obligated to raise one concern.
Whenever there's a shift in a relationship...
...between two individuals within a group...
...it inevitably has repercussions on the group as a whole.
SHAGGY:
Oh, Velma, don't worry about that.
We're all way too mature to let that happen.
- Right, Scoob?
- I know I am.
Punch buggy white.
Ouch. Oh, good one, Scoob.
But it's a shame you didn't notice the punch buggy green.
Ow!
[SHAGGY & SCOOBY GRUNTING]
- All right.
- You know what? That is it. I've had it.
You know, I will turn this van around.
- Do I have to come back there?
DAPHNE: Scooby-Doo...
...get your tail out of my face.
DAPHNE: Fred, where are those directions I sent you to print out?
Don't worry, we're not lost.
DAPHNE: Hm. This sure doesn't look like my uncle's country club.
Oh. Hey, look. It's the S.S. Daphne.
DAPHNE:
Ha, ha.
Oh, look. Try stopping there, sweetie.
FRED:
Whatever you say, dear.
VELMA:
Oh, how quaint.
Hm.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Like, yikes. Maybe we ought to just find our own way...
...to your uncle's country club.
Zoinks!
Country club?
You're going to the country club?
Yes, we have summer jobs there.
No, you must turn back.
You must leave while you still can.
- Leave? Why would we wanna leave?
- They were fools to build there.
I tried to warn them...
...but they thought
I was just some crazy hag.
You? Heh. No.
But mark my words, the lake monster will return.
The lake monster will return.
[WHIMPERING]
- Did you get directions?
- Uh...
- Not exactly.
SHAGGY: Oh, yes, we did.
Make a U-turn and head straight back to Coolsville.
There's a monster at the lake, guys.
A monster.
- A monster?
- Mm-hm.
Would you be referring to the lake monster of Erie Pointe?
You know, I didn't catch his name.
- All I heard was "monster."
VELMA: No, look.
It says here for hundreds of years there have been sightings...
...of hideous creatures said to live at the bottom of the lake.
I get it, it's one of those things like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster.
Oh, no, it's worse than we thought.
No, Shaggy, I think what Fred means is that it's just a legend.
You know, lots of small towns make them up. They're good for tourism.
Oh. Oh, sure, you know, come for the scenery...
...stay for the certain death.
[THUD]
Come on, guys. Let's just get going or we're gonna be late.
Uh, Fred?
- We still don't know how to get there.
- Mm-hm.
Actually, yes, we do.
[SHAGGY SIGHS]
- No.
- Yes.
FRED:
Pretty swank, Daph.
DAPHNE: Yeah, looks like my uncle really outdid himself this time.
Thanks, Shaggy.
[LAUGHS]
- Is that my favorite niece?
- Uncle Thorny.
Wow.
Thank you again, uncle.
I don't know what we would've done without these summer jobs.
Yeah. And, again, just for the record...
...it's a well-known fact that scarecrows are afraid of fire...
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Gang, I'd like you to meet
Thorton Blake IV.
Fifth, actually.
Uncle Thorny, this is the gang.
This is Shaggy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Fred.
- Oh.
DAPHNE: Velma.
- Pleasure.
- And...
SCOOBY: Scooby-Doo.
Nice to meet you, Uncle Thorny.
Smile.
[SCOOBY GIGGLES]
Well, I'm sure glad to have you all on board this summer.
Grab your stuff, get settled, and park that thing in the back.
Oh. You're gonna need to get a good night's sleep.
Your shifts start at 6 a.m. sharp.
There's a 6 a. m?
[SIGHS]
And that one. It's my makeup.
[SHAGGY GRUNTING]
- Shaggy, need a hand?
- No, thanks, Fred. I got it.
It just takes a little elbow grease.
[GASPING]
Shaggy.
Shaggy, are you all right?
Like, I am now.
Shaggy.
Yes, Velma?
I don't know how much longer
I can hold you.
- Hey, Scoob?
- Huh?
- Can I talk to you man-to-man?
- Uh...
Sort of.
I think I might have just had a hayloft moment with Velma.
Do you think it's possible that...?
I don't know, that she and I are meant to be?
[LAUGHING]
Yeah. Thanks for the support, pal.
I'll remember this come flea season.
[PUFFING]
[CONTINUES LAUGHING]
[TREE BRANCHES RUSTLE]
Getting much better distance on those woods, sir.
Hey, Fred, can I talk to you man-to-man?
Sort of.
Well, you and Daphne, is that something you recommend?
What do you mean?
Well, you know, going from having...
...you know, a girl friend to a girlfriend.
Heh, heh. I don't know if I'd really call Daphne my girlfriend, Shags.
You know, it's more casual than that.
We're just, um...
- We're hanging out.
- Hanging out?
No, Fred is totally my boyfriend.
Really?
I always thought football players liked to, well...
...play the field.
- Pfft.
Me too. I never thought Fred would be the relationship type, but he totally is.
I'm just not the relationship type.
I'm a football player, we like to, uh, play the field.
Anyhow, it's summer, Shaggy.
Oh, yeah, summer. Totally.
Because who'd want a girlfriend during daylight-savings time?
Good guess, but what I'm saying...
...is summer's a time you just wanna have fun. Not get so serious.
Daphne's cool, she feels the same way.
It's totally getting serious.
Fred's cool, he feels the same way.
Well, it certainly sounds like you two are perfectly in sync.
Yeah.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[YAWNS]
SHAGGY:
Hey, Scoob.
- How was the first dog day of summer?
- Relaxing.
Glad to hear it, boy.
Now, come on, let's go get some...
Oh, hello, Velma.
- How was your day?
- Fine, I guess.
Oh, really? Like, mine was fine too.
It's crazy how much we have in common, huh?
Oh, boy.
So, guys, my uncle invited us to the opening night reception.
- What do you say?
- Awesome.
- How about a dip in the pool first?
DAPHNE: Sounds great.
Oh, like, that sounds like a real rager.
What do you think, V?
Perhaps I'll rendezvous with everyone later.
Since we arrived, I've been eager to survey the indigenous flora and fauna.
Oh, hey. Wait up.
So you say there's both flora and fauna out there, huh?
When was the last time you heard those two things in the same sentence?
[BELCHES]
Shaggy, did you know
Lake Erie is the warmest...
...and most biologically productive of the Great Lakes?
Not to mention the eleventh largest lake in the world.
[METAL DETECTOR BEEPING]
SHAGGY:
Oh, wow.
I could listen to you talk like that for hours.
Are you really interested in this stuff, Shaggy?
I've never known you to be, well, intellectually curious.
Oh, I'm curious about a lot of things, Velma.
Like...
Like people and relationships...
...and relationships between people.
Hey.
[GRUNTING]
Hey, Shaggy, you're gonna love this factoid.
Lake Erie has been gradually rising over the last few hundred years.
That means beneath all of these rock formations...
...there are miles of underwater caves.
- Get out of town.
- No, really.
You can tell by the variegated sedimentary striations.
Oh, would you look at that.
I've never seen irrigated rudimentary claymations like that before.
Hey, Velma, yesterday at the van...
Uh...
Jinkies.
Look at this, Shaggy.
I think it might actually be a moonstone.
They're very rare.
You know, the Native Americans believed...
...they held this mystical connection with the moon, thereby the name.
Look at how it glows.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It sure is.
Almost as beautiful as your eyes.
- Oh, Shaggy.
- Oh, Velma.
Oh, Shaggy, I think I'm gonna be sick.
- What? Oh, Velma, are you all right?
- I'm fine.
I just feel really nauseous all of a sudden.
SHAGGY:
Like, you better sit down.
- Here, let me help.
- No, it's okay.
I'm just gonna go back to the room and lie down for a little while.
Oh, okay.
I think she likes me.
Oy vay.
[PIANO PLAYING]
THORNY: Well, I'll catch you out there on the links, huh?
Oh.
Senator. I'm so glad you could make it.
Oh, how could I ever say no to my biggest contributor?
- How about a photograph?
- Yes.
- Good thing I dressed up, hey, Scoob?
SCOOBY: Yeah.
Hey, Shagg, Scoob. Where's Velma?
Oh. Uh, heh.
Uh, she got sick all of a sudden.
But it was totally natural causes...
...and not revulsion at the very thought of me.
Okay.
- Hey, Scoob, check out the buffet.
- Ooh.
Now, if you don't mind, one from my best side.
One more.
This will be good in my scrapbook.
Perfect.
Like, who ordered the pea soup?
THORNY:
Sorry, everyone.
I'm sure it's just a little minor glitch with one of our generators.
I'll just...
[GROWLING]
What the heck is that?
[GASPING]
- Fred?
- I don't know either, Daph.
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
[ROARING]
SCOOBY:
Lake monster.
Excuse me, I don't recall having seen your name on the guest list.
[SCREAMING]
[PHOTOGRAPHER SCREAMS]
That thing can't be real, can it?
I don't know, but I'm not getting close enough to find out.
Hi.
[ROARS]
THORNY:
No, please.
Please, everyone...
...I'm sure there's a logical explanation as to what's going on.
We'll just tidy up the tent...
...and, you know, we'll just continue the party.
Everyone... Oh, senator, senator.
MAN: Give me the keys, I'll get it myself.
WOMAN: Just go without him.
My goodness.
Why do I have the feeling
I missed something rather significant?
It was the lake monster.
The lake monster of Erie Pointe.
It was horrifying, terrifying, scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.
On a more personal note, how are you feeling, Velma?
- Did you just say the lake monster?
- Yeah.
You can't be serious.
Oh, my guests sure seemed to think it was serious.
Look at this, not even day one...
...and half of them have canceled their memberships.
If somebody doesn't figure out what's going on here quickly...
...it's gonna be a very short summer for all of us.
Guys, we have to do something.
We can't afford to lose these jobs.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
- You guys thinking what I'm thinking?
- No.
- Come on.
- Guys, please, don't...
[SIGHS]
Here we go again.
Uncle Thorny.
We just wanna let you know not to worry.
Not only did you hire summer help...
...you also hired the best supernatural detectives in the tristate area.
- I did?
- That's right.
And I know just where to start too.
With Elmer Uggins, the person who's taken...
...the only known photo of the lake monster.
FRED:
Heh. Would you look at that.
Our first suspect just happens to be the keeper of a creepy old lighthouse.
You know, just once...
...I wish we found a mystery that started in a cheery futon showroom.
What?
Futons offer far more support than traditional mattresses.
[FOGHORN BLOWS]
Well, looks like the light's on but nobody's home.
Isn't this the part when we normally split up and search for clues?
I'll go with Velma. Ha.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Okay. Come on, Daph.
[SHAGGY SNIFFING]
Oh, Velma, what is that sweet fragrance you're wearing?
Bug and tick repellent.
[MOSQUITO BUZZING]
Well, it certainly isn't repelling me.
[CLEARS THROAT]
It sure is a lovely night, huh?
I've always enjoyed strolling beneath a full moon.
Werewolves notwithstanding, of course.
I too enjoy walking by the light of the silvery moon.
[CHUCKLES]
Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Wait, where's the funny?
- Oh. "By the Light of the Silvery Moon"?
- Yeah.
It's just an old vaudevillian ditty.
But I must confess,
I do have a soft spot for it.
Like, wait, I think I do know that one.

Hey, Fred, you don't think Shaggy could have a crush on Velma, do you?
Not unless she turned into a steaming bowl of chili cheese fries.
[CHUCKLES]
- Why?
- I don't know, it's just...
...he's been acting really goofy lately.
Even for Shaggy.
And he's been following Velma around like a puppy dog.
Actually, that would explain why he's been asking me...
...all those questions about dating.
But I guess he didn't take my advice.
Advice? Wait, Fred, what advice?
[CREATURE GROWLING]
Um, Velma, that wasn't what I thought it was, was it?
I don't know.
Did you surmise that it was a heretofore unclassified amphibious humanoid?
No. I thought it was a lake monster!
Zoinks!
Fred?
Exactly what advice did you give Shaggy about dating?
What?
Oh, you know, just that it's summertime and we're not really...
[CREATURE ROARS]
Come on.
Go, go, go!
SHAGGY:
It's the lake monster! Save me.
MONSTER:
Ow! My ankle.
What?
UGGINS:
Hey.
Mr. Uggins, I presume?
Call me Elmer.
Hi, kids.
So you've never actually seen the monster?
I was just using the legend to make a quick buck.
Made some postcards...
...sold them to the local tourist traps.
- Mm?
- No.
- No.
- Thanks.
Hey, what can I say?
You know, lighthouse keeping ain't exactly a growth industry.
[CHUCKLING]
Ahem. Anyway...
...when I heard about all the hoopla down at the country club tonight...
...I figured it might be a good time to dust off old green-eyes over there...
...and take some new shots.
[IMITATING CAMERA SHUTTER
CLICKING]
But listen, kids...
...if this thing's really back, you best leave now while you still can.
Come on, you don't really believe the monster's real, do you?
It's probably some prankster with a better costume.
Maybe it is and maybe it ain't.
But one thing's for sure...
...the legend is a truly terrible tale.
It all goes back to the very beginnings of town.
When the first settlers arrived in these parts...
... they was confronted
by an old woman...
... who was said to live
in a cave by the lake.
Grubwort was her name.
Wanda Grubwort.
She claimed all the land around the lake
belonged to her...
...and told the settlers that if they didn't turn back...
...they would pay the price.
But them early pioneers was not about to be turned away so easily...
...so they settled in and forgot all about her warning.
But Wanda Grubwort did not forget.
And one day, she fulfilled her dark oath.
Using her magical staff...
... she cast a spell
upon an innocent creature of the lake...
...transforming it into a hideous beast.
Once Grubwort
had her monstrous slave...
... she loosed it upon the villagers.
And then? What happened next?
Well, it's said the settlers eventually overcame Grubwort...
...tried her for witchery and burned her at the stake.
Like I said...
...you best leave now while you still can.
I'm sorry, Mr. Uggins, but we just don't give up that easy.
He obviously wasn't in my sophomore geometry class.
[UGGINS GRUNTS]
SHAGGY:
Mr. Shaggy...
...Dinkley.
It's like the angels are singing it.
- Mister...
- Hey, Shagg. What you doing?
Oh! Um... Nothing.
Doctor says I need more linen in my diet.
Okay. So, have you seen Fred?
He's out on the...
Out on the green, putting with some girls.
Girls?
FRED:
Now, just remember to follow through.
GIRL 1:
Follow through.
Hey.
GIRL 1: Thanks.
FRED: Okay, guys, I'm out of here.
- Okay, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye.
GIRL 2: Bye, Fred.
FRED: Bye now.
Hey, Daph.
- What's up, Shags?
- Hey, Fred.
What?
Hey, um...
...can I ask your advice about something?
Sure.
Well, I...
See, I have this friend, okay?
His name's, um, Scruffy. Yeah, Scruffy.
They call him that...
...because he has a goatee.
No, that would be too obvious.
Anyway, so this friend of mine, who doesn't have a goatee or a dog...
...definitely doesn't have a dog either...
...he has this crush on this girl he sometimes solves mysteries with.
No, no. That's a dead giveaway.
- Let me start over. So...
- Shaggy.
It's okay. We know you like Velma.
[SCOFFS]
Oh. Oh, what?
Oh, I don't know what you guys are talking about.
I definitely do not like... Velma.
You are not gonna believe what I found in the security footage. Come on.
After you watch this,
I think you'll all be saying "jinkies."
Hey, the security camera caught the attack.
Yep. And they caught something else too.
Looks like we have two pranksters on our hands.
Jinkies.
- Told you.
- Freeze it.
If you zoom in right here, we can see who's inside that cloak.
SHAGGY:
Oh, look, it's coming into focus.
[SHAGGY SCREAMS]
What happened?
Like, that spooky figure must be using some sort of magic...
...to prevent us from seeing its face.
I'm afraid the explanation is slightly less supernatural than that, Shaggy.
I accidentally knocked over my green tea and short-circuited the hard drive.
- Oh.
- That's okay, Velma.
You know, I'm sure we'll find another piece of critical evidence.
- Right, guys?
- Yeah, for sure.
- It's groovy.
FRED: Don't worry.
I know this is highly uncharacteristic behavior.
I'm really sorry, guys.
I'll tender my resignation from the group if you wish.
- What?
- What?
DAPHNE: Velma.
- Come on.
Velma.
Like, hold on, V.
Don't beat yourself up about this.
You just pulled a Shaggy, that's all.
I do it all the time.
Thanks, Shaggy, but there's really no excuse.
Maybe reading a little Sylvia Plath will buoy my spirits.
Hey, I...
I still think you're wonderful.
Shaggy, that was so nice.
That's exactly how you should be if you're really serious about Velma.
Oh. Oh, what?
Oh, what do you mean?
I do not...
All right, I admit it.
I like Velma.
I'm my friend. I'm Scruffy.
But what am I gonna do?
You know, I don't know what I'm supposed to say to her.
Let me help you out, Shags.
You gotta be confident, smooth.
- Girls like guys...
- Don't listen to him.
He has no idea what girls like.
See, what girls like is to feel special.
To feel like they're the only one on a guy's mind.
Yeah, I know that.
But listen, what you wanna do...
Well, if you know that, then why don't you try it sometime?
What's with you?
Why are you acting weird?
- How exactly am I act...?
- Like, you know what?
Forget I even asked.
I'll just figure this out for myself.
Besides, if I ever get Velma to like me,
I want it to be real...
...not some loosey-goosey thing like you guys have.
Fred, did you say something to Shaggy...
...about us having a "loosey-goosey" relationship?
What? Oh, no, no.
I just told him how we're casual.
You know, how it's summer and we're just hanging out.
I mean, that is what we're doing, right?
Yes, Fred.
That is exactly what we're doing.
I'm just so glad that we're on the same page.
Well, she's not the president of the drama club for nothing.
I like you, Velma Dinkley.
So, what do you say?
- Will you go on a date with me?
- Sorry, not my type.
Like, come on, Scoob.
Forget Velma.
Time for a midnight snack.
SHAGGY: A what?
- A midnight snack.
You know, a couple of sandwiches, a rack of ribs, pepperoni?
- What?
- Oh, just follow me. Whew.
Just my luck.
I've got a talking dog and I can't understand a word he says.
SHAGGY:
Mm, mm, mm.
Sandwich, look out.
[SNIFFS THEN SIGHS]
Is that Eau de' Dinkley I detect?
Shaggy?
Shaggy? Hey, what about my midnight snack?
[GROWLS]
Huh.
DAPHNE:
Nice shot.
Mine.
[MAN GRUNTS
AND DAPHNE SHRIEKS]
Velma?
Where is she?
[TWIG CRACKS]
[SIGHS]
Oh, Velma, is that you?
[ROARS]
[SCREAMS]
Oh, hi, Fred.
Is something wrong?
SHAGGY:
Help!
- Help, help!
- Come on.
- Shaggy.
- Aah!
- What's wrong?
- Oh.
Oh, you know, nothing.
I just thought I'd work on my blood-curdling scream.
What the heck do you think is wrong?
It's the lake monster.
Whoa!
That's it, time to unmask this prankster once and for all.
[GRUNTING]
Come on, help me with this mask.
Fred, I don't think this thing is a mask.
Ew! Gross.
FRED:
Keep moving.
This thing keeps getting the jump on us.
It can't jump in two directions.
Come on, split up.
Like, why did he have to pick me?
In gym class,
I'm always the last one picked.
Huh. Heh.
Oh, zoinks.
[ROARING]
SCOOBY:
I'll save you, Shaggy.
SHAGGY:
Like, thanks, buddy.
I thought that giant mutant frog was gonna make me croak.
[SHAGGY GIGGLES]
Oh, boy, I wish I could enjoy that one.
Oh, heh. Oh. You did it, boy.
Oh, what a friend.
What a pal.
What a sand trap.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
Oh, boy, Scoob.
I owe you one, buddy.
If it wasn't for you, I would...
Hey, would you look at that?
- It's one of those moonstones.
- Yeah.
Velma loves these things almost as much I love deep-fried...
Well, anything. Huh.
Groovy.
Huh? Hmph.
Velma, Velma, Velma. Pfft.
Hey, come on,
I think the coast is clear.
This doesn't make sense.
There's no such thing as a lake monster.
Tell that to the thing that just threw up an aquarium.
So now do you wanna tell me who those guys were?
Not now, Fred.
[MONSTER GROWLING]
Oh, that was worse than my date with Herbie Zimmer.
Totally, I... Wait, you went on a date with Herbie Zi...?
[MONSTER SCREAMING]
WOMAN:
Creature.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be searching.
With all the bedlam you've raised tonight...
...we'll have to stop early.
Return to the lake.
I'll summon you when it's safe to resume our search.
[DAPHNE SIGHS]
- That was close.
- Yeah.
Hey. Not bad.
[SIGHS]
Uncle Thorny.
That thing came back.
Oh, you think?
Canceled memberships and now all this damage.
I hate to say it, I may have no choice but to shut this place down...
...and go back to my life as an international playboy.
SHAGGY:
Hey, guys.
Shaggy, you're okay.
Well, yeah, I am, but has anyone seen Velma?
Before the monster attacked, she was out here, I know it.
Oh, no.
Oh, you don't think the lake monster got to her, do you?
I've seen monster movies,
I know how this works.
[ROARS THEN SCREAMS]
Shaggy, Shaggy. Calm down, okay?
- We're gonna find her.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
SHAGGY: Okay.
FRED:
Velma!
DAPHNE:
Velma!
Velma?
Where are you?
- Velma!
- Velma!
Hey, guys, I found her.
- Oh, no. She's dead.
- Oh!
Oh, she looks so peaceful.
Oh, I can't look.
[GROANS]
Uh... Guys?
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's a miracle.
FRED: What happened to you last night, Velma?
I don't know.
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk by the lake.
But then that fog rolled in and...
Well, I must have gotten lost.
I sat down to wait until it lifted...
...and I must have fallen asleep.
Don't you ever do that to us again, you hear?
You had us all worried so...
What are those?
- They kind of look like warts.
- Warts?
Egads.
Oh, no.
I'm sure it's just some kind of urushiol-induced dermatitis.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Anyway, what's going on?
You missed another attack.
Come on, we'll get you cleaned up...
...and we'll fill you in.
VELMA: Another attack?
Anybody else hungry? I know I am.
Shocking.
Mm.
Ooh.
So you think the monster's real and someone's using it...
...to dig up something on the grounds?
Yeah. Problem is, we don't have a single clue about who's using it.
Yes, we do. The mysterious figure had a streak of purple paint on its cloak.
- So?
- So remember the boat that we passed...
...on the way up here?
Shaggy called it the S.S. Daphne.
It was being painted the exact same color.
I'd be willing to bet that whoever's behind this has been on that boat.
All right, gang, we know what we have to do.
After our shifts tonight, we'll head to the docks and we'll check it out.
No.
No.
I'm not going until I do what I've been trying to do...
...since we first got here.
Um, Velma, I learned something today.
Life is like a chocolate soufflé.
And if you wait too long to dig in, it could just collapse on you.
So anyway, what I'm trying to say is...
...Velma Dinkley, will you go on a date with me?
- Heh. A date?
- Yeah.
Shaggy.
Are you serious?
I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life.
Except maybe dinosaurs, but that was a long time ago.
Shaggy, that's very sweet of you...
...but we're right in the middle of an investigation.
Well, like,
I think Fred and Daphne can handle it.
They probably wanna spend some quality time together anyway, right?
- No, not really.
- I'm good.
I don't know, Shaggy.
SHAGGY:
Oh.
Like... Like, yeah, that's...
I mean, that's fine.
I...
If I were you, I probably wouldn't wanna go on a date...
...with a goofy guy like me either so...
Hold on.
Shaggy, you know what?
I will go on a date with you tonight.
Oh, really?
- You mean it?
- Sure.
Why not?
Yes.
Pick you up around 7.
[GRUNTS]
Seven o'clock.
Slippery.
[PIANO CRASHES]
- Ouch.
SHAGGY: I'm okay.
Oh, curse this mop top.
I can't do anything with it.
Okay, Scoob, how do I look?
Ah. Handsome as a devil.
What about me?
Oh. Um...
Like, as dapper as a Dalmatian...
...but where are you headed, buddy?
- With you. Where else?
Oh, um, heh. Um...
You know, buddy...
...I'm gonna have to fly solo on this one tonight.
- Solo?
- Yeah, you know, like...
...you're just gonna have to do your own thing, you know what I mean?
My own thing? But, Shaggy...
Thanks for understanding, Scoob.
[SIGHS]
I'll see you later, pal.
Goodbye, Shaggy.
[CRYING]
[SHAGGY WHIMPERING]
Who's the best puppy in the whole wide world?
[CONTINUES WHIMPERING]
No. No more rolling over.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Good. So...
...who were they?
Who were who?
Oh, ho.
Are you still wondering about those boys
I was playing tennis with?
They were nobody, Fred.
Just some caddies I met.
Why?
You're not jealous, are you?
Jealous? No, no.
I'm not jealous. No way.
I don't get jealous.
Yeah, right.
[SNIFFING]
- Good evening, Norville.
- Heh.
[CHUCKLES]
Shaggy.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
I like corn dogs.
- Thanks, Shaggy.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh. Ahem.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Well, it looks like we got the whole place to ourselves.
Yes, unfortunately, that only emphasizes the urgency of our investigation.
- Sure we shouldn't check with Fred...?
- Oh, come on, V.
Like, just try to put those frontal lobes on the back burner tonight, okay?
Okay, Shaggy.
I must admit, I do have a hard time letting myself relax.
Especially recently.
Ever since we've been here,
I just haven't felt like myself.
Well, whoever you are, I like it.
Thanks, Shaggy.
Oh. Um...
Now, come on,
I want this night to be perfect.
[SCREAMS]
Velma.
VELMA:
My glasses.
Here, let me help you up.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, I...
I don't know what came over me.
Oh, here. Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Here, let me get you some water.
Garçon, water, please.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[LAUGHING]
[HUMMING]
[SCOOBY BELCHES]
[SCOOBY SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
Oh, whoops.
I seem to have dropped my fork.
Here, help me find it, waiter.
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing?
Waiting tables. Fresh ground pepper?
Scooby, get out of here, buddy.
You're gonna ruin everything.
No.
Okay, but would you do it for a Scooby snack?
I can't be bought. Hmph.
Now, you listen, Scoob...
...I'm the master and I command you to go back to your room...
...and quit being such a bad dog.
Puppy loving...
[SCOOBY MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Bad dog? Huh.
I'll show you a bad dog.
[LAUGHS THEN GROWLS]
No, Shaggy, don't.
The waiter will bring...
[SCREAMS]
Would you care to hear our specials?
Scooby-Doo? Is that you?
I didn't invite him.
He just showed up and tried to sabotage everything and...
- And...
- Is that what I think it is?
Oh, uh, heh.
Yeah, that was supposed to be a surprise.
I found it in a sand trap last night.
It's one of those moonstones, right?
Yes.
I was gonna give it to you when I walked you back to your room tonight, but...
It's beautiful.
Excuse me, I have to go now.
Wait, what? Well, Velma...
This is all your fault, Scooby-Doo.
You ruined everything.
No, I didn't.
[SCOOBY GROWLS]
DAPHNE:
There it is, the purple boat.
FRED:
She. There she is.
A boat is a she, like a girl.
But not one who goes around playing tennis...
...with every boy boat in the harbor.
That cloaked figure was definitely here.
All hands on deck.
Fred, look.
- Ladies first.
- Mm-mm.
Fine.
Looks like a bunch of old newspapers.
DAPHNE:
I'll say.
FRED:
Huh.
Hey, these are about that witch from Uggins' story, Wanda Grubwort.
DAPHNE: Evil staff?
- Yeah, remember? Didn't Elmer say...
...an ancient staff was the source of her black magic?
DAPHNE:
Hey, look at this one.
That must be what the monster's doing, looking for the source of her powers.
The problem is we still don't know who's controlling it.
Wait a second, maybe we do.
Wanda Grubwort had children. She could still have descendants living in town.
Maybe one got angry...
...when your uncle built on their land and decided to get revenge.
What was that?
It's locked. Hello!
Help. Help.
DAPHNE:
Anyone out there? Let us out.
Help. Help.
Is anyone out there? Oh, great.
If we don't get this open, we'll be stuck here all night.
[RUMBLING]
That might be the least of our worries.
- Hello!
- Is anyone out there?
Help!
- Help, help!
DAPHNE: We need to get out.
FRED: Help, anybody.
DAPHNE: Anyone!
FRED: Help, anybody!
- Help, get us out!
FRED:
Help, help, anybody!
- Help, help.
- We're stuck, it's filling.
Fred, you need to do something.
We're gonna drown.
I have an idea. Why don't we call those guys you were playing tennis with?
- I knew it, you are jealous.
- Yeah, maybe I am.
- Good, that was the point.
- You were just lying to make me jealous?
Yes, I'm trying to pay you back for playing golf with those floozies.
Flooz...? Oh, that was different.
How? How was that any different?
I don't know, they were... It just was.
All right, you know what, Fred?
If I'm gonna die,
I don't want to die dating a jerk.
Yeah, well, if I'm gonna die,
I don't want to die dating a sneaky...
...manipulative, game-playing...
You see that? I saved us.
That's lovely, but we're still broken up.
What?
Good.
[MUTTERING]
Like, what happened to you guys?
What happened?
We broke up, that's what happened.
Yeah, best decision I ever made too.
Did you just say best decision you ever made?
That's funny, because I broke up with you.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
What? You did not.
- Guys?
DAPHNE: I did so.
Guys.
That's a real bummer and all, but I kind of meant, why are you wet?
Oh, that.
Well, let's just say we almost got in over our heads.
But we figured out that Wanda Grubwort's descendant...
...might be trying to reconstruct her magical staff.
Hey, how'd it go with Velma?
Yeah. Ask my waiter.
DAPHNE:
Grubek, Grubel, Guzzak.
No Grubwort.
Huh. Would you look at that.
What a crazy coincidence.
What's that, Shags?
Oh. Remember that creepy general store we stopped at on the way in?
It was called Trowburgs.
Well, if you spell Trowburg backwards you get Grubwort.
What are the odds, huh?
Excuse me, you are on my side of the room.
[SHAGGY & SCOOBY GULP]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
There. Shaggy, Scooby, go around back.
- I'm not going with him.
- I'm not going with him.
- You think I want to go with you?
SHAGGY: Seriously...
SCOOBY: I'm not going with Shaggy.
FRED: Enough.
- Guys, let's just go.
- Go.
- Surprise.
WOMAN: Oh, no.
[WOMAN CACKLING]
Come on.
Hey, wait for me.
In here.
SCOOBY:
This way.
The other way.
[SHAGGY SCREAMING]
No.
FRED: Come on.
SHAGGY: No, please.
Please.
- Now can we split up?
- Ugh.
SHAGGY: Hey, come on, Scoob.
- I'm right behind you, Shaggy.
[SHAGGY SCREAMS]
Change of plans.
WOMAN:
And stay out.
Time to unmask the person behind this mystery.
- It's you?
- What?
Like, it can't be.
Velma?
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
Oh, you fools. I'm not Velma.
[DAPHNE SCREAMS]
Daphne.
I don't want to hurt you, Velma.
Oh, but I do want to hurt you, pretty boy.
Sorry, Velma.
[GRUNTING]
Velma. What's going on?
Why are you doing this?
Our date wasn't that bad, was it?
Why? To make them pay, to make them all pay.
Now, that I've rebuilt my staff, no one can stop me.
[COUGHING]
Well, there's another mystery solved, huh, gang?
I got it.
Okay.
What in the world is going on?
Why is Velma doing this?
Oh, no.
You don't think my passions drove her mad, do you?
I'm sure there's something bigger than that going on.
I'll say.
Your friend has been possessed by the spirit of the witch Wanda Grubwort.
Oh, great, my first love and she's turned into an evil witch.
Join the club.
Yeah. Hee, hee, hee.
It was that staff.
[IMITATES EXPLOSION]
She must have found the pieces...
...that have been buried all these many years.
Like, by any chance...
...did moonstones play any part in this?
As soon as your friend touched one of those rocks...
...the spirit of my evil ancestor took hold of her...
...and compelled her to find the rest.
SCOOBY: For you, old lady.
- Oh.
So it's been Velma the entire time?
Like, zoinks.
It's been right under our noses.
The evil spirit must have first taken
hold of her...
... when we found that stone
by the lake.
And those creepy warts, it was like she was actually turning into a witch.
Being burned at the stake...
... would make me pretty freaked out
at the sight of fire too.
And I bet she intentionally shorted out the security console...
... because she knew
we'd see her face.
I can't believe we missed it.
I guess we were all too wrapped up in our own little dramas...
...to catch the really big one going on.
[SIGHS]
So now that she has her powers back, what's Wanda Grubwort going to do?
I fear that what she seeks is the revenge...
...that has eluded her all these years.
Who cares about what she wants.
We gotta save Velma. Do you have any idea where she would have gone?
Oh, probably to the caves where she lived.
The caves?
But what about the irrigated rudimentary claymations?
The what?
The entrances to the caves, they're all underwater.
How would we get in?
You're in luck. I rent scuba gear.
I'll give you a good deal too.
Smile.
Zoinks.
FRED:
Lights.
Uh-oh.
VELMA [IN DISTORTED VOICE]:
Ah.
You've been a faithful servant.
And now I think you deserve some playmates.
[BELLOWS]
She's making more of those things.
VELMA:
Rise, my slithering slaves.
Rise and serve your new master.
[GROWLING]
[GASPS]
Finally, we'll make them pay.
Make them rue the day they set foot on our land.
Those things are gonna attack everyone in town.
- We have to do something.
- What can we do?
Hey, Fred, I know this is usually your department, but do you mind...?
- If you've got a plan, Shaggy, go for it.
- Okay.
Velma Dacey Dinkley, you stop that this instant.
I told you,
Velma doesn't live here anymore.
That was your big idea, Shags?
Creatures, change of plans.
Get them.
SCOOBY:
Hold still.
Thank you. Aah!
Velma.
Velma, I know you're still in there.
I know you can hear me.
Okay, like, maybe you can't.
DAPHNE:
This is like biology class...
...except this time the frogs are gonna dissect us.
Like, come on, V.
You gotta listen to me.
You're stronger than this thing inside of you.
You're stronger and you're smarter and you're cuter.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] I am?
- That's right, V.
I think everything about you is cute.
Like the way...
...your pleated skirt ruffles when you run from ghosts.
How... And even...
Even how you lose your glasses at the most inopportune moments.
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, that might be the cutest thing of all.
Shaggy?
- Help me.
- Yeah.
Yeah, listen, V.
You gotta fight this old witch.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Shaggy, I'll try. I'll try.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
No, you won't.
[SHAGGY SCREAMING]
Well, at least now I can finally say
I've been picked up by a girl.
See you, froggies.
FRED:
Run, run.
That ought to hold them for a while.
Come on.
Knock me down all you want,
Wanda Grubwort...
...but I'm not gonna let a couple of stupid moonstones take my friend away.
Oh, wait, moon. Oh, that's it.
[SINGING]
By the light of the silvery moon
What is it? What are you...?
By the light
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Not the dark but the light
Of the silvery moon
Not the sun, but the moon
I want to spoon
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
No, you're mine.
- To my honey I'll croon love's tune
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Croon love's tune
- Oh, by the light of the silvery
- Light of the silvery
VELMA: Moon
WANDA: Oh!
[GROANING]
It's a dead end.
I'm sorry, Daph.
I really was a jerk.
I'm sorry too, Fred.
I never should've tried to make you jealous.
[MONSTERS ROARING]
Get out of me, Wanda Grubwort.
[WANDA SCREAMING]
Nothing can stop me now. Come.
SCOOBY:
Not so fast.
What? No.
Say goodbye, wicked witch.
No, no. Revenge was in my grasp.
And I would have gotten away with it...
...if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your rotten dog.
[GIGGLES]
Oh, no. No.
[SCREAMS]
[MONSTERS SLITHERING]
[FROGS CROAKING]
Shaggy did it. Come on.
VELMA:
Shaggy?
Is it over?
I think so, V.
Those things you said to me.
Did you really mean all of that?
Of course I did.
I've been trying to say it ever since we got here.
Just kiss her already.
Oh, well, I...
Shaggy, just kiss me already.
SHAGGY:
Well, um...
That was, uh...
Yeah.
You know,
I don't know too much about chemistry.
I do, Shaggy.
And, well, there just wasn't any.
Yeah, I...
You know, maybe we're just better off being friends.
You know what? Maybe we all are.
Yeah.
Phew.
THORNY: Well, kids, with the creature gone, we have a ton of new applications.
Maybe more than we can handle.
- And it's all thanks to you guys.
- Aw.
Oh, that reminds me.
FRED: What?
- Something to show my appreciation.
- Ten thousand dollars?
- Uncle Thorny.
- Oh.
- Aw.
By the way, I took the liberty to set up an appointment with my attorney...
...for you to discuss incorporating.
Thought that might help with your future liability issues.
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.
- Shall we go play around?
SHAGGY: This is gonna be amazing, guys.
- So insane.
- Hey, you guys, I've got it.
We can be Mystery Incorporated.
- I love it.
- I can totally dig that.
Hey, Scooby, get a picture.
[LAUGHS]
FRED:
Everybody say, "Mystery Inc."
ALL:
Mystery Inc.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Guys, group hug.
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.
VELMA: Okay, Shaggy.
DAPHNE: Shaggy.
VELMA: Shaggy.
FRED: Okay...
All right. We'll celebrate.
All right. Bye, guys.
Not the hair, man. Not the hair.
[SIGHS]
[WHIMPERING]
[GRUNTING]
Don't worry, Scoob.
No matter what happens,
I'll always be here for you.
Oh, Shaggy.
[SINGING]
When danger used to come around
I would fall right to the ground
It's true
But now that I can see your face
Well, I can stand up to anything
And how I cherish the times
When the sun shines on the two of us
But I don't mind going through
The bad times
Just as long as they're with you
Well, I can be scared with you
I can be alone with you
As long as I have your hand
To hold onto
I can be scared with you
[CHORUS HUMMING]
I can be scared with you
Oh, I can be scared
As long as I'm with you
I can do anything
I can do anything
As long as I'm with you
[DISCO MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING]
I can be scared with you
I can be alone with you
I can be scared with you
As long as I'm with you
My name is Shaggy
I like to eat
Main man Scooby
But he got four feet
Me and my homeys solve mysteries
Through cartoons, movies
And tons of DVDs
As old school goes, we're genuine
We've been kicking it since 1969
But Mystery Inc. is far from through
Because there's always more adventures
Starring me Scooby-Doo
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
[ENGLISH - US - SDH]
It is said that blood is thicker than water.
It is what defines us.
Binds us. Curses us.
Come, my love. Let's go.
Come, Barnabas.
For some, blood means a life of wealth and privilege.
For others, a life of servitude.
Angelique, how many times do I have to tell you not to stare at him?
Remember your place.
When I was but a boy... my father took us to the New World to expand the Collins family empire.
We brought English industry to the wilds of Maine... and built a fishing business... the likes of which America had never seen.
A man should take pride in what he builds.
But remember, Barnabas, family is the only real wealth.
As our business grew, the town of Collinsport grew with it... and we decided to put down permanent roots.
We spent the next 15 years building our beloved home:
Collinwood.
But not everyone shared in our family's success.
Let me hear you say
"I love you, Angelique. I want you."
Angelique...
I am sorry, my dear... but you would be hearing a lie.
Make the high and mighty low
Arrogant creatures, down you go
Convinced my parents' death was no accident...
I became obsessed with dark magic and ancient curses.
"Lo! Above the gates of hell..." he found a single letter.
A letter proclaiming Satan's true name.
"Mephistopheles."
But even then, in the depths of my grief, not all was darkness.
For I had found my one true love.
Promise we'll be together forever.
God as my witness, Josette...
I swear it.
Of all the servants I could have spurned... all the hearts I could have broken...
I got the one with the secret.
I got the witch.
If he doth another choose
To lend his heart an eye
Then magic shall the slighted use
So all he loves will
Die
Caught in Angelique's spell... my beloved Josette wandered helplessly towards Widow's Hill... where many a despondent soul had leapt to their death.
Josette!
Josette.
Help me.
Josette!
What have you done?!
Angelique had cursed me to be a vampire... so that my suffering would never end.
There's the monster.
Resolved that I would never belong to her...
Angelique turned the townspeople against me... and condemned me to suffer my anguish alone in the dark...
Let me out!
For all time.
Let me out, I say!
Release me!
Hello. My name is Maggie Ev...
Hello. My name is Victoria Winters.
Please, call me Vicky.
So where are you from, Veronica?
New York. And it's Victoria.
"And it's Victoria." I love this chick, man.
New York's a trip?
I guess.
What about you?
What brings a New York girl out to the sticks?
An old friend.
- Be cool.
- Have a nice day.
- Catch you later.
- Take it easy, Veronica.
Hello. I'm Victoria Winters.
Congratulations.
I'm here to see Ms. Stoddard about the governess position.
Oh, yeah. Been expecting you.
Come on.
Sorry I didn't grab you down at the station.
Damn wagon's been acting up.
Miss Elizabeth won't spend the money to get her fixed.
It's beautiful.
A bitch to dust is what it is.
This place was designed for a staff of a hundred.
Now they got a staff of me.
Me and Mrs. Johnson.
She's about as useful as a bucket without a bottom.
Still, not every family has a house like this.
Or a whole town named after them.
Come again?
Collins. "Collinsport."
Never got that.
Who's that?
Barnaby, maybe.
Something with a "Barn" in it.
One of the real important ones from way back.
Back when they were rich, rich people.
Barnabas.
His name was Barnabas Collins.
And he was the finest man this family ever knew.
Welcome to Collinwood.
You'll have to imagine us on a better day.
The house has some 200 rooms... most closed off to save on heating.
We don't even go in the old wing any more.
Sit.
There are only seven of us, after all.
My daughter, Carolyn, and I.
My brother, Roger, and his son, David.
Willie, who you've met.
Mrs. Johnson and Dr. Hoffman... who I suspect is sleeping off one of her legendary hangovers.
And where is David's mother, if you don't mind my asking?
Laura was lost at sea... when David was 5.
He's had a rather difficult time accepting her passing.
I brought Dr. Hoffman here to work with him for a month.
That was three years ago.
There are just a few questions, if you don't mind... that were not on the application.
Of course.
How do you feel about the president?
Never met him.
The war?
I don't watch television.
Do you think the sexes should be equal?
Heavens, no.
Men would become unmanageable.
I think we'll get along just fine,
Ms. Winters.
Vicky. Please, call me Vicky.
Carolyn.
Carolyn, this is Ms. Winters.
Sick of hanging around your pad
You're from New York?
I am.
What's Manhattan like?
I'm going to live there when I'm 16.
Carolyn has a fantasy that I'm going to allow this.
And Mother has a fantasy
I won't run away if she doesn't.
So you're here to babysit the loony.
What have I told you about using that word?
I'm here to teach David.
Good luck.
None of the others have made it past a week.
Ms. Winters.
Please, call me Vicky.
Chop-chop, Willie, I'm starving.
And God help me if it's another bone-dry pot roast...
Who's this?
Ms. Winters, this is my brother, Roger.
Roger, Ms. Winters is to be David's new governess.
Please, call me Vicky.
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you.
That it's strange
You're a liar.
I can tell, you know.
Just from a person's face.
Yours says:
"I might look sweet and innocent, but I have secrets.
Secrets that'll make the hairs on your arms stand straight up."
Leave her be, Julia.
You're the doctor.
Yeah. And you're "the nanny," and she's "the bitch."
How do you ever expect us girls to advance... if we keep reducing each other to labels?
So, Vicky, where'd you c...?
Carolyn!
Will you please turn that noise down?
David, this is Vicky.
She's going to be your new governess.
You ruined it!
I was gonna scare her.
Damn it. What have I told you about cutting holes in the sheets?
Those are Egyptian cotton.
I was gonna scare you.
Were you scared?
Terrified beyond belief.
You don't have to be nice to him just because he's nuts, you know.
Carolyn...
Carolyn touches herself.
She makes noises like a kitten.
- David.
- You little shit.
Carolyn. Enough, both of you.
If I may, what is the family business?
Seafood, Ms. Winters.
We had a large cannery in town.
We still own a few fishing boats.
Rusty old boats that no one will hire.
And David's mother's at the bottom with one of them.
Carolyn, go to your room.
Everybody in this house tiptoes around him, but no one cares how I feel!
She didn't die.
- She can't.
- Enough, David.
Yes, David believes his mother has some kind of... cyclical immortality.
Fascinating, really.
I feel her.
She talks to me.
All the time.
Well...
I think ghosts are just people... who've moved into a slightly different dimension than ours.
And I think some people just have antennas strong enough to pick them up.
There's actually scientific evidence to support...
Thank you, Ms. Winters.
David, you startled me.
Getting ready for Halloween?
He's coming.
We hit something.
Let's dig it out.
Get down here.
What the hell is this?
Think it's a gas main?
Not supposed to be any out here.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Grab me some bolt cutters.
Jesus!
Run!
I am terribly sorry.
You cannot imagine how thirsty I am.
Mephistopheles.
Show yourself, Satan!
Mock me not with your strange luminance!
Curious terrain.
What is this?
Some specter approaches.
It is the eyes of the devil himself, come to drag me to my judgment.
Have at me, Lucifer.
My soul is prepared!
Asshole!
My beloved Collinwood.
What have they done to you?
I'll keep on drinking and trust my...
Hi, pumpkin.
Fear me not, drunkard.
You shall not be harmed... so long as you tell me all that I need to know.
Well, here's all you need to know.
See me, derelict.
Look into my eyes... and deliver me your innermost thoughts.
Awaken.
Well done.
Now, tell me, the Collins family... do they endure?
A-yuh. There's four of them.
Thank heaven.
Pray, what month is it?
October. That's why there's pumpkins.
- What is the year?
Wait. '71.
A-yuh, 1972.
Hear me, future-dweller.
You shall be my loyal servant... until such time as I release you.
So, what first, master?
You will cleanse me, miscreant.
And then you will take me to these living Collinses you speak of.
Okay.
Have you ever seen such majesty?
Every day.
The perfect marriage of European elegance... and American enterprise.
Nine of the finest craftsmen the world will ever know... lost digit, limb and life... in the process of carving these glorious pillars.
And they all considered it worth the sacrifice, I assure you.
The opulence and complexity of this magnificent chandelier... should only be found in the palaces of nobility.
The fireplace... sculpted entirely of the most exquisite Carrara marble... from Firenze, Italia... each joint containing a single pearl.
Are you stoned or something?
They tried stoning me, my dear.
It did not work.
When did they start allowing women of the night on estate grounds?
Carolyn.
- Look.
- Yes.
Uncanny, is it not?
Worth every hour I spent posing.
Forgive me.
My name is Barnabas Collins.
I'm David Collins.
- Are we...?
- Related?
Distantly, you might say.
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Master David.
Children!
Get away from that man.
He says his name is Barnabas Collins.
And I'm pretty sure he called me a hooker.
That'll do, Carolyn.
A word, please.
If this is some kind of a joke, consider it played.
If it's money you're after,
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.
But whoever you are, you're not to look at those children again. Am I clear?
Your devotion to family... is admirable, madam.
And your suspicion... understandable.
A stranger arrives... claiming to be a distant relation.
The question of motive is to be expected.
As a Collins... surely you are aware of the darkness that has long plagued our family.
You mean our curse.
Witches, ghosts and vampires.
Myths.
And like so many before you...
I suppose you're here to rid us of them.
For a price, of course.
- I can prove that I am different.
- Oh?
Firstly, I do not come seeking money.
Rather, to provide it.
Secondly...
I know the body of this mansion as well as I know my own.
Every nook... every corner... every secret!
That's where I keep my macramé.
A disgraceful misuse.
Impressive.
But there are plenty of old houses with hidden doors.
I hope you have a "thirdly."
Indeed.
Tell me... what do you know... of Barnabas Collins?
Just legends, really.
He was confident and strong.
Admired by all.
But he believed our family was cursed... and when his parents were killed, he went mad.
Went around insisting that a witch had turned him into a vampire.
And what is known of his death?
Nothing.
Not that I can think of.
That, madam... is because he never died.
I am Barnabas Collins.
That means you're...
A vampire, madam. Yes.
And most regrettably so.
But more importantly, I am a Collins.
And I give you my word of honor:
Neither you nor any under this roof need fear my cursed nature.
My father had quite a flair for secret passages and rooms.
As a boy, I took it upon myself to discover each one.
But this one...
This one was always my favorite.
"Family is the only real wealth," he would often remark.
Though clearly... he was not opposed to other kinds.
Oh, my God.
We've been sitting on top of a fortune all these years.
Know this:
I mean to stay.
I mean to be a part of this family again.
On one condition.
Yes.
Promise me that this... all of this, will remain our secret.
So be it.
Partners.
Welcome home, Barnabas Collins.
I was awakened... by a yellow dragon with iron teeth.
Confronted by a giant letter M with the luminance of a thousand lanterns.
He's not staying with us forever, is he?
I like him.
Yes, well, I'm sure things are very different in England.
So, Barnabas, what sort of business are you in back home?
The Collins family has always been in the fishing business.
But after two centuries of consideration...
I have decided to devote the entirety of my energies... to family.
He means it seemed like two centuries.
Morning.
Who the hell is this?
Dr. Hoffman, this is our distant relative,
Barnabas Collins.
The Third.
Barnabas Collins lll is going to stay with us from England.
Barnabas? Dr. Julia Hoffman.
My God... a woman doctor.
What an age this is.
Is he for real?
I think he's just tired from his long trip.
I see that you have grown desperate enough... to sell off the prized family silverware.
How could you tell?
These are exact replicas.
Had this fork been real silver... my hand would have burst into flames upon its slightest touch.
Yes, you mentioned you have a terrible metal allergy.
Anyway, the fishing business is all but gone.
The manor is nearly in ruins.
Well, I have returned.
And in short order, so shall our fortunes.
Good luck.
Angie has deals with most of the boats in Maine.
- "Angie"?
- Angelbay.
They've taken just about every port on the East Coast.
Then that is where my work begins.
And with your blessing...
I shall restore the family business to its former glory.
Josette.
That's Vicky.
She believes in ghosts, like me.
Hi.
Enchanted.
Surely you do not let them call you "Vicky."
A name like Victoria is so beautiful...
I could not bear to part with a single syllable of it.
Yeah, well... money might grow on trees where you're from... but it's a little harder to come by here.
Do not concern yourself with my methods.
I should like to see the factory immediately.
How soon can the horses be ready?
We don't have horses.
We have a Chevy.
Hey, Angie, have a great day!
- Morning, Angie!
- Hi, Angie!
Morning!
One of the seamers blew a clutch.
It'll be two hours before it's back online.
Make it an hour.
And start cracking the whip out here.
Everybody looks like they're moving at half speed today.
Tell you the truth, I think they're a little spooked about what happened last night.
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you hear?
They found 11 workers dead in the woods off Route 9 this morning.
Well, accidents happen.
It wasn't an accident.
Some maniac ripped their throats out.
Where off Route 9?
Yeah, Helen, it's me. Yeah, you heard me right.
It's carnage here.
All right! I heard you the first 20 times.
Keep your damn panties...
- ...on.
- I'll do my best.
A word with Barnabas Collins, please.
Oh, he's... Who?
Oh, I think you know who.
Black hair, handsome features.
Strange clothes covered in fresh blood.
My, we've let this place go to hell, haven't we?
Right where it belongs.
You must be Carolyn.
You're like a hungry tiger
We're growing into quite the fetching creature.
Angelique.
Elizabeth.
You're looking well.
And to what do we owe the pleasure?
I'm here on behalf of the town council to welcome our new visitor to Collinsport.
He's asleep, I'm afraid.
During the day? How odd.
What was that infernal banging?
Barnabas, we have a guest.
My apologies, madam.
I have just arisen.
You must think me a fright. Miss...?
Hello, Barnabas.
My name is Angie Bouchard.
So it is.
Do you know what I would very much like to do with you?
I can only imagine.
I would very much like to have a word in the drawing room.
With your permission, Elizabeth.
Would you excuse us?
How dare you defile my manor with your noxious...?
It's really you.
How dare you place your wicked lips upon me?
I remember this place being less depressing.
I also remember the two of us having a lot of fun.
Here... and... here.
Have you any idea what you put me through?
You killed the woman I love and cursed me to be this hideous creature.
Barnabas, get over it.
Locked in a box for 200 years!
Don't exaggerate, it was only 196.
It was an eternity.
I shall have you tried for witchcraft and burnt at the stake.
Poor, sweet Barnabas.
Things have changed while you were taking your little nap.
My Angelbay is Collinsport now.
So you are the one who has sent the Collins family business into the abyss.
They love me here.
I'm the only big fish left in their little pond.
Is that so?
And do the good people of Collinsport know that their beloved Angie... is a whore of Beelzebub?
Do you really think anyone would believe a word you said?
I've been an upstanding member of this community for 200 years... in one form or another.
Your name may have changed, but you remain the succubus of Satan.
Harlot of the devil. Vulgar...!
The people of Collinsport are my worshippers now.
And to them... you're just a stranger who's afraid of the sun.
Welcome back to the shadows,
Barnabas Collins.
I've missed you.
Angelbay.
The very audacity of the name summons vomit into the recesses of my mouth.
I always knew there was something off about Angie. But a witch?
Indeed.
But a witch with an impenetrable hatred of me.
Hate?
No, if she merely hated you, she would've killed you.
A curse takes devotion.
Why must I alone... bear the rotten fruit of our cursed family tree?
My parents, taken.
My true love, taken.
And what did you do?
I attempted to throw myself from a cliff.
Tragically, to no avail.
And then...
I became a vampire... and started to kill innocent townspeople.
Yes... but you also kept the family business afloat... and tried to keep the manor from falling apart.
Yes.
Yes, I did, didn't I?
You fought on, Barnabas.
In your own crazy and miserable way, you fought on... until they had to drag you away and lock you in an iron box...
- ...to keep you from fighting.
- My God, you're right.
You fought on because it's in your blood.
In our blood, madam.
And now you have a chance to fight again.
And fight I shall.
Just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
I'm on the top of the world looking down
What sorcery is this?
Reveal yourself, tiny songstress!
You want fishermen, you gotta get Silas Clarney first.
He's got the ear of every captain from Bar Harbor to Boston.
They call him the
"Godfather of the Grand Banks."
Excuse me. Captain Clarney?
Captain Clarney,
I'd like you to meet Barnabas Collins.
"Collins"?
And why does a Collins want to talk to me?
To offer you a contract.
I have a contract... with Angelbay.
And if I told you
I could offer you a better one?
Then, Mr. Collins, I would tell you to take a long walk off a short pier.
There is such a thing as loyalty in our line of work.
I see.
Mr. Clarney... you have grown rather weary of working for Angelbay.
In fact, you would rather sell your soul to Satan... than sell another fish to Angelique Bouchard.
Do you understand?
I... understand.
Very good.
Now... if you would be so kind as to introduce me... to some of your fellow captains...
Barnabas? Why are you staring into Carolyn's room?
What is that thing?
It's a lamp.
It looks like a pulsating blood urn.
I think it's time I showed you my office, Barnabas.
Do you know what a psychiatrist is?
Regrettably, the word is foreign to me.
May I assume it is some species of American delicacy?
It's a medical doctor that specializes in disorders of the mind.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Now, where were you born?
- Liverpool.
- Can you describe it for me?
Filthy.
The air is choked with soot and the streets reek... of freshly hurled chamber pots.
The smell of urine permeates the air.
Have you any experience with hypnotism, Barnabas?
I find it very useful, yes.
Yes, I agree.
You see... sometimes we make up a fantasy world... to help us erase horrible memories from our past.
I find hypnotism cuts through all that.
I employ it for other purposes.
May I hypnotize you, Barnabas?
Madam...
I do not believe that remotely possi...
Good.
Now...
I'd like you to tell me a few things.
A vampire?
Keep your voice down.
What on earth are you talking about?
Oh, spare me.
I had him under hypnosis for hours.
Barnabas?
There's a point where delusions fail, but his didn't budge.
He told me everything... including that you've known his secret since he arrived!
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was protecting the children.
Oh, by letting a vampire use one of the guest bedrooms?
He admitted killing those men at the construction site.
- He's a murderer.
- He's a Collins and a good man... and these days, that's a desperately rare combination.
Oh, yes, I almost forgot, the family that can do no wrong.
You know, Julia, I'm surprised at you.
I'd think a physician like you would find him fascinating.
Well, sure.
Medically, psychologically and physically, he's fascinating.
Which is exactly why I came to you instead of the police.
Then be fascinated, Julia.
And if you have an ounce of love or respect for this family... keep your mouth shut.
I don't feel comfortable discussing this with you.
Do not fear, my child.
I simply seek advice on the art of courting a woman of this time.
Land.
And who better to tutor me than a woman of your age.
What is your age, if I may?
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen and no husband.
You must put those birthing hips to good use at once... lest your womb shrivel up and die.
You're weird.
But do you think me too weird for a woman of this... land?
You obviously mean Vicky.
She has the most fertile birthing hips
I have ever laid eyes upon.
You're way too weird.
Do you really think so?
You're all stiff, proper and old-fashioned.
And Victoria... is she not proper?
She likes to pretend she's rock 'n' roll.
She's a Carpenters kind of chick for sure.
Do you mean to say that she has a penchant for woodworkers?
The Carpenters are musicians, stupid.
Music.
Yes, I'm rather fond of the music of the day.
I am a picker
I am a grinner
I am a lover
And I am a sinner
I play my music
In the sun
If only Shakespeare had been as eloquent.
Okay.
If you wanna get with her, you're gonna have to change your approach.
Drop the whole weird
Swinging London thing... and hang out with a few normal people.
You know what's good about this war, man?
- What?
- No way, man.
No, no, no, listen up.
What's good about this war... is that it's so bad... it's gonna be the last one.
- Yeah.
- The last one.
And this last war we're in the middle of... who wins?
- Peace wins, man.
- Yeah.
- Peace wins every war.
- Yeah.
- Every war.
- Yeah.
- You speak of peace.
- Yeah.
I have spent the last two centuries locked in a box... staring into the all-consuming void.
The dark shadows of one's soul.
That's heavy, man.
Man, you tripped for two centuries?
Indeed.
But with great purpose, methinks.
For I believe that I have found my one true love.
Alas, I know not how to win her tender affections... for I fear that I am a relic in her eyes.
- That's what they say about us.
- Yeah.
Where I'm from... the love of a woman is won by giving money to her father.
Or sheep.
And if the love is earnest enough... then perhaps even a combination of the two.
Women don't care about money... or sheep.
Yeah.
Are you absolutely certain?
Love.
Chicks dig love, man.
Yeah.
Yes.
I am reminded of a line... from Erich Segal's wonderful novel,
Love Story.
"Love means never having to say... you are sorry."
That is so beautiful.
However, please know that it is with sincere regret... that I must now kill all of you.
Yeah.
No, it's brilliant.
Theoretically, anyway.
A series of transfusions to try and purify your blood.
And my soul with it.
I should warn you, Barnabas, there's a slight chance it won't work.
It isn't exactly the kind of thing they teach in medical school.
You must have faith, doctor... for if a man can become a monster, then a monster can become a man.
But why become a man, Barnabas?
Why give up the gift of eternal youth?
Look at me. Every year I get half as pretty and twice as drunk.
If that is true, madam... you must have started as the most beautiful creature that has ever lived.
Barnabas... are you aware of the concept of doctor-patient confidentiality?
No.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to enlighten me.
All right.
Barnabas!
Victoria.
Mind if I tag along?
Nothing would make me happier.
You've come down for a stroll?
Actually, I came down looking for David.
God knows where he's run off to now.
We'll be lucky if we see him before Christmas.
He's a fine lad.
Every bit as curious and rambunctious as I was.
He idolizes you.
Between you and his mother, I can hardly get him to talk about anything else.
You believe him, that he sees her and speaks to her?
Part of me believes he's a lonely boy looking for comfort.
Part of me believes there are things in this world we don't understand.
Things like magic, death, destiny.
I guess as long as it makes him happy, what does it matter what anyone believes?
Eloquently put.
Maybe we're getting too worked up about this, Angie.
They spruced up the cannery and renovated their house. So what?
We still hold pink slips on 95 percent of the nets dragging the Grand Banks.
He's right.
It doesn't mean anything to our bottom line.
"Doesn't mean anything"?
My great-great grandmother started Angelbay... to show those Collins that they didn't own the water.
That they couldn't look down their entitled noses at us.
The Bouchard women slaved for over two centuries... sacrificing their lives to build this business.
So that means something, gentlemen.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna see it destroyed by those bastards.
Call and arrange a meeting.
Sell to you? Never.
One cannot put a price on the restoration of a family's honor.
Let me try.
I had no idea that my business acumen was giving you such spasms.
Hypnotizing fishermen isn't business acumen, Barnabas.
Those are my terms.
Here are my terms:
Goest thou to hell, and swiftly, please.
And there may Asmodeus himself suckle from your diseased teat.
No one talks like you any more,
Barnabas.
Yes, indeed.
I must say this age does remain a mystery to me.
Give me one good reason why I should not kill you this instant.
Because I'd kill you if you tried.
Impossible.
That would require mercy.
Instead, you have made me a monster.
We're both monsters, Barnabas.
Just two big fish in an itty-bitty pond.
Now, we can either fight until one of us is dead... or we can make... little fish together.
I'll be honest. I was really angry at you for the first century or so.
Sure, it was fun... watching your family squirm and burn away... like ants under a magnifying glass.
And yes, it was fun being adored as the Collins name crumbled... growing wealthy on the backs of their despair.
But lately...
Lately it's just been... lonely.
We're different from these people, Barnabas.
We're better than they are.
That's why I've missed you.
You're the only ant I couldn't... burn.
What is it you want, Angelique?
Your love.
You do still love me, don't you?
Somewhere deep down in that cold, un-beating heart.
My dear, even Aphrodite herself could not construct a more odious union.
What if I made you?
With what, a spell?
A little doll filled with pins?
That is not love.
- With this.
- Oh.
The body you once begged me for.
I must admit, they have not aged a day.
I'm willing to start over, Barnabas.
I'm willing to call a truce if you'll just take me.
I am not as I once was.
I could change that.
And if I refuse?
I'll take everything you love... starting with that little creature you've been eyeing so fondly.
The one who looks like Josette.
Well, then...
I suppose strictly in the name of her honor...
I must now defile... your most intimate and womanly segments.
That was a regrettable turn of events.
You didn't seem to regret it.
Yes.
Seems that even in death,
I have a weakness for the living flesh.
Especially yours.
What a cold way to describe something so hot.
Perhaps.
But I cannot succumb to your charms ever again.
Please, forgive me.
If I can't have you, my love...
I'll destroy you.
Five more minutes.
This is a very silly play.
A werewolf.
A werewolf?
Yeah, well, it's the only station we get out here.
How are we doing?
I do not feel as though
I'm becoming more human as yet.
Give it some time.
Time, doctor,
I have an unfortunate excess of.
This is my favorite doll, called Lucy.
And my favorite bit about Lucy is her crazy, crazy red hair.
I mean, look at her red hair.
And my second favorite bit about her... is her nice, shiny, pink bow and...
No! Please! Please, no! Please!
Please, I'm begging you! Please, don't!
It's really true! Mommy, Daddy, please!
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy!
Please, Daddy! Daddy!
Help me.
Help you what?
A what?
A ball.
And a most splendid one.
A ball for who?
For the entire town, of course.
Don't you know the entire town kind of hates us?
Balls are demonstrations of power.
Balls are how the ruling class remain the ruling class.
Exactly what I've been saying.
This family could use some balls.
Indeed. And the Collins family have always held the biggest... and the most wonderful balls.
Jesus, can somebody shut the drapes?
You know, Barnabas has a point.
It's about time we threw a little dough around.
Show the peasants that we're back in action.
People don't throw balls any more, stupid.
Do they not?
They throw happenings.
And how, pray, does one throw a happening?
Well... first things first, you'll need a mirror ball.
Whatever that is, we shall have it.
And booze, lots of booze.
Carolyn.
We shall have spirits enough to fill a schooner's hull.
And...
Alice Cooper.
I seem to recall an Alice Cooper from my youth.
Does she reside in Collinsport?
Not exactly.
Well, she shall be our guest nonetheless.
How do you do?
- Thank you for having us.
- Evening.
Good evening. Welcome to Collinwood.
I have to hand it to you.
This is a happening.
I guess the only thing missing is Alice Cooper.
Perhaps you should go and acquaint yourself with the evening's entertainment.
I used t be such a sweet, sweet thing
Till they got ahold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm getting real shot down
And I'm feeling mean
Ugliest woman I've ever seen.
No more Mr. Nice Guy
No more Mr. Clean
No more Mr. Nice Guy
They say he's sick,
He's obscene.
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
Master David.
Where is the female coat attendant?
My dad's talking to her inside.
But he told me to keep everybody out.
I'm sure he did, David.
And you've done a marvelous job.
But now I would like you to go and watch Alice Cooper with the others.
But my dad said...
Go and watch the Cooper woman.
You were right about this stuff.
Nothing but the best for you, pussycat.
Who was the kid?
I have no idea. I never saw him before.
Now... come here.
Mommy, where's Daddy?
He's been gone for so long.
Is he ever coming home?
I was gone for 14 days
I could've been gone for more
Whatever are you doing outside, my dear?
You'll catch your death of cold.
I've caught the only thing that matters, Barnabas.
Your eye.
I have withheld my tender affections... fearful that they were unrequited.
I've not spoken of my feelings to another soul.
Right. You've only spoken of my birthing hips.
Yes, well...
I don't know why, but for some reason,
I feel like I can tell you anything.
It's like I've known you forever.
Yes.
It's almost hypnotic.
Yes.
But, wait, no.
I have used no such trickery to summon your ardor, I assure you.
I don't know what it is. I just know there's always been something pulling me here.
Pulling me to Collinsport.
To you.
Oh, my dear Victoria.
- Hath my scent offended thee?
- No, no.
I'm sorry. It's just...
The people I love haven't always loved me back.
My own family sent me away.
Swept me under the rug... because it was easier than having a daughter who was different.
Who was cursed.
Cursed because I saw things other little girls didn't.
They were the loneliest, most painful years a child could know.
Now, hold still, Maggie.
This will only hurt for a minute.
But as hard as they were,
I never lost my will.
The need to feel the sun on my face again.
So I set out in search of a new home.
A new life, far away from that pain.
But even in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd feel as happy as I do now.
To betray one's own kin, and because she possesses a gift.
No, Victoria.
It is unforgivable.
And your parents deserve to boil in hell's everlasting sulfur.
See my lonely life unfold
Since I've gone away
Hey.
Hey, you're not invited.
Hey.
But...
Sleeping don't come very easy
In a straight, white vest
Should like to see that little children
She's only 4 years old
For most of my life,
I've wanted a place where I belonged.
A place where I could feel at home again.
Feel loved again.
And I've found that place here at Collinwood.
And here.
We must intensify our efforts.
I have urgent need to be human again.
I can explain.
My God.
You're not using your blood to make me human.
You're using my blood to make yourself immortal.
Yes, but, Barnabas, you have a gift.
It isn't fair to keep it all to yourself.
The Collins family took you in, bestowed their sacred trust upon you.
And you brazenly betray that trust.
I'm sorry.
I just don't want to grow old.
I want to be beautiful again.
- I want to live forever, like you.
- I'm afraid that is out of the question.
A stout man contains some five quarts of blood... which, if you will forgive the boast...
I can consume in a mere seven and a half seconds.
But you, my dear little wisp...
I dare say I shall drink you to a withered husk in less than five.
Please don't kill me. You're a good man.
You're a gentleman.
- Please, forgive me.
- Madam.
I am neither good nor gentle, and I do not forgive.
I should tell you, Willie... if you ever speak a word of this to anyone...
I shall have to kill you in a most unpleasant manner.
Don't worry, Mr. B.
I never liked the bitch anyway.
Come on. I know you're here.
Hey.
Beautiful workmanship, isn't it?
I was just looking for the...
This?
There's nothing worth stealing,
I'm afraid.
Sadly, Elizabeth uses it for the badminton equipment.
That's what I was looking for.
What are you?
I am about to do something so repellent... that it sickens me to my very core.
I'm going to give you a choice.
What choice?
Either you remain at Collinwood... and devote your every waking moment to becoming an exemplary father... the father David so desperately wants and deserves...
Or?
Or you leave... with sufficient money... to live your thieving, selfish life elsewhere.
Where on earth is Dr. Hoffman when we need her?
Indeed.
Barnabas, you're on fire.
I'd like to teach the world to sing
I demand that you release me from my curse.
You're late.
What is that?
The only thing you drink these days.
From where does it come?
No one you know.
I promise.
I knew it wouldn't be long before you barged in... begging me to make you mortal again.
Now that Dr. Hoffman isn't around to give you your little transfusions.
Yes.
Yes, it was a shame... she was called away on business so suddenly.
Interesting. I don't know many people who take business meetings... on the bottom of the ocean.
She was a liar.
She was stealing my blood.
Aren't we being a smidge hypocritical?
Lying and stealing blood are things you're rather familiar with.
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman... and the workmen and those very nice, unshaven young people.
But know this:
With each life I take... a piece of my wretched soul dies.
For I only kill because I'm compelled to.
Compelled by your witchcraft.
By your curse.
Why have you done this to me?
It's a shame.
You know, if you'd just been smart enough to love me, I would've let her go.
Speak plainly, snake.
I sent your little girlfriend over the cliffs once before.
What makes you think
I wouldn't do it again?
I'm gonna offer you a business proposal, Barnabas.
My final offer.
Either you agree to rule this little pond of mine side by side... partners and lovers... or I put you back in the box.
I have already prepared my counterproposal.
It reads thusly:
You may strategically place your wonderful lips upon my posterior... and kiss it repeatedly!
Sleeping flame, I summon thee
To your form return
Make the night as bright as day
And burn, baby, burn
Wha...?
I've come to realize shutting you in that box for all eternity... might've been a tad harsh.
So here is the deal:
I'm gonna destroy everything you love... and you're gonna take some more time to think about us.
See you in a couple centuries, lover boy.
Do not dismay, Barnabas.
We shall yet again escape this nightmare.
Perhaps only a few brief decades this time.
Oh, hello!
Hello! I hear you!
Oh, sweet glories be. Whoever you are, fear not. I will not harm you.
What year is it?
How many centuries have I...?
How long has it been?
It's been 20 minutes.
Young Master David. How on earth did you know I was imprisoned?
My mom told me.
You probably think I'm crazy.
Young man, I think nothing of the sort.
Uncle Barnabas... why do you have ladies' underwear on your face?
Never mind that. Where is your family?
Where is Victoria?
I haven't seen Vicky... but everybody else is in the town watching our cannery burn.
We must save them! Hurry!
Master David!
Perhaps you should unchain me first?
Hank, we need another brigade out of Portland, quick as you can!
Get these folks out of here!
All right, everybody, stand back!
Please, stand back!
Oh, boy.
Miss Elizabeth's gonna shit a brick.
Sheriff, we need to talk.
Christ, Angie, I ain't got time for chitchat.
The damned town's burning!
You don't have time for proof that the Collins family is harboring a murderer?
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman... and the workmen and those very nice, unshaven young people.
Well, I'll be damned.
And to think the whole town's named after them.
I'd be willing to bet that Barnabas has already skipped town.
And I'd be willing to bet... that you'll find the corpses of more of his innocent victims in there!
The Collins family has rebuilt their business with murder!
Well, I say, not in my town!
There's one of them now!
He's probably the one who started the fire to cover his boss' tracks.
- Time to go.
- Where you going?
Willie. What on earth's happened?
Fire. Murder. Angry mob. Run!
David, go inside.
Liz...
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to take you in.
All of you.
Bill... the Collins family built this town.
We built it with our boats and our nets.
With our sacrifices and our blood.
And this is how you repay us?
You've been harboring a murderer.
Arrest them.
I shall go willingly... to whatever punishment awaits... provided... no harm befalls my family.
Hold it right there.
And provided...
Miss Bouchard goes along with me... for she is no less a monster than I.
Perhaps it is best... if we are both destroyed.
Mr. Collins, back off! I'm warning you!
Go on, slaughter me.
Show them what you are.
No.
I shall show them what we are.
Unh!
What's that man done to Angie?
It's not him, it's her.
She's a witch.
Excuse me.
You gotta get through me first, lady.
All right, everybody, go on home now.
- Nothing to see here.
- Let's move.
You should've loved me, Barnabas.
None of this would've happened if you'd just loved me.
I should have destroyed you.
You've brought me nothing but misery.
I gave you my heart!
You have no heart.
You're the curse!
Women are undone by loving you.
Josette, Dr. Hoffman.
And your beloved Vicky.
I command you to release her from your curse.
"Command"? You make me sick.
Missed me.
Vulgar, hideous serpent,
I shall deliver you to hell's doorstep.
Get out of my room!
Angelique!
Get out of my house.
Your house?
Enough trickery.
I worshiped you.
Plagued me.
Adored you!
Despised you!
Fine.
If Collins blood built this house... then let us bathe in it.
Leave us alone.
Carolyn?
Carolyn, my God.
I'm a werewolf, okay?
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
Woof.
What have you done to my daughter?
Well, Liz... your perfect Collins pedigree lacked a bit of substance... so I sent the werewolf who bit Carolyn in her crib.
Just like I made David no better than a bastard... when I sent his mommy to the ocean floor to have tea with the tuna.
And as for you, my love...
I killed your mother and father.
I cursed your family, my Barnabas.
They kept us apart.
They never understood, we're the same.
We're meant to be.
Leave him alone.
I think I'll kill you first, orphan.
David, get out!
Your quarrel is with me.
My quarrel is with all of you.
I'm warning you.
This is your last chance.
Let us go.
And what will you do if I don't, you little bastard?
Not me.
My mom.
Go!
David, come on.
Willie, come on.
So this is how it ends.
So quiet... as if you were asleep.
You know, there was a time when I might have loved you.
We could have spent eternity together.
We still... can.
You never wanted my love.
You wanted to possess me.
No.
I love you, Barnabas.
You cannot love, Angelique.
That is your curse.
Take it.
Victoria!
Victoria!
She said Widow's Hill.
What do we do now?
What we've always done.
Endure.
I thought I'd lost you.
You have lost me.
I live in the light, Barnabas.
You live in the shadows.
I'll grow old and die, and you'll live forever.
We will find a way, my love.
There's only one way.
No. I will not see you suffer as I do.
Never.
No!
Oh, Victoria.
My sweet Victoria.
Victoria.
Josette.
It is said that blood is thicker than water.
It is what defines us.
Binds us.
Curses us.
My name is Barnabas Collins... and my curse has finally been broken.
There is a place.
A place that knows no sadness.
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.
A place inhabited by little blue beings three apples high.
It lies deep in an enchanted forest, hidden away beyond a medieval village.
Most people believe this place is made up, only to be found in books or in children 's imaginations.
Well, we beg to diff en
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!
I'm going in!
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!
Yes!
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!
Oh, yeah! So excited!
Now you see us, now you don't!
Three, two, one. Yeah!
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf plays their own special pad.
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro for the Blue Moon Festival!
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!
Clumsy! Help!
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!
Smurf on the loose!
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.
Who's clumsy now, huh?
Hey, what do you get when you cross a Smurf with a cow?
Blue cheese! I got you a present.
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!
But, wait! I...
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal for the Blue Moon Festival?
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.
Grouchy, it's right there.
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."
Clearly you two lack the verbal skills required
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy, the other Smurfs don't want to dance with you for fear of what are politely called
"fractures."
How could anybody think that?
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.
Watch it, there!
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.
As happy and as perfect as life in Smurf village is, even sunshine and butterflies must have their dark clouds.
And for all Smurfs, that dark cloud has one name.
Gargamel, the evil wizard.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
This is so wrong
"I'm Papa Smurf.
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people
"and live in the forest with 99 sons and one daughter.
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.
"And I betrayed Gargamel, and I don't even care.
"And everything is just sunshine and rainbows."
But all of that is about to change.
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!
That's your cue to pounce on the miserable beasts in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.
I simply can't stop thinking about the miserable beasts every single minute of every single day.
'Cause I need them!
It is only by capturing the little wretches and extracting their happy blue essence that my magic will finally become...
Not infallible.
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.
I shall become the most powerful wizard in all of the world.
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.
"O great one?"
Yes, lying, deceptive, horrible little Smurfette?
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching, how ever do you expect to find us?"
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.
For, you see, I have a magical map that shows me exactly where the smurf root grows!
I shall now use my formidable powers to magically transport us here!
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!
Alakazoop!
Great.
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?
We really need that Smurf essence.
Alakazamp!
Now tie it off right there!
That blue moon time of year again.
Time to smurf some magic.
Summon a vision and see what our future holds.
I must get the visioning potion just right.
The magic is always strongest during the blue moon.
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.
A dragon wand.
I got it! I got it!
Clumsy.
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!
Papa!
Clumsy, what have you done?
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?
Are you okay?
Yes. Fine.
Why aren't you rehearsing for the Blue Moon celebration?
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face, so I thought I'd make some smurf root mud packs to take down everyone's swelling.
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.
No! Those fields are too close to Gargamel's castle.
I'll get the smurf root.
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?
Okay. If you say so.
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.
Let's see, just a few more...
- Boo.
- Gargamel!
Help!
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!
A ball of yarn!
A nice, juicy bird!
So, that's it!
It's invisible.
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if it's safe.
Azrael?
Are you dead?
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?
Nothing apocalyptic, really.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Perfect. Another year we don't have to worry about that mean, old...
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.
No, no! Gargamel!
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta accidentally led him to the village.
Gargamel!
Smurf for your lives!
Everybody skedaddle!
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!
Sound the alarm, Crazy.
This is really bad!
Smurfs, that way!
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!
There you go, you nasty cat.
- This way!
- This is no joke!
- Look out!
- Papa!
Let go! Cursed nature!
Here comes papa, Papa!
Papa, your primitive little defenses, they're useless against me, sir!
I laugh at them.
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?
Maybe this will all blow over.
I can fix this. I just gotta think.
Yes!
Follow me, everyone!
Save yourselves!
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!
The one time we want him to trip and he's running perfectly!
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!
This is not good at all.
Clumsy!
Help!
Well, we tried. Let's go.
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.
Not the Smurf bridge!
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.
This is not a Smurf bridge, it's clearly a chain...
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?
Oh, no!
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!
- Don't let go!
- Help!
Help!
Look out for the hole!
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.
Smurf up! It's a hole.
Hold on!
Oh, no!
Looks like you got the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?
Now you belong to me!
Not this time, Gargamel!
What's wrong with you?
That was great! Let's have another go.
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!
We're not even wet.
What part of the enchanted forest is this?
My calculations indicate...
That's slimy.
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.
Oh, my.
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.
And can't we just go around the rock?
Oh, my smurf.
Where the smurf are we?
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle, that's where.
Well, at least they're not coming after us.
Oh, yeah. Really?
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!
- Run!
- Not again!
Azrael? Are you dead?
Must have Smurfs!
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!
- Guys, come on!
- Go!
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.
Hey, can we get the photographer over there?
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.
If you could not stand directly in front of the display, but over to the sides, it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.
Also, don't forget to smile.
Remember, you're working for a cosmetics company. That's it.
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!
Hello, Henri.
On top of everything with the campaign, Patrick?
Well, as much as I can be.
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.
Patrick!
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.
It's gonna be quite the gala.
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.
Can you give me what I want?
Is that what you're asking for?
How would I know what I'm asking for when I don't even know what I want?
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.
Exacto! I need you to create a new campaign for Jouvenel.
All digital, of course, so it can be ready on time for the launch.
Odile, that's two days.
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign, it's kind of tight.
But... No, two days is perfect.
God only needed six days for the whole world, right?
Fail me, and maybe you can go and work for him.
Where are we, Azrael?
What manner of freakish realm is this?
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?
Yes, yes, of course.
This day just keeps getting better and better.
So we're just gonna jump in the portal, get back to our village and everybody's happy, right?
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.
We're all gonna die.
Papa Smurf, how do we get home with the portal closed?
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight, the portal will open again.
Now, let's take shelter till dark.
All right, let's get smurfing.
Okay, but I'm not happy.
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!
Way to go, Smurfette!
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!
Smurf!
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!
Hey.
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.
Why don't we just go around the tree?
There you are. By all means, relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.
What? Where?
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!
Be careful, Brainy.
Hey. Hey!
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!
A jump from this height will Knock the blue out of us!
- My hip.
- Papa!
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!
Stop that carriage!
Never mind. Here it is.
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!
You've had that coming for about 30 years!
Smurfs!
Oh, wow.
Castles and palaces everywhere!
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.
And look at the giant princess!
This village is amazing, Papa.
Yes, and likely very dangerous.
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,
I need you all to stay close and do exactly as I say.
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.
You can count on us, Papa.
They can see us! Camouflage.
Blend in.
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.
We get to climb another tree.
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!
- Brainy.
- That's it.
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.
How are we supposed to find Clumsy in there?
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.
- Grace?
- Hello?
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...
Baby kicked.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Please say hello.
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.
This is the sound of my voice.
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.
Hello.
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.
Or the new VP of marketing.
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!
- It's...
- It's provisional.
If I wow Cruella de Odile, then I'll keep the job.
If not, then my head'll be on a pike next to the last guy.
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.
But I have two days.
- Yikes.
- I know.
What if I don't get them done in time?
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.
Unless...
Wait, the backup ads we have did fine in focus groups.
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.
Azrael, we've come so far, yet ever am I haunted by the same familiar riddle.
How to find the Smurfs?
If only I...
I'm sorry, is my thinking interrupting your vile hacking?
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.
Very nice. Are you done now?
I don't want to look at it.
What? What?
Is that... No. No, it can't be.
It is.
The tawny locks of Smurfette.
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!
With my skills, even this small trifle of smurfiness will yield me just enough power to catch them all!
I must find a laboratory with which to tease the magic from these precious little strands.
Yes. it's a bit small, but this should do nicely!
It's even got its own cauldron.
What died in here?
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!
Somebody's been working a dark and terrible magic in there.
What is that?
On, baby.
Daddy is home.
Come on.
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.
How are we gonna open a magical portal when we can't even find Clumsy?
Hey, I think I see something up there.
Oh, no.
Clumsy? Is that you?
Hello.
Help! Help!
Oh, smurf.
Hey.
"Berry Boom."
Patrick!
Elway. Elway.
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!
What is it?
No, no!
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.
Elway.
Elway. Did you do that?
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.
- I got this side.
- All together now.
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.
GO! Pull the lid!
Gross.
This is so...
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...
Did you just talk?
I'm not saying till you put down the giant spiky thing.
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?
- Get out of here!
- Look out!
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!
Kiss my smurf!
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!
- Over here!
- Get him!
Have you had enough? Tap out?
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!
Other way! Other way!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!
Run!
Elway!
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!
Grace! Run!
Stop bleating like a sheep and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.
Grace, we're being attacked!
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!
It's okay, it's okay.
They're friendly.
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.
I was about to make haggis with your innards.
This is it. This is it, Azrael!
Smurfette's hair goes in here, flows through the Smurf essence extractor, and finally, I have my Smurfilator!
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...
Would you care for a mint when you're done?
Yes, yes, yes!
With this precious elixir, my sorcerous spell shall be powerful beyond all measurable measurement.
This one tiny drop will give me the power to capture them all.
This is great!
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin
It's so obvious that what you're doing is wrong.
Oh, really? After you.
How crazy is this?
There are little blue people singing in our kitchen!
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?
Sorry.
Okay. It says here Smurfs are mythical creatures from Belgium,
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.
Documented by Peyo.
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.
It says they're mythical, Grace.
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.
Well, they look pretty real to me.
Come on.
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.
You guys come from a magic forest where you live in oversized mushrooms.
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.
And you like to use the extremely imprecise term "smurf"
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.
And you're all named after your personalities?
Do you get your names when you're born, or after you've exhibited certain traits?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
Yeah, whatever.
Master Winslow, there must be something about the blue moon on your magic window machine.
Just what is this magic searching device?
Right now, I'm using Google.
- Google.
- Google.
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.
"A figurative construct..."
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!
"But the moon itself doesn't appear to be blue."
- What?
- Not blue?
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,
I'll just have to smurf us a potion to invoke the blue moon.
You hear that, honey?
They're only staying till an actual blue moon rises.
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion, which, at this point, seems completely plausible.
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.
Of course, the stars will need to be perfectly aligned.
And when that might be is hard to determine without the proper instrument.
Master Winslow, might I borrow your stargazer?
My what-whatzer?
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!
Besides, Papa had a vision, and everything turns out smurf y.
Right, Papa?
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.
What does the temperature of this Lilly have to do with the finding of Smurfs?
- Take your meds, man.
- What?
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.
Pardon me, wise sir?
By any chance, have you seen any little blue men?
They're everywhere!
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.
I know.
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.
Great. We're gonna be here how long?
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.
Next, find a book of spells and then smurf a portal and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.
Bye, Elway.
Someone looks smurfalish!
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft, like a blacksmith's apron.
I wear it because it's what everyone wears at work.
What are you, you pasty giant?
I try to get people to buy things by analyzing market trend predictions.
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.
Look, I would love to explain but I am super late. I gotta go.
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?
You had one outfit on, and now you're wearing something completely different.
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette, she probably got the other one dirty.
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know, somebody wants a bigger mushroom.
But, then you'd be further apart.
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.
I've got a baby on the way, so...
Wait, wait. We can't just leave them here alone, without an adult.
I'm 546 years old.
Of course you are.
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.
- Love you.
- Okay.
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere if I were you.
Why not?
Our world doesn't do well with visitors from other places.
I mean, look what happened to E.T.
It's a movie. A moving picture.
Book. Just stay, okay?
Great. He's gone and we still don't have a Stargazer.
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller, he reads stars all the time.
Ergo, it's at his place of business.
Excellent work, Brainy.
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.
Clumsy, I think it might be best if you stay here. You know?
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Smurf away!
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?
Look, he's getting into the mechanical wagon.
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!
Goodbye, blue world.
Use your hat, you ninny!
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.
We're stopping. Hold on tight.
Not to me, Grouchy.
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.
Master Winslow, we really need your help.
- Hey.
- Right here.
What are you doing here?
What part of "we need a Stargazer" don't you understand, you numptie?
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?
If we could just have a quick look around in your predicting parlor...
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.
All of you. Trust me.
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.
I'm not going... Hey!
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.
All right, who smurf ed?
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.
I hope you guys like desk drawers, because that's where...
- You're late.
- Odile!
You were in my office.
It's my building, and we have much work to do.
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?
Close. I had a crazy morning.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.
Nervous energy.
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.
- I like it.
- Yep.
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.
Hey! Stop it.
- Henri.
- Make it work.
You have no idea.
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.
Are you crazy?
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?
I'm sorry, Master Winslow, but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?
It's not something people of this century just have, especially here.
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.
Well, perhaps we could sing to help things along.
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long
Stop.
La la la la la la
Stop!
Sing a happy song
Come on. None of you find that song just the tiniest bit annoying?
I find it annoying.
Well, what do you sing at work?
- I don't sing at work.
- What?
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.
I know. How about if we hum?
Please stop humming.
I need to hone my message here.
I've got a message.
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.
That's good. You should use that.
Or, "Dance and be happy."
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?
It's an embarrassment of riches.
They're giving you gold here.
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow, you'll know it's the right message if it comes from the heart.
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.
- You said it.
- Absolutely.
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.
I love emerging dramatically through the smoke.
It makes... It makes me feel so deliciously mysterious.
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.
What?
Where? Where?
What?
Curses! So close.
What?
Theirs is upside-down.
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.
- Hi.
- Hello.
What are you doing?
Just greening things up a bit.
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but, you know, I'm not so sure this stuffs gonna grow out here.
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.
So where is everybody else?
They went to get a Stargazer so Papa can smurf a blue moon to get us home.
And they went without you?
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?
- Hey!
- Sorry!
Why don't we come inside?
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that this new anti-aging cream can make any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.
Astonishing, really.
I see no transformation.
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish, if you ask me.
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.
How sad for you in 30 years.
Henri, escort this lunatic out.
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?
Alakazootiful!
How did you do that?
Yes, and seriously, me next.
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards never reveal their secrets.
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.
Please, señor Can you do that again?
You may attempt to persuade me.
What is it that you desire?
Riches?
Fame?
Fortune?
With my help, the whole world will know the name that is Garbagesmell.
Gargamel.
Yes. With my help, the whole world will know the genius that is Gargamel.
L.m
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone, on the bright side, I did land us all here in your little mushroom, and we got to meet you and Patrick.
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.
Well, I used to be.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So how long did it take you to...
Gosh.
Un-fumble your feet?
Well, about as long as it takes to realize that nobody's just one thing.
You can be anything you wanna be.
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.
Probably not.
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.
First, you put your...
Works every time.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
This is a fascinating wind machine you have here.
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!
They are everywhere and they won't stop singing.
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill to get what you have in that ring.
Not if we Kill them first.
Let's see, we're going to need some knights, preferably in shining armor, some bowmen, poison arrows.
I like the way you think.
And some spikes to mount their heads on.
Well, it is all about the presentation.
And, of course, all of our testing would be animal cruelty-free?
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?
Get out of here.
You have a wicked sense of humor.
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!
Henri?
I said, get out of here.
Señor Gargamel, now you must assure me, darling, that you can recreate whatever it was that you did to my mother, but on a massive scale.
Do that, and the world will worship you.
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...
Heretic. Yes, thank you.
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon has gone straight to my nether regions.
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.
Now, to the matter at hand.
So do we have a deal, señor?
Not quite, my sweet maiden.
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!
Hit the deck!
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.
Can't everyone just slow down
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!
Wait for it.
I gotta get me one of those.
Oh, my gosh!
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!
When we get inside, spread out and find that Stargazer.
Come on, Smurfs!
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.
Grace, are you running?
No, no, I'm totally fine, but they need your help!
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna get themselves killed!
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.
Patrick, they need you.
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!
All right. Where are you?
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
You call that groveling, you fool?
Every village has an idiot. What?
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!
Smurf thief!
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...
So that's where all the unicorns went.
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.
Fine. Then hang on.
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.
Perfect.
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!
That'll put some air up your skirt!
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.
Predator!
Smurf droppings.
These are disgustingly tasty.
Hello.
Oh, creepy.
I hope they weren't looking for a stargazer, too.
Stargazers, stargazers...
Dresses!
You mean I can have more than one kind of dress?
What?
Papa, I'm telling you, we're never gonna find those...
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.
Hold still, stairs!
Look at the stair-climbing toy!
- Hey.
- What is that?
- Let me see it.
- Careful.
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.
Just say who you are and be who you say, right?
I can't seem to get it to scan.
My son wants one of those blue animatronic things.
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.
What aisle did you find this on?
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?
What? Ice Bat?
It comes in pink.
Smurf thief! Stop!
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?
You bet.
Smurf!
But I've got feelings.
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence on that old hag?
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!
I'm not a toy!
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?
- There she is!
- There she is!
Hey, this dress is mine!
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!
A giant's after me! She's huge!
Hey, that's mine!
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...
- Mommy!
- Really?
Don't ever forget that one magical moment our two worlds met.
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.
Hey!
That's one!
Technically, when loading cargo onto the head of a bear,
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.
Hold onto your knickers, boys, it's about to get grisly.
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!
Let's go, go, go!
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.
Two more!
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!
Grace, that's Gargamel!
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.
Bad kitty!
Oh, I hate that Cat!
Gargamel.
Smurfette.
More lovely than ever.
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.
Or not!
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...
Yahoo!
- Patrick.
- Hey.
- Impressive.
- Thanks.
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!
Or suffer the wrath of the great and powerful...
Let me... Let me see here...
How can you be the only girl in the village?
Well, see, I wasn't brought by a stork like the others.
I was created by Gargamel to trap the other Smurfs.
Wow. And then what happened?
Papa saved me.
He cast a special spell and then helped me become the Smurf I was meant to be.
No. Play it safe.
"Odile, pending your approval, it's ready to go to the billboard agency."
Well, here goes nothing.
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent, it's a whole new wager.
Without that blue moon, our giblets are gravy.
Well, it's off.
Time to either celebrate or file for unemployment.
Hey, what's wrong?
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. it's okay.
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.
I know the feeling.
Better yet...
I know the cure.
You just match the colors with the buttons.
You try.
Hey! Go, Grouchy!
- You're good!
- Nice one!
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!
Walk this way...
You sing.
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss
It's a rock face.
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?
Never mind.
- Like this
- Like this
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy
Little skirts climbing way up her knee
Not another single girl in the whole smurf in' world
And I can't believe she's lookin' at me
- it's a complete
- Surrender
- To the power of her
- Gender
So I close my eyes and make a wish
- I just want to
- Savor
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!
- Gutsy!
- Nice!
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
That was rare.
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Sorry, boys.
Yeah, that cools the giblets.
Nothin' like a cool breeze through my Enchanted Forest.
- It's approved.
- What?
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?
Well, she said "approved," so coming from her, that's love.
Oh, my goodness!
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!
Yeah.
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.
Do it, do it.
Go, go, go!
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard in New York City.
It's a go, laddie boy!
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.
But we are going home, right?
Of course. Just not tonight.
Now, off to bed.
I was hoping I'd be sleeping in my mushroom tonight.
I miss the other Smurfs.
Me, too.
I've never spent the night away from home before.
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Papa?
Do you really believe we're ever gonna get home to the other Smurfs?
Don't worry.
We'll be reunited with the others soon enough.
If only the stars would align.
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.
- Aye.
- Yeah.
He's always so nice, but when he leaves you feel bad.
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.
Oh, hello, little moth.
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.
Both of us meant to soar.
Go now, and bring back an army of mighty eagles to free me.
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.
Fly! Fly!
Fly!
Okay. Let's see here.
Hey.
I'm guessing you have a long night ahead of you.
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?
So tell me, that weird guy in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?
Not the smartest of sorcerers, but dangerous just the same.
Thank you.
Back home, I could hold him at bay with a spell or two.
But here, without my books and potions...
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?
Well, what are you gonna do?
I'll do anything and everything I can do to get my Smurfs home.
I won't ever give up. They're my family.
And you never give up on family.
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes having all those little guys depending on you?
I mean, what if you screw up?
How'd you know when you were ready?
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.
Yeah, right. Scratch that.
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you come for us today when your Grace called?
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.
Well, that's what being a papa is.
When it comes time, you just do.
And knowing what to do doesn't come from up here.
It comes from here, where it matters most.
My spleen?
No, your heart.
I'm trying to have a moment here, you whippersnapper.
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.
Come on, baby, stop playing.
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?
You know what happens to people who sit on my bench?
Be gone with you, behemoth, for I have instructed a moth to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles to free me from this confine.
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.
You see? You see?
The dungeon isn't built that can hold the likes of Gargamel.
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!
So long, scallywags!
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.
Wait, take me with you!
Wait! Wait!
To my castle for more essence!
Here they come, here they come.
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.
- There we are.
- Clumsy.
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.
I think there's too much pink.
Just because your name is Grouchy doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.
Yeah, it does.
- Smurfette.
- Hi.
- High five. High four.
- High four.
Great news! The stars have revealed a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!
- All right!
- Smurftastic!
I never doubted it for a second.
It has to be done tonight, between first star and high moon.
That's our only chance.
But we'll need a magic spell that works in this realm to open the portal home.
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.
Is there a place that sells spells?
No.
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.
How about old books?
Wait, there's an antique book shop right near where I work.
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.
Hey! Smurf hug!
Oh, I love you guys!
Bring it in, big fella.
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.
Hey, get up here.
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.
We've already got one.
- Really?
- What?
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.
That's the wrong ad.
What happened to my office?
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Someone sent this to the ad agency last night.
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta, just got me fired.
You sent the wrong file.
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.
I never wanted a house full of little people running around!
Blue. Little blue...
Okay...
Patrick.
What are you doing?
Going to try to save my job.
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!
There's no call for that kind of language, laddie.
See?
Okay, Patrick, wait.
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.
Just stop and listen to me for a second, please.
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?
And I hope that you can straighten that out.
But you are so not seeing the big picture here.
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.
Of all the people on the planet, those magical little creatures came to us.
They chose us.
Don't you see how absolutely amazing that is?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.
This is our blue moon.
And if you don't stop for just a second to see that, you're gonna miss it.
Hey, hey. Taxi!
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!
There's got to be some essence in here somewhere!
NOT DOW.
What? What?
Very, very well done, my little friend.
And to think, I almost ate you that time.
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick, the rouge merchant.
He will lead us to our elusive little blue quarry.
Don't you just have a switch or something to shut them off?
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.
Smurf me.
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?
According to the searching device, we take the F machine two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?
- What?
- Jump!
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.
That was great.
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...
For smurf's sake.
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.
Oh, it smells like butter in here.
Where do you suppose this magic bookstore could be?
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.
- It's closed.
- Figures.
We have to find a way in. Come on.
I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.
All right, everybody.
- Hey.
- Wow.
This place looks creepy to me.
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.
Let's just get the book and get outta here.
You're right. This book of spells is our ticket home.
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire, limitless power and world adulation.
Now why does it have to be so hard?
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.
Wherever did you hear that ear-damning squall?
It's your little blue men.
I saw them going into the bookstore around the corner.
You know, that song is really annoying.
Cautiously excited.
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.
Oh. Nearly there.
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.
Ah, yes.
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. ”
Peyo.
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.
- Look at that.
- Wow.
Well, I'll be smurf ed.
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.
You see all that in there?
Look here, at the patterns on this page.
Openous-lockicuss.
What?
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.
Oh, that's just plain naughty.
All that remains now is to return to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle, where your essence shall finally be mine.
- The dragon wand.
- No!
It's...
Oh, please, please, allow me.
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!
Wait for me!
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.
After all, what is the hunt without the thrill!
No!
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.
Let's get outta here.
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion and smurf the moon tonight.
It has to be tonight.
Me? Smurf the moon?
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?
- Papa, no!
- No!
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?
Come to papa, Papa!
- Just go!
- Papa!
- Papa!
- No!
Keep movin', lass.
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?
What's gonna happen to Papa?
Papa told us to smurf the moon, and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
Come on. We don't have much time.
"Come on"? Come on, where?
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?
We ride. Come on!
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.
And Smurfs. Let's ride.
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!
But I'm not sure I can do this.
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!
According to my calculations, this is dangerous!
It's getting dark.
Yeah. Yeah, I think we'd better go look for them.
Yeah.
Hi.
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.
Listen, Grace, I'm...
Hey, Odile.
Patrick...
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,
I know that the ads that ran weren't the ads I sent.
But they're the ads I should have sent.
The ads I almost did send.
But I didn't 'cause...
I second-guessed myself.
I gave you what I thought you wanted, instead of what I thought was right.
But this is right.
It means something to me and...
I don't know,
I think it's gonna mean something to others, too.
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.
"Once in a blue moon."
That means that there are only a few moments in your life when something truly memorable, truly magical, happens to you.
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid, you might just miss it.
That's what that image means.
Don't let those blue moon moments pass you by.
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.
I so smurf in' love you.
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.
We're outta control!
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.
Look! We got the incantation.
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.
- What?
- Oh, no.
He took him to some place called BellVeedaRay Castle.
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?
Belve... He's taken him to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.
To extract his essence.
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.
Papa said no matter what happens we're not to go back for him.
He's trying to protect us.
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.
No, no, no. We can't.
We promised Papa we'd do exactly what he said.
- That's right.
- I didn't.
I never promised him anything.
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.
I'm in.
Aye. Me, too.
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few
And steal their essence blue
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!
Oh, look at this.
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard yields me all of this essence.
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest from your entire family of Smurfs.
Alakazookas!
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!
No. No! The cages! No! No!
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!
I'll snip it from their hair.
You're a fool, Gargamel.
My Smurfs are well on their way home by now.
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.
Good luck, Gutsy!
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.
Brainy, what's happening?
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.
I don't think I can do it.
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.
I'll be smurf ed!
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.
That which doesn't kill you only makes me stronger.
- Yo!
- Huh?
Gargamel! Come out and play!
Oh, I think our tiny little guests have finally arrived.
- No!
- Ah, well.
Enjoy the ride, Papa!
And remember, keep your hands and feet
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!
Smurfs, run!
Smurfs.
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurf ed!
Yeah, what he said.
Adorable.
Two little smurfs come to save their beloved Papa.
Hey, Gargamel.
Make that three little smurfs.
And I went home and got a few friends.
MY, my, my!
I think the whole village must be here.
Whatever will I do with all this essence?
On me, boys.
Fire!
Let's get this hoedown started!
There comes a time when every Smurf must stand up...
Watch it, you little hoodlums!
For what is good and cute and blue in the world.
And on this brisk New York night, that time is now.
Hey! Seriously?
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.
Eat yolk, Gargamel!
Patrick, can you do it?
Go, go, go!
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.
You know, one bad apple can ruin your whole day.
Full smurf ahead!
Come on!
Hey, Gargamel, here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...
- Fire.
- Fire.
I'm too beautiful to die!
Oh, Papa.
No. No, Smurfette.
What did he do to you?
You shouldn't have come back for me.
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.
Smurfette!
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.
Charge!
Get him!
Grab the wand!
- Goin' in!
- Go!
Bombs away!
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!
Hang on, Papa.
Onions!
Get back, cat.
Here, kitty, kitty...
Smurfette!
Looking for me?
Play time is over!
Behold the awesome power of me!
Smurfette?
Had enough, huh?
You're mine, kitty.
I'm done smurfing around.
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!
What's happening, Papa?
No!
Gargamel!
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.
Oh, Papa!
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa is about to meet his little blue end.
No!
Upsy-daisy!
Oh, no. Papa!
Papa!
No! No!
You again!
Goodbye!
I'm really...
This ends here, this ends now!
Really going to enjoy this.
Gotcha!
Freedom!
Son of a smurf!
Come back here!
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!
Come back here right now with my wand!
Oh, no. Crikey.
I... I got it.
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.
I got it! I got it!
The vision's never been wrong.
I got it!
My wand! Give me back my wand!
How dare you!
How dare you defy the great and powerful...
Oh, my God.
Smurfs!
Are you dead?
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!
- Patrick.
- Hey.
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!
Clumsy, you're a hero.
I'm a hero?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.
Thanks, Papa.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
And now to get rid of this!
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.
I'm not one for long goodbyes, but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.
- Bye.
- Take care.
I hated this. So much less than I expected.
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.
I've never had a girlfriend before.
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.
High four.
High four, Grace.
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.
Hero? Stop.
Well, actually, you mind saying it one more time?
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.
- You saved me.
- So long!
You saved my whole family.
Actually I think it was the other way around.
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.
Your village has given me some ideas.
Come here.
Goodbye, Papa.
Goodbye, Papa.
Let's go home.
And so, the Smurfs left the strange city of New York, and I think they left it a little sweeter, a little wiser, a little smurfier.
And as that portal began to close for the last time...
Hey! Seriously, stop!
Bye, New York!
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.
Finally someone has given me what I want.
I think I'm not fired.
Wow!
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby, some unique new friends...
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.
Grace,
I smurf you.
Smurfs. Smurfs!
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.
What are you looking at?
NARRATOR: The oldest stories ever told are written in the stars.
Stories of time before man and gods, when Titans ruled the earth.
The Titans were powerful...
...but their reign was ended by their own sons...
...Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.
Zeus convinced his brother Hades...
...to create a beast so strong it could defeat their parents.
And from his own flesh...
...Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror...
...the Kraken.
Zeus became king of the heavens.
Poseidon, king of the seas.
And Hades, tricked by Zeus...
...was left to rule the underworld in darkness and in misery.
It was Zeus who created man...
...and man's prayers fed the gods' immortality.
But in time, mankind grew restless.
They began to question the gods...
...and, finally, rise up against them.
Into this world, a child was born.
A boy who would change everything.
[BABY CRYING]
Shh. Shh.
Perseus.
What is it, son?
I'll have a brother or a sister soon.
Think we're gonna love this child differently to the way we love you? We won't.
This child will be yours.
Me...
...I'm no one's son.
I am your father, Perseus.
Marmara is your mother.
And you'll always be our son.
The bond between us is much more than flesh and bone.
The love we have for you...
...it's that love that gods and kings fight over.
I've never understood the gods.
But even I don't question that you were saved for a reason.
And some day...
...that reason is gonna take you far away from here.
But not tonight, eh?
SPYROS:
Perseus. Perseus!
Getting frail, old man.
Marmara! Marmara!
Another day, nothing.
Caught on the reef.
To whom do I direct our gratitude for this glorious bounty?
Spyros, please.
Poseidon, Zeus?
Who do I thank, Marmara?
- Thank the men who provoke them.
SPYROS: They crush my island.
They put a plague on yours.
They take from us what they want.
We're their slaves.
The gods gave us life.
- For that, we should be thankful.
- I'm tired of being thankful for scraps.
I'm a fisherman. Perseus is a fisherman.
They've even taken that away from us.
What we are.
Still they want us to love them anyway.
One day...
...somebody's gonna have to make a stand.
One day, somebody's gonna have to say:
J'Enough."
[THUNDER CRASHING]
Just like the day you came to me.
The storm brought me right to you.
I know you have questions, son.
I wish I had the answers.
I have everything I need...
...right here.
Good night, son.
PERSEUS:
Hold her steady!
Tekla, the wreath.
Fetch the wreath.
SPYROS:
The statue of Zeus. Magnificent.
Something isn't right.
The soldiers, what are they doing?
[SOLDIERS YELLING]
[METAL CLANKING ON STONE]
MAN 1:
Come on!
MAN 2:
Lift it!
PERSEUS:
Hang on!
[TEKLA SCREAMS]
MAN 3:
In the name of the king and queen!
Who are they?
Soldiers from Argos.
MARMARA:
What have they done?
SPYROS: They've declared war.
War against the gods.
[SQUAWKING]
[SOLDIERS YELLING]
- Let's turn the boat around.
SPYROS: No.
Do nothing.
MAN 4:
Behind you!
[TEKLA SCREAMS]
PERSEUS:
Hold on!
MARMARA:
Tekla.
SPYROS:
Where's the boy?
Tekla!
No!
SPYROS: Go!
- No!
[GASPING]
[GROANING]
No!
MAN 1: Zeus, you must bring an end to this. They attack our temples!
MAN 2:
Now they dare to desecrate Zeus' image.
WOMAN:
We could reach out to them.
MAN 3: An accommodation could be made.
A truce!
No!
I created them...
...and they reward my love with defiance?
There will be no truce.
HADES:
Finally.
Some rage from you.
How long has it been?
How long, brother...
...since you've seen my face?
Hades.
Endless years, l've watched from the underworld...
...and saw your wrath tempered with love.
You created them for one reason...
...so their prayers would fuel our immortality.
But you love them too well.
They've grown strong.
And now I am forced to rise because we are all threatened.
What do you want, brother?
Let me loose upon them.
They will pray again...
...and you will bathe in their awe and fear.
And we will grow strong again.
He belongs in the underworld, not here.
You do not tell me where I belong.
You say it is love that feeds us.
But you depend on their love.
I've only learned to live on their fear...
...their pain.
Zeus, our brother speaks the truth.
Hear him.
Go. Do what you will.
Father, we need the mortals.
ZEUS:
No, Apollo.
Hades is right.
Their insolence has a price.
Like children, they need to be reminded of the order of things.
Set an example, brother.
Turn them on each other...
...and back into our arms.
- Are we the last boat to come in?
MAN 1: No, captain.
You're the only one.
Is he one of ours?
No. We found him off Paxos amongst our dead.
He was the only survivor.
Let the palace figure out what to do with him.
MAN 2:
Squad by four!
MAN 3:
Go on.
MAN 4:
Because if we show the gods our love...
...they shall show us love in return.
They shall.
They gave us the corn in the fields, the sun in the sky.
These are all gifts given to us.
Gifts can be taken away.
This will be taken away...
...if we do not pay love to our gods.
If we do not, we stay in filth and misery, which we have brought upon ourselves.
MAN 5: Move. Out of the way.
PROKOPION: Our gods, we beg for the whip...
The beauty and clarity of servitude.
Man cannot rule man. You defy the gods and you will be punished.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]
Is this all there is?
GENERAL:
We lost many men, Your Majesty...
...but we have victory.
To King Kepheus! To Queen Cassiopeia!
[CROWD CHEERS]
No.
To you...
...our mighty legion.
Our heroes who have dared to strike a blow at the heart of Zeus!
[CROWD CHEERS]
The temples are burning.
The statues have fallen.
We have starved them of our prayers.
Tonight...
...after a generation of struggle...
...the sun does not set over the ocean.
It sets on Olympus itself.
A new era has begun.
The era of man!
[CROWD CHEERS]
That frown doesn't suit you, Andromeda.
Have something to drink.
You'll feel more lively.
Andromeda.
What's your name?
Perseus.
Take this.
Please drink.
DRACO: Hands off.
CASSIOPEIA: Enough.
Our daughter, the missionary.
Have you seen what's happening out there?
Have you even bothered to look?
We serve as an inspiration.
ANDROMEDA: Hundreds of our men have lost their lives...
...yet we celebrate.
You provoke the gods and you act as if there will be no consequence.
Well, what do you want?
Should we be afraid?
Should we be trembling and soiling ourselves in fear?
The gods need us.
They need our worship.
What do we need of them?
- Look at my daughter.
- Don't.
What could be more divine than her face?
More beautiful than all the women of Greece.
More beautiful than Aphrodite herself.
The Olympians should envy her.
- We are the gods now.
- My queen. You're making a spectacle.
[CREATURE SQUAWKING IN DISTANCE]
[WIND BLOWING]
[CHATTERING]
Interesting.
You!
You are specks of dust beneath our fingernails.
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.
You have insulted powers beyond your comprehension.
Who are you?
I am Hades.
Kneel.
Not now, Perseus.
You will have your chance.
HADES:
What do you know of beauty?
What is more beautiful than death?
Gaze upon me, mortal queen.
ANDROMEDA: Mother.
DRACO: Princess.
[ANDROMEDA GRUNTS]
HADES:
In 10 days...
...when the sun is eclipsed...
...I will unleash the Kraken.
Argos will be swept from the earth...
...and all of you with it.
Unless...
...you sacrifice the princess...
...you so foolishly compare to the gods.
Only her blood will sate the Kraken...
...and Zeus...
...who you have so offended.
Choose your penance, Argos.
Destruction or sacrifice.
This is the will of Zeus.
The will of your father.
HERMES:
There is a demigod in Argos.
That is impossible.
He's yours.
His name is Perseus.
We could offer him sanctuary.
Have I heard his prayers?
This son knows no love for me.
He's no different from any of the others who have turned their backs on us.
DRACO:
For the last time, demigod, speak!
- I'm not a demigod.
- Who are you? Why were you sent?
I don't know.
[GRUNTING]
AMMON:
I advise against this, sire.
- He's not to be trusted.
- What would you have me do? Draco.
Leave him.
Is it possible?
If it's true you are the son of Zeus...
...you can save us.
You must save us.
I can't save you. I'm just a man.
My lord, as terrible as it is to utter the words...
...a sacrifice is the only way.
Don't even say the word.
ANDROMEDA:
He's right.
No one should have to die for me.
Let Perseus go.
Sire, we need to get the princess out of the city now.
- I'll find a place to hide her.
- You can't hide from Hades.
So says the bastard son of a god.
My father...
...was killed by a god.
My mother, sister...
...everyone I loved was killed by a god.
I mend nets...
...not wield a sword.
So, demigod, you have a visitor.
She says she knows you.
My name is lo, Perseus.
And how do you know me?
I've watched you all your life.
I guided you to your family.
Are you a god?
There are gods and there are men...
...and there are those of us who are in between.
Many years ago...
...I refused a god's advance.
I was cursed with agelessness.
That's not much of a curse.
I've lived for years watching my loved ones die.
I imagine you're sympathetic to that plight.
Is it true?
Am I the son of Zeus?
Yes.
The story of your birth began with the rebellion of King Acrisius.
Mankind had grown tired of the gods' mistreatment and cruelty.
Acrisius led a siege on Olympus.
It is said the other gods...
...wanted to simply lay waste to Acrisius and his army...
...but Zeus loved man too much.
Instead, he chose to make an example of Acrisius.
He disguised himself as the king...
...and visited the chamber where the king's wife was sleeping.
My king.
Zeus?
[SCREAMS]
IO:
Acrisius grew mad with rage.
He ordered the execution of his wife...
...and Zeus' newborn son.
I curse you, Zeus.
I deny you the body you soiled...
...and the bastard child with it!
[YELLS]
No!
[YELLING]
The queen and her child were cast into the sea.
Your mother was killed, but you...
...part man, part god, you lived.
I've watched over you ever since...
...waiting for the day when you will help bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.
You were born to kill the Kraken.
I don't know why I was born...
...or what I am.
But I know it's not the Kraken
I wanna kill.
How do I get to Hades?
If the Kraken falls...
...Hades will be weak enough for you to strike a deathly blow.
Only then will you have the revenge you seek.
Then they better release me.
[BANGING ON DOOR]
IO:
If the Kraken can be killed...
...the Stygian witches will know how.
The witches are further away than the legion has ever been.
No man can go there.
No man.
Keep your distance, lo.
Zeus, forgive us for these affronts and protect us.
And you still believe they're going to help?
This is suicide.
MAN 1:
And the shields. Come on, boys.
MAN 2:
It's a lost cause.
We've no chance, and you know it.
Here's who you drew into this, Perseus.
An honor guard.
Young men who look good on a reviewing stand...
...and old soldiersV heading towards retirement.
Do you know what the Kraken is?
The Kraken is the end of us.
A colossal, elemental beast.
It doesn't think. It doesn't feel.
Even the gods fear it.
- And you, you're going to kill it?
- Don't come.
- I don't need your help.
- Of course not.
You're the son of Zeus.
- But we have orders.
MAN 3: Come, we need to leave!
Gentlemen, may our journey be long, filled with agony and torment...
...and may we all complain about it bitterly as old men.
- So what should we bring?
- Bring everything.
What makes you think the witches will tell us anything?
Oh, they'll tell us, or I'll kill them too.
[WHIRRING]
MAN 4:
Come on. Let's go, boys.
- What is this?
- Just leave it.
MAN: Don't leave us to the mercy of the gods! Please.
WOMAN 1:
Don't go. Please stay!
Stay here. Please? Please? Help us.
WOMAN 2: You're just going to make the gods angrier. Please.
Just sacrifice the princess!
Watch your mouth! Stay back. Stay back!
You'd think they might be thankful.
WOMAN 3:
You cannot desert us!
Maybe they're tired of being thankful.
OZAL:
Good news!
My brother and I have decided...
...to accompany you on your journey.
- We have enough strangers here.
We can be of great help to you, trust me. You'll need us.
I need soldiers, not hunters.
Which one of your soldiers knows how to cut the impenetrable skin...
...of the Nemean lion?
Which one of them knows the soft points on a centaur's armor?
Which one of them knows which jugular to slice on a five-headed Hydra?
- The middle one.
- The middle one. Good guess.
My brother and I, we know how to kill.
- We enjoy it.
- If you can keep up...
...and you don't mind dying, come along.
It is death who should be afraid of us.
HADES:
King Acrisius.
CALIBOS:
There is no Acrisius.
Just Calibos.
HADES:
We have an enemy in common.
- Zeus.
- Zeus.
HADES:
My brother.
CALIBOS:
What do you want from me?
Zeus' seed in your wife survived.
The child of your shame.
Perseus.
CALIBOS:
He lives?
You murdered your wife for nothing.
Now Perseus hurls himself from Argos to destroy me.
He must die.
- What would you have me do?
- Zeus must think I serve him...
...but I am growing stronger.
Until I possess my full power...
...you will be my weapon.
Come.
Use this.
Kill Perseus for me.
And l'll destroy Zeus for you.
I serve you.
The boy will die.
MAN 1:
How far is it?
MAN 2:
Four days to the witches.
MAN 3:
Four days? I'm tired already.
Here, use this.
Would you like us to wait?
BELO:
Oops.
[BLOWING]
KUCUK:
You really are a fisherman.
You should've seen my father.
You.
Bring your weapon.
Have you handled a sword before?
- There's been no need.
- I see.
Left foot forward.
Your motions should be fluid.
The weapon is a part of you.
Like the sting on a wasp.
Stay focused.
Know what's around you.
Keep your balance at all times.
You fall...
[MEN LAUGHING]
...you die.
Get up.
Don't...
There is a god in you.
Be sure to bring it.
End of lesson.
Perseus.
A gift from the gods.
- Forged on Olympus.
- Why?
Just accept it.
I can do this as a man.
So it's yours.
Gentlemen, retrieve our savior.

No man has ever ridden one.
It's a message.
They're watching us.

Djinn.
I fought them in the legion.
This is their desert.
- Enemies?
- I thought so.
SOLON: They aren't human. Not anymore.
Desert conjurers, cutthroats.
- Well, somebody should thank them.
SOLON: What?
[GROANING]
- What is it?
- Venom. From Hades.
- Pray. Pray to Zeus for strength.
- No. No.
Pray to your damn father.

No.
PROKOPION:
We must turn our hearts to Hades!
It is the only way!
Brothers and sisters!
Come to me! Come!
I have the way out of our misery.
Hades has asked for the princess.
Sacrifice one for the life of the city.
Why do they remain silent while we suffer?
Why do they guard the woman whose death will save us?
Is she better than any one of you?
We have long worshiped Zeus in Argos.
But it is Hades who now offers us salvation.
We must pray to the one who showed us our sin...
...and who offers us redemption...
...through blood.
[CROWD GASPING]
[YELLING]
DRACO:
A bribe for the ferryman.
SOLON:
When they get injured in battle...
...they replace their limbs with charwood and black magic.
They feel no pain.
Live hundreds of years.
So how old is that one?
I don't care. I don't trust them.
You're burning.
Drink this.
I'll get more water.
[YELLING]
Come on!
IXAS:
Look out!
[SPEAKING IN DJINN LANGUAGE]
DRACO:
What?
What's he saying?
The Djinn have waited many years for the one who will free them from the gods.
- He says he is no friend of the humans.
- You don't say.
But the only way we can help Perseus is together.
Draco.
Look.
[DJINN SPEAKS IN DJINN LANGUAGE]
Together.
- He's not ready to travel.
- Time is slipping away, lo.
- He may be a demigod, but he's still mortal.
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, a bit.
- Good.
Your pride is killing my men.
- You were given gifts. Use them.
- Those gifts are a trap!
- I don't care what they are. Use them.
- No.
I will not use that sword or anything that they give me!
So we'll just continue to die.
I can't become like them.
If I do this, I do it as a man.
But you are not just a man.
I choose to be.
A man cannot do this, Perseus.
According to who?
The gods?
If I had your gifts...
When you need your sword, it's in my bag.
They're riding them.
They tried to kill us. I'm not getting on it.
Magnificent.
What are you waiting for?
Well, we need to make up for lost time.
We're making good time.
Not good enough.
The eclipse is drawing near.
IXAS:
How close are we to the Norn Mountains?
DRACO: It'll be two days before we reach the witches.
This thing is making me feel sick.
Trust me, it's better to be on one than in one.
[CHUCKLING]
What, don't you ever smile?
When I spit in the eyes of the gods...
...then l'll smile.
- What is this place?
- The Garden of Stygia.
This is where the Kraken defeated the Titans.
It's what Argos will look like when we fail.
Every step we take is an insult to the gods.
- Good.
- Perseus.
Only ask what you need to know.
Nothing more.
Of course.
ENYO:
Visitors.
PEMPHREDO: Who is it?
DEINO: Visitors.
ENYO:
Got the eye.
DEINO: Give it to me.

DEINO:
The eye. Give it to me.
Perseus, no.
We didn't come here to fight.
- We just have one question.
PEMPHREDO: Young Perseus.
DEINO: Son of Zeus.
PEMPHREDO: So fresh.
ENYO: Perseus.
DEINO: Closer.

So which one's gonna answer my question?
ENYO: You want to know about the Kraken.
DEINO: Kraken?
PEMPHREDO: Do it.
- Kill it.
- That's right.
DEINO: A wasted journey.
The Kraken fears no weapon.
It must have a weakness.
Maybe.
But knowledge demands payment.
- Sacrifice.
ENYO: Sacrifice.

DRACO: Watch out!
SOLON: Look out!
DRACO: Ixas, shoot!
EUSEBIOS: Help!
ENYO: The eye!
PERSEUS: Let him go! Do it!
DEINO: You wouldn't dare.
We cannot see the answers without the eye!
Let him go!
Now answer the question.
How do we kill the Kraken?
- There is a solution.
PEMPHREDO: Solution.
But it is an impossible one.
- Yeah?
- The Gorgon, Medusa.
DEINO:
Medusa.
Anything of flesh is killed by her gaze.
ENYO: Killed by her.
- Her prison lies across the River Styx...
...at the edge of the underworld.
ENYO: A Titan against a Titan.
DRACO: She's no use against the Kraken.
We can't control her.
Then we take her head.
ENYO: Clever boy.
- Now the eye. Give us the eye.
- The eye.
- The eye.
Where is it?
But wait. There's more.
Don't you want to know more?
Perseus, no.
DEINO: Tell him.
PEMPHREDO: Tell him.
What?
ENYO:
Your journey does not end well.
Fate has spoken.
You will die, son of Zeus!
It's a lie. Come.
Written as history.
Perseus.
You will die.
EUSEBIOS:
Why are the Djinn leaving us?
IXAS: They believe we will all die.
It's the prophecy.
Who are you?
Well, you can call me Father...
...if you wish.
- My father's dead.
He was killed by a god.
An unfortunate casualty in a war men brought on themselves.
Men didn't murder my family.
Your brother did.
You heard the witches' prophesy.
You will not defeat the Kraken, much less Hades.
If you continue this journey, you will die, and Argos will still fall.
If you're so sure, why are you here?
To offer you sanctuary.
Your blood is mine, PerseusV and that makes you a god.
It's time you came to Olympus and started living like one.
Rather die in the mud with those men than live forever as a god.
You foolish boy.
Man's entire existence is a gift of my grace.
For someone who created man...
...you don't know much about us.
We live...
...we fight and we die...
...for each other, not for you.
Tell Hades I'll see him soon.
- I will not make this offer again.
- Good.
Because I'd hate to refuse you twice.
Perseus.
Wait.
It's expensive where you're going.
Kucuk fashioned this shield from the Scorpioch.
Stronger and lighter than any metal.
Very rare and high-quality item.
We can fight anywhere...
...but not in the underworld.
Yeah.
Good luck, fisherman.
We all heard what the witches said.
But we can prove them wrong.
I need your help.
It wasn't the gods that saved me up there.
If you believe that we have a chance.
I never liked Argos much anyway.
IO:
I know the way.
Then we go to the underworld.
We kill Medusa.
[GROWLS]
SOLON: Now what?
- We wait for Charon.
Charon only ferries the dead.
Any volunteers?
Heads we swim.
A bribe for the ferryman.
[SPEAKS IN DJINN LANGUAGE]
So, what happens when we get there?
Just another beast to kill.
A beast?
Medusa was beautiful once.
So beautiful as to tempt Poseidon.
When he came for her...
...she ran to Athena's temple thinking that the goddess would protect her.
She didn't.
Poseidon took her on the cold floor.
She prayed to Athena for comfort...
...but the goddess felt nothing but disgust.
She made sure no one would ever want Medusa again.
One look at the creature she has become will turn any living thing to stone.
I cannot assist you there.
A curse prevents me.
It was Athena's one bit of solace to Medusa so that Medusa would never harm a woman.
Only men are allowed in the temple.
Though no man has ever made it out.
[GRUNTING]
Medusa's got a tail and that's how she'll use it.
Listen.
Hear her muscles coil.
Smell her skin.
Feel her hunger in your gut.
Medusa's killed you twice now.
Do you think she'll hand you her head?
She won't be gracious about it.
One look in her eyes and you'll turn to stone.
Good.
- Try not to enjoy this so much.
- I'm trying to help you live.
Don't look at me.
Ease your storm.
[CLEARS THROAT]
SOLON:
We're nearing Medusa's lair.
I never thought I could reach this place.
Who'd you lose?
My daughter.
Taken away on her 16th birthday.
Dragged down here.
I have a feeling l'll see her soon.
You brought us this far.
Let's go the rest of the way.
- How many coins did you get, Perseus?
- Just the one.
I only knew one great man in my life.
My father.
Now I know four more.
And a woman.
And whatever the hell you are.
I know we're all afraid.
But my father told me:
Someday someone was gonna have to take a stand.
Someday someone was gonna have to say enough.
This could be that day.
Trust your senses.
And don't look this bitch in the eye.
- Doesn't really inspire confidence.
- Quiet.
- Listen.
PERSEUS: Eusebios.
Keep your eyes down.
[MEDUSA LAUGHING]
Here we go.
[YELLING]
Solon!
Keep going!
Flank her.
- Draco.
- Go!
Eusebios, follow me.
Hang on!
[SPEAKS IN DJINN LANGUAGE]
[PERSEUS YELLS]
[GRUNTING]
[MEDUSA LAUGHING]
IXAS:
Eusebios.
Remember what Perseus said.
Eyes down.
Ixas, no.
[YELLS]
Eyes down.
Where are you?
PERSEUS:
Eusebios.
[MEDUSA LAUGHING]
Go!
Wait here.
I'll lure her out.
Get ready.
[PERSEUS YELLING]
Now!
Together.
[YELLING]
Let them know men did this.
[SCREAMS]
Just you and me, son of Zeus.
[YELLING]
Perseus.
Don't become one of them.
Io, I'm here.
There's no time.
The eclipse.
Perseus, you must go before it's too late.
I'm not going anywhere.
My fate is certain.
But the fate of Argos is still in your hands.
All my life you've been there.
You never left me.
I can't leave you.
This part of the journey you must do alone.
Perseus...
...you're not just part man, part god...
...you're the best of both.
Everything will be all right.
Brother.
It is time for the mortals to pay.
My child waits to do your will.
ZEUS:
Leave us.
Release the Kraken!
The Kraken comes now!
Our suffering ends when the beast is sated!
Will it take us...
...or will it take Andromeda?
CROWD:
Andromeda!
ANDROMEDA:
It's my name they're calling.
This cannot continue.
MAN 1: Stay back!
MAN 2: Stay back!
Look! The Kraken! Help us!
[CROWD YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
KEPHEUS:
Andromeda!
Hades, we sacrifice our princess in your name.
It comes, brothers and sisters!
[PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
Argos has fallen.
Do you feel stronger, brother?
You thought the Kraken would bring you their prayers.
But the Kraken is my child.
It feeds only me.
I command Olympus.
Remember who you serve.
I serve myself.
I have since you cheated me.
You sent me to the underworld to be hated...
...while you basked in their love.
We need the love of humans.
No, you need it.
I survive on their fear.
Your reign is over, brother Zeus.
You'll watch while my blessed avenger devours their hopes.
And then finally you'll know my pain.
There is still a demigod in Argos...
...brother.
Perseus.
The bag! Come on!
Hyah!
KUCUK:
Hey, fisherman!
[LAUGHING]
Come on!
[PERSEUS YELLS]
No!
[SCREAMS]
I'm a god.
I will live forever.
But not here.
ANDROMEDA:
The boats are coming for us.
For you. Not for me.
You won't stay, will you?
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.
I cannot be a king.
I serve you better as a man.
You'll make a fine queen for them.
ZEUS:
Olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.
As do I.
Hades lives.
He's just sent back to the underworld.
Biding his time, no doubt.
Waiting for men to grow weakV and in their weakness, he grows stronger.
It's mankind who holds the key to Hades' rise.
It always was.
So we'll see him again.
Yes.
But now the world knows a man can stop him.
Of course, you had some help.
A sword, the Pegasus...
I wanted men to worship us again, but I didn't want it to cost me a son.
That's almost human of you.
I don't suppose you'll reconsider my offer to take your place as one of us.
I've got everything I need right here.
You may not want to be a god, Perseus...
...but after feats like yoursV men will worship you.
Be good to them.
Be better than we were.
And if you insist on continuing this mundane human existence...
...I won't have you do it alone.
You're the son of Zeus, after all.
Everyone has an angel.
A guardian who watches over us.
We can't know what form they'll take.
One day, old man.
Next day, little girl.
But don't let appearances fool you.
They can be as fierce as any dragon.
Yet they're not here to fight our battles...
...but to whisper from our heart...
...reminding that it's us.
It's every one of us who holds the power over the worlds we create.
No!
No.
SUCKER PUNCH
We can deny our angels exist...
...convince ourselves they can't be real.
But they show up anyway.
At strange places.
And at strange times.
They can speak through any character we can imagine.
They'll shout through demons if they have to...
...daring us...
...challenging us to fight.
Female. Age 20.
- You're the father?
- Stepfather.
That's right. We talked on the phone.
Okay, come with me.
We're gonna take her into the theater.
Dr. Gorski's gonna want to take a look at her.
She likes to see all the new girls.
Don't worry, Dad.
Everything's gonna be fine.
I've got everything under control around here.
Okay? Come on. Follow me.
So this is what we call the theater.
Liar!
Oh, girls. Yes, go, go.
Hey. Come here.
Girls. Behave.
- Break it up. Break it up.
- Will you stop them?
Lynn.
Amy.
Sit down.
Sit.
Anyway. So the girls use this place to be social.
Dr. Gorski, she uses it to help them deal with their issues.
Polish therapy.
It's quite a show, watching them act out who touched them or beat them.
Dr. Gorski seems to think it helps.
I'm not so sure.
But whether it does or doesn't won't matter much to you.
Once we take care of a little bit of business...
...there won't be any of that for this one.
Good.
She'll be in paradise, if you know what I mean.
And all of your troubles will be over.
Right?
Now, I know we said 1400 on the phone....
I'm taking a really big risk here...
...so it's gonna have to be 2 grand even.
What the hell are you talking about?
We had a deal.
Listen, Father,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
Clearly you're a man that can take care of himself.
I don't know what you did to this girl.
And, frankly, I don't wanna know.
What are you gonna tell the detectives when they come around?
They're gonna love her side of the story.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'm going to start your music.
You are safe.
It's all safe.
Now relax.
And just let go.
Now, here's the other thing:
I don't have a doctor on staff who does lobotomies.
- What?
- But...
...there happens to be one scheduled to come in in five days.
So I'll just forge her signature.
I've done it a dozen times.
It's like we talk about.
You control this world.
I told the police she lost her mind when her mother died.
The truth is a little more complicated.
Let the pain go.
Let the hurt go.
Let the guilt go.
What you're imagining right now...
...that world you control?
That place can be as real as any pain.
I don't want her to remember a thing.
Don't worry, she won't even remember her name when I'm done with her.
Stop.
Get that thing away from me.
Get it away from me.
Where is my mind?
And shut off that damn music.
Undo these straps.
Don't forget my ankles.
Hurry.
Is there a problem, Sweet Pea?
This is a joke, right?
Don't you get the point of this?
It's to turn people on.
I get the sexy little schoolgirl.
I even get the helpless mental patient, right? That can be hot.
But what is this?
Lobotomized vegetable?
How about something a little more commercial, for God's sakes?
Sweet Pea, could you come here, please?
You gotta help me.
I'm the star of the show, remember?
I'll figure something out.
All right, ladies. Wrap it up.
Sweet Pea, I want you to meet somebody. This--
Oh, don't tell me.
The priest brought you here from the orphanage.
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, that's right.
The High Roller is coming for her in five days.
He's gonna, you know, just do a little flower picking.
Can you do me a favor, honey?
Can you show this little baby doll around, give her a tour of the establishment, please?
Blue, please.
You saw the show, okay?
I don't have the time.
Let my sister take her.
Rocket.
Show her around, will you, sis?
All right, come on. Let's go.
Don't worry, I don't bite very hard.
Goodbye, my dear.
- Jesus!
- Oh....
You'll get what you deserve when the High Roller comes!
- Calm down.
- I will not calm down.
- You see what she did? I hope you rot!
- I did. I'm sorry.
This way.
You're gonna be okay. It just takes a little while to get used to.
So how'd you become an orphan?
Oh, I get it. It's complicated, right?
Well, we all have our stories in here.
Mine's...
...complicated.
These are the rooms where we take the clients.
There's fresh towels in all the bathrooms and--
Turn that on.
Blue owns the club.
And we, my dear, heh...
...are the main attractions. Ta-da.
The club's a front for his business.
Guns, gambling, medications, special favors.
He brings in his clients, and we gotta make them feel, you know...
...special.
I don't think she's a problem.
- She looked nice.
- She looked stuck-up to me.
No. She's scared.
I feel sorry for her.
Amber, you feel sorry for everyone.
Do you remember when you first got here?
Nobody felt sorry for you.
Well, don't get too attached to her, okay?
Blue's saving her for the High Roller.
She's no virgin.
Babydoll, that's Amber, Blondie, and you've met my sister, Sweet Pea.
- Watch yourself.
- Come on, just give her a break.
Yeah, she hasn't done anything to you guys.
You best friends now?
Will you just let me finish my tour, please?
Thank you.
Everybody gets a dance, a routine.
We practice, practice, practice, and the men come and watch us perform.
And if they like what they see....
Well, that's why we dance.
Give me that.
Somebody! Help me!
Let her go, pig.
I didn't mean nothing.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Let's just go.
We don't wanna be late.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Two, two, three, four, arms, six, seven, eight. Stop.
Stop.
Where are you right now?
Are you with us or not?
Sweet Pea, take break.
Yeah.
Babydoll.
Come over here.
Come, come.
Let me look at you.
Hm.
You seem fit enough.
I'm going to play you some music, okay?
I want you to just relax.
Feel the music.
Open your heart to it. Let it in.
And when you are ready...
...I want you to dance.
If you do not dance, you have no purpose.
And we don't keep things here that have no purpose.
You see, your fight for survival starts right now.
You don't want to be judged?
You won't be.
You don't think you're strong enough?
You are.
You're afraid. Don't be.
You have all the weapons you need.
Now fight.
Again.
Stand up
You've got to manage
Hello?
- Excuse me, could you help me? I'm--
- Shoes.
I'm sorry?
Your shoes.
You're tracking snow everywhere.
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I take them off?
That time has passed.
What can I do for you?
Nothing. I just--
Let me ask it another way:
What are you looking for?
A way out, I guess.
You guess?
No, I--
I know.
I need to get out of here.
Freedom.
That wasn't so hard, was it?
I'm going to help you to be free.
What do I have to do?
These are your weapons.
When you take them, you begin your journey.
Your journey to freedom.
You will need five items for this journey.
The first is a map.
Then fire, a knife and a key.
You said five things.
The fifth thing is a mystery.
It is the reason. It is the goal.
It will be a deep sacrifice and a perfect victory.
Only you can find it.
And if you do...
...it will set you free.
Oh, and one more thing:
Defend yourself.
What was that?
Seriously, you're gonna have to teach me how to dance like that.
That was crazy.
That was so amazing. I'm, like, shaking.
I've never seen Madame Gorski clap like that before.
Well, get over it.
It's nearly lights out.
She's not easily impressed.
She wasn't impressed.
All that gyrating and moaning.
The dance should be more than just titillation.
Mine's personal. It says who I am.
What the heck does yours say?
It says I'm gonna escape from here.
That I'm gonna be free.
Well, send me a postcard from paradise.
Are you really gonna try to escape?
Yeah. Before the High Roller comes.
- Can I come?
- Me too.
- Yeah, of course.
- You're not going anywhere, Rocket.
I'm gonna do what I wanna do.
No one's ever escaped from here.
You know that.
Yeah. You know, the last three girls that tried died.
And the same thing'll happen to the next fool.
Look, why don't you just listen to my plan?
Don't wanna hear your plan, okay?
None of us do.
What if it's a good plan?
Then she can go through with it.
I'm not letting you get hurt.
- I kept us safe through a lot of shit.
- I know you have.
I'm not gonna get hurt.
I just can't be here anymore.
And if it is a good plan, we're both going.
No, we're not.
You're on your own.
- Well, I've been on my own before.
- Heh.
Sure you have.
Look where that got us.
Baby saved me from the Cook the other day.
What?
I was working in the kitchen and he comes in behind me.
And he pushes me down and he gets on top of me...
...and I can't even move.
And there she was, just like that.
She had a knife to his throat.
She saved me.
The High Roller comes for me in three days.
But I'm getting out of here before he does.
So if you guys wanna come with me, this is how I plan to do it.
Well?
Okay.
If we can collect all four of these items, we can be free.
Okay.
- How do we use them?
- Wait up.
First things first.
How do you plan on getting these things?
Well, whoever has the item we need, we get them to watch me dance.
While we run around and pick their pockets?
- Yeah, that's right.
- But we'd be taking all the risk.
We'd be doing the work while you prance around with an alibi.
No. As long as I'm dancing, they won't even know you're there.
Okay, so the first thing we need is a map...
...to figure out where all the exits are, where the guards are located.
Blue has that in his office.
It's behind his desk.
Right. Good.
Second thing we need is something to start a fire with...
...as a distraction for when we escape.
Plus, the fire should disable all the checkpoints.
And the third thing is a knife...
...in case we run into trouble.
The Cook.
- We can do it.
- Okay.
And the last thing's a key.
Blue wears a key around his neck.
What door does it open?
It's for all of them, I think.
It's a master key.
This plan is crazy.
There's armed guards everywhere, okay?
And if Blue finds out, we're dead.
It's not gonna be, "Oh, sorry, Blue, we won't do it again.".
Because we'll be dead.
We're already dead.
- I'm in.
- So am I.
Me too.
All right.
But I'm only doing this because you guys'd get caught without me, okay?
And if it gets too hairy...
...if I say it's over...
...we stop.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll get the map.
I went for a walk down the railroad track.
Next thing you know, some--
- What do you want?
- She's dancing.
Who is dancing?
Your baby doll.
One pill makes you larger
One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
Baby.
Baby.
He's coming.
He's gonna start the briefing.
All right, here's the drill:
The Germans are preparing a report for the kaiser. It's a map.
How do we intercept it?
You're gonna cross no man's land, enter the enemy trenches...
...and take the map from the field commander's bunker...
...before the courier can reach the zeppelin.
Sounds like fun.
Oh, and I've arranged something special for Amber.
Get you out of there when you're done.
Let's go.
German doctors and engineers...
...have worked out how to return their fallen to the front lines.
They're using steam power and clockworks to keep them moving.
So don't feel bad about killing them.
They're already dead.
Remember, ladies:
If you don't stand for something...
...you'll fall for anything.
Oh, and one last thing:
Try and work together.
Son of a--
Come on, guys. The bunker's this way.
- Cover!
- Rocket!
Sweet Pea! Help!
Unh. Sweet Pea!
Rocket.
Are you okay?
It's right here.
Rocket. That's enough.
Wow.
- Very good.
- Hm.
- Nice work.
- Thanks.
Very good.
Okay, this gives me an idea.
What about a private dance for the Mayor.
What?
Nothing touchy-feely, just something to get him wound up.
Get him ready to spend some money.
All she has to do is do what she did just now.
That is out of the question.
She is not ready. It is too raw.
Did you just say she's not ready?
She doesn't have a costume.
There is no set.
Honey, she doesn't need that bullshit.
She's perfect.
Perhaps.
But that is not for you to decide, that is for me to decide.
Oh.
It's my show, and I say she's not ready.
Clearly, I've offended you, and I apologize.
Thank you.
Here's the thing:
This show might be yours...
...but the girls and you...
...are mine.
Right?
You're mine.
And if you need a stronger reminder of that, you let me know, okay?
That won't be necessary.
So with or without your blessing, she's gonna be on that stage tomorrow?
- I'll see what I can do.
- Attagirl.
- Mm-hm.
- All right.
You look fantastic, by the way.
Big show, girls.
Thank you.
- For what?
- The Cook.
- It was nothing.
- Shut up.
No one takes a risk for anyone in here.
So thank you.
You're welcome.
You got family?
No.
Oh, that's right.
I forgot, you're an orphan.
I ran away from mine.
I thought I was pretty smart at the time, but....
Sweet Pea followed.
Which is crazy, because she never even had a real problem with Mom and Dad.
She just cares about you a lot.
Have you just ever wanted to just take something back?
You know, something you said.
Something you did.
All the time.
Amber?
The Mayor comes tonight.
I've never seen him without a big stogie in his mouth.
Ugh. I hate those cigars.
I can never get that stink out of my hair.
- What?
- It's you.
- You have to get his lighter.
- I'm not doing that.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Come on, be reasonable.
There's got to be another way, or someone else who can do it.
He's your client.
Yeah, but what if I screw it up?
You can do this.
Well, he keeps it here, you know.
In his breast pocket.
So then you do the good old kiss-the-neck...
...rub-his-chest...
...reach in...
...and bam...
...you're gold.
Yeah.
Kiss the neck.
- He'll like that.
- Heh, heh.
Gentlemen. Welcome.
We have a new girl for you tonight.
Something extra special.
It is a work-in-progress...
...so I apologize in advance for the raw nature of the performance.
I will say, however...
...that is part of the charm.
It is my pleasure to introduce to you...
...this little baby doll.
Okay. This is how it's gonna go.
Amber will keep the bird on station.
Blondie, you'll operate the 50 cal here and the 30 down there.
The rest of you, drop into the courtyard and kill the creatures in your way.
Now, when you reach the nest, you'll find the baby.
You'll have to slit its throat.
Down inside its neck are two crystals...
...that, when struck together, produce the most magnificent fire you'll ever see.
Amber...
...put us on approach.
Roger that. Starting my run.
Nice.
Remember:
Don't ever write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass.
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.
Don't wake the mother.
Here we go, ladies.
Go! Go! Go!
Whoa!
To the castle!
I got an idea.
Hold on!
Take that, you ugly mother.
Amber, where is she?
Check our 6. I don't see her.
Blondie, keep your eyes peeled.
I'll kill yo--
She's all yours, Baby.
I can't believe I did it.
Damn, that girl can dance.
See what you can do?
Wow, Amber.
Check it out.
- Halfway home.
- Yeah.
Let me see it.
- It's just like I said:
- Oh.
You kiss the neck, it works every time.
- Good job.
- How'd we do?
Nice. Here.
- And he didn't even notice.
- No. No idea.
Good work, Amber.
- Thanks, Baby.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers?
What are we celebrating?
Huh?
Who should I be congratulating?
It was just Babydoll's first time on stage.
You know how scary that can be.
Yeah.
The bond of the theater.
Hm?
I mean, what else could it be?
I mean, it's not like any of you have anything to hide, is it?
No.
It's not like anyone was in my office...
...messing with my shit.
No. It's not like people are missing things.
You know, small little objects here and there.
No. No, that would be outrageous.
That would be crazy.
Right?
Because we have such an obvious explanation for this exuberance.
It's the fraternity of performers.
It's the adrenaline from the curtain rising.
Maybe this is my fault.
You know, maybe I've just become too familiar with you girls.
Maybe I need to make an example of someone.
Re-establish the parameters of our relationship. What do you think?
Blondie, girls?
And what about you?
Huh?
Oh.
You think you're special, don't you?
Well, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
If I was not about to make a small fortune on you with the High Roller...
...I would--
It saddens me that I have to resort to threats with you girls.
I thought we were past that.
I just-- I need this bullshit to stop!
Out of mutual respect.
Let's get things back to how they were.
Well....
So much for that little experiment.
What are you saying?
I'm saying it's over.
Right, Baby?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Blue's onto us.
We had a deal.
If I say it's over, it's over.
We're this close, though.
We can't just stop.
Did you not hear Blue?
He knows we're up to something.
He knows what we're doing.
If he catches us for real, it won't be a lecture. You saw him.
Sweet Pea. Rocket is right.
The High Roller comes tomorrow.
If we can just stick with the plan
- till then--
- No! You're screwed.
We're out.
Rocket...
...we're out.
I'm finishing this.
We are all finishing this.
You know it's the only way we can get out of here.
You're gonna choose her...
...someone you barely know...
...over me?
After all I've sacrificed for you.
I'm sorry.
Blondie?
What are you doing down there?
Are you all right?
I'm sorry, it's nothing.
What? What's wrong?
- Did someone hurt you?
- No, it's not like that.
- It's really nothing.
- Clearly...
...it is not nothing.
Hey.
You can tell me. I am good listener.
Madame Gorski...
...please.
I know that look.
You think you're all alone, and that no one can help you.
There is a way to fix anything.
Now...
...tell me what is wrong, child.
Okay.
Promise you can keep a secret?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know.
We need your music.
You know what, forget it.
No, it's too late. Sweet Pea was right.
What are you talking about?
The three of us, we can--
I don't think we can do this.
I don't wanna do something stupid that's gonna put you guys in danger.
I'm sorry.
Hey, we got this far, right?
I mean, that's something not a lot of people could have done.
How bad can the High Roller be, anyway?
Don't you girls have some work you should be doing?
- You came to help us.
- No.
I came to keep you from getting killed.
Thank you.
We don't have a lot of time.
If you're done with the pleasantries, you got a dance to do.
Amber, radio.
What the hell are you doing?
You're gonna wanna watch this.
Turn off your mind
Relax and float downstream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining
Ladies, this is what's on our dance card for tonight.
The bomb, code-named "Kitchen Knife," is on a hijacked train.
It is protected by a couple dozen mechanized gunmen.
The idea is simple:
Take care of the gunmen, deactivate the bomb, then steal it.
The code numbers for the bomb and the jetpacks for your escape are in that duffel.
Got it.
Sweet Pea.
I'm glad you changed your mind.
Well, there you have it.
You know, for those who fight for it...
...life has a flavor the sheltered will never know.
Oh, yeah. One last thing.
The bomb's timer is set to detonate when it reaches the city.
So if I were you, I'd hurry!
Weapons hot, ladies.
Hot.
- Hot.
- Hot.
I've got a lock.
Good luck.
- We're down.
- Copy that.
Warning:
Weapon will activate in four minutes,
15 seconds.
- Warning:
- Codes!
Weapon will activate in four minutes, 10 seconds.
Warning: Weapon will activate in four minutes, five seconds.
A deactivation procedure has been initiated.
Deactivation procedure complete.
Weapon deactivated.
Whoa!
Hurry, Amber.
We gotta get this thing out of here.
On my way.
Please refer to the operations manual.
For details on....
Amber, she's good.
I'm taking her out.
Guys, it's caught on something.
Hold up. We missed one.
Override procedures complete.
Weapon active.
Proximity warning.
Proximity warning.
Amber, the bomb's active.
Weapon will activate in 45 seconds.
Get free.
Whoa!
- Rocket, let's go.
- Warning:
Weapon will activate in 25 seconds.
It's broke. It's not gonna work.
I'm on full burn. We'll go together.
It's not gonna carry the both of us.
- We have to try.
- Okay, we'll try.
But you've gotta promise me two things.
Rocket, let's go.
- The first thing is...
- Weapon will activate in 15 seconds.
...don't get mad about this.
About what?
This.
Rocket!
Weapon will activate in 10, nine...
...eight, seven, six...
...five, four...
...three, two, one.
The second thing is...
...when you get home...
...when you get free...
...you tell Mom I love her.
- I'll tell her.
- Mom.
I promise.
Oh, my.
You, what did you do?
You simple, inbred idiot.
Sir, don't know what happened. I just--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Get her up. Get her up, CJ!
Yes. Yeah, look.
I want you to look at what you did.
Look at what you did, you bitch!
Amber, sweetheart.
You've got Sweet Pea's slot in tonight's show. Go get ready.
Go get ready.
Go!
Take her to the closet.
As for you...
...it's showtime.
The High Roller is here.
I need you to focus for me.
Ah. Thank you.
Girls?
Can you just gather around for a second?
I wanna say a few words.
That's all right.
You can just finish getting her dressed.
Okay. There we go.
Very nice.
All right.
I try to give you all...
...a good life.
I try. I do.
And all I ask for in return is just for...
...respect...
...honesty.
You know-- Oh, that's okay, Margaret.
A give-and-take relationship.
But it's come to my attention--
It's come to our attention...
...that a few bad eggs...
...led by one little egg in particular...
...have spit in the face of that generosity...
...and are plotting against me.
Me.
Your friend.
Your protector.
Your employer.
Plotting to take from me my most precious possessions.
Blue, what you doing?
- Hm?
- You got the information. You have won.
This little fantasy of freedom is all they have.
No, no, no. No one's buying that, honey. No one's buying that, Vera.
There is nothing you can do to--
- Unh.
- You listen to me, you old whore.
It's too late to play the good guy.
It's far too late.
You're suddenly not aware of what it is we do here?
I teach them to survive you.
- All right.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say anything.
I'm sorry.
No, Blondie.
I didn't mean to.
He said everything would be okay.
Blue, this is a mistake.
Please don't do this, okay?
That's right.
Our dear Blondie came to us...
...desperately trying to help her sisters off this most dangerous path.
At first, we didn't even believe her.
But after hearing who was involved, frankly, it started to make sense.
- Right here?
- Blue.
Uh-huh. "Map. Fire."
Looks like that chicken was counted a little before it hatched.
Ain't that right, Amber?
You have anything to say? Anything?
Blue, we didn't-- We were still--
You know what, sweetheart?
It's okay.
It's okay.
No!
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, calm down.
This will all be over soon and we can get back to business as usual.
Blondie, I wanna thank you for everything you've done.
I am so sorry.
The thing is, we hate snitches, so....
No!
Okay. Here.
I hate guns.
I hope everyone's learned a valuable lesson here.
Especially you, Madame Gorski.
Get her out of here.
And the rest of you, you got a show to do. So go on, go get them, girls.
Make it count.
I've been thinking a lot...
...about all that money you're gonna make me.
And you'd think that would give me pleasure.
I mean, I'm in the business of pleasure.
But you know what it makes me feel like?
I'm gonna be honest with you. It makes me feel like I'm this little boy...
...sitting in the corner of the sandbox...
...while everybody gets to play with my toys...
...but me.
So you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take my toys and I'm gonna go home.
Oh, is that it?!
Is that all you got?!
Come here!
Come on.
Did you lose your fight? Huh?
No.
I just found it.
You'll never have me.
Ever.
- Sweet Pea.
- Where's Amber and Blondie?
It's just us now.
We have to go, Sweet Pea. Come on.
- That's it.
- Okay.
- Now what?
- Wait for it.
Come on.
Damn it.
This can't be.
We did everything right.
A map, fire, a knife, a key, and one thing more.
One thing more.
It's me.
What?
Oh, it's me. Of course it's me.
It's the only way this ever could have ended.
What do you mean?
I'm saying you go home.
Go home to your family.
You tell your mom what Rocket said.
Make her happy.
Go out and live a normal life...
...love...
...be free.
You have to live for all of us now.
- Baby, no. You can't do that.
- Yes, Sweet Pea.
You're the strongest.
You're the only one of us that ever had a chance out there.
You going home and living, that's how we win.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's better this way.
Now listen.
I'm gonna walk out there...
...and when they come after me, you go, okay?
There's gotta be another way.
No.
This is right.
This was never my story.
It's yours.
Now, don't screw it up, okay?
You stay off the roads and you find a bus station, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
Where you going, sweetheart?
I said, where you going?
Jesus.
Did--?
Did you see the way she looked at me?
Just in that last moment.
It was like....
Doctor?
Is it done?
Dr. Gorski, what do you know about this one?
Uh, there was something very peculiar.
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her into a deep depression.
And then in a fit, she accidentally killed her sister.
Poor child.
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.
Yes, but you recommended the procedure.
Oh, I'm afraid not.
I will admit she has been quite a handful.
In just one week here, she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...
...and helped another patient to escape.
But I don't agree with this solution, doctor.
But why would you sign for a procedure you don't agree with?
Well, I--
That is your signature, is it not?
I've been doing this for quite some time, doctor...
...and to be honest with you,
I've wondered myself whether or not it's right.
And I have seen some tortured souls in here. Believe me.
But this one....
Something in her eyes.
I've never seen anyone that....
It's the way she looked at me.
It's like she wanted me to do it.
I hope it helps her.
Hi.
You remember me?
Listen. Listen,
I got a bad feeling, okay?
These boys do too.
This is not the way we should be running this place.
We don't run the place. I run it.
In the chair.
Look...
...I'm not....
- I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
- I'm not doing this.
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.
I need her in that chair.
Put her in the goddamn chair!
Thank you.
Close the door, please.
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no.
You're still here.
You're here with me.
In all this shit.
And you don't go away unless I say so.
Okay?
That's not right.
That's not right.
You come back to me.
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?
- Move away from the girl.
- Aah! Aah!
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Aah!
What in God's name have you been doing up here?
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.
She's gone. Look at her face!
She's not here.
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.
I look out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.
Tell them!
Get him out of here.
- Now.
- Aah! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.
I'll tell you everything.
I'll tell you--
I'll tell you about the money.
Just keep going down the hall.
You all right, miss?
Miss?
And finally, this question:
The mystery of whose story it will be...
...of who draws the curtain.
Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance?
Who drives us mad...
...lashes us with whips...
...and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible?
Who is it...
...that does all these things?
Bus 22 southbound to Fort Wayne will now begin loading.
Please have your tickets ready to show the driver.
Excuse me, miss?
Miss, can we have a word?
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.
- We understand.
- Do you?
That young woman's been on this bus since Hartford.
I don't see what she could possibly know about anything happening around here.
Is that true, miss?
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.
- All right.
- Oh, and one more thing.
- She's been a joy the entire journey.
- Yes, I said, all right.
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.
You have yourself a nice trip now.
It's no problem.
- I don't have a ticket.
- I know. It's okay.
Go find a seat in the back.
Try and get some sleep.
We got a long way to go.
Thank you.
Who honors those we love with the very life we live?
Who sends monsters to kill us...
...and at the same time sings that we'll never die?
Who teaches us what's real and how to laugh at lies?
Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend?
Who chains us?
And who holds the key that can set us free?
It's you.
You have all the weapons you need.
Now fight.
Once upon a time, in deep winter,
a queen was admiring the falling snow
when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
Reaching for it, she pricked her finger
and three drops of blood fell.
And because the red seemed so alive against the white
she thought, "If only I had a child as white as snow,
"lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings
"and all with the strength of that rose."
Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen
and was named,
"Snow White."
And she was adored throughout the kingdom
as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty.
We found it in the woods.
It's injured, Mother.
It must have broken its wing.
Don't worry, it will heal in time.
I'll look after it.
You possess a rare beauty, my love.
In here.
Never lose it.
It will serve you well when you become queen.
Be careful you don't fall.
I'm just getting you an apple.
Here you go.
Thank you.
William!
The next winter was the harshest in memory and Snow White's mother passed away.
The King was inconsolable.
Taking advantage of his grief, a dark and mysterious army appeared and lured him into battle.
What devil spawned this army?
Send them back to hell!
No prisoners!
The dark army was defeated, but what would soon come to pass was far darker.
Sire!
A prisoner.
Fear not, you will come to no harm from me or my men.
What is your name, my lady?
Ravenna, sire.
So enchanted by her beauty was the King that he forgot, for the first time, his broken heart and the very next day, she would become his wife.
You're so beautiful.
That's kind, child.
Especially when it is said that yours is the face of true beauty in this kingdom.
Come.
This all must be difficult for you.
I, too, lost my mother when I was a young girl.
I can never take your mother's place.
Never.
But I feel that you and I are bound.
I feel it there.
Your heart.
You will be the ruin of me.
Indeed, my lord.
I was ruined by a king like you once.
I replaced his queen, an old woman.
And, in time,
I, too, would have been replaced.
Men use women.
They ruin us and when they are finished with us they toss us to the dogs like scraps.
What have you given me?
When a woman stays young and beautiful forever, the world is hers.
First, I will take your life, my lord.
And then
I'll take your throne.
Welcome, brother.
My queen.
She had tricked her way into the kingdom with a phantom army.
She now welcomed a very real one.
William!
Snow, get out! Snow!
I can't leave!
The Princess!
No!
Get out of here! Go!
William! Don't leave me!
Father, we must go back!
We must!
No!
We've lost her!
No! No! No!
Don't leave me!
William!
Out.
Out!
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?
It is you, my queen.
Yet another kingdom falls to your glory.
Is there no end to your power and beauty?
The remnants, my queen.
What do we do with them?
To the sword.
Finn.
Lock her up.
One never knows when royal blood may be of value.
So poisonous was the reign of Ravenna, that nature turned on itself and people turned on each other.
The land died and with it, hope.
And all that time, she kept Snow White imprisoned high up in the north tower.
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Hello?
What is your name?
I am Greta.
What happened to you?
All the girls in our village were taken.
I was trying to reach Duke Hammond's castle when I was caught.
Duke Hammond?
Is he alive?
Does he still fight in my father's name?
You're the King's daughter.
The night the King died, we were told all in the castle were slain.
And William?
Is the Duke's son still alive?
I don't know, Princess.
What will they do to me?
Do you remember when we were children begging for scraps like those wretches?
Yes, sister.
Am I not kinder?
Yes.
These two were captured leading an ambush on one of our supply trains.
Your son?
Handsome.
Obviously, a debt owed to your mother.
There was a time
I would have lost my heart to a face like yours.
And you, no doubt, would have broken it.
Lain, no!
You would kill your queen?
Such courage.
Such beauty.
But how strong is your heart?
No. My son.
My son!
Leave him.
Let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his queen.
Out.
Out!
Magic comes at a lofty price.
And the expense grows.
You look...
Old.
Tired.
My power fades.
I have something for what ails you.
Oh.
Greta?
Greta?
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is fairest of them all?
My queen, on this day, one has come of age fairer even than you.
She is the reason your powers wane.
Who is it?
Snow White.
Snow White?
She is my undoing?
I should have killed her when she was a child.
Be warned.
Her innocence and purity is all that can destroy you.
But she is also your salvation, Queen.
Take her heart in your hand and you shall never again need to consume youth.
You shall never again weaken or age.
Immortality.
Immortality forever.
Finn!
Brother, bring me the King's daughter.
Did I wake you?
Are you always awake when I watch you?
You've never come in before.
My sister won't allow it.
She wants you all to herself.
I'm afraid of her.
And not of me?
No.
Fear not, Princess.
You will never again be locked in this cell.
What does she want from me?
Your beating heart.
Get me out of here!
No!
Greta?
Go.
Get me out of here!
No!
Go.
No!
Stop her!
Catch her!
Seize her!
Get to the gate!
Bring her back to me!
How is it that an innocent young girl makes a fool of my brother?
Armed only with a nail.
If she'd had a sword, she would have taken my kingdom.
"Bring me the King's daughter," and you let her slip right through your tiny little fingers.
How?
You swore that you would protect me!
You swore!
Now there's no one
I can trust.
No one.
There's no loyalty, no loyalty.
None, not even from you!
Where is she?
She was chased into the Dark Forest, where the men lost her.
She's no good to me in the Dark Forest, lost!
I need her heart!
You failed me, Finn!
Have I not given all to you!
Have I not given you all?
Yes, sister.
Quiet.
I have no powers in the Dark Forest.
You have to find me someone.
Someone who knows it.
Someone who can hunt her.
You owe me money from my pocket and money for the girl.
Well, you know,
I seem to have drunk it all, but you're welcome to it when it comes out again.
You've gone too far.
I want my money!
Here it is!
The Queen demands your presence.
Can't you see
I'm having a bath?
Trust me on this, sister.
All right! All right!
Hey!
My brother tells me you are a widower.
A drunkard.
And one of few who has ventured into the Dark Forest.
Aye.
One of my prisoners has escaped there.
Then he's dead.
She.
She is certainly dead.
Find her.
Bring her to me.
No, I've been to that forest.
I'm not going back.
You will be rewarded handsomely.
What good is gold to me if I'm lying dead with the crows picking at my eyes?
Why is she of such value?
That is none of your concern.
I'll determine what concerns me, thank you.
You will do this for me, huntsman!
And if I refuse?
Do me the favor,
I beg of you.
To his knees.
So you wish to be reunited with your beloved?
You do not speak of my wife.
You miss her.
What would you give to see her again?
You know of my powers.
Bring me the girl and I will bring back your wife.
Nothing can bring her back.
I can.
A life for a life.
She can't have gone far.
All right, do exactly as I do.
It's a bad idea.
Stay here.
Come here.
No!
Will you help me?
Please, the Queen is going to kill me.
Sure she is.
She's going to rip out my heart.
Quick work.
Hey.
Well done, huntsman.
Hand her over.
What do you intend to do with her?
Why do you care?
You want her... Hey!
Give me what
I was promised.
You did your job well.
Now, keep your word.
He'll kill us both.
Shut up.
He will.
I said, shut up.
No, no.
I'll keep my word when the Queen keeps hers.
Where's my wife?
He's going to betray you.
My sister has many powers.
She can take life away, or sustain it, but she can't bring your wife back from the dead, you fool!
I want her back!
I will find you!
Quiet. All right?
Hey, what the hell's going on?
Who are you?
Why does the Queen want you dead?
She wants everyone dead, all of us.
What makes you so damn valuable?
You should know, you're the one hunting me.
Forget it.
I should have never got involved in the Queen's business.
What did I get in?
Stupid...
Where are you going?
Getting away from you.
You're trouble, is what you are.
I need to get to the Duke's castle.
There's an army there.
Oh, the Duke's army?
Bunch of farmers and milkmaids with pitchforks.
I know sheep that have more fight in them.
I'm valuable.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
If you return without me, you're dead.
If you leave me,
I'm dead.
Just for argument's sake, how much reward?
However much is enough.
At least thirty gold pieces...
A hundred.
Help me.
Who are you?
Maybe you should have asked the Queen that.
I don't trust you.
I've given you my word.
I still don't trust you.
But you have a deal.
Give me that, before you lose a finger.
She killed my brave lain with just the palm of her hand and then she drew a dagger from her side with no blood.
She cannot be killed.
But there is more.
The Princess is alive.
Where is my son?
We have word of the Princess.
Ravenna has kept her, all these years.
She lives?
She escaped the castle, into the Dark Forest.
I'm going after her.
We don't know if she survived.
William!
What?
You ventured beyond the castle walls again, disobeying my orders.
We're all that's left, don't you understand?
I cannot afford to lose any more of my men.
I'm going alone.
I will not lose my only son.
You don't know the Dark Forest.
Then I'll find somebody who does.
I will not abandon her a second time.
The forest gains its strength from your weakness.
Do you drink to drown your sorrows?
Or your conscience?
What concern is it of yours, why I drink?
I suppose a man's sorrows are his own.
What does a young girl like you know about sorrow?
Don't flatter yourself.
Now stay close.
You men know the dark forest?
Load and prepare.
You ride for
50 gold pieces.
Does it not trouble you to serve her?
Who the Queen?
I serve no one.
Especially that old hag, and any other royalty.
They're all damned.
The King and his true queen are not damned.
The King?
He's the one that let the devil in the door.
It's his fault the kingdom's plunged into darkness.
From you?
You know nothing.
What? And you do?
What's a wee scrod like you care about the King anyway?
You're barely old enough to remember him.
The land is diseased.
Nature is upturned.
This, this is the legacy of your precious king.
Do you need a bowman?
I have a bowman.
Kill him.
I said, do you need a bowman?
Here, I want to show you something.
Which is your lead foot?
If someone comes at you, you raise this arm up and you block, and use their strength against them.
You're small, so wait until they're close and you drive it through their heart to the hilt.
You understand?
Do not hesitate.
You look in their eyes and do not pull it out until you see their soul.
I couldn't do that.
Well, you might not have a choice.
We have their trail.
Move on. Move on!
Wait.
Is this the edge of the Dark Forest?
Aye.
What is it?
Troll!
Go!
Run!
I told you to run.
If I had, you would be dead.
Only demons or spirits pass through the Dark Forest. Which are you?
We're fugitives from the Queen.
We mean you no harm.
Where are all the men?
Gone.
Have you got nothing to drink?
You have traveled far and carried a great burden.
I've had worse jobs.
Anyway, she's not that heavy.
You don't know who she is.
What do you mean?
Why? Who is she?
Maybe it needs a skirt, or a dress or something?
That's nice.
How about a face?
Your mother wants to see you.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I'd think it was too difficult a task?
You would be right.
I didn't trust you.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Our scars protect us.
Without beauty, we are worthless to the Queen.
It's a sacrifice we made so we could raise our children in peace while their fathers are at war.
And you, your sacrifice will come.
You must rest.
How can you desert her when you know the truth?
Aye, I know the truth.
That's why she should be as far away from me as possible.
Anything I ever cared about was taken away from me.
Not this time.
She's safer here with you.
Lily! Lily, come on!
Come on!
Run, rats, run!
Find her!
Come on!
Get in the boats!
Get in the boats!
Lily!
In there, baby.
There you go.
Come on!
No! No!
Come on! Let's go!
No! We have to help them!
You will. Go.
Come on!
Go!
Your beauty is all that can save you, Ravenna.
This spell will make your beauty your power and protection.
By fairest blood it is done.
Here. Drink, drink!
But, be warned.
By fairest blood, this spell can be undone.
Avenge us!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're not.
I am.
You left us.
We should never have been there.
Hey, look at me.
I'll take you to
Duke Hammond's, okay?
All right?
You have my word.
Wait!
This is our lucky day.
Oh, no. Dwarves.
The hedge-pig I loathe most in the world lands right in our lap.
Come on, Beith.
Is this how you treat a friend?
Oh! No, no, no, you puttock.
This is how
I treat a friend.
She's pretty.
And who's this?
Is this an errant apprentice or captive?
This man is helping me.
We should kill them both.
He's caused us nothing but trouble.
Skewer him and leave her to rot.
I don't like killing girls.
I do.
Good.
Leave her alone, Duir.
He's got nothing.
One silver coin and an empty codpiece.
Two days we sat here.
What for?
Nothing.
We should have stayed by the river.
What a waste of time!
Cut us down, Beith.
I have gold I can pay you.
It's not here, it's hidden back in the woods.
Shut your ugly mug, huntsman.
If you had any pennies, you would have pissed it away on mead by now.
Cut us down, then I'll show you.
Pull the other one, you lying dangler.
Tell them the truth, huntsman.
There's no time!
I have to take this girl to Hammond's.
She's not safe here.
Well, my little heart bleeds for you.
We should chop them up and feed them to the wolves.
Yeah. Yes!
Who is she?
She's worth a lot of gold to me.
Which I am happy to share with you stupid little dwarves.
Stop that!
Gold is worth nothing to any of you if you're all dead!
The Queen's men hunt us!
They're very close!
Shut up!
You have love for the Queen?
We have no love for the Queen.
Then you fight against her?
No one fights against the Queen.
We lost everything when the King died.
We fight only for ourselves!
Yes.
My father was King Magnus.
Muir, does she speak the truth?
Yes. She is of the blood.
She is destined, Beith.
I see an end to the darkness.
Riders!
They found us!
If you don't cut us down, we'll all be killed!
I don't like this, Beith.
It smells like trouble.
You'll find your weight in gold if you cut us down, now!
Shut up, Princess.
Queen's riders!
And they're coming this way!
We'll take her, but not him!
What?
No, both of us!
Cut them both down, Gort!
Let's get the hell out of here!
Move it! Move it!
They're close.
Blasted fairy music.
Yeah.
Good thing there's plenty of moss about.
Where are we?
They call it Sanctuary, my lady.
It's the home of the fairies.
Fairies.
Clear!
Coll?
Clear!
Set up camp!
Gus. Quert.
Make the fire.
Gort, your mug.
Play louder, you whey-face,
I can still hear them harpy fairies.
Duir, would you really have killed her?
Yeah.
Of course.
That seat's not taken, if that's what you were about to ask.
I want to thank you.
It's only a log.
There's no need to thank me.
No, for before.
For defending me.
Ah. Your father was a good man.
The kingdom prospered.
Our people prospered.
There were more of you.
Aye.
Yeah.
The men you see before you and many, many more, went deep into the caves.
We were noble gold miners because we could see the light in the darkness.
Gus. Gus?
You were just a boy, but you remember.
When we returned to the surface, there was nothing.
The land was blackened.
Everything, everyone was gone.
Was dead.
That was the month your father died.
I'm very sorry.
As am I, Princess.
As am I.
Son, play a happy song.
Why spend your leisure
Bereft of pleasure
Amassing treasure
Why scrape and save?
Why look so canny
At ev'ry penny?
You'll take no money within the grave
I know I'm a bit gicky, but would you care for a dance?
I'd be honored, Gus.
Our glasses clinking
And round and round
Is iomaj slj sin
Do bhjos ag daoine
Ag cruinniu pjosaj
Is ag d閍namh st骾r
So, lads and lasses
Because life passes
Come fill your glasses for another round
I don't trust her, and I don't believe her.
No matter what Muir says.
I feel peculiar.
Queer almost.
What? Since when?
I'm tingling all over, but I feel lovely.
I feel lovely.
How's your gout?
Gout?
It's a bit better.
And my cough.
You know, this is her doing.
How much have you had to drink?
No, it was the mushrooms.
Send a log downstream.
With hump for tramel
The scripture's camel
Still fleecing us out of our bevvy, huntsman?
What do you say we let bygones be bygones?
Not yet, nut-hook.
Hug.
Come fill your glasses for another round
Is iomaj slj sin
Do bhjos ag daoine
So what's in it for you?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the girl.
Come fill your glasses for another round
Is it really just the gold?
I'm not sure, Beith.
If I had any sense,
I'd have abandoned her long ago.
Muir says she's destined.
Question is, huntsman, for what?
Hmm?
Get up.
Father? What was that?
Father?
I know, son, I know.
It's him.
No, no, no, huntsman.
No one's ever seen this before.
The white hart bows before the Princess, Father.
He's blessing her.
What are you talking about?
You have eyes, huntsman, but you do not see.
You, who have been with her the longest.
She is life itself.
She will heal the land.
She is the one.
Can't you feel it?
Are your ailments not gone?
Gold or no gold, where she leads,
I follow.
Aye.
I'm with you.
Yes, Father.
Ambush!
Aim low! Aim low!
Coll, Duir, take him.
Gus, go with her.
Stay with me.
Don't you wait for me.
You first.
I know.
Go. That way.
Go, go!
No, no, it's me!
It's William.
It's William.
I admire your fight, huntsman.
Your wife was the same.
What do you know of my wife?
I remember them all.
But especially the ones with fight.
She screamed your name, but you weren't there.
Now, you can beg her forgiveness in the Otherworld.
Sister, heal me.
Forgive me, brother.
I feel...
Arrow!
Gus. Gus!
Gus, breathe.
Gus, breathe.
I won't leave you, miss.
We used to have pride.
And now we just pilfer and drink and dream about when we didn't.
Every man here would die for the chance of becoming that man again.
So, we follow you, Princess, in life and in death.
And we shall have our pride again.
On Gus's soul, this I swear.
Dark the stars
And dark the moon
Hush the night
And the morning loon
Tell the horses
And beat on your drum
Gone their master
Gone their sun
Dark the oceans
Dark the sky
Hush the whales
And the ocean tide
Tell the salt marsh
And beat on your drum
Gone their master
Gone their sun
Dark to light
And light to dark
Three black carriages
Three white carts
What brings us together's
What pulls us apart
Gone our brother
Gone our heart
I'm sorry I left you.
You didn't.
If I'd have thought you were alive,
I would have come for you.
We were children, William.
You're here now.
Hush the whales
And the ocean tide
Tell the salt marsh
And beat on your drum
Gone their master
Gone their sun
Here.
She hasn't changed.
She has that same light inside her.
You must see it.
You'd be blind if you didn't.
Thought about her every day since I lost her.
I can hardly believe
I found her.
You should tell her how you feel.
It'd be good for her.
No.
I wouldn't know how.
Your not telling someone something like that and living with the regret is a lot worse.
William.
It's as if nothing's changed here.
The world seems beautiful again.
It will be, when you are queen.
The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna with every fiber.
I used to hate her.
But now I feel only sorrow.
Once people find out you're alive, they will rise up in your name.
It takes more than a name.
You are your father's daughter.
The rightful heir.
If I had a choice,
I'd take you far away.
Keep you safe by my side.
But I have a duty.
And so do you.
How do I inspire?
How will I lead men?
The way you led me when we were children.
I followed you everywhere.
I ran when you called.
I would have done anything for you.
That's not how I remember it.
No?
No.
And we used to fight all the time.
And argue.
Do you remember that trick?
What trick?
You see, child, love always betrays us.
Wake up.
By fairest blood it was done, and only by fairest blood can it be undone.
You were the only one who could break the spell and destroy me.
And the only one pure enough to save me.
You don't even realize how lucky you are never to know what it is to grow old.
No!
No.
No. No.
What are you looking at?
Do something!
You're dwarves, healers.
Save her. Help her.
No. This cannot be.
Please, please.
Please.
What do we do, Beith?
What we promised.
Well, here you are.
All dressed up, like you're about to wake up and give me more grief. Am I right?
You deserved better.
I once had a wife,
Princess.
Sara was her name.
When I came back from the wars,
I carried with me the stench of death and the anger of the lost.
I wasn't worth saving, that's for sure.
But she did so anyway.
And I loved her so much.
I loved her more than anyone or anything.
And then I let her out of my sight and she was gone.
And I became myself again.
A self I never cared for.
Until you.
See, you remind me of her.
Her heart. Her spirit.
But now you, too, have gone.
You both deserved better, and I'm so sorry I failed you.
I'm so sorry.
But you'll be a queen in heaven now and sit among the angels.
She died for us!
For our cause!
We cannot just hide behind these walls and watch this land die with her!
Your grief clouds your judgment, my son.
My grief makes me see clearer, Father.
My duty is to protect those people who come to me for help.
I will defend them to the last drop of my blood, but I will not abandon these walls.
The spell is lifted.
Death has favored you.
Death favors no man.
We must ride like thundering waves under the tattered battle flag of my father.
You must rest.
We have rested long enough.
Frost to fire and fire to frost.
Iron will melt.
But it will writhe inside of itself!
All these years all I've known is darkness.
But I have never seen a brighter light than when my eyes just opened.
And I know that light burns in all of you!
Those embers must turn to flame.
Iron into sword!
I will become your weapon!
Forged by the fierce fire that I know is in your hearts!
For I have seen what she sees.
I know what she knows.
I can kill her.
And I'd rather die today than live another day of this death!
And who will ride with me?
Who will be my brother?
Aye!
Farewell, Princess.
Where are they?
Amassed on the cliffs.
Their numbers have swollen.
They say the King's standard flies again.
Then let them come.
And let them break their skulls on these stone walls and bring me my prize.
My lord, we only have a few hours before the tide comes in.
Not long enough to breach the castle walls.
Is there no other way in?
There is another way.
Hi-ho, lads, it's off to work.
If he starts whistling,
I'll smash his face in.
Yes.
We're promised gold and what do we get?
Poo!
How low has the dwarf race sunk?
That looks like one of mine.
Hold this!
All right.
The gatehouse is 50 yards to the right.
And there's a whole army out there.
Six dwarves against an army?
I like them odds.
We must ride now.
The portcullis will be open.
So, you're back from the dead and instigating the masses.
You look very fetching in mail.
We ride!
All right.
We move as one.
After you.
Hey, go, go, go.
Sorry.
What's happening, Coll?
They're on the beach!
Release!
Ready! Release!
Release!
Go, go, go!
The summit's breached!
Back here, lads!
Come on!
Get back to it!
Pull!
Nion, get on that rope!
Come on!
Go on!
Quert!
It's a massacre down there!
Gort, on that rope!
We must turn back!
No! I gave them my word!
It's over!
Get on now!
She's moving.
You done it, lads!
Charge!
Ya!
Form! Form!
William!
Come and avenge your father who was too weak to raise his sword.
Ah.
Go on.
Watch them die.
How does it feel, knowing you were the one who led them to their deaths?
You see?
We're not that different, are we?
I'm everything you're not.
You cannot defeat me!
I've lived too many lives.
Ravaged entire kingdoms.
I have been given powers that you could not even fathom!
I will never stop.
Never.
I will give this wretched world the queen it deserves.
By fairest blood, it is done!
And only by fairest blood is it undone.
You can't have my heart.
In the name of all that is good and just in this land
I crown you queen.
Hail to the Queen!
Hail to the Queen!
Hail to the Queen!
This is the story of my family.
Me, my three beautiful children and my husband.
There is our lovely farm.
It's been in my husband's family for generations.
The sad thing is, my husband is away, fighting in a war,
so we're on our own.
We're all terribly worried about him, of course,
but on the whole, I'm coping well.
Very well.
Very well, indeed.
No fighting in the best parlour!
That's me, coping.
Lemon drop.
That's very naughty of you.
They're coping, too.
Get off the furniture! Vincent, off, off, off!
- They started it.
- Get off the furniture!
We're all coping. We're fine.
- You're on the furniture!
- You're on the furniture!
We're fine.
Then stop shouting!
We're not shouting. You're shouting.
We are supposed to be getting the farm spic-and-span before the cousins arrive tomorrow.
And instead, all you're doing is fighting, fighting, fighting, when what I want to be seeing is sharing, sharing, sharing.
Imagine how sad you'd be if you had to be taken away from home because of bombs dropping all over the place.
- We're not sharing the jam with them.
- What?
We're not sharing Dad's jam with the cousins.
Oh, no, of course not.
That's for Dad when he comes home.
I'm talking about your room and your toys.
Why won't he reply to my letter?
We're not talking about Dad, darling.
But why won't he reply?
His last one came years ago.
No, darling.
Look.
Three months ago, that's all.
You see?
Dad's in the Army.
They move him about a lot, that's all it is.
There is nothing to worry about, all right?
Now, I've got to run, but you've got to clean up the farm for the cousins.
What are they actually like, the cousins?
They're city children, and I imagine they're rather refined.
And I am sure that they are very well-behaved.
Blenkinsop, he's vomming again.
Stop the car.
He's vommed all over my shoes!
It's all right, Blenkinsop. Stopped now.
Where are my marshmallows?
Master Cyril, are them marshmallows a wise choice, given your recent evacuation?
Marshmallows are always a wise choice, thanks.
You beast!
You've ruined my brand-new
Fontarelli patent-leather pumps, and I've left the pale pink at home.
You beast, beast, beast!
Oh, look.
How sweetly pretty. Is that the place?
No.
Vincent, chores, now.
But the piglets are getting sold tomorrow, and you said I could scratch them before they went away.
Dad left me in charge, and what I say goes.
Now, get off.
But Dad built the Scratch-o-Matic for them.
- I said, get off!
- I'm getting off. I'm getting off.
And no more scratching.
I'm going to check the barley.
Hello.
Shoo.
- How is my gorgeous sister-in-law?
- No.
Your coat's inside out.
Nylons you need with that skirt.
- No.
- No? No what?
You know perfectly well. "No what?"
I'm not selling.
Isabel, look at me. Look at me.
- Who am I? Who am I?
- You're my brother-in-law.
I'm family, Iz, is all I'm pointing out, and that's why you can trust me.
All right, Phil. What's your point?
Iz, we need to sell the farm, now.
You haven't even got enough money for tomorrow's payment on the tractor, and if there's no tractor, there's no harvest.
If there's no harvest, the farm will fail.
I said no.
And actually, Norman's thought of a way to get some money, so I will make the payment on the tractor.
- Has he, indeed? What way would that be?
- I'm in a hurry, Phil.
Isabel, I can't point it out enough that I need the money.
I'm only human, but that farm is half...
Half Rory's and half yours. Yes, yes, I know.
I know, because you tell me every time I see you.
But you can't sell it without my permission, and I do not give my permission!
- But Izzy, I've got the contract right here.
- Goodbye, Phil.
I'm here. I'm here.
Mrs Docherty, don't start without me.
Mrs Docherty?
Mrs Docherty?
Hello. Oh.
Oh.
There you are. I was so worried.
Oh, you worry too much, and it doesn't help.
It's just that you have been a bit forgetful, that's all.
Now, you... You look after the shop.
I'll put away the deliveries.
Oh, I was managing perfectly.
You haven't started unpacking, have you?
Unpacking? Where?
All right.
I was just putting the flour away.
It's gotten foggy.
Could you pass me the scoop?
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Good morning, Mr Green.
We haven't had the pleasure.
But I am Miss Topsey and this is my colleague, Miss Turvey.
Charmed.
Can you guess who sent us?
Sent two lovely ladies such as yourselves?
Father Christmas?
Are you flirting with us, Phil?
Oh, I can call you Phil, can I?
You can call me whatever you like, sweetheart.
Don't be so naughty.
Mrs Biggles won't like it.
Mrs Big says you owe her.
You ran up a big fat debt in one of her riverside casinos.
See what you've gambled away, Phil?
"I.O.U. One farm."
- Where is your farm, Phil?
- I like farms.
We've come to get it.
And I respect that, ladies, and, yeah, you'll get it. You'll get it.
And Mrs Biggles has nothing to worry about.
I can fix it. I am fixing it.
Please, don't hurt me.
We don't want to hurt you, Phil.
The fact is, Mrs Big has told us to come back with one of two things, the deeds to your farm...
Or your kidneys.
Not ripe yet, then, old son?
Uncle Phil, where did you come from?
Oh, just on me way home.
Be ripe in a few days, I reckon.
Must be very proud.
Your mum told me all about your idea to pay for the tractor.
What on earth made you think of that, then?
Well, I saw Farmer Macreadie at the shop, and he said he was looking to buy some Gloucestershire Old Spots.
Huh?
- Pigs.
- I knew that.
So when I offered to sell him our piglets, he jumped at it.
Clever.
Very clever.
Come on.
Feed it through. That's it.
Feed it through.
Come on, Phil, think.
Think, think, think, think.
Piglets.
Got to get rid of the piglets.
Got to get rid of the piglets.
No piglets, no tractor.
Then she'll have to sell the farm.
Look.
Cor! Look at that.
Is that a motorcar?
It must be the cousins.
It can't be the cousins.
They're not due till tomorrow.
Do you think they've brought sweets?
They must be so rich.
They've got a chauffeur.
Where are we?
We're in the Land of Poo.
Duck poo, hen poo, cow poo, goat poo.
Poo as far as the eye can see.
Here we are, then. Out you get.
In fact, it's the British Museum of Poo.
Have you gone completely insane, Blenkinsop?
Mummy would never send me to a place like this. Take me home.
You see? There are savages.
I refuse to leave the car.
Oh, put a sock in it, Ceels.
We've got no choice.
Take me home, right now!
And you know why we've got no choice, too, so let's just stop pretending we're here because of bombs.
They're probably cannibals.
Did you see that thing at the window?
Greetings, O covered-in-poo people.
- Do you speak English?
- You're early.
Yes, poo-man, we have come from far away.
Far, from the land of soap and indoor toilets.
Is that a Fry's chocolate bar with cinder-crunch topping?
Yes, it is. Would you like some?
Pity, there's none left.
- Come on, Miss Celia.
- Please, Blenkinsop!
- That's rotten.
- That's life.
- I'll tell Mummy!
- Now, don't be like that, Miss Celia.
Let go!
- Let go of the drinks cabinet, Miss Celia!
- No!
Look here, mister.
I think you'd better take these two great perfumed townies
- back where they belong.
- I just want to go home!
This place is awful.
It's an awful place.
My shoes!
I refuse to stay in this cesspit.
I'd rather be bombed.
Promise me you'll tell Mummy how awful it is here.
Please, Blenkinsop, she's got to come get me tomorrow.
Promise me!
You've only been here for five minutes, and look at you.
- And you're just a chauffeur.
- Master Cyril, if you'd be so kind, just hold your arms out for Miss Celia's new clothes.
Promise me!
I'll talk to your mother, Miss Celia,
I promise.
- But for now, you'll have to stay here.
- They can't stay here. They're rude.
That's rich, coming from someone who clearly doesn't even know how to wipe his own bottom.
- Come here, you.
- Stop!
Stop! My clothes. My beautiful new clothes.
They're all in the mud. How dare you!
You're trampling them.
- I should have enlisted.
- You wait until I tell my mother.
My beautiful clothes.
They're ruined.
I'm in hell!
You monsters, I'll kill you for this.
Well, that's me off, Mrs Docherty.
I've just enough time to get home and finish tidying before the cousins arrive tomorrow.
Oh, that's nice, dear.
All my cousins are dead.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Give my love to Mr Docherty.
- I will.
There's that finished, then.
What?
I've just put away the treacle.
What? Where?
It's all done and dusted.
There's absolutely nothing to worry about.
Oh, have a little faith, why don't you?
Oh.
"Have a little faith," she says.
"Nothing to worry about," she says.
Oh, no, no, nothing at all.
Children at each other's throats, tractor about to be repossessed,
Phil trying to sell the farm out from under us, guests coming in 24 hours, my only good coat, ruined, and 17 drawers full of treacle!

Ugh. What a surprise.
Not only do they behave like animals, they live like animals.
I'm covered in poo.
Good news. You'll fit right in.
There's bugger-all to eat in here, except this.
- No!
- Dad's jam!
Put the jam down.
It's only jam.
In case you hadn't noticed, there's a war on.
We saved our sugar coupons for months to make that jam.
You touch it, and I'll mash you.
Whoops.
Touched it.
I'm going to wake up and this will all be a nasty dream.
I'm going to wake up, and I'll be in Harrods with Mummy.
The shoe department.
My maid tells me they have arrived, so Mummy and I have come to collect them.
Would you go and fetch them for me?
I'm going to wake up, and there'll be some pink patent pumps.
Ceels, catch.
Mummy's already ordered a beautiful pair in mauve with a matching cloak, and I gather they will be here today.
That's it.
They die.
Catch them!
Come back!
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.
Nanny McPhee.
Nanny McPhee.
No!
- Come here, you coward.
- Norman, Cyril.
- Hello...
- Hello, dear.
...Aunt Isabel.
- Come back here, you big...
- How's your mother?
Death, death and hurting!
You lace-covered...
Don't you call me names, you peasant.
- Celia, is that you?
- You've ruined my clothes, so I'm going to ruin your hair!
What a lovely frock.
Oh! What now? I'm coming.
I'm coming.
- Isabel.
- Not now, Phil.
I was wondering, when you say, "No,"
- do you really mean no?
- Now is not a good time.
I could come back in 10 minutes.
Five, three, two?
I think I should boil you all an egg.
For goodness' sake, Phil, go away.
I... Go...
Good evening, Mrs Green.
I am Nanny McPhee.
Oh, you're it? I mean, her? I mean...
Who are you?
I am Nanny McPhee.
Small "C," big "P."
Right, right.
Thing is, I haven't hired a nanny.
I don't need a nanny.
I'm managing perfectly well.
I have never had a nanny because I don't want a nanny.
I am an Army nanny, Mrs Green.
I have been deployed.
No, no, no, no. There must be some mistake.
- Everything's under control here.
- Get away from me, you oik from hell.
That's Cyril. He's not one of mine.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- He's their cousin.
- Come back here, you parasitic poshie!
- And that's Norman.
Get your filthy hands off me.
He is mine. They've just met.
Horrible, horrible.
They're getting to know each other through play.
Kill the townies and eat their heads!
Oh, it's the war.
It's not a very good influence.
Indeed.
- May I come in?
- Must you?
I mean, yes. Yes, of course, you must.
- Tea?
- Perhaps later.
Let me introduce myself to the children.
No, wait.
Why don't you put the kettle on?
I shan't be a moment.
- You can't stop me.
- Let go!
- Mark my words.
- Die! Kill!
Put me down!
You're just jealous of my fashion sense!
Get your hands off my suit!
It's Savile Row.
Please, may I have your attention?
Ow! Ow!
I am Nanny McPhee.
Ow!
Die!
Please, listen carefully.
You are all to stop what you are doing and go upstairs to bed.
- You look like a banana!
- You look like an unravelled toilet roll.
Did you hear what I said?
Squash. Squish.
- You are to stop fighting.
- Get off me.
Immediately.
My father's very high up in the War Office.
- Hmm.
- Did he ever teach you this?
Was that supposed to impress us?
What's happening?
Ow.
Ow!
No, not me, too.
Ow!
Oh, no!
Vincent, stop!
I can't stop. It's making me do it!
It's her!
- What?
- She's making us do it. Ow!
- He's right.
- What are you talking about?
It must be that stick!
It can't be anything else.
Stop us!
Stop us, please.
- Please.
- Please.
On one condition, that you apologise for hurting each other and promise to stop fighting.
Apologise?
- I'm not apologising to them!
- Well, I'm not apologising to them!
- You broke the jam.
- They should apologise to us.
Technically, it was Cyril who broke the jam.
Oh, no!
What's happening, Vinnie?
Dad's letters!
They're going to get burnt.
Keep away from them!
I can't, it's making me! Please!
All right, we'll apologise.
I'm sorry I hit you with the fire-tongs, Celia, and I promise not to do it again.
Me, too, I'm sorry!
Sorry, Cyril!
Celia, please, it's our dad's letters!
All right, I apologise. I'm sorry.
- Cyril!
- Apologise!
Please, the letters!
- Cyril!
- Apologise.
- Cyril.
- Say you're sorry.
- Say it.
- Say you're sorry, please!
All right, all right. I'm sorry.
Help!
What are you doing here, Mr Edelweiss?
You naughty bird.
Tiresome creature.
If you're trying to impress me, it's not working.
Get off.
Get off.
No.
You are still not forgiven.
You know what you did.
It is rude to stare.
Upstairs to bed, please.
Good night, Mum.
- Good night, Aunt Isabel.
- Good night, Aunt Isabel.
I do hope you sleep well.
Oh.
Vincent, would you please put those back where they belong?
Ooh!
- Thank you, Nanny McPhee.
- You're welcome.
Off you go.
And make yourself scarce.
Go on.
Shoo!
These children require five lessons,
Mrs Green.
Lesson one, to stop fighting, is complete.
They've stopped fighting?
Mmm.
Early beds tonight, I think.
Leave it to me.
You should be able to have a little time to yourself.
Time to myself?
Mmm.
Time to myself?
She's coming.
We're not fighting.
I can see that, Vincent. Thank you.
Look, I don't know how all that happened downstairs, but I'm in charge here, and I don't need some nanny to help.
My sister and I aren't even part of this family, so whomever you've come to look after, it certainly isn't us.
Listen to me very carefully.
I am going to explain to you the way I work.
When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay.
When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go.
How could anyone possibly want you?
Well, it's an odd thought, I grant you, but there it is.
Now, to business.
In the absence of any spare beds,
Norman, I presume, will be sharing with Cyril?
I'd rather share with a goat.
A goat wouldn't have you, and neither will I.
I see.
Celia, Megsie, would you be willing to share a bed?
I'm not sharing anything with that vicious harpy.
- I'd rather share with Geraldine.
- She's our cow.
And I'd rather share with an elephant.
Thank you, Vincent, but you will not be required to share.
Ha ha. I don't have to share.
I don't have to share.
The rest of you, however, will have to come to some agreement.
- Never.
- Never.
- Never.
- Never.
Never!
Hmm.
Ew!
Oh. I am so sorry.
I do beg your pardon.
Oh!
How are they managing?
You must be exhausted. Do sit down.
I'm making some tea.
Sorry, I haven't got any biscuits.
No one's got any biscuits, you know that.
Are they all right up there?
Are they sharing?
Yes, they're sharing very nicely.
Indeed, they came up with all the arrangements for themselves.
But that's a miracle.
What did you...
How on earth did you do it?
I'm afraid that's classified information, Mrs Green.
The Army is very strict about such matters.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Tea.
Can you believe it? I haven't even a plain old biscuit to offer you.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're not leaving us, are you?
Certainly not.
Thank goodness.
These children need me.
The thing is,
I can't afford to pay you at the moment,
- but...
- Do not concern yourself, Mrs Green.
The Army remunerates me, and I have arranged my own accommodation.
Oh!
Good night, Mrs Green. Enjoy your tea.
Move over. Your hoof's in my ear.
- I haven't got hooves.
- Not you, you idiot. Geraldine.
What is that perfectly frightful stench?
It's the goat, you fool.
This is that ghastly nanny's doing. I know it is.
Would you like a pillow,
Little Elly?
You're a bit big for this bed, but I don't mind.
Geraldine, you're not cooperating.
Cooperate.
Just go to sleep.
Calm yourself.
Are you Mrs Biggles?
I am Nanny McPhee. Small "C," big "P."
Good evening.
Right.
Oh, my darling.
Where are you?
All right.
Piglets. Piglets, come here.
Piggies.
Piglets. Piglets!
Hello.
Off you go, piglet. That's it.
Once you're gone, I'll get the farm.
Hmm.
Rise and shine.
Beds made, nice neat hospital corners, if you please, downstairs for breakfast, at the double.
My elephant's gone.
May I just say, it's typical of this family to have hired a nanny with a face that could win the war, hands down.
We've not hired her, and she's not our nanny.
Who is she, then?
And how did she make us do all those things?
I have a theory.
She's a secret weapon.
Definitely.
My father is very high up in the War Office, so I know about these things.
I suspect that that stick of hers releases some sort of odourless chemical when she bangs it.
To put it simply, she gassed us.
Don't be daft.
That can't possibly be legal.
I am pleased to report, Mrs Green, that lesson two, to share nicely, is complete.
Oh, that's wonderful.
- Is that you, Cyril?
- It is.
Good morning, darling.
Why are you wearing a gas mask?
- In case of a gas attack, Aunt Isabel.
- A gas...
I don't think there's going to be a gas attack in this part of the country, darling.
That's why your parents sent you here.
Poor thing.
London must be worse than I thought.
Mmm.
- Where's Celia, dear?
- Looking for something to wear.
Oh, yes, I am so sorry.
Your mother will never forgive me.
Oh, don't tell me that's cheesecloth.
Horrid, ugly, shapeless.
Ugh.
Don't forget, Norman, Farmer Macreadie is coming for the piglets at noon.
I'll be back in time for that. I've got to run.
There's a delivery of mouse traps at the shop.
I've got to get to them before Mrs Docherty...
For heaven's sake.
- I'll see you outside.
- Hmm?
Oh! Don't be so disgusting.
You have wind because you have collywobbles, and you have the collywobbles because you have been eating window putty.
I'm not interested, Mr Edelweiss.
All the piglets have gone?
Yes, that is interesting, very interesting.
Hmm.
That's that done.
Right. Chores.
Megs, feed Geraldine.
I'll get the piglets ready for Farmer Macreadie.
Vinnie's collecting the eggs.
Cyril, you can sweep up the dung.
I'd love to sweep up the dung.
It's almost my favourite activity, but sadly, I've left my dung-sweepers at home.
- Perhaps Celia could...
- I'm coming back for you.
What are you wearing?
I think it's mostly tulle.
That's my mother's wedding dress.
No, this old thing? It can't be.
It hasn't even got a train.
Take it off.
I will do no such thing.
You've ruined all my clothes, and this is the only decent thing in the house.
You've stolen that from our mother's room.
Take it off!
- I haven't stolen it, I've borrowed it.
- Megsie!
- The piglets have escaped.
- What?
- There's a hole!
- They're all gone!
We've got to find them before Farmer Macreadie comes.
- Come on, Norman.
- Move.
- You can't be serious.
- Listen, they're prize piglets.
The money we get for them pays this month's tractor hire.
And if we lose the tractor, we lose the harvest, and if we lose the harvest, we'll lose the whole farm.
How frightful for you.
Please! This is our dad's farm, and the harvest is everything.
No, you can't make me.
And you can't make me, either.
I've got my gas mask on, so that stick of yours won't work.
Furthermore, I'm going to report you to my father,
who is very high up in the War Office.
There's no time for this.
What if it was your dad's farm?
You would help then, wouldn't you?
Would you, Cyril? Hmm?
Help your father?
Blast you all.
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't possibly run in these heels.
Don't you dare gas me.
Oh.
There's one.
- What are you doing here?
- Just helping.
Well, come on, if you're coming.
Come on, come on.
I'm only helping till Mummy comes.
- Catch it!
- Pig, heel.
- I've got one! I've got one!
- Careful it doesn't bite.
Right, take it slowly.
They've caught two already?
That will never do.
Well, we don't want to make it too easy for them.
Hey!
What on earth's it doing?
Blimey!
- Is that normal?
- No, it's not.
I had no idea country life could be quite so entertaining.
Oh, no. Come back, piggy!
Pig, come back!
Come back!
No, pig!
Did you know? I had no idea pigs could swim so stylishly.
They can't.
After them.
Ahoy there, Phil.
Hello, Farmer Macreadie.
Whoa, there. Whoa. Whoa.
Sorry to hear about the piglets.
Piglets? What, my piglets?
Yeah, haven't you heard? They've gone, disappeared in the night. Escaped.
Escaped?
Dear, oh, dear. What a shame.
Dreadful thing.
Escaped, eh?
Funny things, pigs. Clever.
I knew a pig once who could play Scrabble.
Tapped out the words with its trotter.
"Sty." Good score. Dear, oh, dear.
Isabel will be in a right old tizzy,
I should think.
Well, thanks for letting me know, Phil.
You saved me a journey.
Bye, then.
Wait up, there.
One good turn deserves another.
I'll give you a ride up there.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, I'll walk.
- Jump in.
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- It's no bother.
- Turn around.
- Don't be daft.
- Cheerio.
- Go on, now. Up you jump.
- Shoo. No, please.
- Come on.
- All right.
I don't know how we're ever going to catch them.
They're getting sold in half an hour.
If I may suggest, we need to use strategy, tactics, a proper movement order.
And you were trained where, exactly?
Cadet school.
- Oh. Fair enough. Go on, then.
- Right.
Now, we're here and they're there, there, there and possibly over there.
- Megsie?
- Ready.
- Celia?
- Ready.
- Three.
- Two.
One.
They've dug a hole.
- Where are the piglets, Isabel?
- Oh, they've gone.
- Oh, no!
- Every single one of them.
- Piggy. Oink, oink.
- Gone.
What will we do?
They maybe got wind of the move,
Mrs Green.
- Clever things, are pigs.
- Very clever.
How will we pay for the tractor?
How will we get the harvest in?
I'll try and help if I can, Mrs Green, but I've got me hands full with my wheat,
- and what with my boys off fighting...
- Terrible thing, war.
Curse these flat feet.
I'm sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Oh, no, not to worry.
Good luck.
I know. They're hiding.
Isabel, sign it. I have a buyer today.
I might not have a buyer tomorrow.
It won't be so bad. Think about it, Iz, no more worrying about tractors or harvests or...
Pigs!
Pigs!
Children.
- Look.
- Hoorah!
Right, then. What have we got here?
One, two, three, four and five.
- You got the whole pride.
- Did you get all of them?
These piglets are funny things.
We got all of them.
Yes, all of them.
- All of them. You did?
- I couldn't believe my eyes.
Right, there you are.
Tractor money.
- And then, he did a somersault.
- Somersault?
I didn't know you could swim.
They're worth a lot more than that, you know.
These piglets are geniuses.
They can do synchronised swimming.
We do not tell fibs in this house.
- They really did.
- Megsie.
But they did do synchronised swimming.
- That's enough, Megsie. Shush!
- It's true.
They can climb trees.
Stop telling fibs. Pigs don't climb trees.
- Stop being so silly.
- But we're not!
He's only trying to get a bit more for them, and quite right, too.
Clever things, are pigs.
Thank you.
All right, come on.
I knew a pig once, could count to 10 in French.
- Really?
- No.
Come on, let's go.
- Look here.
- Synchronised swimming.
- Climbing trees? The very idea.
- It was climbing trees.
It was... It was true.
It was true. It was like...
- They were climbing trees.
- A pirouette.
It was like magic.
Yes.
- Like...
- Magic.
Synchronised swimming.
I'm so proud of you. Let me hug you.
Is that...
Is that my wedding dress?
It was our fault.
- We spoiled Celia's...
- No, it's my fault.
I borrowed it without asking.
I didn't mean to chase the piglets in it.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Where's the veil?
- We used it to catch the piglets.
It's here.
It was my fault, I'm afraid. We needed a net.
Sorry.
Well, I never...
How clever you all are.
I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow, we'll jolly well have a picnic, and after I've paid up the tractor, we'll use the extra pennies for ginger beer.
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
Ginger beer? Ginger beer?
Lesson three, to help each other, is complete.
Clever things, pigs.
Bye-bye, Pillow. Bye-bye, Dora.
Bye-bye, piggies.
Mummy!
Look, it's Mummy.
See, I told you she'd come.
Ceels, don't.
Mummy, you'll never guess.
We just rescued some little pigs.
They were dancing and...
Where's Mummy?
Her Ladyship's still in London, Miss Celia.
- But did you give her my message?
- I did, Miss Celia.
Has she sent you to bring me home?
Regretfully not, Miss Celia.
My only instructions was to bring the pumps you left behind.
Fontarelli, I believe.
I suppose she's very busy.
That's right, Miss.
She's very, very busy.
What are you gawking at?
We're not some freak show, you know.
- Cyril, we didn't mean to be...
- Get away!
You don't know anything about us.
Hmm.
I don't want them.
Can I look at them?
I don't care for them.
You can have them, if you want.
These are my best, but you can have them for everyday.
You're it!
I'm gonna get you for that, Vinnie!
You're it!
Come and pass around these buns we made.
Not yet. Not yet.
Oh, look, Mr Docherty, how thoughtful.
They've put out cushions.
You see, Mrs Docherty,
I regret to inform you that's a cow pat, not a cushion.
Oh.
Can't I sit on it anyway?
It looks so comfortable.
Oh.
- There we are.
- Um...
- Can you help me down? Thank you.
- There.
Yes, it's very comfy.
You going to sit down? There we are.
Would you like a bun, Nanny McPhee?
I think I better not. Thank you.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Get away with you, Mr Edelweiss.
You revolting bird.
Get off. I don't want you there.
What's he done to make you so cross with him?
He eats inappropriate substances.
- I'm so sorry.
- Such as?
Such as window putty.
Window putty?
Such as the window putty in every single one of my window panes, which all fell out at once.
- Oh, please.
- That's bad.
I don't care how much you love it, you deplorable creature. It is a nasty habit.
What are all your medals for,
Nanny McPhee?
Courage, kindness, resolve, imagination, enthusiasm, basket-work and leaps of faith.
- Sandwiches!
- Hooray!
In my...
In my capacity as warden, Mrs Green, might I suggest that you provide the family with protective head gear in case of bombs dropping all of a sudden?
Mrs Docherty and I wear these at home.
I don't think bombs are going to drop in this part of the country, Mr Docherty.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Well, that is where you're possibly, even tragically, mistaken.
Picture this.
An enemy plane,
Carrying an enemy bomb.
An enemy pilot with a bad cold.
They get them, you know, same as we do.
He sneezes once,
Nothing occurs.
He sneezes a second time,
Again, all is well.
He sneezes a third time, and watch very carefully now,
He hits the big red button with his big red nose, and it's
Bombs away!
Oh, kettle's boiled.
- Big bang, you see.
- Oh, dear, what a thought.
We'll just have to hope that none of them catches a cold, won't we, Mrs Docherty?
- Egg and cress or bloater paste?
- Ham.
Norman, watch me do a handstand.
Shoo! Shoo!
- Time for ginger beer.
- Ginger beer!
- Megsie has more.
- No, she hasn't.
Norman has up to the fourth ring, as well.
All right, I've got two drops left.
- For me.
- Me.
There's Uncle Phil. Quick, hide the cake.
I wasn't sure he was coming.
But here he is, with his silly contract.
Oh, wait, that looks more like a letter.
Norman, Megsie,
Uncle Phil's got a letter for us.
A letter from Rory.
That'll be nice after all their waiting.
That's not a letter, dear.
It's yellow.
It's a telegram.
What's that?
From the War Office.
That's not for us, is it?
It's not always bad news, is it?
I mean, we've got to have a little faith, haven't we?
Oh.
Mum?
"Killed in action."
I'm so...
Rotten luck.
It's a brilliant bit of design, this machine.
- He must've been a terribly good...
- He's not dead, you know.
What?
He's not dead. I know he's not.
They've got it wrong.
- Norman, the Army doesn't get it...
- They've got it wrong.
Sorry.
But how? How do you know?
Look, my dad's always saying he feels things in his bones.
He can feel weather coming, and he knows when things are going to happen, like if a cow's going to calve, or if a lamb's in trouble.
And he's always right. Every time.
Well, I can feel it in my bones that he's alive.
I just know it.
You don't think that you feel this way because you've just heard, or...
No, it's not that. I just know.
All right.
So, what do you want to do about it?
We need to find out where he is, and we need to find out fast.
Mum will sell the farm if she believes he's dead.
She'll think we can't manage it on our own.
The thing is, how do I find him?
I can't very well go off looking for him.
- There might be a way.
- What? What? Tell me.
Well, it's just... My father.
- He's very high up in the War Office.
- Very high up in the War Office.
Exactly, he'd be able to find out quickly.
- Where is he?
- London.
- Then how do we get to him?
- I don't know. We need help.
- Should we ask your mother?
- No. No, I need to prove that he's alive, bring her proof.
Then who? Who can help us?
The boys are on their way to London.
They can't be.
They said they were checking the barley.
No, listen.
"Megs, Dad not dead.
"Feel it in bones. Don't tell Mum.
"Have gone to London with Cyril to get proof.
"That's the only thing that will stop her from selling the farm."
But she's decided to sell, she said so.
Can't we tell her?
No, Norman's right.
We mustn't say anything until he has proof.
- So we've got to stop her till he gets back.
- Exactly.
Where are we?
Chelsea.
Haven't you been here before?
I've never even been to London before.
Lord Nelson.
What are we going to do?
This is going to take ages.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
I was hoping to avoid this, but, Norman, could you please turn that little red wheel all the way, clockwise?
Right, thank you.
Nanny McPhee, how long is this going to...
I can't bear London in the traffic.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Sleep well?
- Yes, thanks.
- Look what I've got.
- What's that?
- It's a kidney dish, Phil.
- It fits two in quite snugly.
Surely you don't need both.
Listen, ladies, the deeds to the farm will be in your hands before you know it.
Oh, I do hope so, Phil,
'cause the fact is, kidney removal is quite a long and painful procedure.
And we're on a very tight schedule.
Here we are. Out you get.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Best of luck.
- You all right?
- Yes.
A bit nervous, but yes.
Please, sir. We're here to see Lord Gray on a matter of life and death.
Get lost before I thump you.
Tell him.
- He's my father.
- Prove it.
- What?
- Prove it or hop it.
Sergeant Jeffreys, you've grown.
Nanny McPhee, ma'am.
At your service, ma'am.
At ease, Ralph.
- Lesson three paid off, I see.
- Certainly did, ma'am.
- How's the Army treating you?
- Proudly, ma'am.
Have you learned to eat your greens?
Well?
I can't lie to you, Nanny McPhee.
Broccoli still presents a challenge.
Try it with cheese.
And don't forget, in May and June, asparagus can be a pleasant alternative.
I shall answer for these children.
Please let them in, immediately.
On the double, Nanny McPhee, ma'am.
All right, Phil, I'm ready to sign.
Mum, what are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing, darling.
- But, well, you've got to wait for Norman.
No more waiting!
If we wait another second, we'll lose the kidneys.
I mean the sale. The sale.
Megsie, there's nothing that Norman can do about this.
What is the meaning of this, boy?
Sorry to disturb you, sir, but we need your help.
- We've come all the way from the country.
- We?
He means me, Uncle.
I mean, Uncle Your Lordship.
And you are?
Norman, sir. Your nephew, sir.
Aunt Isabel's son.
Ah, yes, the girl who made that unfortunate marriage.
Her happy marriage to my father, sir, who's fighting for your army, so I'll thank you to be more civil.
And what is your business here, pray?
Sir, we need you to find out what's happened to Norman's father.
To Uncle Rory.
We got a telegram saying...
Yes?
...he was killed in action.
But I know it's wrong. I know he's alive.
I see. So, you're saying that the telegram, a telegram sent from the War Office, contained false information?
Exactly.
And you have proof, of course, otherwise you would not have dared to come here.
Has your father contacted you since you received the telegram?
No.
Then one of his unit has been in touch, presumably?
No.
Then what proof have you?
I can feel it in my bones.
- In your what? What?
- I can feel it in my bones.
In your bones?
Feel it in your bones?
- Yes.
- Great heavens, boy.
Do you mean you've persuaded my weak-willed son to bring you here, in the middle of a war, with some cock-and-bull story about a feeling you have in your bones?
He's not weak-willed.
It was him who saved the piglets and him that thought of helping us by coming here.
And I know I'm right about my father.
Please, can't you just inquire?
There are thousands of men fighting in my army.
Why should I give your father, however worthy he may be, my special attention?
Because...
Because they love him, and so does Auntie Isabel, and they need him.
And I know why you sent us away to them, too.
It had nothing to do with bombs.
I know you and Mother are getting a divorce.
- Enough!
- No, you will listen!
You've made your lives and our lives a misery.
Isn't that enough for you?
At least help Aunt Isabel and Uncle Rory to be together.
Wait here.
- Hurry it along there, Isabel.
- Well, I've got to read it, haven't I?
Right.
Mum, please, wait. Please.
Stop it, Megsie.
"Those shall be accepted in reserve..."
A mouse. A mouse under the chair.
Are they really going to get a divorce, your mum and dad?
So who will you live with?
My mother, I suppose.
Won't make much difference.
We hardly ever see him or her.
We only ever get wheeled out for them on special occasions.
You can come live with us, you know.
You and Celia.
That's jolly decent of you.
I'm sorry.
What does it say?
I'm afraid he's M.I.A.
- What's that?
- Missing in action.
I'm sorry, Norman.
Wait.
"Missing"?
"Missing in action," not "killed in action"?
Not killed.
The telegram you received was incorrect.
In fact, there's no record of any telegram having been sent.
Which is something we should look into...
I knew it. He's alive.
Thank you, Uncle.
He's my nephew. He's a country boy.
"Rough diamond," as they say.
Come on, we've got to get back.
We've got to tell Mum.
Cyril, it's done you good, all that country air.
Carry on.
I will, sir.
I mean, Father.
Right-o.
Right-o.
Norman, if the War Office never sent that telegram, it means the one you saw was forged, but who would forge a telegram saying someone was dead?
- Who would do something that awful?
- Uncle Phil.
He's been trying to get Mum to sell our half of the farm.
He must have known she'd sell if she thought Dad was dead.
We've got to hurry.
He's not dead. He's only missing.
That is good news.
But we've got to get back quickly.
We'll explain on the way.
Celia, please, stop screaming!
It's been half an hour.
There is no mouse.
I saw it. Must have escaped.
Right.
Isabel, let's just get this done, shall we?
Have you got a pen?
Mum, please wait.
That's enough, Megsie.
- Phil, find a pen.
- Another pen. Right.
Ah.
Nanny McPhee, we need you.
Please, Nanny McPhee, we need you.
Please, please, Nanny McPhee, we need you.
Nanny McPhee, we need you.
We need you. We need you. We need you.
Norman, could you hand me my stick, please?
Actually, better still, could you just bang it down on the road once, quite hard?
Go on.
Don't drop it.
The paperwork involved in replacing it simply doesn't bear thinking about.
Well done. Put it back.
- What did it do?
- What?
When Norman banged the stick, what was it for?
Hello.
Mum, please, don't. It's our farm.
Don't sign it.
This is all self-explanatory.
Oh! So is this.
And that. And you just sign it there.
Where is the pen?
For heaven's sake, Phil.
Never mind.
They were here.
Bye.
I thought you wanted me to sign the thing.
I don't understand.
Someone must've...
I don't think there are any more pens, Mum.
- Nanny McPhee.
- Yes, dearie?
How fast can this thing go, exactly?
Look what I found.
Right. Isabel, let's get this thing done, shall we?
Let's get this signed, Isabel.
I'll steady your hand.
Steady your hand. There.
Just... Just there, that's it.
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.
Yes.
I can't think of anything that could stop him now.
"L-S..."
- It's a UXB.
- What's that?
An unexploded bomb.
We have them in London.
Could go off at any second.
- What?
- What?
It might not. It depends.
But it'll destroy the harvest.
It's a sign.
They're coming for me.
Stop panicking. Help is at hand.
They're gonna kill me.
- Unexploded bomb!
- They're gonna kill me!
- Unexploded bomb!
- Who? Who's going to kill you?
The hit-women.
The lady heavies.
I'm here. Stop all that panicking. Stop it!
I can't stop it. I'm going to die.
I'm going to get under the table.
I'm going to put the kettle on.
Mine's a milk and two sugars.
Thank God. You have to arrest me, and you have to arrest me now, before they get here.
What?
Arrest me now! I repeat...
Arrest you for what? What's the crime?
There's got to be a crime.
Try forgery.
Norman, where have you been?
To the War Office. Dad's alive.
What?
- Uncle Phil forged the telegram.
- Yes.
Norman's right. There's your crime.
- Now will you arrest me?
- Phil, you...
Look, none of you seem to realise
that there could be a fatalistic explosion at any second of the moment.
Quiet, please. Quiet, please, all of you.
Norman, come here.
Dad's missing in action.
Go on.
But I can feel it in my bones that he's alive.
Oh, well, then, it must be true.
Thank you. Thank you, my darling.
My darling.
My darling boy.
- And Cyril. Thank him, too.
- Cyril, you, too?
Cyril, come here.
- My brave boy.
- Did you hear that?
- What?
- I'm a forger, a villainous forger.
Leave it. There's a bomb out there what needs dealing with.
- Bomb?
- Bomb?
Quick, come and look.
Here's the cuffs, Phil. Sort it out yourself.
Now, "Bombs."
- It's a UXB.
- That means unexploded bomb.
But the barley.
If it goes off, it will be destroyed.
"Defusing your bomb."
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Cuff me to you. To you.
That way I'll be safe.
Can someone help me with these, please?
You don't deserve any help, you completely wicked person.
Please, I'm begging you, Megsie.
Allow me.
I mean, thank you.
I am about to disarm the device.
- He fell over.
- I think he may have fainted.
Who's going to defuse it now?
Boys, check on Mr Docherty and put that ladder back up.
Celia, get his pamphlet.
You read out the instructions
'cause you've got the best diction.
Nanny McPhee, please, help me stop them.
Somehow, I doubt that will be possible.
Anyone there?
It's just, I'm not comfy.
"Defusing your bomb.
"Three simple steps to an explosion-free day.
"Step one.
Open the vent situated by the tail fin."
- Open the vent.
- Open the vent.
Open the vent.
Vent open.
What's next?
"Step two. Cut the blue wire."
- Blue wire.
- Blue wire.
These are going to be too big.
- What else can we use?
- Has anyone got a penknife?
Oh!
Try these.
These are perfect.
Well done, Celia.
What's next?
- Yoo-hoo!
- Yoo-hoo!
Hello, Phil.
"Step three. Cut the red wire."
- Red wire.
- Red wire.
- Can you see it?
- Is it there?
- Have you done it?
- Be quiet. I can't reach it.
Isn't it exciting?
What?
- I did it.
- Well done.
Jolly good.
Megsie, well done.
Uh-oh.
What's it doing? What's it doing?
We've got such good news, Phil.
We're not going to remove your kidneys after all. That's right.
Mrs Big has decided that kidney removal just wasn't good enough for you.
It lacked finesse.
She wants us to stuff you, Phil.
Stuff you, and put you in the entrance to the casino as a warning to others.
You can't do that.
Oh, don't worry, Phil,
Miss Turvey's a professional.
Here is an early example of my work.
And here's how you'll look.
It's uncanny, isn't it?
Only thing is, we will have to scoop you out while you're still, well...
Alive.
No!
What does it say about the light?
You can check yourself, there is absolutely nothing
- in the whole book.
- Wait, there's a footnote.
"On certain enemy bombs, there will be a step four.
"Cut the green wire."
I can't see any green wire.
It must be covered by all this grey stuff.
It's hard as nails.
Algernon, I don't want you to miss the bomb going off. Come on, dear.
Wait. Here.
"Warning, if the green wire is protected with explosive putty..."
- Putty?
- "...red lights will come on,
"beginning the countdown to explosion."
Why is that at the back?
We all need to take cover right now!
Come down, Megsie!
Look.
- Megsie!
- Mum, wait.
Megsie, come down now!
Mr Edelweiss is eating the putty.
Megsie, come down now.
Megsie!
- Megsie, please, come down!
- What's happening?
- Megsie, it's too dangerous.
- You have to come down now.
I can see the green wire.
- We did it.
- My darling, come down.
You did it.
You did it, darling. Come down now.
Well done, Megs!
You clever, clever girl. Come down.
The bomb's been defused.
Oh, it was nothing.
I knew you could do it, Megsie.
Well done.
Lesson four, to be brave, is complete.
But Mr Edelweiss.
He's full of explosive putty.
Won't he go off?
Take cover, everyone.
Leave this to me.
Go, go. Go as fast as you can.
There.
I can fly!
Goodbye!
Well done, Phil.
What's happening to the barley?
Cor!
What's happened?
The harvest's in.
Look, there's a slide.
Come on, everybody.
Last one up's a rotten egg.
Me first, me first!
Mum, come up the ladder.
- Darling.
- Watch. Watch.
Well done!
Well done, Mr Docherty. Up you get.
- Come on, Mum.
- All right. I don't know.
Are you off?
I am.
Thank you for having me to stay, Aggy.
Thank you for asking, Nanny McPhee.
Look.
That's one of
Nanny McPhee's medals.
You have one, too. It's the green one.
That one's my favourite.
Ooh.
- Why has she given us her medals?
- Let's ask her.
Where is she?
Nanny McPhee?
There.
Nanny McPhee!
Where's she going?
She's leaving you.
What?
- She can't be.
- Why?
Because you don't need her any more.
Don't be ridiculous.
But I want her to stay.
Oh, dear. You've forgotten how she works, haven't you?
How?
When you need her but do not want her, then she must stay.
When you want her but no longer need her, then she has to go.
That's not fair.
We didn't mean to want her.
What do you mean, we don't need her?
Are you quite mad?
- Nanny McPhee.
- Let's head her off.
- Nanny McPhee.
- Nanny McPhee.
Nanny McPhee doesn't like goodbyes.
I remember from when I was little.
Come back.
They might not need you, but I do.
I need you. I need you, desperately.
Oh, come back.
Keep going, Mum.
Don't stop, Mum, or we'll lose her.
Will you come back? Come back!
Keep going, Mum. We need her.
No, we don't.
Dada!
Oh!
Dad.
My little man.
- Dad, this is Cyril and Celia.
- Celia.
I had three children when I left, and now I have five.
I'm home. I'm home, now.
I'm all right.
Lesson five, to have faith, is complete.
Hop on, then.
- The person you need...
- Is Nanny McPhee.
Nanny McPhee.
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.
Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis
and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of
when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world.
Then came the dark empire of Acheron,
where cruel Necromancers sought secrets of resurrection.
They crafted a mask from the bones of kings
and awakened its wrath with the pure blood of their daughters.
The mask summoned spirits of unspeakable evil,
giving them power no mortal men should possess.
Acheron enslaved the civilized world.
Only the Barbarian tribes were left to rise up against them.
The mask was shattered and Acheron fell.
Each tribe kept a single shard
so that no man might attempt to join them back together
and drive the world once again into chaos and ruin.
Their pieces were scattered across the land and remained hidden for ages.
But prophecy spoke of a man who would some day try to reassemble the mask
and rule the world.
So came the dawn of Hyborian Age, a time both bleak and brutal.
And so came a child.
Born of battle.
Fialla!
Fialla.
Do not speak, my love. Do not speak.
I must see my child before I die.
Name your son.
His name is Conan.
Slow down, Conan!
When a Cimmerian feels thirst, it is the thirst for blood.
When he feels cold, it is the cold edge of steel.
But the courage of the Cimmerian is tempered.
He neither fears death nor rushes foolishly to meet it.
But to be a Cimmerian warrior, you must have both cunning and balance, as well as speed and strength.
Conan.
I gave you chores, boy.
Finished, Father.
First to circle the hills and return the egg unbroken earns the right to fight with the warriors.
Well, by Crom, boy, what are you waiting for?
We go back.
Conan!
Make way. Make way.
Come. Time to forge a blade.
This sword we make will be yours one day.
But before you wield it, you must understand it.
The sword must bend or it will break.
It must be tempered.
What is most important when forging a blade, fire or ice?
Fire.
Ice?
Are you certain?
Fire and ice together.
This is the mystery of steel.
You're still all fire, boy.
No. Slow down. Find your footing.
Enough!
You're not ready for this sword.
Fire!
Fire!
- Father!
- Conan!
Father!
Conan!
Die!
Father!
Barbarian.
There's no shame in kneeling before me.
Each of these brave warriors has surrendered, left their lands, sworn allegiance to me.
They do so because they know one day I will be a god.
One day... the other clans of Cimmeria will gather for vengeance, and then god or no god, you will fall.
You know why I'm here.
One piece is missing from the mask.
You know its power. Give it to me now... or die and I'll find it for myself.
I prefer death.
Oh, my nose!
No!
This is your son.
I like him.
Come here, my daughter.
Father, I sense the bone shard is close.
Will you find it for me, Marique?
Barbarian, your son has courage.
But my daughter has talents as well.
Find it, Marique.
These Cimmerians, they do not pray.
This is their church.
This is what they worship.
It will be here!
The shard. She found the bone shard.
Your mother would be proud.
- Remo.
- Yeah?
Gather the men. Burn everything.
But, Zym!
Not the boy. Not yet.
Not yet. Look what he did to my face!
Now, how do I punish you, huh?
You fear not pain, nor death.
Father! No!
Father!
No!
Worse than death, eh, Cimmerian?
Watching your son die.
Because he loves you.
It is complete.
Marique, we're halfway there.
When we find the pureblood, your mother, my beloved, will return.
The mask is complete!
Conan, you cannot save me.
Let go of the chain, boy.
- I'm not afraid to die!
- Nor I.
I love you, Son.
No! No!
Conan left Cimmeria and wandered the edges of the world, slaying, thieving, surviving, storming the high walls of Venarium and prowling the dark seas among pirates.
But the nameless man who slaughtered his village and killed his father remained in shadow.
These are common slavers, Conan.
Not the man you seek. Why attack?
No man should live in chains.
Fight!
Stay and fight, you pink-bellied motherless goat-lovers!
Go. You're free.
Go. Your masters are dead.
You are no longer slaves.
But you've taken all our food, all our weapons.
Where would you have us go?
Come on.
We sail to Messantia.
Come on.
Call it.
Come on, old man.
I win!
I still win.
When I first met him, he was no bigger than you.
Just a scrawny little rat picking pockets in Zamora.
Even SO, it was he who stole the Elephant's Heart and slew the sorcerer Yara.
Come.
Hey, mama. Need more mead.
Who's next?
Guards! There. And check there.
Hey. Why are they looking for you?
No. No, no, no. No, wait.
You don't understand.
They'll be happy to take us both to prison if you don't let go!
Maybe I wanna go to prison.
You take the one in the middle?
Me?
- You.
- I'll take him.
I am your prisoner.
You're calm for somebody who's about to die.
Move!
Where's the captain?
The hill ape can speak.
The captain is currently occupied.
Don't worry. Everyone can get their chance.
Hey!
Stop him!
Come here!
Where is the captain of the guard?
His door's sealed from within.
He can only open it for me.
Guards! The door!
All right.
What?
Guards! Guards!
You remember me?
Who are you?
I'm the one who made you pretty.
You can't do this! Do you know who I am?
Where is the man who killed my father?
You seek Khalar Zym?
Zym. No.
My people were slain by a common bandit, not a king.
He was a bandit then. He's a legend now.
A Shadow Lord.
A Shadow Lord, huh?
Speak. I will not kill you.
You know the Forbidden Forest?
Nothing there but dead bodies and the animals who feed on them.
Even as we speak,
Khalar leads his legions through the mist.
More.
Not good enough.
Wait! The forest is large, I know.
But as he returns to his stronghold at Khor Kalba, he returns by way of the ravine at Shaipur.
That's a perfect place for an ambush.
What does Khalar want there?
He's with his witch daughter.
They're searching for a young girl.
A pureblood.
Are you leading me into a trap?
No. I wouldn't lie to you.
He's mad.
He's obsessed with Acheronian sorcery.
I hold no loyalty to him.
Well, Northerner,
I've upheld my part of the deal.
No!
Yes.
By Mitra, what are you doing?
Toasting to our deal.
Hey! Northerner!
Hey, hey, wait for me!
Oh, god!
Prisoners of Messantia!
The key to your freedom sits in your captain's gut.
You gave me your word!
You swore you'd spare my life!
I said I would not kill you.
Free yourselves.
Northerner! My name is Ela-Shan.
Perhaps you've heard that there is no lock
I cannot break or vault I cannot enter.
If you are ever foolish enough to pursue this man to Khor Kalba, come see me in Argalon so I can talk you out of it.
Ask anyone you meet there for Ela-Shan!
What do you see in my future,
Master Fassir?
It is unclear.
I see a journey.
A man crossing the sands.
A knight?
A warrior.
Your paths will merge.
He will take you home to your birthplace.
Is that all that you see, Master?
The pureblood is close.
I can taste her in the air.
There'll be rioting in Messantia for days, thanks to you.
Khalar Zym.
What?
That's the name of the man who killed my father.
Zym?
Do you know who that is?
I am told he's the angel of death.
I leave tonight to pursue him in Shaipur.
We can sail as far as the bay near the Shaipur Outpost.
- You can wait for me there.
- Wait?
I'm not your sewing maid.
I will go with you.
Not this time, Artus.
This is something I must do alone.
Go to the temple. Go! Go!
Protect the master. Go! Go!
Tamara, come with me.
Get into the carriage.
No, I want to stay here and defend our home.
For the sake of your people, you must leave this place and go to the monks in Hyrkania.
It is your duty.
Do not hesitate and do not waver.
I don't want to leave you.
Do you trust me, Tamara?
Yes. With my life. Everything I have.
Then ask no more questions and do as I say.
Go!
Let's go!
Let none escape!
Zym.
Who are you?
Where's Khalar?
Who is Khalar?
Hey!
Come here!
Come on.
Step aside, Northerner.
The woman is property of Khalar Zym.
She is my property now.
Well, you have no claim to her.
No. But I have a claim to you.
And what claim is that?
Death.
Who are you?
When you fight a Cimmerian, even a boy, you best kill him.
I killed hundreds of Cimmerians.
Yes. An entire village.
But I did not burn in my father's forge.
Run from me and I will tear apart the mountains to find you.
I will follow you to hell.
Woman! Come here.
I said, come here.
Which one of you is the pureblood?
Whoever reveals her, gets to live.
And you smell.
Are you the one I seek?
Could it be you?
None of them are pure.
You know who I've come for.
Why suffer for it?
None of the ancient bloodline remain.
Well, if this is true, tell me why have you and these monks chosen to hide here like vermin for a thousand years?
We live here in peace.
We have no riches. We do not make war.
We value life.
You value life.
Do you forget what happened in the forests of Ophir?
When all the nations of Hyboria hunted a woman as if she were an animal?
When both I and my daughter were forced to watch Maliva, my innocent wife, be lashed to the wheel and set aflame?
No. What you value is death.
The monks here had no part in her death.
Where is the pureblood?
Not to fear, Father.
He will tell me his secrets.
They all tell me their secrets.
Your vain pursuit for the secrets of Acheron is a lust for power, not a love of life.
Your innocent wife sought to enslave all of Hyboria with her sorcery.
She deserved to burn.
You will never rule, and Maliva will never rise again!
Die!
My lord!
Remo is searching for the one that got away.
She is the pureblood.
Remo will capture her for me.
Come here!
Get off.
My master said I would meet you.
He said our paths would merge.
You're the one Khalar Zym seeks.
I know nothing about it.
Those were his men chasing you.
They attacked our monastery.
So, will you escort me to Hyrkania?
We will wait for Khalar.
We? There is no we.
I will go to Hyrkania as my master instructed.
I said, we will wait.
I said, I win go to Hyrkania.
Why must I be tied up?
Keep quiet and do as you're told.
What are you going to do with him?
I will wait for him to awaken.
I wanna look him in the eyes when I kill him.
Do you have a name?
My name is Tamara Amaliat Jorvi Karushan.
And yours is?
Conan.
Conan.
That's it?
How many names do I need?
Why would you save me only to tie me up?
Khalar's a hard man to find.
If I possess you, he must come to me.
Possess? I am not your property.
Go to sleep.
I take instruction from no man.
I am a monk of the Order of Shaipur.
My people have never been conquered by anyone the likes of you and I'm not about to...
Open.
What?
Quiet.
Still no word from Remo and his scouts?
They're gone. Remo will bring her here.
He has never disappointed me.
The prize is near, Father.
Soon you will have not only the mask, but the blood to fill it.
Marique, how your mother yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.
Imagine the secrets she will bring back from the realm of the dead.
And imagine how indomitable I will become when she's once again by my side.
Father...
If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...
It will not fail.
If it does...
It will not!
Your mother will return to me.
My powers are growing inside of me.
My mother's blood flows through me.
I can help you uncover the secrets of Acheron, just as she did.
I can have them all kneeling before you, just as I kneel before you now.
My Marique, you are like your mother.
In so many ways.
But you are not her.
Here. Drink.
The truth this time.
Why does Khalar want you?
I am a simple monk.
I am of no value to a warlord.
She's lying!
It's her blood. Her blood is special.
She's last of the bloodline of Acheron.
Wait.
Don't kill him yet.
You are mistaken.
That bloodline ended a thousand years ago.
You lie, whore.
You can kill him now.
No, please.
For her, I can get you a king's ransom.
It is true.
Khalar has been searching for a pureblood descendant for 20 years.
Then we will wait for Khalar.
No. He will not come this way.
Zym will be camped in the Shaipur Ravine waiting for me.
I can show you.
Yeah.
Come.
Come on!
You see? I speak the truth.
If you want, he will give your weight in gold for this woman.
I will arrange everything.
I will deliver the message.
Yes, you will.
Remo returns.
What does it say?
"The Shaipur Outpost at midday."
"Come alone."
It's hers.
You're bold, Northerner.
I admire courage, even when it's foolish.
Your reward.
- I do not want your gold.
- No?
Then what?
I want your head.
Yes, of course you do.
Kill him.
Then bring me the pureblood.
Conan!
Come on!
Who are you?
You left me behind to watch my father die.
Cimmerian.
That was your chance, boy.
You won't get another.
Wouldn't your father be ashamed of you?
Yeah.
Come on!
Huh? Boy?
Run!
No!
By Mitra, jump!
I had him.
Artus, I had him.
The gods are cruel.
Blast the gods. This was not their doing.
It was I who failed.
Are the tales they tell true?
Does he have eyes red as fire and a hide of golden scales?
He is just a man.
Then it is he who has failed.
In fact, you may be the only man in Hyboria to fight Khalar Zym and live.
I need to go ashore and find him.
After I go, you must take her some place safe.
She saved my life.
For that, she has my loyalty.
Then she has mine as well.
Charming man, your friend.
Most men are born to mother's milk.
His first taste was of his mother's blood.
He was battle born.
So all he can do is kill?
Oh, no. He has the heart of a king, the loyalty of a bloodhound.
The Barbarians may be warriors, but they do not sacrifice their children or enslave their allies like the priests and princes of the civilized world.
As for his manners...
You look like a harlot.
Yes. And apparently I'm the only woman you've ever met who isn't one.
Cimmerian women dress as warriors.
Give her the leather and the armor.
I think he likes you.
Wake up! Wake up!
All hands on deck!
No!
How many Cimmerians died at the edge of that blade?
Catch!
Not bad.
Farewell, good friend.
May you find what you seek, Conan.
It would seem our friend has forgotten his map of the shoreline.
You should take it to him.
And say goodbye.
We set sail at dawn.
Don't be late.
You should go back to the ship.
Do you ever wonder if our actions serve some plan?
Some purpose spun by the gods?
Or are we all just doomed to chaos and ruin?
I know not and I care not.
I live, I love, I slay, and I am content.
Goodbye.
Conan!
The elusive one. Welcome.
You have made a mistake.
I am not the person you are looking for.
It is she.
The pureblood descendent of the Necromancers of Acheron.
I'm looking for a thief.
Argalon is a city of thieves.
I'm looking for a thief named Ela-Shan.
Who are you to ask, Barbarian?
Stand down, you fools!
Fast as Yezud, he will gut you like a fish.
I owe this man my life.
Well, Ela-Shan, you will have your chance to repay it.
Come.
This is madness.
Breaking into Khalar Zym's fortress is like reaching under a sleeping dragon to steal her eggs.
Why go in?
There's a woman inside.
She must be really pretty.
My mother wore this gown on her wedding day. It flatters you.
I'm not your mother.
No? But you will be.
Imagine that your body is a vessel.
And your soul is the water that fills it.
When your blood seeds the mask, my father will empty you.
Then I welcome death.
Your death shall herald a new age of Acheron.
The spirits I raise will melt flesh from the bones of kings.
And my wife will make me a god, and we will cast all rivals into oceans of blood.
Please. I beg you one last time.
Do not do this. Let us turn back.
Come on.
Did you know
I met your Barbarian when he was a boy?
That I took this sword from him?
I'm told Cimmerian steel is sharper and harder than any other, that when it cuts, the pain is close to pleasure.
I know that will please you.
That was the last gate.
I told you, you see?
I told you I can get you in.
You!
A feast for my sword.
No! A feast for the Dweller!
Hey!
- Watch out!
- No! No!
Conan!
Conan, watch out!
No! Hey!
Conan!
Oh, Shit!
- Get me out of here!
- Use a key!
- I can't! I dropped them!
- Then pick the lock!
With what?
Hey! Help me!
Careful! Be careful!
Drop!
Hey! Hey!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hey! Help me. Hey!
Get me out of here!
I'm dying! I'm gonna die!
You scream like a woman.
I think it's this way.
Hey, hey, wait for me.
Yeah, I think he's headed to Skull Cave.
I see no more locks down there.
Your debt is paid.
Farewell, my friend.
If you ever need me again, you know where to find me!
As a victorious Barbarian sword once shattered the mask, so shall a vanquished
Barbarian sword revive it.
Pureblood.
Behold and despair your new master.
Maliva!
My queen!
Hear my call!
Barbarian.
I don't like you any more.
Jump to the ledge!
Get up! Hide!
That was your chance, Khalar.
And you won't get another.
I smell you.
Conan!
Barbarian!
You're too late. She belongs to me!
Die!
Get out! Tamara, run! Run!
I'm going to kill you with your own father's blade.
You are not worthy of my father's sword.
Come.
Come on.
Get up.
Go!
Run!
Barbarian! I'm coming for you!
Tamara!
Maliva!
I summon you here.
His witch possesses me.
I can't fight her.
No!
Drop me, Conan, please!
Once again, the little Cimmerian boy is caught holding a chain.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Boy.
There is no shame in kneeling before me.
Conan, please!
She will live forever.
Drop the chain.
Let go of the chain, Conan.
And let another die in your place?
Like your father?
Drop me!
I warned him that one day
I would become a god.
And my father warned you, god or not...
Let me go!
You will fall!
Maliva!
Give me your hand.
Thank you for bringing me home.
I know you have to leave.
Live well, Tamara.
Till' we meet again.
This sword we make will be yours one day.
But before you wield it, you must understand it.
And the next candidate
for Buckston High School
Green Committee President,
Kyle Kingson.
True or false... you are an aggressively unattractive person.
Hatchet face, face-ache, face like burnt lego?
Or did you only just miss the beauty boat.
Any which way, best embrace the suck.
Beautiful people get it better.
That's just the way it is.
So-So... what does this got to do with running for
Green Committee President?
Not much. Except... you'll never elect me 'cause of my commitment to the environment.
I don't have one.
I want this for my transcript.
But what you got to ask yourselves is, should you vote for me just because I'm the rich, popular, goodlooking guy with the famous dad?
And the answer is, hell yeah.
Palm of your hand, man, palm of your hand.
Stellar Angels in America essay.
I appreciate all the extra time you spent with me, Mr. Bernstein.
You hate that teacher's guts.
Whatever it takes,
'til the college recs are in.
Speech killed.
Speaking of killing, you see that ball-biting, voodoo-tatted slut.
But really, who gives?
Stick to my mantra steer clear of the witch.
I'll put it out of your head later.
What the shit?
Maybe it's just me, but shouldn't whoever runs the Green Committee actually care about things green?
Or be green, like the rest of your facially disabled coven?
Throw it to someone deserving.
Lindy Taylor's only going for Treasurer because she knew she couldn't win
President against you.
No, no, no. I...
But I think we're all hoping that in the privacy of the voting booth your bandwagoneers will stop fearing for their social lives and make the right choice.
And might I just add, looks are important to you.
They're important to everyone.
Except you, clearly.
Appreciate the smear campaign and kudos to you and your bitchcrafty friend for staging a little coup, but if you wanted Prez, you shoulda had...
Actually, I don't want Prez,
I don't know Kendra and
I don't let others speak for me.
But maybe that's just me being the defensive scholarship kid. So, best of luck tomorrow.
And it's nice to finally meet you after three years.
How are you?
Not bad.
Elections today.
Great.
No, not you.
I was talking to my son.
- Did us proud.
- Yeah, all right.
Experimented with heroin too.
Terrific. Uh, wait, hold on. Jill,
I got to go.
Hey, I'm sorry, Jill got canned.
Yeah, it's probably the way the baby ten looked on camera.
And she's a big-boned girl to begin with.
People like people who look good.
Anyone who says otherwise is dumb or ugly.
- Who's Jill?
- I told you about her.
I don't think so.
And I know this because the last time we had a conversation that lasted more than five minutes was sophomore year.
I hear you.
Why don't you leave me alone?
When I told you
I had brain cancer.
And? Oh, shoot. Hang on.
Rob Kingson.
What?
Nothing. I say good night.
Why, 'cause you need to get home to your sixteen children?
My three children live in Jamaica with their father, which you know.
Do me a favor.
Save the sob stories for your heart-to-hearts with Mr. Clean.
You no vex me, you stoosh ginnygog.
And next year's GC president
Kyle Kingson.
Josh Black, please report
to the principal's office.
Don't think it was a landslide, if it makes you feel better.
And... and I'm sorry.
Is bullshit one word or two?
No, it's not...
And I want to make it up to you.
I get two Green Party VIP passes.
Scores you greenroom access, that kinda thing. Want one?
- What's the catch?
- No catch.
- So I'd be like, going with you?
- Yeah.
What about your girl friend?
Deep-fried barbie doll e-dumped me last night.
Hey, I don't know what game this is, but I'll play.
Really?
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Besides, you know what they say about me, don't you?
Vicious gossip.
And only idiots screw with witches.
Careful now.
Tell me you did not get a cheap-ass rose.
Them no have the orchid.
They didn't have it?
I told you two weeks ago to order it.
You tell me yesterday,
But listen.
"A symbol of humility, the white rose also say,
'I am loyal and worthy of you.'"
WTF?
And it also means
I am loyal and worthy of you.
- Go blow a goat.
- I'm sorry.
The orchid was this year's yellow ribbon.
It was a political statement.
Thanks for making me look like an insensitive bitch.
I mean does it suck so bad?
No, it's... badass.
Did I ever congratulate you on treasurer?
Probably never apologized for my aholian election behavior either.
Well... two weeks ago was the first and last time you spoke to me in three years.
So, um... no.
Sorry on all counts.
Got to slave here all night?
Slaving all year.
Work-study?
Yeah. I'm saving for the Machu Picchu trip.
But my shift's almost over.
Just in time for the real fun.
Yeah, right.
She blows it off.
Too cool for school?
Definitely not. Just...
Not your thing.
That, and... well, that.
What can I say?
I'm substance over style.
A dying breed.
Never too late to join.
Think I already drank the kool-aid.
Always hope.
- Take a picture with me.
- What?
School newspaper.
But I'll need to approve it before it runs.
Hold up.
- What else'll I do with it?
- "I'm worthy of you."
What?
What white roses mean.
Lamecore, I know.
And obviously not what I, uh, thought you meant.
No, it's just...
See you later.
Don't be a stranger.
- What's with her?
- Pity mack.
Cause you got a flesh-eater at 4 o'clock.
And here we go.
You actually bought it.
You bought that I'd hook up with you the self-mutilated, tatted Frankenskank who publicly humiliated me, almost cost me the election?
No dice, sunshine.
But hey, you can buy a ticket.
Or here's a secret.
Sometimes they let you in just 'cause you're eye candy.
She eye-candy?
Rules are she needs a ticket.
Ah well, que sera, sera.
Spanish for sucks to be an ugly cow.
I only came to give you a second chance.
- Guess I blew it.
- I Guess so.
But Kyle?
Best embrace the suck.
Relax. Kyle,
I already forgave you. Come on.
God, you're sweating like a pig.
You see the way she looked at me?
So what?
- I got to go.
- Kyle.
How are you feeling, Kyle?
Kendra? What're you doing here?
I'm here for everyone who just missed the beauty boat.
What?
And all the self-mutilating, tatted Frankenskanks.
It was Ajoke.
I didn't get it.
But pretty soon, you will.
You have a year to find someone to love you.
Before the tree blooms again.
When the spring flowers bloom again, the year is up,
And either the words "I love you" will release you from the spell or stay like this forever.
Like what?
No!
No!
No!
As aggressively unattractive outside as you are inside.
Wait!
You have a year
to find someone to love you.
Or stay like this forever.
Dad.
Jesus, you scared me.
Don't turn on the light.
- Why?
- Please.
What's going on?
Why do you love me?
Kind of a question is that?
- Just answer it.
- Because you're my son.
But-But do you believe in magic?
Magic? What the hell are you...
Kyle?
His vision and hearing.
That's all you've got?
And, of course, his insides are just as normal as-as they were before, but the skin won't change no matter what we do.
Now, what about skin grafts or face transplants?
I mean, look at him, look at him.
He doesn't want to live life looking like this.
We'd risk anything.
What?
Kyle, we are going to find somebody else.
I'm not taking
"no" from Dr. Crap-For-Brains.
We will fix this.
Yes, because we'd risk anything, including me dying.
No-No, that's not what I meant.
It just came out that way.
Or did it come out because that is what you meant?
No.
Come on.
I have a surprise for you.
What do you think, Kyle?
It's private, safe.
People can't be spying all the time.
Plus, I'm thinking I might get you that motorcycle you've always wanted.
Where's your room?
It's right across the hall.
Don't worry. I will take care of whatever you need.
Still need to get my stuff.
But we're keeping the place in the city?
So I can crash there late nights if need be.
Dad?
Yeah?
Hey, hey.
Okay, I have a four-o'clock call, so I will check in right after that.
And Zola's right here. Okay?
Who're you?
Mary Poppins.
The tutor. Uh, your dad hired me.
I'm supposed to move in today.
Tell my father he can carpe diem in hell.
Happy to.
Meantime, how about you cage the rage and invite me in for a nice, hot bowl of Dad sucks?
Saw right through that one, Oprah?
Yeah, it's a little gift I have.
Especially since I can't actually see.
- Hi, I am Will.
- Come in.
I'll get Zola.
She'll welcome you to hell, fix you up with your own bedroom, and explain what happened to me and- and what I did to deserve this.
Oh, and please-please, hang with us.
Gouge the old man for everything he's worth.
He deserves it.
You know what?
Obviously, he forgot to spin the borderline hostile act of hiring a blind guy to tutor his creep show son.
As for learning calculus,
I think I'll take a pass.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry, I come back later.
How old are your kids?
Sixteen, thirteen, ten.
You just left them?
Can't get them green cards.
But you left them.
Parents do what they do with what they know.
They were not very big when I leave.
It was five years.
For my little one, it is half his life.
There is a hole in my heart.
So I know your father will come.
I don't think so.
Rob Kingson. Leave a message.
It's me.
Could you do me a favor?
I, uh, I know we were rescheduling for the next week, or maybe it was the week after, but...
Maybe we should...
Maybe we should just not pretend anymore.
Sweet.
Kendra!
Kendra!
Kendra! Kendra!
I am begging you.
Please make it end. Please.
I can't do that.
But-But I get it.
L... I know what it's like to be shit-ugly.
So-So you got me, five months is enough,
I learned the lesson.
You learned nothing.
Find someone who can see better than you can.
Seven more months for someone to say, "I love you."
Please! Make this go away!
Sloan?
That sounded like Kyle, didn't it?
Weird. I suck not writing him back.
I suck more.
Well, but honestly, with him gone, it's kind of a relief.
Like, I always felt like I had to be on and mean, like really mean... to keep him entertained.
And I know what you mean.
Hey.
Sorry.
And I'm sorry to spy on you, spying.
Unbelievable.
But it does sort a feel like the death of romance unfolding before your very eyes, doesn't it?
Doesn't she have a boyfriend?
Yes, this is what I'm saying.
What happened to romance?
Sappy, soppy longhand love letters and you really, really don't have to keep listening to me, by the way.
Thing is that guy they were talking about?
They're way off.
Personally I respect that he called things as he saw them, even if he did see them wrong.
Do you know what it really was?
What?
He was a shot of life.
You're kidding, right?
How do you do that?
I went to this dance and some emo chick gave me a dart hex.
Bite me.
Oh hey, now you're up, want to learn something?
- No!
- Be careful.
Lose your smarts, blondes will be telling jokes about you.
My dad always said that how much people like you is directly proportional to what you look like.
But they hated me.
High school unquestionably sucks ass.
You went to regular school?
At fifteen, my friends lost their virginity.
I lost my sight.
But living hell has its upside.
- Like better hearing?
- Yeah.
And chicks dig blind guys.
Too bad they don't dig ugly guys.
How do you know?
Defying expectations,
Blindie keeps up his bitchin' sense of style.
A holdover from my seeing days.
Point being, no matter what, how you look matters?
Point being, it's not about how others look at me, it's about how I look at myself.
Mental Rubiks cube, I know, but one day it'll make sense.
Ass-wipe.
You have the humor of a marmot.
So, I heard someone sneaking in late last night.
Where'd you go?
Isn't the benefit of having no parents that you have no parents?
Get off my back.
But, uh, you know, since we last talked,
I've been thinking and... is there any kind of eye operation?
'Cause I saw, like, every doctor in the country.
Miracles only, but thanks.
So where did you go last night?
I went to see about this girl.
I'm so happy for you!
I didn't even talk to her.
Baby steps. You think you might say, "Wassup?"
The benefit of you being blind is you can't see how I should so never say, "Wassup."
Baby steps. We must celebrate.
One, two, three. Wassup!
Fore!
One, two, three. Wassup!
Wassup.
Wassup!
- Here's a sandwich, Ben.
- Thanks.
How's your dad?
Stayin' out of trouble?
Dad, I'm home. Dad?
Come on.
Dad!
I don't have it.
Please, Victor, come on.
Just hook me up.
Just another week.
I just need a little more time.
No-No-No, I'm not screwing around, you sorry-ass addict.
- Dad, not this again.
- I'm sorry, Lindy
Hey, shut up.
And you get out of here.
Victor, please.
We'll get you your money.
Give me and my brother our money.
Dad!
No!
Where is she?
You killed him.
Your daughter for my brother.
Someday I'll find her.
I wouldn't.
What do you need?
Come on, what do you want?
I want her.
I'm want to protect her.
I can protect her.
Please. Did you hear him?
If she stays with me, she-she'll be safe.
I don't know who you are.
But if she leaves...
If she leaves... cops will get these.
No. It's just too twisted.
So's killing a man.
But what's she gonna think of you?
Zola, remember.
Hunter, not Kyle. Hunter.
Hello, I'm Zola.
- Where is he?
- You can go.
I'm not gonna just leave you here.
With some stranger?
Son of an old friend.
For your safety.
Bullshit and I can take care of myself.
- I let you say goodbye.
- No need.
How'm I gonna know you're okay?
You're not.
Deal is, I give up my life, my whole life, school, friends, everything, everything.
And in return, you don't come see me, don't call me, don't do anything.
Just stay away.
I screwed up, keep screwing up, I know that, but I don't know what else to do...
You can leave.
So I'm here, okay?
Whoever you are.
You come near me, I taser your ass.
So that makes two of us.
- I got you food.
- Call someone who gives.
I'd really like to explain.
Please come out.
Inviting.
What?
This time go to Barneys, get Manolos or whatever sick-expensive kind Sloan and her bimbots loved.
Everything you say to me about her, everything I see, tells me she's not the kind.
Prada, then.
To be bought.
I'm not trying to buy her.
You are. And she'll hate that.
So what, then?
What do you know about her?
You must think about her.
Me know you see who she is.
Go on. Think.
It's like you don't even know me.
This whole thing is all kinds of mess.
It's just a bad scene.
There's nothing remotely good and I miss everybody.
I miss being able to go out and get deli coffee whenever I want.
And the clinic.
And everything that made me me.
No, it's way screwed up and he thinks he can give me a few presents and, like, that fixes everything.
I know it's just for a little while, but I'm hating it.
I hate missing school, hate my dad, just hate hating.
And I know it's life or death but I've been saving for that Machu Picchu trip for three years.
You know, the first thing
I did in my life just for me, just because I wanted to.
Lindy-Lindy journeys to a wonder of the world and finally seizes her moment and...
Jesus, what's your problem?
What's with the mask?
I didn't want to freak you out.
Sure. The ski mask didn't freak me out.
I, uh, I-I got you Jujyfruits.
Can I ask you something?
Why am I here?
Because you need to be protected.
But I can take care of myself.
You don't even know me.
But my Dad and-and-and your Dad...
I know, his mysterious
"friend from the past."
He wanted someone they couldn't trace you to.
He's scared out of his mind something will happen to you.
Because of how much he loves you.
Which he kept saying over and over.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Thanks for the Jujyfruits.
You're welcome.
The thinking thing killed. Killed.
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.
The real kind. Longhand.
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.
Now, you're doing what?
Seeing if I can build a greenhouse.
She's very into roses.
Each color means something different, you know?
Yeah. Well, they all kind of mean,
I'm a guy who cries over chick flicks and sleeps with stuffed animals.
I'm not here.
Hey. I'm Lindy.
Hi. Will. A pleasure.
I, uh... heard the game.
- You a Rangers fan?
- Die-hard.
I knew it. Guys' gal.
Guys' gal.
- Why don't you join me?
- Thanks.
Sure.
What's with all the tools?
Uh, it's Hunter's thing.
It's a structure on the roof.
Structure for what?
You ever see the 1954
Devil Girl from Mars flick, where they abduct virginal teenage girls for breeding stock?
I'm just... It's a joke-joke. Sorry.
I haven't gotten out much.
I'm losing my social graces.
Rewind.
Hi. Will. Pleasure.
The building books belong to Hunter, an all-around, way-good guy who's contemplating building a greenhouse.
- A greenhouse?
- Yeah.
Rad.
Right?
Very funny.
So are we gonna, like, really meet?
- Like, now?
- No.
Okay.
You lived here your whole life?
No. Pretty recently.
I was living with my dad, but he's the kinda guy who can't really deal...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
And your mom?
Mine's dead. I never knew her.
So... no mom... Screwed-up dad.
It's too bad we have nothing in common.
What's with the Korean TV?
You speak Korean?
- Fluently.
- Oh, really?
What are they saying?
"Bon Appetit."
She didn't say "Bon Appetit."
Oh, you speak Korean too?
I don't like to show off, but yes.
And Koreans do not say
Bon Appetit.
She said the Korean equivalent.
Which is what?
I hope you have a big appetite such that you scarf food and hurl chunks.
No that's the subjunctive.
I'll take Mom, you take Perm Boy.
Game on.
So what's she saying now?
I love you, but when it comes to hair, you are a clueless wonder
I can tell you for a fact that is not what she said.
What Mom said was...
Hope Will isn't your Korean teacher.
Do you, uh... do you miss school?
Like a natural-born wonk.
Cause, uh... I have classes if you want to come.
Yes. I'd love to
- Tomorrow?
- Sure.
Well, great.
I guess good night then.
Hold up.
Pretty gruesome, huh?
I've seen worse.
We're having school today, but you need to make it seem like we didn’t just start a-and I need to look smart.
Lindy's coming.
Shut up. What're we studying?
Don't worry, I'll come up with something graphic and humiliating.
No-No-No.
I need to know what it is now.
I need the answers in advance.
That's called cheating.
No, that's called trying to get a girl to like you while look like the lead in a slasher flick.
- Shakespeare sonnet?
- Obvious.
- E.E. Cummings.
- Cliche.
What's cliche is the guy liking school to impress the girl.
What about the Frank O'Hara poem
"Having a Coke with You"?
How do you know that poem?
I Googled
"modern poetry, impress girls."
But I need smart things to say.
Good luck with that.
I need another thinking thing.
Another thing Lindy'll like.
It's for this morning.
Please don't ask.
When my husband wanted me to marry him, he would weave me baskets.
Yeah, I really don't think that's gonna work.
- What about chocolate?
- Oh, no.
Come on.
She will like it when you are being kind.
Yeah, I suck at that
When you are being yourself.
What, this self or the jerk I was?
The man I know you to be.
How'd you do it?
I, uh, I just figured it out.
I love "Having a Coke With You."
- Shoot me now.
- What?
No, I mean, that's great, that you know all about it and will have lots of smart things to say.
Blind man climbing.
- Could you just hang on a sec?
- Ow! Blind guy tripping.
- You're okay?
- Peachy.
Zola, thanks for getting these.
And by the way, I'm up the creek.
It turns out "Having a Coke with You" is one of Lindy's favorites.
God, I'm looking forward to this class.
- Here you go.
- How'd you know?
Deli coffee, very underrated.
As I've always said.
Long-time green thumb?
No, no.
Actually my dad stuck me in this house so no one could see me.
And I thought I'd take the, the ugly and shameful thing and turn it into something not.
Of course, not everyone can necessarily see its beauty...
Just read.
Having a Coke with You is even more fun than going to San Sebastian,
Irun, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian partly because of my love for you.
We be back.
We... Oh, yeah, we be back. We be back.
Carry on.
In the warm New York
4 o'clock light we are drifting back and forth between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them
I look at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
I need more time.
Magic can't be undone.
But I might have a shot if I had more time.
Can't, sorry.
Okay. I pissed you off.
You wasted me.
But there's got to be something you can do.
Come on, help me.
I can't. And I wouldn't.
You still don't think about anyone but yourself.
You're wrong.
I do think about other people.
I think about Lindy and what her life is like and I think about a woman who can't see her kids and a man who can't see, period.
So he cares now?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, I'll keep trying with Lindy.
But please give Will his sight,
Zola her family.
It's the least they deserve after being trapped in this hell with me.
I'll help them. If you succeed.
And Kyle, good luck.
- I got your CDs.
- Thanks.
Just some guy at my old school.
- Kind of a jerk, actually.
- Really?
Yeah, we were on this committee together, so that's why I have his picture.
I mean... Looks-wise, he doesn't suck.
Oh! He knew it, too.
Same old, same old:
Jerks are exciting and my type falls for 'em.
- Did you fall for him?
- Not that I fell for him.
Every once in a while, you kind of remind me of him.
Not that you're a jerk.
Anyways, he disappeared. Rehab.
Oh, it figures. The addict's daughter falls for the addict.
So you did fall for him?
No, I mean, I just talked to him his last night.
For, like, a minute.
You know, the truly ridiculous thing is,
I might have, kind of, sort of, actually thought he, a little bit, liked me... ish.
Of course he did.
Oh, please.
He was completely on the in and I was not, am not.
That's why I like you.
Yeah, well... same.
Anyways, being on the in isn't all that.
Isn't that what people on the out say to make each other feel better?
Yeah. But it also happens to be true.
Something about him...
What?
Underneath all the bullshit was...
I don't know.
What?
Good.
Good?
So, I mean, are you still into him?
Like you said, you don't want to be the girl who falls for jerks.
Yeah. But he-he's not.
Right. He's a decent guy at heart.
That's what I'm thinking.
But still kinda... wrong.
Yeah.
I don't know.
You know, that something underneath, it's catnip for sappy tools like me.
To be the one who uncovers it.
Do you want to go somewhere with me?
Usually, if I'm out this time of night,
I'm looking for my dad, mace in hand, counting by primes.
Counting?
It keeps me from getting scared.
Oh. Fortunately, scary guy's right next to you.
So there's that.
What about when people see you?
They don't. I got it down.
I was good at blending in too.
This way.
You taking me to the park?
You'll see. Come on.
The zoo?
Hear that?
The animals. Water lapping.
In some nearby street, a man is whispering...
"I love you."
Do you hear that?
What?
Somewhere there's a baboon scratching his ass.
Why are we here?
This place is important to me.
It's still here.
What is it?
When I was in kindergarten, my dad offered to take me anywhere I wanted.
We came to the zoo.
He bought me all the toys and candy I wanted.
And at the end of the day, he told me my mother had left.
I haven't seen her since.
After he told me,
I ran away and hid in here.
And saw this movie.
It's about this mother elephant whose two babies die.
Plague or something.
She misses them so much that when she's migrating back a year later... a year later... she finds her babies' bones.
Can you imagine that love?
No.
I never brought anyone here before.
Seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven, twelve...
It feels like I've known you forever.
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...
The sun's coming up.
I think...
I think I love you.
Maybe I should let her go.
At least she'll be safe in Machu Picchu.
She has been jonesing for that trip forever, even without being stuck here.
But every day, she like you more and more.
But not the way I like her.
- Move your hands. My turn.
- Sorry.
I don't stand a chance.
She's still talking about running away. And...
I-I know you guys want out, too.
- Desperately.
- No.
Kidding. Kidding.
Look, even if she does go on the trip, you still have a couple days to ratchet up the romance quotient.
Just try to put yourself in her shoes.
This is all so strange for her, but me know she'll say those words, "I love you."
It's just the year is almost up.
Just take her to whatever bad-boy country house Daddy's got.
Daddy don't got.
Just the lake cottage.
Just the...
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Would you buy a frickin' vowel? Go!
Seriously?
After you.
So, are you, uh, dying of boredom yet?
No.
It must have been so great as a kid coming out here.
My dad got bad reception down at the lake.
He could only take it for about forty-five minutes.
But those forty-five minutes... they were awesome.
My Dad was a teacher.
You know, before my mom died and he lost it.
Do you miss your dad?
Not right now.
In the past few months, living away from my dad... not spending every second worrying about him,
I mean, not trying to fix everything for him,
Just not totally losing myself.
That's why I wanted to go away on that trip in the first place.
I guess this cage set me free.
Is that a "thank you"?
- Let's go down to the lake.
- Okay.
I've been writing something for you.
- What is it?
- A letter.
I'm sorry. This-This ring is only...
Hello?
Which hospital?
Okay. I'll... I'll... I'll call you back.
My father OD'd.
You have to go to him.
All aboard!
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go!
- I'll call you.
- He's gonna be fine.
Okay. I'll call you. And as soon as he's better, I'll come back.
And everything will be all right.
And Hunter...
Yeah?
You're a good friend.
Don't. Don't read that.
Don't read that.
Don't read that.
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.
The real kind. Longhand.
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.
And I'm going to write to you
every day for a long, long, long time
because I think-
I think I might be in danger of...
falling in love with you.
Hey, it's me.
Uh, my dad is gonna be okay, but
I really want to talk to you
about your letter.
Where are you?
Look, I don't understand.
You wrote me this letter.
Why don't you call me back?
Because I'm "a good friend."
What's going on?
Hunter...
I'm out of time.
Call her back.
Why, because I'm "a good friend?"
Yup.
And not calling her back, what good that do, huh?
She even called me.
Why won't you talk to her?
The last time I talked to her, she told me she's hurt.
And "hurt" is girl-speak for,
"Call now, bonehead."
She don't know what to do, so she go back to school to go on the trip.
Lindy!
What're you doing here?
I had to see you before you left.
- You wrote me that letter.
- I know.
- And then you didn't call me back.
- I'm sorry.
You knew what was going on with me.
I was being dumb.
- I just was scared you didn't...
- Didn't what?
Love me.
And I didn't think you could.
Because of how ugly I am.
And I should have known better, that that's not who you are.
You took one look at me and still said you'd seen worse.
Somehow... when I'm around you...
I don't feel ugly at all.
It's because you're not.
Go.
You deserve it.
Nothing's gonna change while you're gone.
That I can promise.
Go.
Go.
Hunter.
I love you.
Kyle.
Hunter!
Kyle!
Sorry, I'm looking for someone,
I don't mean to be rude.
- I get it.
- Thanks.
And sometime, you'll tell me what happened to you.
- I-I met someone.
- That's great.
She reminds me of you.
And she showed me that love can change you.
Do you think love change you?
Of course.
Then you'll believe the story
I'm about to tell you.
Where is he?
It's about a guy, good-looking on the outside, ugly on the inside.
And there's a curse.
Love-Love changes him.
Everyone knows that story.
What if it wasn't a story?
What if it were true?
What?
Can you imagine... that love?
Can you?
Yeah.
It's you.
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
It's a dream, right?
It's must be.
But happy.
Very damn happy.
Mr. Kingson, your new intern is coming up in the elevator,
I thought you might want to meet her.
Just so long as she's easy on the eyes.
Well she's a bit odd looking.
No dogfaces, no dumpy frumps.
But her reference said no matter what you throw her way, she can always work magic.
Please, I beg you...
I told the truth! I'm not a witch!
My daughter! No!

That's dead Enogh for me.

Thousands lost souls through the fires of Hell, a glorious day for the Church!
You call this  glorious ?!
Murdering women and children?
Know your place, Knight.
You pledge your life for the cause.
- For God, not for this.
I am a herald of God in this world, his voice rings ever in my ears.
Perhaps it's not his voice you hear.
- How dare you?
I am the voice of the church! bathed in truth and blameless in light of mine Lord.
You're no more than a robber blood on his hands!
Who controls your insolent tongue, Behmen?
Let's get the hell out of here.
You can not leave!
Who's going stop us?
Coast of Sryria
One month latter
Sheep roaming free and no shepherd in sight.
Did they jumped the fence?!
- All of them?
We have been walking all day and  have not passed a soul.
Keep your souls and only find a chicken.
Hello !
Is anyone here?
Hello!
What happened to them?!
- I do not know.
We have seen so much death you and Some deserved, some not.
But What is one do,to deserve a death like that? - Nothing.
Finally a town!
We might be recognized.
We should go around, Behmen.
- Go where?!
The horses won't carry us.
They are farm animals.
We need Propper Hourses food... Provisions.
Please, let them come to me!
- I beg you!
Please, take us! No more!
Lord all mighty, Heavenly Father
Accept the pain and suffering we restore upon our selves.
Find deed to the awkward to free us!
From this Terbile suffer.
What madness is this? - Plague.
Plague?!
Like No other.
The pestilence over all the land.
Is there no cure? - None.
How long is it been so?
Three years in a season.
- How many dead?
Some says as many in three and four.
But with my own hands I have buried two children and the wife who born them.
But, How is it you you dont know this? - We're travelers, we have only recently returned.
Here you are, two of my finest.
- Thank you.
Leave it!
Felson, this way.
What is it now?
They saw my sword's Crest.
I told we should've gone around.
You two! Stand fast!
Shit!
Fine.
Come with me.
Drop it!
Remove the hood and the mask.
Arest these deserters.
Wait!
Let me see that.
This is yours?
Follow me.
I hope we are on our way to dinner.
- What you want with us, Priest?
That's not up for me to say.
Pardon me, your eminent.
- What is it, Debelzaq?
This the knight's sword.
Come closer.
Tell me your name.
- I am Behmen of Blybrook.
Behmen, yes ...And your comrade,
Felson. Your names are known to me.
Your victories have become legends.
Yes, I'm stricken...
The Plague is everywhere.
It's a curse called up from Hell.
Brought upon us by
The Black Witch.
The Black Witch?!
I myself heard the confession.
The Witch must be taken to the abbey of Severak, where the Monks possess the last copy of an ancient book, rituals that will destroy the Witch's powers,
And End... the plague.
What is this to do with us?
Our ranks have been decimated.
You must deliver her.
My best knight, Eckhart has allready pledged his services, as has our priest Debelzaq.
I ask the same of you.
Will you serve the church, once more?
I can not.
- You swear in front of God.
Have you been released from this vow?
- My vow is to God...
...not the men how murder in his name.
You know the penalty for desertion.
I ask again Behmen of Blybrook.
Do you serve God and the church ?
I serve the church no more.
In there...
...both of you.
What do they do with deserters any way?
Hang them?
Burn them?
Probably both. - I know.
If I the one who say on the matter... I prefer to hanging.
Is that the witch?!
That It is not what I see.
The priest said she confessed.
We both know the church can be Most ... persuasive.
I am Sorry, I Put you into this Felson.
These dungeons go.
And this one is not so bad, we spent nights in much worse places than this.
At least i have. What's that smell?
That would be you.
"I serve the church No more"
Did you see the priest face?
He looked like someone pissed in his holly water.
 They are godless people!
Infidels!
They sinned against God and against his only son, Jesus Christ! 
They must be punished!
You want to speak with the Cardinal?
Tell him we will deliver the girl to Severak, on one condition.
That she is given a fair trail.
You can not bargain with the church.
- This is not for your church.
And we want our weapons returned.
And all charges dismissed.
We're here. The abbey is here.
The distance is nearly 400 leagues
That's roughly Six days travel.
As you can see, we charted a course.
- You would lead us through here?
That is the most direct route, yes.
- Across the river, through...
300 Leagues of heavy forest, and a mountain pass?
This forest is called Wormwood.
It's not a place to be trifled with.
Men have lost their way there, and were never to be seen again.
Tell me, Priest, have you ever made a journey yourself?
No. - Natuarally.
These are the best maps in the land.
But, we will do better to have a guid.
You know, someone who has travelled from here to there.
A tax collector, prehaps a merchant?
There is someone, but...
Ah... Visitors! What can
I do for you gentlemen?
Prehaps, you woud like to  help me with fruit, or kick me in the groin.
You're Hagamar? The swindler?!
Yes. I mean no!
I am Hagamar, but I never swindled anyone.
I sold relics. Genuine Relics.
Where did sell your trinkets?
Everywhere. I have happy customers from here to Prague.
And in Severak? - Yes.  The monks.
I sold them the tail of an asteroid and a flit from Egypt.
Quite a bargin, I am sure.
Then you know the way to the abbey.
- Like the back of my hand.
I'd happy to draw  you a map, only...
The bailiff has prepared to pardon you.
On one condition.
You serve as our guide to
Severak. - Condition accepted.
If I were to relase you however, and you attempt to flee ...
Such thoughts are beneath you sir, I swear by all the saints, me they struck me dead , were I to lie.
They will have to get in line behinde me.
Do we understand each other?
The Witch is unconscious, she was given a powerfull sedative in her food  last night.
Open the cell.
We will be removing the witch for transport.
She's just a girl.
- Don't be deceived.
Catch her Felson!
Hold her!
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.
Now she is sedated.
Who is that? - The Witch. - Witch?
No body said anything about a witch.
What did you think we are going to Severak, to sell trinkets?
Kill the witch!
You gave us this infection!
You brought the wrath of God upon us!
Take the witch out of our land.
And take the plague with you!
Demon!
She is watching me.
Put your mind on something else.
She is trying to frighten you.
It's working.
How did you come upon this girl?
She was found just outside  of Maburn, wandering, muttering strange things words, no one can understand.
This makes her a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.
And with in the fourth night of her arrival, plague has swept over us.
It was the same for every town she passed.
There's no talk of such a girl passing through my village...
...yet, the plague came.
She is stronger than she looks.
Do you belive she is a witch?!
But you felt her strength, would you say, it was that of a girl?
I have seen girls destroy men without lifting a finger.
How many times do we need to go over this? We were in France, for God sake.
And things she did in the bed chamber.
She robbed you out of the year's wages.
Yes, but...
... she gave me so much in return.
Look at us. Barely a month out of service to the church and here we are deserters, in the service of the church.
You know we are being followed.
Let's give him a royal welcome.
Come of the horse.
Who are you and why you're following us?
I asked you a question boy.
He's an altar boy and services to the Cardinal.
My name is Kay.
My father was a knight.
Yuran Wolenbar, he also faught in "Imbrose" prehaps you have heard his name.
What do you want? - I want to come with you to Severak.
Easy boy.
To pledge myself to your service.
In exchange, for which I ask your word that you will vouch for me upon our return, so that
I may be knighted.
The services of an altar boy
I feel safer already.
I would have you know, I have been written in the lists twice and I won flags for valor.
That's not a tournament boy.
Go back to your mother.
This is a free road oldman and I do not need your permission to travel it.
Give the lad a chance to retract the remark.
My sincere apologies.
Not to me, to him. - That I can not. He insulted me first.
I am going to teach this one some manners.
- Go easy, Felson. Use the other hand.
I do not want him dead.
Just send him on his way.
Be quick about it.
With pleasure.
Not bad for an altar boy.
What the devil was that?
Stand and fight like  a man, you little jackrabbit.
Enough!
Perhaps you can be of service.
I heard what the cardinal said, about Your heroism in the Crusades.
I'd have gone too but I was too young.
You're one of the lucky ones!
Well,Tell me about it, where did you enlist?
It was a priest who came to Felson's village.
He told us: "whoever went on Crusade, would receive blessings from the church"
"Remission from sin".
It was the part about sin that perk young Felson is interest.
That's not true. - So he asks the priest :
"what sins would be forgiven"...
"Would they forgive adultery?"
The priest says : "Yes".
For two year pledge".
"What about theft?"
"Yes, for a three year pledge "
So Felson mulls it over and says to the priest:
"Better sign me up for ten"
I brought you some food.
And warmth.
You're not like the others.
You're kind.
Was it Debelzaq, who hurt you?
This place you taking me...
What will happen to me there?
Your innocence or guilt will be decided.
There was a girl in my village who was suspected of being a witch.
They put stones in her pockets and cast her into the lake.
If she drown, they would have known she was human.
But she didn't.
She lived.
They called it proof of magic, and burned at the stake.
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.
You will be given a fair trial.
You have my word on that.
She has talk anything?!
Why are you ask?
- I only want alert him.
The witch is deceiver. She turn one man against the another.
Whose to guard the wagen.
Guard the wagen?
The girl is caged.
And I am tired. - I will go.
Prehaps someone else should take the first watch. - I'll go.
Do not worry, lad, there will be plenty of time between here and  Severak.
Eckhart be watchfull.
I came to relieve you.
Not tired?
No. No!
I don't sleep much these days.
I was thinking about how much the girl reminds me of my daughter.
Sorry for your lose.
What her name?
- Mila, her name was Mila.
Tell me, father...
You say the Cardinal has given his word that she will have a fair trial.
But has he not also given his word end to the plague?
What do you suggesting? - Can you imagin the reaction of the people if she were not to be found guilty of witchcraft.
No Father, you know as well as I the church cannot afford that, not now.
No.
No, our responsibility is to deliver her for trail.
The monks will decide her fate.
Exactly.
The monks will decide her fate and I will not be a part of this,
No will the others, hopfully when they have heared what I have to say.
Wait! Please do not go.
Please, do not leave me alone with him.
Are you afraid?
Listen to me. - Eckharte...
I am not let it... - Calm down.
Give me that key!
How did she escape?
She took the key from around my neck.
Which way did she go?
Maybe she followed this road to the village.
Kay and Eckhart that way.
She's in the squar!
There she is.
This is a grave... this is a mass grave.
 Father!
Wait here.
 Father?
Mila? - Father?
 I'm here.
Eckhart!
- Mila?!!!! -  Father? 
- Mila ....
-  Father , where are you?
- Mila! My child.
-  Father? Is that you?
- Do not run away! - Father.
Mila?!
Papa...
Mila?
Eckhart!
Felson! Behmen! Where you are?
He came running out of no where.
Why did not he stopped?
Why did not he see me?
What dear God, what have I done?
What have I done?
He looked me in the eye, but he didn't see me.
He called me Mila.
Behmen.
I had to run, I had no choice.
I could not let him touch me again, I'm so sorry.
Please Please, do not take me back there.
Please, I beg you, please...
Heavenly Father, we pray thee. take thy servant Johan Eckhart, own to the Heavenly realm.
For he was a soldier of the cross and fought in thy name, and in the name of Thy only Son,
Jesus Christ.
And thus did he die for the  glory of God.
Amen.
Amen.
Would anyone care to offer some words?
Let his sacrifice, not be in vain.
Behmen!
Behmen! I must speak with you.
What is it now, Priest? - You must warn the others be careful in her presence, not to, not to discuss personal matters, things she might use against...
Listen to me!
It was the witch, killed Eckhart.
You heard what Kay said, his mind was not his own.
She overheard us talking of his daughter.
What exactly are you suggesting?
She sees the weakness that lies in our hearts.
And once she sees that, she will use against us.
Crusader!
I am truly grateful for your help.
You're very brave.
A man like you could never stand to see young girl come to any harm.
Debelzaq believes , you are the blame for Eckhart death.
And you believe him?
After what he did to me?
I had no reason to harm Eckhart, he was nothing but kind to me.
He told me, I look like his daughter.
I can see his death weighs heavy on your mind.
Allow me to ease your pain.
Some good deeds can done even from behind bars.
Kay... remember this,
It was not your fault.
It was the witch. No one else.
He died by my sword.
It could just as easily have been another's. - But it was not.
It was mine. I killed him.
Why are we stopped?
You call that a bridge?
Last time I saw it was eight or nine years ago.
I remember it differently.
Is that our reward for taking a swindler as our guide.
I told you, I am not a swindler. - You're not much of a guide either, are you?!
How we are supposed to get across this rotting temper.
You are blaming me for the bridge?
You're the one who led us to it.
You're the one...
Behmen.
Behmen!
Take everything of the wagon!
Bring the horses across.
One by one.
It will be on my count of three.
One, two, three!
My hands!
Can not hold out much longer!
Help!
Hagamar, hitch a rope to the horses, that we will use them to pull the wagon.
If you let me out, it will be lighter.
Please, I can help.
It won't hold. - It will, push.
Push!
You won't make it!
Let me out.
Come on! - Push!
That was a little too close!
I've saved your ass a hundred times. Have a little faith.
Kay, bring me a fresh wrap for priest's hand.
It would be a shame if you bleed to death.
Thank you.
Felson!
The flask.
Really?
What is this place?
Hagamar, where are we?
The Wormwood forest.
Damn fog, like a veil before my eyes. - We haven't strayed from the path, have we??
I can barely see my own hand in front of my face.
The only reason you're around is because you claimed you knew the way.
I know the way, it's just i can't see the way.
Maybe you like to try leading the way, huh?
Enough, both of you!
Okay, we camping on the road.
Wait for the fog past.
Kay told me what happened on the bridge.
He says, you saved his life.
With one hand.
Hard to believe.
We believe what we want to believe.
Do you believe I am a witch, Behmen?
You are not afraid of me, are you?
Trouble sleeping?
My self as well.
I am not sure if it's the fog, the altitude...
It's unsettling.
Even for a knight.
Let alone spineless scavenger like my self!
That's not what I meant.
No...!
Behmen, how many more are going to die before we reach a Severak?
None, if I can help it. - And if you can't, what then what?
Forgive me if I seem reluctant to put my life in your hands.
But I have a better solution.
We kill the bitch! Here and now, be done with it.
We tell whose back in "Molbow", she tried to escape, she meant us harm... What can we do? We had no choice.
And who will be the wiser?
I, for one.
Did you hear that? - What it's it?
What is happening? - Listen. - Quite.
Wolfs.
What do we do?
Kill many as you can.
Oh no. - Get the horses,
I'll take the wagon.
Behmen!
It's too late.
We can not help him.
Behmen! What are you doing?
Behmen, what are you doing? - He is doing what comes naturllay killing the innocent.
You can not do this! - Step aside
Two lives have allready been lost.
No one grieves for that more than I.
Step aside or this arrow will be yours!
If we fault her now, those lives will have been lost in vain.
Or will not be lost!
Four lives will be spared.
And what are four lives, compared with the thousands more will be lost if this plague is not ended.
I know, there maybe no room in your heart for God, Behmen.
But in my heart I know he would not abandon us, in God's name...
No man has spilt more blood in God's name than I.
A benevolent God, what are odds thus takes a man!
If you kill her, you will not have God to blame.
Only yourself.
He ends the say.
Look. Severak ...
We've come a long way, Behmen.
Crossed oceans, deserts. Seen things a few men have seen.
When this is over, I think i like see the valley where I was born.
And you?
I have no such yearnings for home. - Then come with me,
I will shaw you my home.
We will sit in the hall where my forefathers sat and a drink ale.
And tell tales, few men have lived to tell.
A fewer still will believe!
Either we will know the truth, my friend.
We will know.
Hello !...
Is anyone there?
Where are the monks? - The chapel. At this time, they should be in vespers.
My brothers, forgive the intrusion, but we have traveled far.
It can not be!
He would not abandon us.
God would not abandon us.
We must go, there is no hope here. Only the plague.
Go where?!
These men were our hope.
We are in God's hands now.
Prayer is our only salvation.
Our Lord in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...
As it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And Forgive us our trespasses...
- Get up!
...we forgive those how trespass against us... - Get up!
And lead us nary to temptation.
- But deliver us from evil.
A last...
Debelzaq...
The Key of Solomon book of wich the cardinal spoke.
Within this pages is sayed to be all the rituals, prayers, and incantations used by holy men, through out the ages to defend against the forces of evil.
Can...
...you perform the ritual?
What have we here? Is this the fair trial you promised me, Behmen?
You see with your own fate.
Let it be known to all here present
And before God, himself. that this woman stands accused of witchcraft,
That she is admitted to call up the plague against all mankind.
I'm flattered. But I must confess...
I have deceived you... - You think you can save yourself by recanting, but you're wrong, speak the truth now before God!
The truth?
Do not speak to me of the truth, you hypocrite.
For centuries you and your ilk have  been burning, hanging, crucifying anyone who stood in thier way.
In truth, I shall thank you.
The church has sent more souls to Perdition than all of the wars, famines and pestilences is put together.
That's a lie, Witch!
- Debelzaq, the ritual!
And you, Behmen? All you needed was a child to save.
Someone to ease your pitful guilt.
Do you truly think that saving one racked wave, would change anything?
Come Behmen.
Your sins are legend.
How many innocent have fallen beneath that very blade?!
 They are godless people
Infidels
They sinned against God and against his only son, Jesus Christ!
They must be punished
How could you know?
This no witch!
This no witch...
Do not utter those words!
We're gonna need more Holly water.
Here!
Tell me, Behmen...
Are we going in there to defeat the demon?
Or to save the girl?
Both.
I have found more holly water.
- You've done well.
This as far as you go, Kay.
- I don't understand.
This is not your battle.
I took a vow to join your cause.
I release you from your vow, there's no shame in it.
Honor is not as thing to be dismissed or forgotten.
A vow must be fulfilled, else, there is no vow at all.
Even at the cost of your life?
- Even then.
Kneel, Kay.
Speak after me.
Grant me courage, O Lord...
- Grant me courage, O Lord...
For I'm thy servant.
- For I'm thy servant.
And guard me with strength into battle...
- And guard me with strength into battle...
That I may crush thine enemies ...
- That I may crush thine enemies ...
As dust before the wind.
As dust before the wind.
Amen. - Amen. - Amen.
Rise a knight.
Felson...
What is it?
I know in my heart,
I haven't earned this.
You will.
The Demon could've escaped any time.
Why did it wait untill we reach Severak?
Prehaps escape wasn't its purpose.
It wantes to be here.
Debelzaq, you said Eckhart tried to free her.
And I will not be a part of this... - Father! - Mila? 
And it killed him, and Hagamar too. He stood in its way.
 We kill the bitch!
Here and now, be done with it. 
It wanted to come here from the very beginig. - My God!
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.
He's right. Everything it's done, has led us here.
Over Here.
Why would a dying monk do this to him self?!
Why would he tie himself to a desk?
It's a passage from
Book of Solomon.
Have more over here
And more.
They were Copying it.
To spread the wisdom of Solomon to all the corners of the earth, the pietism beyond.
It wants the book!
That why the demon deceived us into believe in the girl was witch.
It knew that a witch will be brought to those who possess the Book of Solomon.
You've seen what this plague has done...
If the book would've fall into the demon's hands...
We would face an endless darkness.
It's our last defence.
I should thank all of you.
You sacrificed so much to deliver me here.
And now you've brought me the book.
Debelzaq ...
Silence!
Watch out! - Behmen!
Where are they?!
Who?
The Monks?
You can weaken it!
You have to keep reading.
The head... Cut off their heads!
They're like cockroaches.
Felson!
You have no idea how bad cause of book cause to me till over the centuries.
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.
You'll be buying tonight my friend.
Felson!
Finish it!
Behmen...
What can I do?
Keep her safe.
God be with you, Felson.
It's strange...
To owe so much to someone
I've never even knew.
I do not know what to say.
Say what is with in your heart.
My name is Anna.
I owe you my life.
God keep you.
Will you tell me about them?
I want to know them.
So the plague past and life returned to the land.
 There are Many who Say the plague was nothing but a pestilence that finally broke, 
 like the passing of a fever.
 They don't know the darkness that almost was.
 The sacrifices made...
 The heroes lost...
 I'll tell thier story. I was there.
 I know.
This blade has a dark past.
It has shed much innocent blood.
You're a fool for traveling alone, so completely unprepared.
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.
Thank you.
So...
What brings you to the land of the gatekeepers?
I'm searching for someone.
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?
A dragon.
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.
I've been alone for as long as I can remember.
We're almost done. Shhh...
Hey, sit still.
Good night, Scales.
Get him, Scales! Come on!
Scales?
Yeah! Come on!
Scales!
I have failed.
You've only failed to see...
These are dragon lands, Sintel.
You are closer than you know.
Scales!
Scales?
Scales...
THE CHRONICLES
OF WUSHU MASTERS
TRUE LEGEND
SU CAN (A.K.A. BEGGAR SU)
A YUEN WOO-PING FILM
China. 1861.
It is a turbulent time.
While foreign powers threaten invasion...
As the nation descends into disorder... the Qing Dynasty is on the verge of collapse.
The people remain defiant.
The practice of Wushu flourishes.
And from the ashes of chaos... a new warrior arises.
THE DECISIVE BATTLE
Quick. Follow me!
Kill him !
Kill him ! Kill him !
Archers. Cover us!
The rest, follow me.
Kill!
I'll kill you !
Son of a bitch !
I'll kill you !
Son of a bitch !
Your Highness.
Are you alright?
Su, let's get out of here!
Ma, stay behind.
Yuan, come with me.
Yes, sir!
You bastard !
Son of a bitch !
Bastard !
Son of a bitch !
Ma!
Yuan, take the Prince to safety.
Su !
Go!
Your Highness. I'm afraid Su is dead.
Dead? Are you sure?
Take an elite team to find General Su.
Dead or alive, I want him here!
Yes, sir.
Su is back!
- Soldiers. Take him to the doctor.
- Yes, sir.
My dear brother.
Your Highness.
Colonel Ma and I are back.
Su, you are a great soldier.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
Su, you saved my life.
I'll ask the Emperor... to make you Governor of Hubei.
I am grateful for your consideration.
But I cannot claim all the credit.
Yuan was also there.
I know Yuan is your foster brother... and the blood brother of your wife.
But he is too reckless... you need to control Yuan.
If you're afraid of hurting his feelings...
I will send Yuan to Sichuan.
I hope you'll accept.
Comrades!
General Su led us to countless victories.
Enemies have fallen under his sword.
Let's toast our triumphs!
Cheers!
Ma, this is for you.
I can't accept!
A great sword deserves a great warrior!
- You don't like it?
- No. Of course, I do.
- Then it's yours!
- Thank you !
- Put it to good use.
- Yes! I promise.
Why aren't you drinking?
A warrior should watch his drinking.
Yuan, a sip to our victory is okay.
I'll ask them to come drink with you.
With you here, I am not needed.
You're my brother.
They'll respect you.
You must take care of the troops when I'm gone.
Why?
You're taking the promotion?
Nonsense!
I've decided to go home.
What? You just won a big battle.
This is your time. Don't walk away.
My mind's made up.
I leave tomorrow.
Honestly, you're more suited for battles.
I've asked the Prince to make you Governor.
The Prince despises me.
I know.
But if I'm not here... he will look at you differently.
Since we were little I always got what you didn't want.
I do not feel like a man.
We grew up together.
I share everything with you.
You really don't want to be Governor?
I seek the highest ideal in Wushu so I can teach others.
And I want to start my own school.
When my Wushu practice flourishes
I'll realise the true meaning of life.
My other wish is to have a family with Ying... and live in peace together.
You and my little sister...a family?
Su, I wish the two of you all the best!
You've been so kind.
One day...
I'll repay you.
Wonderful!
FIVE YEARS LATER
Guests come to see my parents
My parents are not in
I ask the guests to take a seat
Then pour them tea
One more time.
Snake!
A snake! At your feet!
You lied !
Look at you.
A mother and still so rambunctious.
You don't pay any attention to us.
You just practice Wushu all day.
Who doesn't pay attention to you?
Mother! Father! What about me?
Help! Save me!
What's going on?
I want to play.
You two are parents... but act like crazy children.
- Father.
- Father.
Grandfather.
Little Feng.
Give me a hug.
Grandfather.
Have you been good?
I have some news.
Yuan is coming back for a visit.
My brother is coming home?
After all these years...
I knew he'd return one day.
Ying, let's get out the best wine.
We must celebrate.
My son...
Yuan is now a Governor.
I suspect this is more than a homecoming.
You must be cautious.
Father, you worry too much.
Are you still thinking of his real father?
Yuan never uttered a word about him.
He knows why you killed his father.
"Not mentioned" does not mean
"forgotten."
You raised him and Ying as your own.
Ying is my wife. We are one family.
There should be no hard feelings, stop worrying.
I hope you're right.
Thank you !
Thank you ! This way please!
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hurry, hurry!
Father's school opens today.
I want to watch the Lion Dance!
Lower the carriage...
Raise the carriage.
Do you still remember me?
Of course. You're my only brother.
Little Feng, this is Uncle Yuan.
Little Feng.
You're Su's son.
You should be brave.
Father really misses you.
Really? Then let's celebrate his birthday.
- I have to tell you something.
- Come! Tell me tomorrow.
The three of us we look like a family!
My dear Father... happy birthday.
Your timing is perfect.
Everyone missed you.
We're so happy you're home.
Father, I have not re-paid you for raising me and Ying.
My health has deteriorated.
Age has taken its toll.
I don't have many good days.
But I pray everyday for your safe return.
Come.
We have much to catch up on.
Come!
Grandfather!
It was I who killed your father.
Su loves you as his brother.
Please spare his family.
Father, you think so little of Su, your own son?
Your father went too far with the Five Venom Fists.
He killed many innocent people.
You...
I had to stop him.
I have perfected the Five Venom Fists.
Did you think I will ever forget that you murdered my father?
After you killed him... you forced me to be your son.
You told the world my father deserved to die.
Right?
I am the only one you should hate.
Your son stole my only sister.
Governor. We've got her.
Mother!
Don't ever touch my sister!
I never blamed you.
Ying, we are finally together.
What will you do to Su?
Uncle, what's in your hand?
It's a pig's head.
Let's go pay respect to your real grandfather.
Let us go!
Su treated you as his blood brother.
Mother...
Thank you.
Excuse me! This way please!
Young Master!
Something terrible has happened...
What's going on?
Yuan killed your father.
He came for revenge.
Young Master!
Father!
It's been 18 years.
Today, I've finally avenged your death.
Forgive me for taking so long.
Come, Little Feng.
Brother.
Little Feng, come here.
Pay respects to your real grandfather.
Governor. Su's here!
Yuan, how could you?
Stop!
Iron Twins, stand down.
I must welcome my brother-in-law.
Yuan ! Father always treated you as his own.
How could you?
Be careful, Su. Run !
We will be OK.
Your blood will be an offering to my father.
It's dark gold armour.
Sewn onto my flesh inch by inch.
I am invincible.
Your fist is harder than a blade.
Five Venom Fists?
Su !
You know what your father said before he died?
He begged me to spare your life.
You are a monster.
I've hated your family for a long time.
- Father!
- Little Feng !
Uncle!
- Please don't hurt my father.
- Little Feng !
- Run !
- Stop! Stop!
- Run, Little Feng !
- Uncle! Please stop!
Come here, Little Feng. I'll stop.
For the sake of your son, I'll let you go.
- Su !
- Father!
You're Little Feng's Uncle.
Ying ! Don't!
Mother!
Ying !
Someone save her! Ying !
Governor. The water's too fast.
Su.
Dr. Yu, he woke up!
Su ! Good.
Now you needn't worry. He's okay.
You're...
This is Dr. Yu.
She saved our life and treated your wounds.
Ying told me everything.
You are safe now.
I am the only one here on Beidou Mountain.
You can stay as long as you like.
Thank you.
Keep still. There are still traces of toxin in your blood.
Luckily, you're strong.
I was able to expel most of it out.
Someone not as tough would be dead by now.
Be careful. My blood is toxic.
Don't worry. Dr. Yu has researched every herb.
She is now immune to all poisons.
I am eternally grateful!
I must thank Ying.
She tends to the wine-making... so I can focus on my research.
She's a wine-maker?
She sells her wine in the city and distributes the money to the poor.
She also provides medicine to the sick.
A true angel of mercy.
You are making too much of what I do.
These needles will aid my research.
I'll walk you out.
Most people harbour hatred without realising the value of life.
One life is connected to many hearts.
Ying !
What's wrong with my arm?
The tendons are torn.
Dr. Yu said you'll be okay.
But it will heal slowly.
Eat something.
You should've stayed with Little Feng.
Why suffer here?
Yuan will not harm Little Feng.
If I didn't follow you, you would've died.
Look at me.
I can't even hold a bowl of rice.
How can I save our son?
You never accept defeat.
I'm useless.
No, you're not.
You were looking for a worthy opponent.
Now you've found two:
Yuan and yourself.
Su !
Su, it's OK.
Here. Hold this.
Use your right hand.
Come on. Hold it.
So what if I can hold it?
I'm still useless!
Are you all right?
Are you afraid?
Yes, I am.
But I'm more afraid you'll give up.
You're the only hope for our family.
I'm waiting for you to come to your senses.
You were looking for a worthy opponent:
Yuan and yourself.
You're not useless.
You never accept defeat.
Try some.
Now I understand why your wine is so special.
Why?
Because it contains your essence.
Stop it!
Soon my strength will return, and I will rescue our son.
Great levitating skill!
I've never met a skilled master like you.
Please take me as your disciple.
For revenge?
How did you know?
Your eyes revealed everything !
To be our disciple you must first defeat the God of Wushu.
The God of Wushu?
How can I defeat him?
Your right arm was injured...
Now it's healed.
But you've lost your confidence, right?
No!
I have not lost my confidence.
My arm is fine!
You might die fighting the God of Wushu.
If my skills are weak what's the point of living?
Are you afraid yet?
Go home if you're scared.
Never!
Too slow.
Faster! Faster!
To challenge someone like you...
...is a dream come true.
What did they do to you?
Nothing.
Only the weak die at home.
- A warrior dies on the battlefield.
- Su !
Finally you've come to your senses.
Yes, like you said...
I'm the hope of our family.
God of Wushu !
I'm here. Still alive!
You've recovered?
Your right arm is worthless.
Let's chop it off.
Scared?
Again !
Ying said your arm has strengthened.
Take a look.
Let me check how you're doing.
Alright!
The toxins are gone.
Thank you so much.
My body has healed.
And I'm getting stronger each day.
I must go practice. Please enjoy dinner.
Ying...
Su has gone mad with his training.
That's not possible.
Please listen. His pulse is erratic.
His heart is racing and his eyes are blood-shot.
He's going mad.
This can't continue.
His training must stop.
Dr. Yu, he's with me everyday.
He goes off to the Old Sage daily and returns home with wounds.
I see it with my own eyes.
On Beidou Mountain, we're the only ones here.
I know it's hard to believe.
Old Sage and the God of Wushu are supreme beings.
Just like you, they come and go.
- Have you ever met the Old Sage?
- No.
But I believe in my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Do not enter my practice chamber!
You don't listen !
If you die, I'll be alone forever!
Uncle, my feet hurt.
Please don't lock me up.
If you try to run away
I'll chop off your feet.
Uncle, I won't!
Little Feng, you're my only family now.
I will not lose you.
I will protect you.
So no one can harm you.
It's been another year,
I wonder how Little Feng has grown.
I've been thinking.
After I save Little Feng we'll move to the country.
We'll hold hands like this every day.
I haven't seen your smile in a long time.
Su...
After you save our son will you spare my brother's life?
He's part of our family.
If he lives,
I'll make sure he cannot fight again.
Heavenly God.
Please bless our family.
I pray that we shall never be apart.
We shall never be apart.
I must find a way to defeat you !
Have you ever met the Old Sage?
Su has gone mad with his training.
God of Wushu.
Let's go again !
You may be strong. But I'm stronger.
I will defeat you !
Ying. I'm home.
I almost beat the God of Wushu today.
He's really powerful, but I'll defeat him one day.
That's enough.
I now realise the way to defeat an enemy.
That's enough !
What God of Wushu?
Are you alright?
Su...
Do you know you're going mad?
What?
I said, you're going mad.
I'm getting stronger.
And I'm more powerful than before.
I know you miss Little Feng.
I went to the cliff to watch you practice.
I didn't see the God of Wushu, or an Old Sage.
You were alone.
It's all in your head. Don't you realise?
You went to the cliff?
I promised the Masters
I wouldn't bring my wife.
Wake up!
You were practising by yourself.
Don't you understand?
That's impossible.
Look at my wounds.
They're real.
You did it to yourself.
I know you suffer so much.
Are you not feeling well?
If you love me, you have to believe me.
It was you who made me want to be strong.
I need you to believe in me.
Guests come to see my parents
My parents are not in
I ask the guests to take a seat
Then pour them tea
Little Feng.
Let's go home.
Let's go, alright?
If Little Feng hears me sing... he will stop crying.
Su, we are husband and wife.
We share good and bad times... and this wine together.
Su, you show great improvement.
Yes! I've become much stronger.
Even your confidence has returned.
Ying says I'm going insane.
She says you're an illusion.
- What do you think?
- Who are you?
Who are you? Who am I?
It's not important.
What's important is you're ready to save your son.
Ying is right.
You are just in my head.
Leave me alone!
I never want to see you again !
Ying !
Dear Su,
Watching you live in your own fantasy scares me.
I fear I'll lose you and our son forever.
It is now clear to me that I must go save Little Feng.
We made a promise.
Our family shall never be apart.
Wait for my return. -Ying
Please.
How long has he been in here?
Little Feng !
Mother!
Little Feng !
I thought I'd never see you again.
I missed you so much !
- Why are you in chains?
- Hush !
- Uncle may hear us.
- Ying?
You're alive!
This is great!
Finally, we can live happily as a family.
It's been so long.
Do you know the pain I've endured?
I think of you every day.
You've had your revenge.
Now let my son go.
Is Su dead?
You destroyed his arm.
He can never fight again.
Please let us go.
Now that you're here
I'll never lose you again.
He's here! He's here!
Close the gate. Quick!
Governor! Su is fast approaching !
Su !
Ying. I am so happy.
We can finish what we started !
It all ends here!
Then you must deal with me first!
- Mother!
- You're scaring your son.
Does this make you happy?
Happy?
I've known only sorrow since you left.
I can only fight for what I want.
You understand?
Good !
That's more like it, Su !
Su, I should have trusted you !
I was wrong !
Ying !
Guards!
Tie her up.
- Little Feng !
- Mother!
- Uncle! Don't kill her!
- Little Feng !
Let go!
- Mother!
- I won't kill your mother.
But if your father kills me... she has to die with me.
Because we're one family.
But I will not lose.
Bury her in the forest!
No matter what happens...
You must stay with your father.
Remember our family shall never be apart!
Promise me, Little Feng !
Promise me!
Governor, it's been done.
- Does anyone else know where she is?
- No.
Good ! Get up!
Yes, sir!
Kill him, brother! Quick!
Father!
Little Feng !
- Where's your mother?
- You'll never know.
Father!
Father, stop! We need to find Mother!
Father, don't kill him !
Father, you're killing him !
Stop! Father!
Don't kill him !
Uncle, you can't die, Uncle, please live!
Little Feng, he is our enemy!
He buried Mother alive.
Only he knows where she is!
If he dies... we can't save Mother.
Let's go find her!
Forest.
In the forest.
- Ying !
- Mother!
- Mother!
- Ying ! Where are you?
Here!
A DRUNKEN FIST
HEILONGJIANG, ALONG
THE CHINESE-RUSSIAN BORDER
Careful! It's hot! Here it is, go!
Roasted potatoes!
Sweet roasted potatoes!
Mister, how much is one potato?
Two copper coins.
I only have one. Can I get one?
Okay. Consider it charity.
Here. One for you.
Thank you.
Teacher! Teacher!
Wake up!
Get out!
Our Teacher's dead !
Money won't bring him back.
Your Teacher was weak.
Our fighters are better.
Stop!
Master Ma!
Head of the Wushu Federation?
- Master Ma. You need to help us.
- What happened?
They lured our teacher to a match for 30 silver coins.
Said he'd get 5 coins if he surrendered...
But it wasn't a match.
It was murder!
Accidents happen.
People die.
He did surrender.
Your men still beat him to death.
That's outrageous!
How can you call that a match?
If you have any grievances, settle it in the arena.
All right!
Tell your people... if I win, they'll have to close the arena and go back to where they came from !
Deal! We'll be waiting.
Here. Take this. Buy something to eat.
Wine.
Wine...
Excuse me! Who is this guy?
Oh my god !
How did a stinky beggar get in here?
This is not Ying's wine.
This is my wine. Give it back!
Don't push me.
Get out!
You stink!
Don't touch me.
Just wait!
I'll get someone to kick you out.
Hey, come here if you want to drink!
Wine...
Is this Ying's wine?
Drink it, and you'll know.
Wine...
Give me the wine!
Clear head. Drunken form.
Mind meets fist.
Stop obsessing about form.
Heart and fist are one.
To lose is not to lose.
To win is not to win.
Offer wine to the gods.
Hug the barrel in farewell.
Raise the jug with tons of strength.
Being drunk is fake. The fist is real!
A good fist is an unstoppable fist.
Take it and drink up!
Father!
A broken heart needs mending.
What are you doing here?
From now on, let me take you to wherever you want to go.
What a stench.
Master Ma, this is the lunatic
I told you about!
Su Can?
General Su?
He is a General?
Su, it is Ma.
We fought many battles together.
What happened to you?
You don't remember me?
You gave me this sword.
Don't you remember?
Su, wake up!
Foreigners are killing Chinese fighters for amusement.
I have to fight them tomorrow.
Win or lose, I have no regrets.
I've always looked up to you.
A warrior once told me:
"To give is better than to receive."
What happened to that great warrior?
He died with Ying.
Mother.
Su !
For the sake of your son pick yourself up.
Su !
I return this sword to you.
Ma!
I've never asked you for anything.
Now I am asking you to take care of my son.
Father!
What are you saying?
Su !
He is your son !
Look at me.
Do I look like a father?
He has no future with me.
Only suffering.
I beg you.
Please take him away!
I see.
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of him.
I won't go with you !
Father!
Don't send me away, we must stay together.
Who will take care of you if I'm not here?
Father! I won't go,
I want to stay...
Father, I won't go!
You don't need to take care of me.
Now go!
Father! No!
- Go!
- No!
Listen !
I only need wine, not you !
Understand?
I don't want to go.
Go!
Father! Open the door!
Open the door!
I don't want to go!
Open the door! Father!
Uncle Ma...
I'm sorry, but I can't leave him.
He might be crazy, but he's my father...
And we cannot be apart.
I understand, Little Feng.
Come to me if you need anything.
Think of me as your family.
Take good care of your father.
Dear Father: I promised Mother... that I'd always stay with you.
Our family shall never be apart.
Uncle Ma!
We've come to support you.
Ma!
Su !
Can you get us in?
Of course.
Get out of here!
Su !
Are you all right?
What are you doing here?
We have a dress code.
He's with me. How dare you !
After you.
Have a seat.
I need to check something.

Don't hurt Uncle Ma!
Let me go!
Father!
Father! Help! Father!
Let me go!
Father!
Uncle Ma! Are you okay?
Father! Be careful!
Father, don't fight anymore!
Run away!
Little Feng, I never back down.

I knew it.
You've perfected your skills.
Don't leave me again.
I've never left you.
I was always by your side.
Father, wake up, get up quickly.
Father, get up.
Father, wake up!
Get up, Father! Don't leave me.
You're awake!
Get up! Quick!
He's up.
The Chinaman is up!
He wins!
The loser will be banned from this arena.
Ladies and gentlemen.... according to our rules... the last man standing wins.
And today's winner is... the Chinese Man on this stage.
That is my father!
Beggar Su wandered the land with his son... searching for truth through the "Drunken Fist" philosophy.
Today, it is practiced by millions around the world... and its creator, Su Can is indeed a "True Legend" of Wushu.

But in the meantime you keep practicing.
This is really great.
What is it?
- It sounds good.
Thank you.
If you play in the talent show?
There you are.
- Why are you talking with that idiot?
Don 's pocket.
- Your father is waiting. You should go.
Remember not to talk to her.
Roger loses?
Put it away. That sucks.
What to do with Randy's guitar?
- I do not know.
Give this to him.
- Good.
Now get out.
Now you're in trouble.
- That we'll see.
I see. The two couples?
Area, but, and get behind.
Great guy, big guys who put all his chips.
Me too.
I am not afraid.
Aces of Lords.
Flush.
- No.
Yes. Now look. All mine.
Nice. Do not rub.
May I ask you something?
It is certainly on your body that is changing?
Anything that happens with your body is perfectly natural.
No. Stop talking.
Stop talking.
I did not ask.
Not so.
- Good.
Promise not to talk about puberty.
Thank goodness.
Believe me, I will not talk about it.
Whats up. Seriously.
At school we have a talented ...
Mom, I think to make them and I am a bit ...
I do not know.
You may want to participate.
- Yes?
Yes, you are wonderful.
I hear you play.
You are really good.
And the girls who love guitarists.
We're back.
- We are here.
But nothing to tell your mother.
Hey, guys. How did it go?
Your son is just wrong.
- False.
He certainly does not. ... And you see
- Beautiful.
You get the words out of my mouth.
Are you hungry?
Shall we go get something to eat?
Please.
Where is your coat?
You have to go?
- Is anybody hurt?
Not like that you know that you likes to do.
You both look beautiful.
I'll call you later.
I'm really sorry.
Shrink pasta.
No, not again.
Amnesia dust.
- No.
Flying? Poor wing. Forget it.
Moreover, your "all targets magic key generator ", which is not.
This is broken.
- This is an idea.
Do not touch my bag.
This is mine. What do you want?
The magical invisibility sprays.
It always works.
- I know.
Spray it everywhere.
What a surprise.
It does not work.
Your stuff sucks.
Leuk.
- It will leave.
Did you hear that?
- Yes.
Are you confused?
Can we help you?
How about some amnesia dust?
Where am I?
- Go to the white light, my friend.
Go to the white light.
Dear Dog.
Do not hurt me, dog.
What is it?
- A nice long story.
Where is the tooth?
Can I get help?
That's it.
You could very well be the
Tooth fairy worst ever.
Besides, I need some things.
- Stuff?
Things.
The magic powder.
Stuff. Q. Tell
No more things.
- It's amazing.
Although half weeks of my job, how do I do?
Sorry, we have very little money.
Want to know why?
- Not really.
Because children are no longer faith, as they did.
We are not alone.
Even unicorns, leprechauns, dragons.
All these departments. All gone.
If this trend continues, no longer tandfeenland.
No child will still receive more visits from the Tooth fairy.
Ever.
- No visits from the Tooth fairy.
So what?
You really do not understand.
You do not understand that fantasies for children ... their ability to imagine something that is important?
Thus ignoring their souls.
It is the foundation that gives them to dream.
Dreams are bad.
Useless.
You're done.
- The whole week?
For tonight.
Unless you want to remain "Fairioke.
Oh. No
"Fairioke" Feen for karaoke?
I have the thing for you.
What is it?
- The thing. Package.
Bag. Bomb. The stuff.
Frisco special.
Pink Lady. Little Drummer Boy.
Who are you?
- Ziggy.
Say what you will.
Zigman, Zigmeister ...
Stop talking.
- They want you to fail.
What?
- Think about it.
If you fail, they get more time.
It's like k editkort debt ... they just want you pay forever.
Yes.
- Do you really think to play games?
You kill me.
- How do you like that ending?
Can I check?
Oh no.
Can you see me?
This does not work.
- What is it?
What are you doing?
What Ziggy has given me?
Stay calm.
I just need the tooth.
- There is an alien on my balcony.
You are fantastic.
Lily is so pissed because they had a fee to post your trade fairs.
I've learned my lesson.
Never buy black market stuff.
I can not even 2 weeks continue.
- Yes, you can be friend.
Just make a bigger impact.
One day while taking it.
Social workers decide who can see us and who is not.
They wanted to know if you have ever given attention to me, or would listen to me.
But no.
Shut up.
- Ven ...
You should really take the renovation.
If you want I can give you a pamphlet.
- Your punishment is also enlarged.
You need a week. Well done.
Great. Just what I need.
- I think you have need it, friend.
I can now give the new equipment.
I n mode.
From now on, follow the rules.
You embrace the spirit of fairy.
And then listen again.
- Good.
I will always be the best tooth.
You always draw you back from me and then ... you never call.
And when I finally fall something from you ... is that your deposit to pay.
What happened to you?
I would like to tell you, but I can not.
Why not?
I just can not.
I know what it is.
It is that you prefer.
You are afraid of a commitment to go.
You are nervous because it seriously.
Yes, that's it.
You know me so well.
I am nervous about how serious it is.
- What?
You are a woman, and quite frankly, you would not understand.
What?
I'm not nervous, because it is between us seriously.
I must not even think.
What?
I was a little sad.
And I love you so much.
I'm afraid to spoil and lose weight.
I understand.
I am so happy to you re doing well.
Can I get any of it?
What are you doing? Have you already started training?
- I come.
Hurry.
It is for me stood, flushed, beaten and arrested.
Stop complaining.
They promised to embrace the feengeest.
I really include feengeest.
But I do it ... on my way.
It is outside the rules.
- Yes.
I'm just here for a tooth.
Only tooth.
I take my glove.
Good.
Now enter the tooth. Easy.
Let it go.
I said, 'let loose'.
Very good.
Good evening.
Who are you?
I'm the tooth fairy.
Yes.
Okay? Ok.
Mick, how you doing
So far with you?
I'm the new player and ... some teeth from the Wolfs are long, if you understand me.
This reference, Derek Thompson, the Tooth Fairy?
No, I respect my parents.
Thompson takes you beneath your wings?
- No, its wings are bad ... mine is new and ready to fly.
I want my own thing.
A secure young player, good luck.
- Thanks.
The Ice Wolf makes them simple.
Mick, you are.
- Finally.
Good luck, kid.
I mean it.
I think you are doing great.
You are the best hockey player ever.
Whatever.
Come on.
Donnelly, ending the game, and go straight past.
The Ice Wolf pass the blue line.
Haig is on the web.
These two rivals go some battles with each other.
Here we go.
PUK is in the corner.
Donnelly goes after him.
What happened to Donnelly, Jim?
- What are you doing?
PUK is extracted from Donnelly and picks it up.
Save him!
He is terrible.
What happened, Jim?
Has anyone found him, Jim?
What's going on?
He laughs?
Is everything okay?
What?
Try to test me?
- Get off the ice.
If you want to play games but you go on the bench.
But on Thursday. Hurry.
What did I miss?
Why do you bark?
I do not know.
I blew it right now.
It's okay.
We must continue practice.
Everyone will laugh at me.
Maybe I should not do.
Maybe they do, or ... you can blow taken out.
You can not score if you do not shoot.
Yes? When did you last shot?
When I started, I was a goal scorer.
First Round, 'The Devils' ass.
In 'The Bigs' game.
What happened?
- I broke my shoulder in Chicago.
They have put me in a lower class to to recover, and it lasted forever.
I was so angry and frustrated that I am a night a person from New Heaven took to grazing.
Hit a couple of his teeth out the audience was crazy ... and when they called me
'the tooth fairy.
And it was with me.
And I have not scored for years.
But I have more penalty minutes than anyone else in the league.
If you are not completely healed or shoulder?
It is not the same.
- How do you know?
You try not agree.
You can not score if you do not shoot.
If you do, will
I do it.
Well adopted.
And a tooth.
It must have been a good time when you handed the tooth.
I genteresseerd how it feels.
- Find it out yourself.
I'm not a fairy with wings.
Put it out again.
Why can not you have wings?
Want to know something about evolution fairy?
Who wrote it?
"Charles Darwing?
Developments Feen Feen cultivate some wings, and some do not.
I am one of the unfortunate.
- Tooth fairy if you not have wings.
You have it all.
- It's true.
You must show them your power.
Speed, masculinity, flexibility.
How do I do?
To peasants around.
No, come back.
Where are you going?
- Check that door again.
It is almost one meter high, you is nearly 2 meters long ... go back.
A dinosaur!
- No.
Again, I am.
- Is everything okay?
Why save the child?
Back to my roots, it is my worst nightmare.
The success of all
You look like a reindeer so beautiful with your legs.
You dance.
Not with the child in themselves.
Amnesia Powder.
It sounded good.
You make them away tomorrow.
What do you think?
Nice. Great. Randy Harris.
Talent Show.
I think the thing is fun.
You think I can be a famous rock star.
Like Clapton, Hendrix, or Stevie revons?
Fair?
- Yes.
You're pretty good.
Let's say that you work very hard to continue.
Let's say you 13jarige the best guitarist in the neighborhood is.
It is so.
You should know that there
Many neighborhoods.
And a lot 13jarige guitarists, but somewhere out there a 12jarige ... that kill guitar.
You know what? Yes, it is possible.
Take them to graze.
In the third half of the match was the Arrows ... 43 and this is yet another great game.
The arrows face and get away.
You're back.
- Do you clean your pants on?
It's okay.
You want them to wonder.
The Ice Wolf pushed the PUK on Arrow's half, and the Lion is chasing.
The coach leaves Donnelly back to the game.
Now they've got the puck behind the blue line.
And here comes the bank of Thompson, and replaces Dobs.
Thompson fits Browley and takes him over.
Thompson goes back into the game while Donnelly is on the side.
Thompson takes the puck with his stick, and Donnelly is with him.
It is against two n with Thompson take the lead.
Donnelly shouted that he would give off.
Thompson appears to fit, he makes the pass,
He has left wide open goals, the goal is open.
What can he do?
The arrows are on the ice, the shoot and score.
Jim, it appeared Thompson would
Just shoot, and he suffocated.
You're not a hockey player, but
An example statement attraction.
Look at the game tomorrow from the bank.
Asshole.
Come on, guys.
Great.
How was your race?
Not good.
- Dad, I have a loose tooth.
Great, baby.
- What?
Everything. Nothing. Forget it.
- Can we go practice?
Can we skip the lesson today.
I tried just did not.
Talent show is tomorrow.
- I can you.
I should have at least n times through.
- You do not.
I did need.
I need some more practice, so I can win.
No matter what you do the talent show ...
You will never be a famous rock star.
Only one other child with a guitar.
Do yourself a favor and give up.
It is for his own good.
Believe me.
Come on, Tess.
- What happened to you?
I had a bad day?
- A bad day?
A bad day, huh?
- No, it is not good.
You never talk with my children.
It's over between us.
You know what your problem is?
You can not say
'what if'.
And it never will be.
Who wants to hear good news? In.
Come on.
Why are you here?
- Lily has given me this.
Feen Teachers Proof.
- It is only a proof but I am on the road.
You should now be on the way home, because I go to bed.
This is due to you.
We must celebrate.
I know a place where all good mothers are fairy.
Are you crazy?
I just lost everything means something to me.
My friend, children ... and I probably have my skates for good on willows hung.
Just because I like an idiot the Tooth fairy crap you think.
And see what it has brought me.
You do n trial after all these years, it will not work and then simply pass?
So it would not be easy.
And you know it.
I will tell you what I know.
I know you do not have wings.
This means that you can not fly.
This also means that one never may be a tooth fairy.
And what happens if you have a ten-storey building to flee?
I will tell you.
Plat! So.
You know what really sad?
The person who makes you most all your dreams is not murder ...
Carly or randy, or
I find it yourself.
Go away. Well.
Fine.
I go to bed.
A 24 minute sets the third time.
The Ice Wolf still 1 to 0
And Derek Thompson is still trainer in his dug-out.
I think that whole game has he has not seen the ice.
Come on.
- When the game goes ...
Andreas Patrinkle replace the newcomer,
Thompson continues.
What is this?
Another blow.
Donnelly picked up along the PUK.
He goes across.
He has plans to return.
Donnelly makes every
Motion is just good.
Donnelly will be to go and almost get out of position and Donnelly goes along.
He will shoot. And he ...
Against the bar.
Rick, what happened?
He blew his whistle.
Offscreen Patrinkle were killed, and I think he does not stop.
Thompson, go there.
Go.
Come on, guys.
- The Ice Wolf 1 minute ... to score, or an extension.
Thompson looks at the clock.
And they start to hunt, when the clock counts down.
It seems that Thompson take part because he must.
Thompson got a shot.
How can there be no punishment?
He was beaten mess.
I think the Tooth fairy was a payback.
Look for Thompson, Jim.
His legs seem to get back on track.
Thompson flies over the ice, and
I can not make friends.
This is gonna hurt.
No, he thought he not hit.
Unbelievable.
He takes the puck out and flying over the ice.
Thompson makes movements we have not seen.
Who is that guy.
He is only through the n defender.
He becomes the defender,
I think he will decrease.
No, he stops, see what the guy leaves.
He shoots.
Derek Thompson has been nine years not shot ... and so a great shot I've ever seen.
With my arm.
Tommy Mayor Would Shock we do it again.
Not bad.
Great shot, dude.
Here we go.
Even 20 seconds, while both teams go to the center spot.
Oh, no.
The Ice Wolf, the puck, and a pass to Thompson ...
Who give away.
- Why would he do it, Nick?
I have no idea, Jim.
- I can not abandon them.
This is my last chance to play the game.
To leave when I arrived.
- From what I have viewed, you earn it.
Thompson, what are you doing?
Are you not a student?
You break the rules or not?
Please, I have learned from the best.
Look here first to solve ...
Before he takes its decision.
This is Carly's house.
- 14, come on.
Thompson, go back in the box.
I can walk. Lily does not know.
But I want to know.
I need this for home care.
Let us do it.
- How? You can not fly?
Good time to learn.
Yes it is.
Take them to graze.
If you want to fly, you must believe.
No panic, but it is a huge memory gun.
It does not hurt and you feel nothing.
Remember me.
That you do.
Good luck with your car find.
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.
You have a nice costume.
I must tell you something.
I was wrong, it
Tooth fairy is real.
And it's me.
I do not think hockey.
I'm the real Tooth fairy.
- No, you do not.
"You are the real Tooth fairy.
- Did our secret, ok?
Randy.
What are you doing here?
I need talking to you.
Go away.
- Listen here ...
I was wrong, what
I said yesterday.
I do not care.
- You must continue playing guitar.
You really have talent.
And something you love is never a waste of time.
I'm so sorry.
Even if I would, it still can not.
I have destroyed my
Guitar, remember?
So no talent show.
Hold on.
Maybe this helps?
That's great!
How did you do?
- Magic generator for all purposes.
What clothes do you have?
There you will find out.
And now for the clothes and talent show.
Come on.
Derek.
Mama! Derek is the tooth fairy.
You have a fairy costume rental property to do with Tess.
Yes.
That is what I did.
Derek is giving me a new guitar, and brings me to the talent show.
What time is it?
You never get.
Do not worry, it will we make it on time.
You like that.
And you get dressed we see you there.
Oh yes.
Where is your car?
- No car in front.
Hold on.
How can it be?
- It's good.
How is this possible?
On one particular evening, I found an appeal under my pillow.
What is a call?
This is an invitation to go to feenland.
Feenland?
- Yes, I got these wings.
I have met a person who called Tracy.
He looks like a tooth maker but with the eyes of a tuna.
Moreover, I could shrink me to ten centimeters.
Will we again?
What is it?
Sorry mate, but
I have enough rules.
Randy, there you are.
I searched everywhere. You're turn.
Quickly and be ready.
Another tooth.
- Thanks.
Sure.
Now I will go to a concert.
The best have some rules violated, Mr.
Thompson.
But I have helped Carly and then Randy ... and Tess is only six years, so that it will soon forget.
Although they do not forget that they now at least ...
... They will always
- Always know what?
They will always have faith.
Like me.
I get it now, dreams are good.
For all.
Mr. Thompson ...
I hereby relieve you
Tooth fairy from service.
You're right.
- She is a pro.
Congratulations.
Stop it this way.
I prefer that no physical contact.
You can find me funny.
I know you liked me.
You have now very much away, I know ... but somewhere in there, do you like me.
Not doing so frisky.
I really must go.
- Can you still waiting?
Tracy, I must also speak with you.
What is it?
- Everybody that Mr.
Thompson can recover ... deserves it more than any other.
Is there ...?
- These are your wings, Tracy.
Wear them with pride, each once you download a tooth.
You are a dental, companion.
- I have my wings.
You have your wings.
See that you need fixed.
I just do not know why
I talk so crazy.
Thank you, Lady.
This is all good and I am very proud of you ... you are the biggest Tooth fairy world, but I really need to go.
Someone must help me down here.
Tracy, you will do, or should I do?
A gift?
I'm afraid not.
You will soon no longer remember what happened here.
Why?
Because we always do.
I will never forget.
I still can not believe you came into the game.
This is because it is here.
Thank you, Tracy. For everything.
You big giraffe with your four eyes.
Back to the zoo.
And you and running back to Easter Island.
Brothers are still in town.
Let me once again meeting the guys.
You are my husband.
- And you are my fee.
Maybe we should keep in touch.
With e-mail?
We will meet best email.
Do you blog?
- I blog too.
I would like to read your blog. Facebook?
- Really?
I can bury you.
- I think that is fantastic.
There you are, I found you.
Yes, I had to ...
I am so excited.
- I.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.
Come on, Randy.
Still a big applause for our newest artist ...
Randy Harris.
Randy!
You go, Randy!
Well done Randy!
I wondered why we do not marry?
What if we get married?
Did you hear what I said?
I said "what if".
Yes.
We get married.

What's this one about?
Killing demons that have taken over a city.
- Where are they?
- Hiding...
Everywhere...
They hide among us, in the buildings...
Behind mirrors and all over.
Liriko did more last night.
I wish I could meet him.
In your dreams.
He wouldn't even notice you.
FIND YOUR MISSION
He leaves clues.
He must be trying to say something.
Anyway, see you later.

My name is Sara.
I'm 15 years old.
This is my world.
The only one I know.
YOU FEEL YOUR LIFE
DOESN'T RHYME
I wander trough these streets like a ghost.
Searching for someone.
Is anyone there?
Searching for the only person who seems to understand me.
The only person who says things wich really matter to me.
Liriko.
Nobody knows who he is.
Nobody has ever seen him.
I've been decoding his messages for a long time.
I know I'm closer than ever.
Hi!
Sara?
Hi, sweetie.
Why didn't you answer?
Are you feeling any better?
Honey, I'm sorry about last night.
We all lose our patience sometimes.
But you're not a child any more.
You have to be more realistic.
It's for your own good.
We only want the best things for you.
Call your father later and fix things up, okay?
How was your day?
Fine.
Oh, Sara, don't start.
Our history teacher told us something.
Speak up.
I always have to tell you...
A big mess in the Church a long time ago.
He said... there was this debate about... the digestive process and the holy wafer.
Stercorism or something like that.
One side said the wafer stopped being holy when... when it dissolved in the mouth of the communicant...
I mean, the guy eating it...
But things got out of hand when an old monk... said the wafer never loses its holiness.
- Okay, and...?
- Well... that it's always holy, even when it becomes excrement.
- When you take a dump.
- I don't believe it.
Neither did the Vatican.
They were totally pissed off.
- Sara...!
- So they told the priest to repent or he'd be tortured and excommunicated.
And what did he do?
I don't know.
The teacher didn't tell us.
Yeah, great.
You think it's silly, right?
Do call your father, Sara.

Ines... is that you?
Sara?
Sara?
Sara, that's enough, okay?
Raise your hand if you haven't read it.
Sara?
No... I haven't read all of it.
I can't hear you.
Can you please speak up?
- I haven't finished it.
- Why not, may I ask?
- I tried... but.
- But what?
I'm very sorry it was too boring for you, Sara.
Ever heard the expression
"When it rains, it pours"?
I'm sure you have.
Luis, would you mind telling Sara what the first chapter is about?
Well...
The first chapter starts with the famous sentence...
"In a place whose name
I do not care to remember..."
"Somewhere in La Mancha"
- La Mancha!
- Get a clue!
It's okay, don't bother.
Isabel, can you start reading the first chapter, please.
Yes.
"Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance rack, an old buckler, ..."
My life happens in places
I don't understand
Doing things I don't know what they're worth.
That have nothing to do with me.
No one talks about it, but there has to be something else.
In that book I found the story to whom nobody believe.
Just like me.
And his fantasies
could be like me own.
"Awaken to understand
and unravel the meaning.
His curiosity and blunder
were so far reaching that the strangest of thoughts came to mind.
His days from dawn to dark,
and nights from sunset to sunrise...
that he lost his wits."
Hello?!
What are you doing still up?
- Studying...
- It's about time...
Have you had dinner?
Your dad isn't here, is he?
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.
Mom...
Why don't we ever go into town?
We go to the shopping mall all the time.
No. I mean into town, the old part of town.
I don't know.
Because everything we need is here.
So... tomorrow we have a school trip, and I've never been there.
"His fancy grew full...
enchantments, battles, wounds...
that if the world were evil and terrible...
a thought came to his mind... to roam the world here and there.
Seeking it everywhere,
and fight with good judgment
the endless suffering of everyday life. "
Where are you?
You made me lose.
Damn, go talk to him already.
He's screaming for it.
Look, he even found a free seat.
He's waiting for you.
Nothing?
I can't bear to watch you fail.
It's depressing.
This is where I leave you.
I'll try my luck with Remy.
Dario, what are you doing?
You left me all by myself.
You're acting really strange lately, man.
You like that geeky girl, huh?
What do you mean?
What's wrong with you?
Liriko!
Go!
Hey, Dario!
Did you lose something or what?
Come with me down that street.
There's something I want you to see.
Come on, dude!
Shit, man.
- What's up with him?
- Not me.
You go ahead.
We'll be in deep shit if the teacher finds out.
I'm staying.
- Jesus, what a drag.
- Come on!
That damn weirdo has you eating out of her hand.

LIRIKO
This is a wax representation of Elena's body.
She died over 50 years ago.
She threw herself off the bell tower, hoping to to go to heaven.
As you know, the Church considers suicide a sin, but the bishop ruled the girl was driven by an act of faith, wishing to be closer to God, to escape a world she did not understand.
Let's continue, please.
Sara!
- Fuck.
- Fuck?
Where have you been?
We had to go back and look for you!
Sara, what the hell is wrong with you?
Where have you been?
Well?
You could care less.
Damn, you really blow me away.
If you were mine...
We called the police, Sara.
Now we have to call them back and say,
"Sorry about that. We found her."
"She decided to take a fucking stroll."
I'm talking to you, Sara!
Where are you?
What planet are you on?
Were you trying to ruin the field trip?
Great! You did it!
Thanks a lot, Sara!
It maybe time to give up.
Liriko is only an illusion
I have to lose.
Or maybe I'm not who he wants.
Here beauty is far away from me.
I don't know if I'm able to go on.

I AM THE SOUND OF BEAUTY
COME INSIDE ME
Shit! I'm so stupid.
I MAKE PRETTY RHYMES
WITH WHAT I FIND ON THE FLOOR
So this is your hiding place.
I've found you.
I'm finally going to meet you.
FACE YOUR GHOSTS
Everythings begins to make sense.
FOR LIRIKO.
SARA.
"It no longer matters what everyone else says.
Fortune is guiding us better than we could ever have hoped for.
For look there, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves,
all of whom I intend to engage in battle and slay.
It is a service to God indeed to rid the earth
of such an evil breed."
"What giants?", Sancho replied.
"If you are afraid, withdraw to your prayers as I engage them in fierce and unequal combat."
Thank you, Lara, very good.
I shouldn't let you in.
You're half an hour late.
- I'm sorry...
- I can't hear you.
I imagine you're apologizing, but
I can't understand what you're saying.
My mother was sick and I had to stay home.
Sure. Got a slip?
- I didn't bring it.
- What?
I'll bring it tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I can't let you in.
This is getting very serious, Sara.
By the way, your mother called.
She was worried because you didn't sleep at home last night.
You've been caught!
You're screwed!
Where the hell did you sleep last night?
I was worried sick all night!
And you haven't been to school either!
Great!
I'm totally late for work.
If I get in trouble, you're in for it.
Do not leave this house.
You and I are having a serious talk about this later.
I'm sick of it.
You don't care about anything.
We work our asses off and you don't give a damn!
You're always out of it, Sara.
SAVE ME
AWARENESS
WORD
ACTION
Luis, it's Sara.
I found Liriko.
I understood his messages.
He wants me to save that deserted house she lives in.
It's beautiful.
My dad's company is going to demolish it.
I have to stop it.
I'll be gone a few days.
Call me.
FORGET ALL THAT BULLSHIT.
FOCUS.
"Our acquaintances
may very possibly seem to be those same people...
but that they are so in reality and in fact,
believe it not on any account...
It must be that those who have enchanted me
have taken this shape and likeness...
FOUND YOUR MISSION for it is easy for the enchanters to take any form they please...
and they may also have done it
to make me uncertain in my mind...
and unable to conjecture
whence this evil comes to me.
I find myself shut up in a cage.
Moreover, one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes
with himself."
Hi, this is Sara.
Leave a message.
I am noise in silence.
I am the shadow in your living room.
I am the insomniac walking around your bedroom.
I am the crack in your roof.
I turn saying into fact and penetrate you like the air you breathe.
I am the murmur between street corners and avenues.
Hackers up there seek my password but they'll never get it right.
Here words are the code, they fly like gargoyles.
Words are a bullet straight to the jaw, a plague that spreads like ebola, the arrow in Legolas' bow.
In this world so fast are they cripples, invalids feeble and pale, gray matter, scrawny.
Everyone here knows that...
YOU are someone
The lives I witness out there don't deserve my silence.
Appearances can be deceptive, but streets and mirrors show us the unscrupulous truth, from every angle.
Foco, Prosak, Totem, Medussa,
Liriko.
Liriko?
You didn't understand a thing!
Not a thing!
You understood the message, you realised what the mission was.
Never give up in the face of failure.
It's here.
There's no time.
Follow me.
Wait. Use mine!
Hurry!
Where am I?
What is all this?
This is an infinite moment.
A journey through your labyrinth.
Think fast and waste no time, the things you need to understand and overcome will not be easy.
Stupid girl, it's your fault we lost Foco.
Your doubts are an insult.
You've disappointed us.
- You don't deserve our help.
- But I didn't mean to...
Let's go!
But... am I dead?
No.
Yes.
- Almost.
- It's up to you.
You will find the answers if you pass three tests.
Quickly, there's no time.
The fuse is short and narrow!
Danger looms like an arrow!
Sara!
Sara!
No! Sara, breathe!
They all do that!
Breathe... Look at me...
Breathe...
Come on, we have to keep going.
Hermes!
Brother, it's good to see you.
You too.
- How are you, my friend?
- Fine.
I don't know. It's tough...
A lot of kids.
The cities up there are tremendous.
Full of ghostly gazes.
Terrible feeling...
You have to be on the ball.
Losing hope is losing yourself.
Don't worry.
There are more like you.
We are many.
Peace, my friend.
Liriko, there is little time.
Others will take care of him.
Let's go.
Sometimes you compare your life to throwing dice and getting a zero.
And another zero.
And another.
But you're pursued by a strange force.
Just keep going, it says.
Fight...
Live.
Listen up.
First test.
Awareness.
This is the first step: understanding and getting to know your pain.
Facing the deepest part of yourself.
Finding the evil in your subconscious and defeating it once and for all.
Only an exorcism will rescue you from the abyss.
Totem.
Only those who have descended into the darkness, only those who have fought death and loneliness, only those who have crossed the black waters of their shit and their torment.
Only they... shall be worthy of seeing the light they carry inside.
But what do I have to do?
You have to go home and see what still needs to be done.
Sara, you'll soon understand that we've all been through this.
Everyone.
Calm down.
Sara!
Sara!
Baby... Baby...
You have to come back...
Come back...
Come.
No...
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Sara...
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die.
Sara!
You're not dead!
You are not dead.
You're still in your bedroom.
Facing your window.
A great battle is being fought within your soul.
Life... or death.
Darkness spreads inside you.
No one has prepared you for the pain the world causes.
You're alone before the most important fight.
Listen carefully.
We are your personal defense force.
We fought off the attack just in time.
But think, death is on the loose and it's coming after you.
Only you can stop it now.
This is the way of awareness.
You've passed the first test.
Two remain.
Let's go.
Quick, you need to make up your mind.
Go where you won't learn anything.
Or where you feel caged in.
But there's another option hidden at the crossroads.
Come on!
You have no talent!
You're a waste of time!
You're useless, you retarded little girl.
We should leave you behind.
If you hesitate like this every time, how will you ever pass the other tests?
I'll distract her.
FOLLOW YOUR INTUITION
MEDUSSA
I'm down here!
We've lost Prosak.
There's a hidden option.
No, you're not hallucinating.
You've entered the world of the imagination.
Where you'll be able to find surprising new options.
Decisions which will free your life in different directions.
Who says reality can't be changed!
A great voice once said it outright:
"Be the change you want to see in the world."
You're going to discover your power.
Hidden in everything, your whole being.
Let me show you... what no one else has ever seen.
Wake up, leave, ?ee, seek place, space time, see, want, have, be able to, return, life,
stay alert, keep quiet, observe, wait, walk, obey, endure, advance, feel, hug, bite, want,
?y, roar, keep streets,
noises, minutes, hours, days, months, years, calendar,
bad people, rush hour, crashes, damage, steps, laughing,
crying, impossible dreams, kisses, blows,
men, ladies, life, love, always free.
Moon, Earth, sky, clouds, wind, rain, fire, you go up, go down,
you lose, you win, more hitches, more plans, more goals, more fame, and tomorrow more, hitches, more, more,
citizens, voices, friction, races, lights,
you do, you grow, you live, you sleep, you struggle, have happy moments, sex, love, friends, enemies, deals,
partners, pacts, duels, prices, healthy,
vices, dirty, jealousy, streets,
squares, bars, cars, nights, shadows, names,
I just want to forget, inspire, breathe, calculate,
watch over, you think, you feel,
you are, you speak, decision, precision,
ambition, hope, intuition, expression,
they're words.
If you think too much about it, you lose.
Overcome your fear and say what you feel.
Express your ideas, your love, your tenderness, your pain, your rage
Feel your words fill, connect, resound, breathe.
Feel their load, their dart, their mark, their magic, their impact, their brightness, their sensitivity.
Their perfect balance.
That penetrates and inspires, that transforms and determines, that cures and annihilates.
Words are your power.
Enter the zone where you can be yourself.
We have to wait.
Rest.
What is there?
The second test.
Someone inside is trying to pass it.
VERBO
Soon you will understand.
This girl...
She doesn't deserve our pity.
Look at her.
Look at you.
Look at you.
Deep down we all know she won't complete the mission!
What's your problem?!
You've given me nothing but grief all along!
I've had it!
I can't take it any more!
Hey, you did it so well none of us could stand you.
Even I wanted to kill you.
At last!
It was about time you expressed your anger.
Put a stop to whatever intimidates you.
Totem was only playing the tyrant inside us all.
Well done, Totem.
You'll do just fine, sister.
Hermes.
He was so scared...
We couldn't help him!
There was nothing we could do!
I lost my whole group. All three.
I will stay here.
Liriko...
Liriko... You must continue.
Let's go.
Sara!
Live!
Second test: words.
The great battle for your soul between the deepest darkness and the brightest light inside you.
Living is expressing what you feel, what you think.
You begin. Attack.
Make yourself known.
Be proud of yourself.
Fight...
Live...
Go...
Please...
Let me die.
I can't take it any more.
I'm exhausted.
Put an end to this pain.
This emptiness, this deep abyss, wandering, meandering, faithless, hopeless.
Pointless.
Give me a reason.
Give me a single reason,
I can't find any.
YOU FEEL YOUR LIFE
DOES NOT RHYME.
The world is ugly, sad, cruel, unfair, miserable, painful, ruthless, selfish, cold, empty, horrible, terrible.
I'd rather die.
I have reemerged!
Now I will defend myself!
I will conquer you.
I'm here to stop you.
You're pathetic!
You'll only last a few seconds.
You always run away and give in
- to anything that scares you!
- No!
I'll defend myself!
You can't!
- You always break!
- I'll fix me!
- You fall down!
- I'll get up!
- You're in pain!
- Yes, but I can take it!
- Everything hurts you.
- I treat my wounds.
- You're the one who keeps them open.
- In life you lose.
Yes, you lose, but you learn!
- I love.
- And you get hurt.
- I accept the risk.
- Sometimes I win.
I decide.
I am my soul.
I am my body. I speak.
I do.
I grow.
I choose.
I change.
L fight.
I feel.
I am! I... am!
Verbo!
A thought becomes an action.
An action becomes an attitude.
An attitude becomes a destiny.
Awareness and words,
GTE yours.
You did great. Very good.
You've passed.
You won't have to jump any more.
You won't want to...
Now you're ready to return.
The third test awaits you.
Action. It lies in what you need to express most and what is hardest for you to overcome.
Look at chapter 50.
And Medussa...
Prosak...
Totem...
We're inside of you.
We are you.
I am you.
Thank you.
- Sara...?
- Hi, Dario.
Hi.
- Are you okay...?
- Yes.
Thanks for worrying and calling.
I've had a weird few days.
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm going back to school tomorrow.
- I can't wait to see you.
- Me too.
I can't wait to see you either.
Okay, well...
- See you tomorrow, okay?
- Wait!
- What?
- Where are you?
At home. Why?
Dario?
- Nothing, forget it. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Morning, Dad.
Looking for these?
What is it, Sara!
Mom, the thing about the monk...
Remember?
It wasn't nonsense.
I get it now.
He was brave enough to defend something that made everyone else uncomfortable.
No matter how hard you try, you can't hide shit.
Please, not now, okay?
I know you want only the best things for me.
But I don't understand them.
They don't make sense to me.
I can't accept them just like that.
I can't. I shouldn't.
I have to try to be myself.
I can change things, I know that now.
- I love you very much.
- I love you, too.
YOUR LIFE IS STARTING
TO RHYM. LIRIKO sorry
Luis...
Now what?
Truth or dare...
Right here, right now.
There's nothing harder than
LEADERS IN UGLY LIVING
to cause pain to someone that you love.
But bigger is the pain
if we remain in silence
and don't confront what we fear.
UNDERTAKE YOUR GREATEST WORK
THROUGH BEAUTIFUL, TINY GESTURES
But the pain
can be cured.
Everything is at stake.
INES SALGADO
ACQUISITIONS MANAGER
The moment to be determined has come.
Good morning.
Let's continue with Chapter 8.
Who would like to read?
Nobody.
Check the tramp!
Half of you can't read and the other half don't even know where you are.
Let her, she's totally crazy!
That's okay, Sara.
You can sit down.
Chapter 50:
"Whoever you are, you who at the fearsome lake are looking, if you have come to get the thing that lies beneath these black liquids without no more show us your mighty chest and throw..."
Silence...!
"Throw yourself into the black water, get wet again and again until your life finds something.
If this is not the case, be angry and go your way; for if you don't you will not be worthy to see the beautiful sign you carry inside you.
Know that you are not aware of the great wisdom this book contains.
Neither what the point is, nor how it concerns us."
I say this with respect and sadness, for your task is not an easy one, it's not only finishing the syllabus,
I assure you.
You look to me as if I am mad, but I am lucid,
I just do not cover my mouth.
This is just a lyric record in this arctic landscape.
In any country, any place, on any pavement, don't let beauty and truth die.
What I witness does not deserve my silence.
Tell me, what do you put a price on?
For all these reasons your humble servant takes her leave, challenges my heart bids of me await.
And no sir,
I'm not dropping out,
The failure is not mine.
I'm not the one who created this void.
Come.
I want to show you something.
And now, what?
We are going to change some things, now you'll see.
What you are now seeing,
would be considered by some as impossible.
Perhaps they are right
and it's me who is mistaken.
But allow me to be able to live it,
ar least for a moment.
Because trapped amongst the walls they have built
are my soul and the souls of my friends.
On these walls we paint our dreams,
wich we do not consider lost.
Because,
now I know who I am.
I am Verbo.
GIVE BEAUTY BACK TO US
In the beginning was the word,
that energy that guides your voice if you speak.
Just like a weapon alive on your lips
that gets you away from the mire and lonely suffocation.
We're unfinished puzzles, hysterical wandering skeletons.
While our silence increase s and hurts, so affection dies, sad and starving.
Seeing that nothing changes,
that rage sleeps in the back of your throat,
always anchored in that fear that makes you retch.
Thinking so much, saying nothing, feeling every gaze.
Undermined by habit, dry from scarcity,
by the thirst of unfulfilled desires.
Open your mind and look at the walls.
They'll say you can be yourself I not noticing other beings, and be the wind between concrete deserts.
Knowing that those around you don't mould you any more, making everyone believe when they see
you're fighting for what you want.
You say, you do, you grow, you feel because you are,
Verbo.
The proof you exist with an inner scream.
The voice that is born and makes you cross time.
The essence that distinguishes you and makes you shine.
The weapon that unites goals and memories.
Verbo.
Too much heaven for such small wings.
Too much time alone.
Too many bullets to dodge them all.
Too much darkness for you to move.
Too much life to take a chance on death.
That's why it takes action to make the impossible real.
Circumstances tie you down but thoughts are free.
Able to eradicate the dark side absorbing you,
that huge deformed being living between chaos and order,
which withers you inside, stirring in cauldrons of stealth,
where feelings are lost.
No more silence if we burn.
No more eyes to the poison ground.
No grief I black water in your veins, blinding you every morning.
You speak, you search, you love, you win, because your name is...
Verbo.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Be that bolt that hits and thunders in the deep.
You and your voice together like a shining light.
You and your voice,
no one defends you when others don't understand
you're special,
you don't fall into the facile spiral dragging others down
like one of those faces, you won't throw your life away.
Turn around and see how many are suffocating,
wavering at the tops of buildings.
They see that habit and vice left them far from Eden.
But the one with the formula breaks free.
The quivering web of the tarantula from which no one escapes.
So free your passion, your fury.
Take action, keep your hardship at bay,
and remember, any emotion dies when it's hidden.
You struggle, you ?y, you know, you can.
Your name is the proof you exist with an inner scream.
The voice that is born and makes you cross time.
The essence that distinguishes you and makes you shine.
The weapon that unites goals and memories.
You have the greatest power we've ever been given.
The word that frees a chain reaction.
The gift of the power to be someone far from a sickly silence
that traps you in order to make you its servant.
Dare to change your world.
Subtitles: LASERFILM
Great job, you guys.
Has anyone seen Stacy?
Stacy?
Stacy, where are you guys?
Oh, hey boss.
Table four. Come meet us.
Hey, did you check out that cute guy by the Monet?
The one breathing on the Monet?
I called security.
I think it's best to steer clear of him, given my track record.
Ooh, is that for me?
- No, no, that's my...
- Thanks! I'm starving!
The show is going great. To Beth!
- Our fearless leader.
- Job well done.
Thank you, guys.
Oh, my God. Is that Brady Sacks?
Beth's ex? Where?
Not a funny joke.
And I'll tell you why.
Because if Brady had the nerve to show up here,
I mean at my event, no less, after he...
- Dumped you like yesterday's trash?
- Ripped your heart out and fed it to the Central Park pigeons?
Come on, I'm not even over your breakup yet.
Well, I am, OK?
In a big way. Brady Sacks?
Who cares?! That's what I say.
He's right behind me, isn't he?
- Brady...
- Oh, yeah...
- Great show.
- Great show, guys.
Uh, what are you doing here?
Look, I know you're crazy busy, but there's something
I need to say to you.
Something I think'll make up for what I put you through.
Uh... OK.
I've got three words for you,
Beth Martin.
- I was wrong.
- Did he just say he was wrong?
A year ago, when I broke up with you, I felt like you cared more about your work than you did about me.
Yeah, I remember, Brady, really clearly, when you broke up with me in the Applebee's.
I'm sorry about that, but I'm here to tell you that...
...I get it.
- Can you hear?
Barely. I think he said he gets it.
Oh, he gets it!
I'm ready to jump in again, in a big way.
You want to jump in again?
Yeah.
Wow, uh...
Yeah. I mean, maybe. If it's slow.
You made me realize that it doesn't matter how hard someone works, as long as you love them enough.
Yes. I can't believe that you're saying that.
I'm just a little overwhelmed.
I met someone who works just as hard as you do, only now I can accept her for that.
- We're getting engaged!
- Beth's getting engaged!
Did I just hear that right?
Our host and curator, Beth Martin, is getting engaged?
Uh... Uh...
No, I'm not. I'm not getting engaged!
Not tonight, not to him.
Oh, man.
But maybe.
Maybe in the future sometime.
I don't know. With someone else.
Got to see how it pans out. OK?
Well, at least it wasn't in the Applebee's.
Worst day ever.
- Joan?
- Sis! Guess what?
I'm getting married!
Yay.
His name is Umberto.
Umberto! How sexy is that?
We met on a flight to Italy two weeks ago, and now we're getting married. In Rome.
Wow. That... Joan. Wow.
He's the one, Beth. I know it.
I can't wait until you meet him.
And when I do, I will have known him for almost as long as you have.
You know what?
You're not exactly a role model when it comes to relationships.
OK, maybe not, but that is because
I have a relationship with my job.
I love my job. And when I find a guy that I like more than my job, that's how I'll know he's the one.
OK, so basically what you need is a male version of yourself.
Well, he doesn't have to be blonde.
You know that I mean this with all the love in the world, but two weeks, Joan?
That's not long enough.
That's not even enough time for a credit check.
When you know, you don't need proof.
You just know.
- Be happy for me, B.
- God, I am! I am.
I am.
She's doomed. I mean, come on, you meet some Italian guy in first class, you date him.
- You don't marry him.
- She's so lucky.
Just imagine working in a place where they sort men into classes.
What? I'm just saying.
My baby sister is about to make the biggest mistake of her life, and there's nothing I can do about it.
She got swept away. It happens.
No, it doesn't.
Instead of chasing a fairy tale, you could focus on work.
That's what I do.
And you know what?
I've never been happier.
Well, you must be ecstatic.
And still single, I understand.
It appears we can begin.
In nine days, we'll be hosting the single most important event of our year,
The Board of Trustees'
Annual Circle of Gold Gala.
This year, the special installation for the event is the brainchild of our youngest and therefore least-experienced curator.
An exhibition centered on the theme of pain. Status report.
Fourteen of our pieces are already on site, and three of the remaining four are en route.
- And the remaining piece?
- Is the Slater Bradley.
Yes, the centerpiece for the exhibition, where is it?
We're resolving some last-minute insurance issues.
Last-minute? I can't say
I like the sound of that.
It'll be here. I'll make sure of it.
Moving on...
Ah, there is one small little detail.
The day after tomorrow, my sister will be getting married.
In Rome. Italy.
Well, that simply won't do.
Well, it's my baby sister's wedding.
Well, we all have sisters, Beth.
Mmm.
I will stay on top of this from Rome.
I'll be in and out in 48 hours, and you have my word, Celeste.
The Circle of Gold Gala will go off without a hitch.
It better. You may be talented, Beth, but you're not irreplaceable.
Have a nice trip.
So...
How long you stay Rome, eh?
Uh, 48 hours and counting.
Is not so much time. But lucky for you, it only takes a moment to see true beauty.
The Eternal City is the most romantic city in the world.
You never lived until you loved in Rome.
Not a lot of reception around here, huh?
Put down your phone and look, signora. Welcome to Roma!
Did I mention I'm late for my sister's wedding?
Many times.
So much beauty!
And, finally, the magnificent Fontana d'Amore.
A place where romantics from all over the world come to wish for love.
Old people, young people, ugly people.
They get so lost in love. It's nice!
Yes, nice, thank you.
And good luck!
Joan, the Amsale dress looks gorgeous.
- Hi! Hi.
- Beth, darling!
Wow, look at you.
You look exhausted.
- Thanks, Mom.
- She looks fine.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
What happened to "don't see the bride before the wedding"?
- Isn't this bad luck?
- Girls, we don't have time.
Your father's current tramp of the month is waiting inside with your dress.
I heard that. And she's not a tramp.
She's a pro beach volleyball player.
Hello, sweetheart.
Hi, Daddy.
- How are you?
- Exhausted.
Beth, this is Umberto, my fiancé.
So, you're my sister too, now.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
You have to meet his family.
They're a scream.
See if he has a brother.
- Dad!
- Cousin.
Slippery little... Come on.
How does he get service?
- You're late, Nick.
- I'm sorry.
- Where's your tie?
- Oh!
There we go.
I know, but I can't get an Internet signal.
I need to know that you're on top of the Slater Bradley situation.
Hey!
You're breaking up.
Just whistle if you can hear me.
- Stacy?
- Ah, there's my girl.
Taking care of business.
- Always.
- Having a good time?
Oh, yeah. You know me,
I love small, intimate weddings.
If you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly, right?
I don't know what that means.
- So, what do you think of Tina?
- She seems very fit, Dad.
That's all you can say?
Tan and odds-on favorite to catch the bouquet.
You're a very lucky man.
I only wish for you the feeling I have when I'm with her.
Come on, Beth. Get going here.
I want to throw another wedding.
You will. You're due for another wife pretty soon.
I'm sorry, that was a low blow.
Quite a pair, huh?
You refuse to fall in love, and I can't stop.
Promise me one thing.
When it comes, you'll be open to it.
- I will try, Daddy.
- There you are!
- It's vase-breaking time.
- It's what?
It's a tradition.
The maid of honor shatters a vase, and the number of pieces symbolizes the years of happiness she wishes for the bride and groom.
Wow! That's a lot of pressure.
Right? So smash it hard.
- OK.
- OK.
I'm so sorry.
I was not aiming for that, but, man, I really nailed it.
She wishes them a life
- of great tragedy!
- No, I don't. No, I don't.
I just... I'm trying to break it.
I'm really trying.
I cracked it!
OK. We're almost there. Excuse me.
Die! Oh, man!
Let's just go ahead and let me handle this.
Wow. You are... you're...
You're quite the determined little thing, aren't you?
Yeah, well, I cracked it before you smashed it.
I know. Yeah, I know.
- I'm Nick, by the way.
- Beth.
Nice to meet you.
I would've introduced myself earlier, but I was running a little late.
Yeah, I noticed.
I was in the hills doing an interview, and on my way back
I kinda got hit by a goat.
- Oh, my God! You hit a goat?
- No, the goat hit me.
It wasn't my fault, and the goat's fine.
- What are they saying?
- It means "speech."
I think you're up again. There you go.
Hello again.
I'm Beth, sister of the bride.
Umm...
Umberto, though I haven't known you for very long...
Uh...
I'm sorry. I don't speak any Italian.
Umberto, although
I haven't known you very long...
I'm a little rusty, so if you stay away from any obscure idioms, that would be great.
Yeah. Sure.
I'll keep it simple. Thank you.
When I look at you, Joan,
I remember a little girl who believed in magic.
As I look at you right now...
...I see a grown woman who has seen all the magic in the world come true tonight.
Joan...
Joan likes magic...
This is harder than I thought.
Maybe if we all clap loudly...
...she'll wrap it up.
Because you and Umberto are making magic here tonight.
Well, it was worth a try...
And I know that, if you could, you'd share that feeling with me.
And I know that you'll...
...share him with me.
Oh!
OK. It appears our best man has run out of Italian, so cheers.
I liked your toast.
Thank you. Umberto's brother already hit on me, and most of his family thinks I'm a pervert, but thanks.
They do that for good luck.
So where did you learn to speak Italian so poorly?
Syracuse.
Umberto and I were roommates.
He taught me how to talk to girls in Italian, and I taught him American football.
I wanted to ask you before...
- Who is your service provider?
- Uh, why?
I saw you e-mailing earlier, and I kind of have signal envy.
Give me your phone. I need to send one quick work e-mail.
- If I don't...
- No, you can't have my phone.
- Why not?
- You're just gonna take my number.
- I'm not gonna take your number.
- You're gonna take my phone and call your phone with it so that you have my number, and I can't have you booty-calling me
- at 2:30 in the morning.
- I'm not go...
Wait! You know what? I do. I need it.
Because I need to block it from my phone.
I can't give it to you, because
Umberto made me turn it off.
- So it's on vibrate?
- No, it's off.
- Like "off" off?
- Yeah.
- Nicholas!
- Ah, Father Dino!
- Nicholas!
- Father...
All right.
Maybe some cards again tonight?
Some Texas holding them?
I don't think so. You cleaned me out at Umberto's bachelor party.
- No more cards for me, pal.
- Wow.
I take my vows only six months ago.
They say it's a work in the progress.
- Sure.
- Forgive me.
Come on, Father. It's OK.
It's just a card game. It's OK.
It's OK. No more cards.
It's OK.
- Look at those two.
- Tell me he's a good guy.
- Ah, he's a saint. Her?
- An angel.
Oh, a saint and an angel.
I give it a year.
I would not even give it six months.
This marriage has the shelf life of a banana.
They've known each other two weeks.
That's not even enough time for a credit check.
- What?
- Nothing.
Hey!
No, wait! I don't want to... No, wait!
Uh, it's my bad.
Sorry about that.
Go ahead.
What are you...?
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah. It's mine.
Just put that back in there. Thank you.
Hey!
Hey.
- What did he just yell at you?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Nothing.
It means "the hit."
I played some football in college and...
...I took kind of a big hit.
Football. Goats. You get hit a lot.
It's kind of a famous hit.
It's not exactly what you want to be known for.
But it's football. Doesn't everyone get hit in football?
I got hit by lightning. OK?
On the field. In a game.
- Oh...
- Yeah.
See, I get that look a lot.
It's OK. It's OK.
Aside from a slight peripheral vision issue, I'm fine.
- Oh! Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.
You smell like lavender.
You smell like livestock.
You're not so tough.
Beth! It's time to cut the cake.
Oh... all right.
He looks nice.
But so did your father.
- You seen her?
- No.
Be open to it, Beth.
Trust in love, Beth.
Believe in magic, Beth.
Mmm-hmm.
What the hell.
Come on. There you go.
OK...
Of course.
What an idiot.
What are you looking at?
Fountain of Love.
What a crock.
I mean, we wait our whole lives for some perfect guy to come in and sweep us off our feet.
Well, guess what. He's not coming.
Each one of you is a desperate wish for love that is never gonna come true.
So I'm saving you.
And...
...saving you.
You, I don't give a damn about.
But I am saving you.
Magic.
- And you...
- So beautiful.
Thank you.
And I'm saving you.
- Hey, Father Dino.
- Nicholas.
Oop, the love police.
- Hello.
- Oh, hey. Hey, it's Nick.
Nick who?
- Beamon. From the wedding.
- What's taking him so long?
- Joan gave me your number.
- Of course she did.
Uh, I wasn't really expecting to get you.
Want me to hang up so you can talk to the machine?
- No. This is good.
- Yo, Nick! What's going on?
Did you get lost?
Grab some beers! Let's do this!
I'm looking for the bottle opener.
It's on the fridge. See it from here.
Dude, you gave me the instruction card.
- That's a helpful card.
- Why is it wet?
- I put it in a glass of water.
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.
- That's weird.
I was thinking maybe we could have dinner later?
Uh, I'm already having dinner.
Oh. Maybe a drink? Some coffee?
- Nope.
- Which part no?
- The drink or the coffee?
- Nick!
Umm, it's just sort of a blanket nope.
Nick, how long you gonna take?
We watched Roots while you were gone!
Maybe I'm a little off base here,
but I thought that we hit it off the other night, no?
Yeah, Nick, you're a little off base.
Who would win in a fight?
A whale or a silverback gorilla?
Definitely a whale.
It also depends if they're in water or not.
What about, like, a couple silverback gorillas?
If they're in water, they'll lose.
Don't think they swim good?
I think they swim well.
I don't know if they swim good.
Let's be an English major, why don't we?
Dude, what took you so long?
I didn't have a beard when you left.
Nice. What's this?
- What's it look like?
- A bottle opener.
Use that to open beer bottles?
That would've been nice, beers.
That would've been nice.
That would've been great.
Whoa! You didn't call some chick
- during our game, did you?
- No!
You don't mind if I hit redial?
That wouldn't bother you?
- No, no, no, no. Give me that!
- Hello? I love you.
- So touchy all of a sudden.
- I'm not touchy.
You're sensitive all of a sudden.
I'm not... I'm not sensitive.
That's what a sensitive person would say.
Yeah, whatever.
Methinks some girl has put a spell on you.
No!
Wait! I just need to see your feet!
OK, I chase. No problem.
This is a great view from behind.
Wait!
Now the game is on!
In Italia, when a woman run away, it mean she love you!
You must love me so much!
Bella, wait! Wait!
How can I prove my love to you, if you won't stop?!
Mi amore, I just need one moment with your feet!
I'm coming!
Uh-oh!
You out of your frigging mind, dude?
Are you OK?
I don't know what you're saying.
What's he saying?
I don't know. I don't speak idiot.
Please, allow me...
...to see your magnifico feet.
- What? No! Ew!
Hey, this is you.
- And this one, too.
- Let me explain.
My name is Antonio Guiseppe Donatello.
I'm from the village of Nunzio in Italia.
I... Oh, my spleen. It's OK.
Two days ago, I have a vision.
I see the face of love, your face.
Then I see your neck, your torso, your...
Oh, got it. I get it.
But... I could not paint your feet.
You came from Italy to paint my feet?
No, also to earn your love.
I think you have me confused with someone else.
Put some ice on it and be careful.
OK! I will paint your face on every building in this city until you recognize my love!
Hi. I'm kind of in a hurry, so...
Thanks.
No problem.
Isn't this place the greatest?
You can get your work done, no one bothers you.
Food's great. Low carb, high protein.
The only way to go when your work requires you to be shredded and dieseled out.
Oh, yeah, here, don't crane your neck.
Go ahead. Feast your eyes.
Yes, I've seen that look before.
You're intimidated because I'm a model.
But I don't want you to be scared,
OK? I'm a normal guy.
This is my portfolio.
It's kind of my calling card.
These are mostly non-paying jobs, or spec work.
I think that's a real dog.
And here's the crown jewel.
I am the Gasee guy. So...
- Wow.
- I'm Gale.
Like a gale-force wind.
I took on that name because it's the most powerful force in the natural world.
For shaping and eroding the earth, it's...
You can feel it.
Actually, I think that's water, eroding the earth.
Don't think it's water.
I think it's wind.
- Like the Grand Canyon.
- I'm gonna look that up.
This is crazy. I don't know whether to look at my own reflection or at you,
- that's how beautiful you are.
- You know what? I have to go.
OK, you asked for it.
- Yeah, she's back. Hi.
- You can't just take your shirt off.
I don't hear any complaints from the peanut gallery, so...
- Put your shirt back on, creep.
- Here you go.
I know this looks nuts, all right?
And maybe I am a little nuts because I've never tried to share my beauty with anyone before.
And I think it's because
I'm in love with you. Big time.
Great first date, Beth!
Let's get another one on the books soon.
Come on, man, put your shirt on.
Honestly though, is there a doctor here, because there's some kind of weird swelling in this...
Yeah, that can't be normal, can it?
Humans aren't...
Jeez, Louise, dessert's served.
Sit down, Gas guy.
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me, miss. Miss?
I believe you dropped this.
Oh, my... Yeah, thank you.
I don't know how that fell off. Thanks.
Miss?
How did you...?
Time flies, but magic flies faster.
Oh, you're a street magician.
I really appreciate it, but I don't have the time right now.
You have all the time in the world.
Damn it. All right, now it's getting kind of creepy because you must have just touched me, and I didn't feel anything.
Pick a card, and I'll show you my heart.
- Come on, do it!
- Do it!
If I pick a card, will you stop stealing my watch?
- Probably.
- OK.
Take a good look.
Don't show it to me.
- Wasn't gonna.
- Place it back in the deck.
- Ready, everyone?
- Wow.
That's not my card.
I know... because the joker is me.
A fool for love.
I told you I'd show you my heart.
Ew!
Oh!
Is this your card?
Get over here.
Little help here, please.
Hey, little girl, could you please give me my heart?
Is it me, or is New York getting crazier?
- Your sister's on line two.
- Take a message.
- She says it's kind of important.
- Fine. Patch her through.
Hi, Joan.
What were you doing in the Fontana d'Amore
- during my wedding?
- What makes you think that...
I'm looking at a picture of you.
It's front-page news over here, sis.
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
Little bit ofjet lag, little bit of champagne, or a lot of champagne.
And the next thing I'm sitting in the fountain picking up coins.
She took coins from the fontana?
That's not so good.
- Why not so good?
- There is a legend,
if you take someone's coin from the fontana,
they will fall in love with you.
- Oh! Except that is ridiculous.
- OK. Then we hang up!
I totally believe in magic coins.
- Were you on that call?
- Love is finally at your doorstep.
So have any men come on to you since the wedding?
- Well...
- Oh, my God. They have been.
Yeah, a couple of weirdos approached me this morning...
There are some magical forces at work here.
I don't believe in magic.
Know what I do believe in?
Art. Where's my Slater Bradley?
Told you I was on top of it.
The insurance company totally wanted to jack up the rate, so in an effort to be more assertive,
I told them to shove it.
You told Hillman and Craft to shove it?
- Yeah.
- That piece was coming from a collector in Australia.
Even if we got it on a jet today, it would never clear customs in time for the gala.
That means I have no centerpiece for the Circle of Gold.
I'll get Hillman and Craft on the phone.
- I don't think I burned that bridge.
- No, no. It's too late now.
I have to tell Celeste.
Hello?
Hey. Did I mention Joan gave me your cell number, too?
- Little busy now. What do you want?
- Same thing I wanted last night.
What is it going to take for me to convince you
- that I'm not interested in you?
- What is it going to take?
It's going to take you looking me in the eye to tell me that.
That'd require seeing you, and I don't have the time...
- Hi.
- Oh, so you're stalking me now?
No, I'm just running into you in a premeditated manner.
I have a big problem on my hands right now.
I just lost the centerpiece to my show.
- Beth?
- Celeste.
This is Mr. Al Russo, our newest patron.
He asked specifically to see you.
Of course. Um, hi. Um...
- I'm sorry. Have we met before?
- In my dreams.
Beth has secured a rare Slater Bradley as the centerpiece for our pain exhibit.
Actually, Celeste...
- Nick Beamon? Are you Nick Beamon?
- Yeah.
Nick the Hit! You want to talk about pain, this guy...
- A million volts in the neck.
- That's fascinating.
Beth, you do have the Slater Bradley, yes?
- Celeste, it's...
- My fault, and I was meaning to tell you...
Actually, she has access to something better.
- This is really not the time.
- An original Petrocelli.
The title of the photograph is Anguish.
It too has never been viewed in public.
A Petrocelli that's never been viewed?
That's right. Damian Petrocelli agreed to give me the print
- and burn the negative.
- Why would he do that?
Because I happen to be the subject of the photo.
And I'm willing to relive that humiliation in public because I know that as long as Beth is involved, it will be in good hands.
How about that private tour we're gonna have?
Follow me.
...including Cézanne, Degas,
Manet, Picasso and Van Gogh...
They're just really nicely spaced.
You did such a great job.
Let me... I have something for you.
This is a gift for you.
Oh, my.
It's not from Tiffany.
- Sausage. That's your face.
- Yeah, that's it.
This may sound a little odd to you, but encased meat is my life's work.
I am like a curator, just like you.
A curator of sausage.
- Well, passion is passion.
- That's exactly what I say.
There is not an emotion on Earth that can't be expressed through sausage.
And that bratwurst is saying,
"Hello, and thank you for showing me the museum."
Who knew bratwurst could even say all that?
- Beth.
- Please tell me you're here because you have a deep appreciation for modern art.
I have a deep appreciation, but for you, Beth.
That's it. Tour's over.
I know it seems crazy.
It's crazy to me too.
Want to play cat and mouse?
I can play cat and mouse.
You forgot your sausages!
Oh, no. Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it hurts.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that was you. I didn't...
I'm really sorry.
It hurts so bad, but tastes so good.
- What is that, mint?
- It's breath spray.
You startled me, I didn't have anything else. I am so sorry.
Can I see it? Take your hands away.
- You're gonna make it worse.
- I'm not gonna make it worse.
Don't be such a baby.
I really feel awful.
I did not know that it would hurt that bad.
It doesn't hurt that bad.
I was just playing.
You think you're real charming, don't you?
- Little bit.
- Yeah. Well, you are. OK?
- What?
- OK.
Where are you going?
I know your type of guy, Nick.
And what type is that?
Come on. The girl in the red dress kissing you at the fountain?
- You saw that?
- Yeah.
That's why you've been cold the last couple of days.
Is that so hard to believe?
That was Umberto's crazy cousin, OK?
You know the blood runs hot in that family.
Yeah, you seemed so sick about it.
I was a little sick about it.
Especially after I met you.
Wait!
Oh, no. Let's go this way.
- Hey, Beth! It's me, Al Russo!
- Oh, let's cross.
Whoa! Wait one second.
- One second!
- I'm sorry, Nick! I gotta go!
- Just...
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Hold on! Beth! Beth, wait.
Ah!
Ah, I did not see that one coming!
OK, Lance, you can do this.
Just have to believe.
I will do the Great Mummy Escape, and Beth will love me.
This worked for Houdini, it should work for me.
OK, here she comes.
Well, I don't know, Joan. OK?
I don't know what I believe anymore.
All I know is that this is crazy, and I need it to stop.
We told you this would happen.
OK, then what is it gonna take for me to end this little nightmare?
You have to return the coins to the Fontana d'Amore.
Wait, that's it?
And spell broken, and these guys leave me alone?
I'm overnighting you the coins right now.
That's no good. She needs to return the coins herself.
I cannot just fly back to Italy to put some magic coins into a fountain.
There's got to be another way we can handle this.
- Try and enjoy the attention?
- Joan...
Beth! It's me, Lance.
I'm setting a record for you.
I know this looks scary and dangerous, but if I can do this, get out of the straitjacket...
Stop! Stop!
What are you doing in my apartment?
Blowing your mind!
No one's ever done the Mummy Escape in under three minutes.
- Juan, what's my time?
- Three minutes and 53 seconds.
I don't know. That felt pretty tight.
Are you sure you timed that right?
You know, you want to find the rabbit, you got to work the hat.
You're just not putting in the hours, bro.
- Not in front of my girlfriend.
- Who the hell is that?
That's Juan, my assistant.
He's just been video chronicling all my illusions. Anyway...
Both of you, out of my apartment, now.
No, wait. Now listen up.
Oh, my goodness.
Your perfume is intoxicating, and your hair smells like cinnamon!
Get out!
Hey, Nick... Douche.
You get those old Giant photos
I asked you for?
I am a professional photographer.
I'm not your girl Friday, OK?
I would appreciate some respect, but yes, here.
Or, in lieu of respect, I'd appreciate you and me chatting up two ladies and leaving the one that knows more about Wookiees alone with this.
I'm not gonna be able to make that party.
What? No, Saturday night is the ESPN party.
That's a work and play event, dude.
Oh, my God. It's the girl.
- The museum girl, isn't it? I knew it.
- You don't understand.
You should see this girl.
I can barely keep up with her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful. She's funny.
Oh, my God, no.
Stop it! Stop liking her!
Do not go any further until I can do a little recon on this girl.
Recon? What are you, black ops?
No, absolutely not.
What do you really know about her?
I'm not going to let my boy go in there blind.
- Puck! No!
- No?
- No!
- No?
- No.
- How about yes?
OK, go.
Hey! Look at you!
Look at me, we look great!
I can't jog. I have a weak hamstring.
It's OK. I nearly die. But I...
Robert Longo,
Kiki Smith, Carl Riddle...
Mm-hm.
Wow! That looks great!
Let's be beautiful together.
Where you going? Beth!
It's gonna come back around in four minutes.
It's gonna be great!
I can explain.
There's a nude mural of you on 82nd Street. Should we start there?
I know. That is actually a funny...
- Could we start somewhere else?
- Flowers everywhere!
A sudden, unexplained change in the program for the Circle of Gold gala.
I need to have confidence in my curators, Beth...
You wouldn't believe if...
You're right.
- I'm sorry.
- You promised me this program
- would go off without a hitch.
- It will.
Let me be perfectly clear.
If it doesn't, I'll see to it that the only artwork you're ever allowed near are the velvet Elvis paintings for sale in Times Square.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
This is gonna be a serious blow to your self-esteem.
Maybe you should sit down.
Remember that girl? The one you wanted to settle down with?
The one you wanted to be little soccer dad with?
Well, guess what. Mama's a bigger player than you, son!
Shazam! Check it out.
Foreign guys, old dudes,
Houdini, a half-naked gentleman.
This girl sees more action in one afternoon than you saw in your whole senior season.
Look, I'm sorry, man, but it's all there.
It's pretty clear what I have to do.
Yeah.
I got to pick up my game.
Ow!
- I was just thinking about you.
- I was just thinking of you.
I'm sorry I ran off the other day.
I've just been having one of those weeks.
Yeah, so it would seem.
Is everything OK?
There's a lot I would like to tell you.
Unfortunately, I need to cut to the chase. Back her up a bit.
My fundraiser at the museum, it's tomorrow,
- and I need to get my hands on that...
- The Petrocelli.
I'm kind of wavering on that now.
But that's the centerpiece to my pain exhibit.
Yeah, but have you thought at all about my pain, my suffering?
- What?
- I would feel better about it if we could sit down, talk about it, maybe over dinner?
I know this place called Blackout on Bleecker.
- I was thinking 8:00?
- So you're blackmailing me now?
- Actually, it's extortion.
- If I come to dinner,
- can I have my Petrocelli?
- I got to run. See you at 8:00!
- You have a date, huh?
- It's not a date.
So, what are you gonna wear?
My navy blouse, a pencil skirt, and some open-toed slingbacks.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Wow. You look great.
Oh, I didn't really have time to get ready. Um...
So this is it?
Yeah. It's supposed to get a lot better in the back.
- OK.
- Look, we got off on the wrong foot.
Actually, we got off on the right foot, and Umberto's cousin messed everything...
I don't even want to talk about that right now.
I just wanted to tell you ever since that night in Rome...
Hi! My name is llona, and I'll be your sensory guide this evening.
Tonight you will enjoy a delicious gourmet meal without your primary sense of sight.
In this way your other senses will become heightened to bring you an exciting, new culinary experience.
Is she serious?
Yeah. Our last great moment was the night the lights went out in Rome, so I figured we'd pick up where we left off.
That's beautiful.
Please take my hand and I will lead you to your table.
Let's make a train.
Here we are. Now, just follow me. Stay close.
Just let your eyes take a back seat while your senses do the driving.
It's furniture.
That's a chair.
Very good. Very good.
You wouldn't have gotten to feel that chair if your eyes...
Oh, my. Oh, my!
- I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
- What an adventure.
All right. That's a head.
That's a man's head.
- There are so many people!
- I think I broke something.
Just keep coming forward.
That's a woman, sir.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Here's your table.
Now follow my voice to the chair.
- Follow my voice to the chair.
- Right here?
Where's my voice?
Your butt should go about here.
I know you can't see this, but you've got a gentleman.
Let me help you with your jacket.
It's a struggle because of your muscles. Jeez!
- Yeah.
- And here we are.
Are you smelling me?
OK. So, in just a few minutes, your wine will be out.
If you need anything at all, just raise your hand, and one of our attendants will assist you.
Remember, you can't see us, but we can see you.
This is... This is kind of...
- Kind of cool.
- Creepy.
- It's awesome!
- I thought you had left.
Your wine is being poured in front of you at two o'clock. Enjoy.
There you go.
I hope you didn't order anything expensive.
She could have switched it to a cheap bottle and we'd have no way of knowing.
Still here.
And I would never do that, ever.
You going to be there the whole meal, or...
No. I'm going to let the two of you get to know each other on a deeper level, and I'm going to go touch other people in the restaurant.
- OK, then. Thank you.
- Sure.
I think she's finally gone.
It's really dark.
I'll tell you this.
Even in the dark you're beautiful.
This is actually kind of nice.
This is the best I've felt since Rome.
Beth, it's me! Al Russo.
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Who's this?
- Your liverwurst nightmare, pal.
- Oh, no.
Ah, the feet...
Look who it is, principessa.
- Meatball!
- Sausage King!
Does anyone have... the time?
- Oh, God.
- Hey, my watch is missing.
Try being gorgeous, and no one can see you.
- Who is that?
- Waiter?
Feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini around with a car cover on.
Ordered an eight-pack? Please enjoy.
I had a great time, but I got to go!
"Great time?" We just got here!
Beth, wait. Beth...
Ow!
- Ma'am!
- What the hell is going on?
People really drop a lot of food in this place.
Are you dark dining and dashing?
I had her, and you blew it.
He make her disappear with magic.
Bring her back, warlock!
Taxi!
- Beth!
- Please, just let me go.
Do you mind telling me what the hell just happened there?
- How many guys are you seeing?
- I'm not see...
You don't...
Those guys don't know me.
They're just under a... spell.
Beth! Beth, hi!
Why don't you leave me alone!
I don't know you!
Beth, it's me.
Your dentist. Dr. Moscowitz.
Oh.
- Sorry, Dr. Moscowitz. Hi.
- Everything OK?
Oh, God, yeah.
- And I'm flossing twice a day.
- Oh, good.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Your dentist? Are you OK?
I just want to get out of here.
OK.
- Where do you want to go?
- I don't...
Where would you feel safe?
I used to come here with my parents when I was a little girl.
I thought this place was magic.
And my father told me that the roof was made of glass so that God could see the paintings from up in heaven.
Wow.
I know.
Her name was Marie-Therese Walter.
She was 17 when Picasso fell in love with her.
Picasso was already married, and 30 years her senior, so they kept their affair a secret.
But he documented his passion by hiding her initials in some of his paintings.
Of course, Picasso wasn't completely ready to settle down, and he left Marie-Therese for Dora Maar just like he left his wife Olga for Marie-Therese.
But Marie-Therese never stopped loving Picasso.
And she hung herself after his death.
Hey...
You OK?
She just loved him so much, and in the end, he didn't really love her back.
It's just sad.
You know, it doesn't always have to be that way.
Every time I've ever put myself out there, I've gotten hurt.
Every time.
It's like I meet a guy, and I think it's great.
And anyone else would just be thinking about how much greater it's going to get.
And I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.
You know, lightning does strike once in a while, Beth.
Trust me. I know.
I wish I could believe that.
You can. No other shoes are going to drop, Beth.
This is real.
I'm real.
- Damn it!
- It's OK.
- It's OK.
- One second.
Six beers enter, no beers leave!
What are you doing? Come on.
Is she here? What's her name? Betsy?
I hate you. You're ruining my life.
- Aha, you found it.
- Oh, it's so beautiful.
- And so sad.
- Yeah, it's OK.
You know, every time I look at that, all I think about is...
...everything football meant to me and my family and especially my old man.
All the dreams... gone in an instant.
That was the real hit.
Oh, no.
- What?
- I have to go.
What's wrong? We can slow down.
- I just have to go.
- Hold on, hold on.
Hold on. Hey!
- I don't get it.
- I know you don't, Nick.
And you probably never will.
But it's not real.
And it's never going to be real.
What about the photograph?
Keep it.
I don't want to see you in pain.
Is this all the programs?
I don't want to forget any.
Everything's gonna be OK, Beth.
I know it will.
No, it's not.
It's his chip. He's just under a spell.
It's not real.
- Hello.
- Listen, I have great news.
Umberto talked to his nana.
She said there's another way to break the spell.
- There is?
- Yeah.
All you have to do is return the coins directly to the guys.
It doesn't have to be the fountain.
Return the coin, return the love.
If I return the coins,
I return the love?
Yeah.
That'll break the spell?
And that'll get me out of this whole mess?
Yeah! It'll be all over.
Isn't that great?
- Yeah. It's great.
- I knew you'd be relieved.
This is for your own good, boss.
It's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah! Oh, I got to go.
Good luck at the show tonight.
I'll call you later.
- I love you, OK? Bye!
- OK.
Hey, boss, I'm gonna start setting up.
I'll see you at the Gugg.
Wow.
Come on in.
OK.
It's nice here. Very nice.
I like what you do. It's sort of modern.
- Very nice place.
- Beautiful.
Really nice. You look great.
Are you excited for the show?
You OK? You seem sad.
This is going to be harder than I thought. Um...
I'm actually glad that you're all here.
Just because I need to tell you something.
Oh.
Come here.
The couch. You can sit on the couch.
- You're gonna tell us on the couch?
- Yeah.
I think she's gonna pick one of us.
Like The Bachelor.
I love this show, with the rose.
- I like my odds.
- It's you, it's you.
Um...
I don't know any other way to say this, other than to just...
You don't love me.
- Trust me, I love you.
- No, you don't.
- They don't, but I do.
- I love you so much.
Well, I was drunk, but I took the coins. I took your coins.
- I do love you.
- It's not real. You don't love me.
- As much as I can love someone.
- No, you don't.
We're not in love with each other. I'm in love with someone else. I love Nick.
I love Nick.
I love Nick more than I love my job, which is big for me.
And it's not your fault, and I'm really sorry.
I love him even if he might not love me back.
You know?
I understand loving somebody and...
...them not loving you back.
We all do.
- It's a bummer.
- This really suck.
I'm sorry, guys.
OK...
The whole point of love is to put someone else's needs above your own.
Maybe that's why I'm here.
Maybe that's why we're all here.
Maybe for you.
- He may be on to something.
- No, it's true.
- How can we help?
- Thanks, guys.
And this will all be a little clearer when I give you something back.
Oh, no.
Stacy.
- What the heck is...?
- What?
- That was weird.
- I swear, that wasn't me.
It was just...
...freak electrical storm has caused rolling blackouts and gridlock
throughout the city. Traffic lights are out throughout the metro area.
New York City is at a standstill.
- We got to stay in.
- I make food for everybody. We eat.
No, no, no. We're not staying here.
You're not staying here.
I need to be at the Guggenheim.
This has to end now.
After we eat.
Hold it, hold it.
If we love her, we'll get her to the
Guggenheim. That's all there is to it.
Let's do this.
I'll do it. And I'm going to do it with more flair than all of you.
We take my car.
I just bring her from Italia.
- You have a car?
- It's molto grande.
For one, two... No, it be fine.
Come on! Move it!
- Comfortable up there?
- Where's the keys?
I had the keys in your apartment.
- Have the key.
- Give him the keys.
Ay-yay-yay!
- I am what I am.
- Annoying.
Who makes this car, Fisher-Price?
In Italia this is a midsize car.
In America it's a clown car.
Careful.
- It's Stacy. Leave a message.
- Please call me when you get this.
And don't do anything with those coins. I'm on my way.
- I was expecting a little bit bigger.
- Oh, tiny bit, huh?
Hit the horn. Thread the needle.
See if you can go around this guy.
- Just drive like you're in Rome.
- No problem.
Hey, coming through!
I'm OK.
If you can't reach the dashboard, and you wanna hold onto the washboards, let me know.
There's a fat guy on a bike.
A fat guy on a bike.
Sorry about that.
I'll give you a thousand bucks to let me sit in front.
- OK, that hurt.
- Damn it!
Come on up.
There's the Gugg!
Coming through!
- You can just let me out here.
- No, not close enough.
I take you right upstairs.
- No, Antonio. The doors!
- I got this. You must all believe.
- I don't believe!
- I don't believe!
I believe!
Open!
I did it!
Could you push five?
Stacy.
Beth. There you are.
You're a hit. They love the show.
The Petrocelli is... How?
Nick sent it over late this afternoon.
People cried when they saw it.
- And Celeste is...
- Pleased.
We've already received a record number of financial pledges tonight, Beth.
I'm very proud of you.
You're a wonderful curator.
Anyone who would care to join me in the Thannhauser, please come this way.
Stacy... I need the coins.
But look at what's happened, Beth.
Nick did all of this for you.
- He loves you.
- I know.
But if I take his love against his will, that's not love at all.
Please, Stacy. The coins.
I have to do this my way.
You are not going to the Guggenheim.
This isn't my scene.
What are you talking about?
We're neck-deep in hot ladies.
LT is here. What up, son?
- LT!
- Man, what's your damn problem?
He knows his name.
Where are you going?
Hey, how's it going?
We're from the network.
Good to see you. We're big fans.
We read your column every week.
Thank you.
Somebody we wanted to introduce you to. Nick, Shaq.
- How you doing? Read your article.
- Good. Yeah?
- Spelled my name wrong.
- It's the proofreading department.
- This guy right here?
- Yeah, this guy.
Excuse me, I've got to take this phone call.
- You don't know how to spell?
- I don't know anything.
Beth. Hey, how are you?
Nick, there's something
I want to tell you.
Even though it won't matter after tonight.
I want to thank you... for making me believe in love again.
Even if it wasn't real for you, it was very real for me.
What does that mean?
Beth. Beth!
Hey!
I'm guessing this belongs to you?
Does it?
Check your purse.
OK, stop it. I need you to take this.
Come on. Close your hand.
- Wait, I have another trick.
- Nope.
Now I remember.
I never had the guts to perform in public until I wanted to do it for you.
I guess I just needed a muse.
What am I going to do without you?
You'll find your muse. Your true muse.
Trust me, you won't be sorry.
Are you a coin collector?
When I threw this coin in the fountain
I wasn't wishing that my wife would come back.
I knew that wouldn't happen.
I was just wishing to get a chance to feel the way I did when she was around.
And...
...my wish came true. You gave me that.
Thank you.
Hey!
Come on!
Is this your euro?
- That's weird.
- Antonio?
- It's Anthony, actually.
- From Nunzio?
- No. Newark. New Jersey.
- Are you really a tortured artist?
Tortured. Been in retail shoe sales for the last nine years.
As far as being an artist, I guess
I figured going to Italy'd make me one.
I think you're an artist.
I do. And I'm not just saying that because I'm trying to get rid of you.
- It's my professional opinion.
- Thank you.
I think I'll miss you least of all.
Honestly, I don't think
I really learned anything.
- No?
- But I had a blast helping you grow.
You're welcome.
Mmm.
Good luck. It's all right.
- What's going on?
- All the lights are out.
Some kind of freak electrical storm.
I wouldn't cross there if I were you!
That's suicide, pal!
Crap, not again.
I didn't see that one coming.
- That was both our faults, really.
- What are you doing here?
Didn't think I was going to let my boy do this alone, did you?
- I feel safer. Thank you.
- Does she have a sister?
- She's married.
- Dammit.
Come on. Get in.
You're buying me a new windshield.
- Don't kick my car. I'll hit you again!
- I'm OK, by the way.
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
- Good. I don't care.
And I guess there's one more.
Looking for something?
I need that.
Oopsie-daisy, where'd it go?
Oh, there they are.
Now, there's two.
- Back to one.
- Give it to me!
So, I guess it's over now, huh?
- Is that really what you want?
- It doesn't matter what I want.
You've got your will back.
Ever since I saw you in that fountain something...
...something changed in me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I can't do anything without thinking about you.
I don't know what is going on with me, but I want to know what is going on with you.
You seem to think that all these guys are under some crazy spell, and that I'm one of them, but I'm not.
This is real, OK?
And I ran all the way up Fifth Avenue in a lightning storm
- because I wanted to tell you...
- You love me?
- I never said I loved you.
- You didn't. No, you don't.
I just never said it. You said it, and I wanted to say it, but...
OK, you go. You say it.
Well, say it if you want to say it.
Look...
The only spell that I'm under...
...is yours.
I'm in love with you, Beth.
- Oh. Did she invite you, too?
- Yeah. Tony.
- Gale.
- Yeah.
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah. You, too.
You look great.
That's a nice cut.
You look terrific.
Beautiful silhouette.
I saw you out there.
- You can hold a suit. Yeah.
- Thank you.
- You're an artist.
- Yeah. Sort of.
I would love to do a nude with you.
I'd like that.
Great.
I'd really like that.
I am really sorry about this,
Beth. This is all my fault.
I found that in my bag of tricks.
- It's not mine, so...
- Oh, my God. It's Nick's.
I guess I accidentally gave you the wrong chip in the museum.
He's still under the spell.
- OK, thank you. Time to go.
- Are you her sister?
- Would you like to see an illusion?
- Bye-bye.
Don't you want to be dazzled?
- Oh, my God, Beth. I'm so sorry.
- What am I going to do?
Showtime.
Dad.
When you married Mom, did you ever think that you wouldn't make it?
Elizabeth Ann.
Honey, you cannot learn from my mistakes.
You're going to have to go out there and make your own.
Now, you could get your heart broken or you could have the greatest love affair the world has ever known, but you're not going to know unless you try.
But what if there was a guarantee that you'd never get hurt.
Baby... the passion is in the risk.
It's like I always say,
"If you're going to be a bear..."
- "Be a grizzly."
- That's my girl.
A marriage is like all contracts that the two enter under the eyes of Our Father Almighty.
If there's anybody here who has reasons that Beth...
...and Nicholas should not get married today, speak now or forever hold on to your peaces.
Anybody?
Anybody?
Anybody?
It could be anybody. You don't have to know them to speak up.
OK, padre, it seems nobody's objecting, so let's move on with it.
Do you, Nicholas, take Beth to be your awful wedded wife?
"Lawful." Yes. Yes, I do.
What is with him?
And do you, Beth, take Nicholas to be your awful wedded husband?
To love, amore, to honor
until morte, death, do you part?
Think, bella.
It's a very big responsibility, no?
No.
I can't do this to you, Nick. I'm sorry.
You think you're pretty funny, don't you?
Did you enjoy watching me go crazy?
Did you have fun watching my life turn upside down because of love?
Because I did.
Beth!
Beth!
I've got a question.
Why do you keep giving me my poker chips?
Because you deserve to have it back.
You threw it in the fountain and wished for love, and I don't want to keep it anymore.
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?
- No.
- Then who did?
I have no idea.
Then this is all real?
How's this for real?
Free of temptation!
Didn't you say at Umberto's bachelor party...
The padre cleaned me out at the poker table. Yeah.
Are you sure you're eighteen?
- Why? Do I look older?
Alberta Scrubb?
- It's a typographical error
- It is suppose to be Albert A. Scrubb.
- Edmund, you are suppose to be helping me with the groceries.
Better luck next time, ay, squirt?
Squirt? He barely had 2 years on me!
I am a king. I've fought wars and I've led armies.
Not in this world.
- Yeah, instead i'm stuck here.
Doing battles with useless Clarence Scrubb.
If anyone so deserve the name.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Come on then.
Dear Diary.
It is now day 253. since my ratchet cousins
Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.
Not sure how much long i can cope living with them.
Hard to share my things.
If only one could treat relatives like one who treat insects, all my problems would be solved.
I could simply put them in a jar.
Pin them to my wall?
- I'm home!
- Hello?
- Note to self.
Investigate legal ramifications of impaling relatives.
And that concludes the war news from the western front.
- Hi, Uncle Harold.
I've tried to find some carrots but all they had were turnips again.
Should I start making soup?
And Alberta is on her way home.
Uncle Harold?
- Father.
Edward making faces at you.
Why, you little...
- Father, he's going to hit me.
Edmund look, it's from Susan.
I do wish you were here with us.
It is such an adventure.
But nothing like our times in Narnia.
America is very exciting.
Only we never see father.
He works so very hard.
I was invited to the British consul's tea party this week by a naval officer.
Who happens to be very handsome.
I think he fancies me.
It seems that the Germans have made the crossing difficult right now.
Time are hard. Mother hopes you both won't mind another few months in Cambridge.
Another few months?
How will we survive?
You're lucky. At least you've got your own room.
I'm stuck with mullet mouth.
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.
Off on adventures.
- Yeah. They are the olders we are the youngest.
We don't matter as much.
Do you think i look anything like Susan?
Lucy, have you seen this ship before?
- Yes, it's very Narnian looking isn't it?
Yeah. Just another reminder that we're here not there.
There once was two orphans who wasted their time. believing in Narnian nursery rhyme.
Please let me hit him!
- No.
Don't you ever knock?
- It's my house.
I do as I please. You're just guests.
What's so fascinating about that picture anyway?
It's hideous.
You won't see it from the outside of the door.
Edmund look, looks like the water is actually moving.
What rubbish, see? That's what happens when you read all those fancy little novels and fairy tales of yours.
There once was a boy called Eustace, who read books for facts which were worthless.
People who read fairy tales are always a sort of becoming a hideous burden compared to people like me.
I read books with real information.
- A hideous burden?
I haven't seen you lift a finger since we've been here.
I hope you won't mind I tell your father it was you who stole Aunt Alberta sweets?
- Liar?
- Really?
- Edmund, the painting!
- I found them under your bed.
And you know what? I've licked every one of them!
Ew! I'm infected with you!
What is going on here?
- Lucy, do you think...
This is some kind of a trick. Stop or I'll tell mother.
Mother!
I'll just smash the whole thing.
Do something!
- No.
Help me.
- Let me go.
Let go.
Eustace, swim!
- What's going on?
Swimming!
Swim.
It's alright! I got you.
Caspian?
- Lucy.
Edmund, it is Caspian.
- You're safe now.
Are we in Narnia?
- Yes, you are in Narnia.
I don't wanna go. I want to go back to England!
I'm going back to England!
Hold on.
That was thrilling!
How in the world do you end up here?
- I have no idea.
- Caspian!
- Edmund.
It's great to see you.
- Didn't you call for us?
No, not this time.
Well, whatever the case, i'm just glad to be here.
Ahh! Get that thing off me!
Reepicheep!
Your Majesty.
- Hello, Reep.
What a pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine sir.
But first, what to do about this, this hysterical interloper?
That giant rat thing just tried to claw my face off!
I was merely trying to expel the water from your lungs sir.
He talks! Does anyone understand? He just talk!
- He always talks.
Actually its getting him to shut up that's the trick.
The moment there is nothing to be said your highness,
I promise you I will not say it.
I don't know what kind of prank this is.
I wanna wake up right now!
Perhaps we can throw him back?
And being abducted by a kind of zeepiratencarnival.
I demand to know just where in the blazes am I?
You're on the Dawn Treader.
The finest ship in Narnia's navy.
Was it something I said?
See to him for me.
- Your majesty.
Men.
Behold our castaways.
Edmund the Just and Lucy the Valiant.
High King and Queen of Narnia.
Aslan.
Look! Susan's bow and arrows.
- Lucy
- My Healing Cordial and dagger. oh, May I?
- Of course. They are yours.
Peter's sword.
- Yes.
I looked after as promised.
Here.
Hold it if you wish.
No, it's yours.
Peter has given it to you.
I did saved this for you though.
Thanks.
Since you've left, the Giants in the North had surrendered unconditionally.
And we defeated the Calormen army of the great desert.
There is peace across all of Narnia.
- Peace?
For three years.
And have you found yourself a queen in those three years?
No. Not one to compare to your sister.
Hang on, so there are no wars to fight and no one is in trouble...
Then, why are we here?
- That's a good question.
I have been asking myself the same thing.
So, where are we sailing?
- To get back the throne from my uncle.
He tried to kill my father's closest friends and most loyal supporters.
The seven Lords of Telmar.
They fled to the Lone Islands.
No one has heard from them since.
So you think something has happened to them?
- Well, if it has...
It is my duty to find out.
What lies east of the Lone Islands?
Uncharted waters. Things that you can barely imagine.
Tales of sea serpents and worse.
Sea serpents?
- Alright captain, enough of your tall tales.
Where skies i want to be, where the waves are sweet.
Descends upon you, Reepicheep.
That's pretty!
- oh! Thank you.
A "driad" sung to me when i was just a "materling".
I can't divine the meaning but i never forgotten the words.
What do you think past Lone islands is?
I've been told the furthest east one can sail is to the end of the world.
Aslan's country.
- Do you really believe there is such a place?
We have nothing if we do not believe.
Do you think you can actually sail there?
Well, there is only one way of finding that out.
Only hope one day I'd earn the right to see it.
Your majesty.
You have grown stronger, my friend.
Seems I have.
Alright! Back to work.
Edmund, Do you think if we keep sailing to the end of the world, we just... tip off the edge?
Don't worry, Lu.
We're long way from there.
I see you're still talking nonsense.
Are you feeling better?
- Yes, but not thanks to you.
It's like I have an iron constitution.
- You're ever "vesitence" ever I see. (?)
Found your sea legs?
- Never lost them.
It's just given a shock of things. (?)
Obviously have the cutest position, (?) due to my intelligence.
I don't think he has "apute" anything (?)
I'll have you know as soon as
I find civilization.
I'm contacting the British Consulate.
Having you arrested for kidnapping.
Kidnapping is it? That's funny.
I thought we had saved your life.
You held me here against my own will!
- Did I?
(???) in that quarters
It's like a zoo down there!
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?
- He is just warming up.
Landfall.
The Lone Islands.
Narrow Haven's portal.
Strange. No Narnia flag in sight.
The Lone Islands always been of Narnia's.
Seems suspicious.
I say we prepare a party
Drinian?
- Forgive me, Your Majesty...
But the chain of command starts with Prince Caspian on this ship
Right
- We use rowboats. Drinian, pick some men and come on shore.
Men the row boats! Throw the sailer and prepare to go out. and get ready to lower the anchor.
En route! (??) lies ahead.
Can't we just wait till the morning?
There is no honor in turning away from adventure land.
Listen!
Where is everyone?
Come on, jelly legs.
- I'm capable of getting out myself!
And you're certain you're related by blood?
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men and secure the place.
We will head up.
If we don't come back by dawn, send the party.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Yeah, looks like nobody is in.
So do you think we should go back?
Do you want to come here and guard...something?
Ah, yes.
Good idea, cousin.
Very..um, logical.
I've got it.
Don't worry.
I'm ready to go when you are!
Who are all these people?
- Why are they've been crossed out?
Looks like some kind of fee..?
- Slave Traders.
Look out.
Unless you want to hear this scum squeal like a girl again,
I would say, you should drop your weapons.
I'm not a girl.
- Now!
Put it down!
- Useless..
Put them in irons.
- Come here you!
Get your hands off me. Let go!
Take these two to the market.
Send those other two to the dungeons.
Listen to me, you insolent fool.
I am your king!
You're gonna pay for that!
- Actually... someone else is going to pay.
For all of you.
You all right?
- Yeah.
It is hopeless.
You'll never get out.
Who's there?
- Nobody.
Just a voice in my head.
Lord Bern?
That was me once.
I do not deserve that title anymore.
Is he one of the seven?
Your face. You remind me of a king that I once know.
That man was my father.
My Lord, please forgive me.
No, please.
No!
- Mommy!
Get back.
Stay with daddy.
- Don't worry. I will find you!
Mommy!
Where are they taking them?
- Keep watching.
What happened?
- It's a sacrifice.
Where did they go?
- No one knows.
The mist was first seen in the east.
Reports of fishermen and sailors disappearing out at sea.
We lords have made a pact... to find the source of the mist and to destroy them.
They each set sail,
But none of them came back.
You see, If they don't sell you to the slave traders
You're likely to be fed to the mist
- We have to find Lucy.
Before it's too late.
- I offer 60.
I bid 80!
- 100 for the little lady.
Anymore bids?
SOLD!
Come on, move!
And now, for this fine speciment!
Who'd kick off the bidding?
Come on now, he may not seem like much, but uh..he is strong.
Yes, he's strong alright. Smells like the rear end of a Minotaur.
That is an outrageous lie.
I won the school hygeine award, two years running!
Come on, someone make your bid!
- I'll take them off your hands.
I'll take them all out of your hands.
For Narnia!
Thanks, Reep. I knew you would come.
- Your Highness.
Grab the keys.
Keys! oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?
I hope that wasn't British consul.
Your majesty!
- Wait.
My wife was taken just this morning.
- Daddy!
I beg you, take me with you.
I want to come.
- No, Gael. Stay with your aunt.
I am a fight sailor, been on the seas my whole life.
Of course, you must.
- Thank you.
But Daddy!
- If I ever not come back...
Now be good.
My king!
This was given to me by your father.
I hid it safely in the cave.
All these years.
- I thought that is Narnian sword?
It's from your Golden Age.
There are seven of those swords.
Gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.
Your father entrusted them to us.
Here. Take it.
And it may protect you.
Thank you, my Lord.
And we shall find your lost sisters(?).
Edmund.
Dear diary.
There has been extraordinary turn of event.
I have been abducted by my cousins and set to drift in uncharted waters.
In some ridiculously looking boat.
What's worse, as I share quarters with obnoxious mouse thing,
My thought banking with my cousins was bad enough.
So far, every person I met in this strange place suffers from the most florit delusions
Chasing for green mists and looking for lost lords.
I can only assume this is the result of poor diet.
Everyone are barking mad.
Cousin Edmund is no exception.
He spends every spare second rubbing that thin sword.
Like it's some magic lantern.
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.
It is going to be magnificient.
Do they come in a smaller size?
Peeving Marmud (?)
He's more delusional than my cousin.
In England we have mousetraps and that sort of things.
Speaking of food, do you think I can get any do you?
Uh, why you talking to that bird?
I just naturally assumed that...
- (Laughs) He's talking to birds.
He is as mad as a looner that one.
Shoo! Go go.
Are you aware sir...
Stealing rations is a capital offense?
Up here.
You.
- Men have been killed for less.
For What?
- Treason and sneakiness...and general nuisances.
Just hand over the orange and we'll let the matter pass.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Allow me to...
I've had quite enough of you.
- Unhand the tail.
The Great Aslan himself gave me this tail.
No one. Repeat. No one touches the tail.
Period. Exclamation mark!
- Sorry.
Now. I will have the orange, then I will have satisfaction.
Puh, puh, please, please, please, um. I'm a pacifist.
Watch it.
- Sorry.
Are you trying to run away?
We're on a boat you know.
Can't we just discuss this?
That is for stealing, that is for lying, and that was for good measure.
(Laughs) That's the spirit! We have ourselves a duel! Catch.
Now, come on.
Take your best shot.
Is that it?
Come on, boy.
Stop flapping your wings like a drunken pelican.
Hoist!
Keep your leg up.
Yoo-hoo! Over here.
On your foot.
On your left, your right.
Got it? Come on.
The Nimble. It is a dance, boy.
Come on now. And again.
Oh, no.
And that!
Look.
Gael, what are you doing here?
It seems that we have an extra crew member.
Welcome aboard.
- Your majesty.
Call me Lucy.
Come on.
Come on, look lovely, back to work!
Good match!
I will make a swordsman of you yet.
Yes, well...it's the plane we look more even it would be an entirely different result.
(Laughs) Indeed.
It looks like uninhabited.
If the Lords follow the mist to the east, they would have stopped here.
It could be a trap.
Or it can held some answers.
- Caspian?
We spend the night on shore.
Scout the island everyone.
Ay, Your Majesty.
Seems they have brought a pig.
This one. It's female.
So is this one.
This one reads.
Let's take her.
There is no escape!
- We are scary.
What are you?
- We are terrifying invisible beasts.
If you could see us, you would be really intimidated.
You forgot to mention that we all are very large.
What do you want?
- You'll do what we ask.
She will!
- Very clear. Well put!
Or what?
- Or death.
Death.
Well, I won't be much use to you when
I'm dead now, would I?
I haven't thought of that.
- No, you hadn't. Fair point.
Alright. Then we'll just kill your friends!
Good idea.
- What do you want with me?
You'll enter the house of the Opressor.
What house?
- This one.
Upstairs, you'll find the book of incantation recite the spell that makes the unseen, seen.
Well put chief, well put.
- Very. Yeah.
Well, go on.
We haven't got all day.
Remember what will happen to your friends
You've been warned.
- Yeah.
Right.
Why don't you do it yourself?
- We can't read.
Can't write for the matter of fact.
All that.
- Yeah.
Why didn't you just say so?
Beware of the opressor.
- He is very aggressive!
What makes the unseen, seen.
Got it? Don't forget that!
Ed, wake up.
Wake up!
Look.
Where's Lucy?
Lucy!
Everybody up!
- Get up.
This way.
- Move!
The Book of Incantation
MAXIM TO HEAL Pain
A MAXIM TO FORGET
With these words, Your tongue must sew.
For all around there to be snow.
An infallible spell to make you she, the beauty you've always wanted to be.
Susan, what's going on?
I'm beautiful.
No! wait.
Make me she, whom i'd agree.
Aslan?
A spell to make the unseen, seen.
If the 'p' in psychology, the 'h' in psychiatry... invisible ink and the truth in theology.
Caspian, Lucy's dagger.
Stop right there or there is!
The spell is complete.
Now all is visible.
What sort of creatures are you?
- Great ones.
With the head of a tiger and the body of um-different tiger.
You don't want to mess with us!
- Or what?
Or I'll claw you to death!
I'll run my touch right through you!
I will crush you with my teeth.
- And i'll bite you with my fangs.
You mean squash us with your fat bellies?
Fatty bellies?
- Or tickle us with your toes?
What have you done with my sister, you little pip squid?
Now, calm down.
- Where is she?
Can I tell him?
- Tell him, chief.
In the mansion.
- What mansion?
Oh. That mansion.
Now, I'm getting tired of you leaving me behind.
The thing came back.
This place is weirder and weirder.
He's calling us weird.
- Lucy! Your majesty.
- Caspian and Edmund.
This is Coriakin.
It's his island.
That's what he thinks.
You have wronged us, magician.
I have not wronged you, I've made you invisible for your own protection.
Protection?
- That's aggressive! Opressor!
I have not opressed you.
- But you could have!
If you wanted to!
- Be gone.
What was that?
- Loot(?). But don't tell them.
What were those things?
- Dufflepuds.
Of course.
Silly me.
What did you mean when you said you made them invisible for their own good?
It seems to be the easiest way to protect them.
From the evil.
- You mean the mist?
I mean what lies behind the mist.
It's quite beautiful.
I mean for a made belived that and a made believed world.
There is the source of your problems.
The Dark Island.
A place where evil lurks.
It can take any form. It can make your darkest dream come true.
It seeks to corrupt all goodness
Steal the lights from this world.
How do we stop it?
- You must break its spell.
That sword you carry, there are six others.
Have you seen them?
- Yes.
The six lords, they passed through here?
- Indeed.
Where are they heading?
- Where I've sent them.
Break the spell.
You must follow the Blue Star... to Ramandu's Island.
There the seven swords must be laid at Aslan's table.
Only then can the truly magical power be released.
But beware. You will all about to be tested.
Tested?
It will do everything in it's power to tempt you.
Be strong...
Don't fall to temptations.
To defeat the darkness out there you must defeat the darkness inside yourself.
For reasons beyond my comprehension
We have taken the advice from the senile old coup(?). who doesn't possess a razor, and walks around on a dressing gown.
So we're back in the bathtub and and lost in the tempest. Brilliant!
14 days of being tossed like a pancake, not the slightest sight of land.
The only consolation is that everyone is finally as miserable as I am.
Except for that show-off talking rat.
He is one of the annoying glass is always half full part.
So, we're stuck here... with half rations, we have food and water for two more weeks maximum.
This is your last chance to turn back, your majesty.
Not in this storm.
Needle in a haystack trying to find this remoteless place.
We can sail way past and knocked to the end of world.
We can be eaten by a sea serpent.
You'll see when the men are getting nervous.
These are strange seas we are sailing the lights that which i've never seen before.
Then perhaps captain, you'd love to be the one to explain to Mr. Rince that we're abandoning the search for his families?
I'll get back to it.
Just a word of warning, the seas can play nasty tricks on a crew mind.
Very nasty.
Transform my reflection, cast into affection lashes, lips and complexion.
Let me like whom I agree, cause more beauty over me.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ms. Pevensie.
Edmund?
- You look beautiful, Sister.
As always.
- Peter!
Excuse me Miss,
Can I get a photo?
Mother's gonne love this, all her children in one picture.
Smile!
- Hang on. Where am I?
I mean where's Lucy?
- Lucy, who's Lucy?
Susan, what's wrong?
Come on now Miss.
A nice big smile!
Edmund, I'm not sure about this. I think
I want to go back.
Go back where?
- To Narnia!
What is Narnia?
- What's going on?
Stop this!
Lucy.
- Aslan?
What have you done, child?
I don't know, but that was awful.
But you chose it, Lucy.
I didn't mean to choose all that. I just wanted to be as beautiful like Susan.
That's all.
You wished yourself away, and with it, much more.
Your brothers and sisters wouldn't know Narnia without you, Lucy.
You discovered it first, remember?
I'm so sorry.
You doubt your value, don't run from who you are.
Aslan!
Father.
Edmund.
Come with me.
Join me.
Edmund?
Lucy.
I can't sleep.
- Let me guess. Bad dream?
So either we're all going mad, or something is playing with our minds.
I doubt the Lord stopped here, there is no sign of anything living.
Right. Well, once you have got on shore, take your men for food and water.
The three of us will look for clues.
- You mean the four of us?
Come on, please don't send me back to the rat.
- I heard that!
Big ears.
- I heard that too.
Look. We not the first on the island.
The Lords?
- Could be.
What do you think could be down there?
Let's find out.
What is that?
- I don't know. Looks like some kind of a gold statue.
He must have fallen in.
Poor man.
- You mean, poor Lord.
The crust of Lord rest in him.
- And his sword.
We need it.
Be careful.
Your sword hasn't turn to gold.
- Both swords are magical.
He mustn't have known what hit him.
Maybe, or maybe
He was onto something.
What are you talking about?
What are you staring at?
Whoever has access to this pool, could be the most powerful person in the world.
Lucy, we'll be so rich no one can tell us what to do, or who to live with.
You can't take anything out of Narnia, Edmund.
Says who?
- I do.
I am not your subject.
You have been waiting for this, haven't you?
To challenge me. You doubt my leadership!
You doubt yourself.
You're a child.
- And you're a spineless sap.
Edmund?
- I'm tired of playing second fiddle...
First it was Peter, and now it's you.
You know I am braver than both of you.
Why did you Peter's sword?
I deserve a kingdom of my own!
I deserve to rule!
- If you think you're so brave... prove it!
No!
Stop it!
Both of you.
Look at yourself.
Can't you see what's happenning?
This place has tempted you.
It is bewitching you,
This is exactly what Coriakin is talking about.
Let's just get outta here.
Oh yes, follow the imaginary blue star, to the island of Rabandoedoe...
Like the seven steak knives on the table of a talking lion.
Nonsense.
What is that?
I must be dead.
You are definitely dead.
You wouldn't be needing that one wont you.
Finally, a favorable turn of events.
What foods did you found?
It is volcanic, My majesty.
Nothing grows.
Where is Eustace?
I believe he's out not helping us loading the boats.
Eustace!
I have got a bad feeling.
I'm going to find him.
I'll come with you.
Eustace?
Treasure.
Trouble.
Eustace's.
No.
I'm sorry.
- He was just a boy.
I shouldn't have left him.
What could have happened to him?
In this place? Anything.
And he wasn't the first.
It's Lord Octesian.
We should find this... sword.
What was that?
Is it the volcano?
Oh no, that's not a volcano.
All hands on deck.
Archers, arm yourselves!
Take your positions and wait for my command.
What is it doing?
- Fire!
He will break the mast.
Hold your positions.
Fire!
Edmund!
Edmund!
- Lucy.
I AM Eustace
You've got to be joking!
He must have been tempted by the treasure.
Everyone knows that the dragon's treasure is enchanted.
Apart anyone from here.
Is there any way to change him back?
- Not that I know of.
Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.
Sorry about the hand, oh boy.
I can be a little over zealous sometimes.
The boats are ready, sire.
- We can not leave him.
Well, we can't bring him on board, Your Majesty.
You and others take one boat back.
The rest of us stay here until morning. and work out what to do.
- But you have no provisions.
And no means of staying warm, My Majesty
And you were saying?
I've never seen these constellation before.
Me neither.
We are long way from home.
When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing to the end of the world.
To find my father there.
Maybe you are.
I miss my mommy.
I miss mine too.
Don't worry, you'll see her again.
How do you know?
- You just have to have faith about these things.
Aslan will help us.
But Aslan could have stop her from being taken.
We'll find her, I promise.
Somehow.
Trouble sleeping?
Now now, all is not lost as it seems.
I'll stay up with you if you wish.
To keep you company.
You didn't even believe in dragons this morning.
You know, extraordinary things only happen to extraordinary people.
Maybe it's a sign!
That you've got an extraordinary destiny
Something greater than you could have imagine.
I can tell you one or two of my adventures if you like, just past the time.
Believe it or not, you are not the first dragon I've encountered.
Many years ago, too many that I care to imagine.
I was with a band of pirates and I met another dragon.
Much fierce than you.
Lucy, wake up.
Look.
The Blue Star.
Everybody up.
- What?
It is the blue star.
- Wake up.
Pull.
Put your strokes in there, lads!
Pull!
The wind has left.
So how do we get to Ramandu Island now then?
My guess is something doesn't want us to get there.
Pull.
If I'm getting hungrier,
I'm gonna eat that dragon!
Don't worry, Eustace, they will to deal with me first.
If we don't get to landfall by tonight, they might as well eat them...
What are we hitting?
Eustace, that's brilliant!
En route!
We can't be sure that the other Lords even made it to Ramandu's Island.
You got us there! What did I tell you?
Eustace, you're extraordinary!
Wait.
Lord Revilian.
Lord Mavramorn.
Lord Argoz.
He's breathing!
So are they.
They're under the spell.
It's the food!
Hey, it's the stone knife.
This is Aslan's table!
The swords.
Let me take it.
That's six.
We're missing one.
Look!
Travellers of Narnia
Welcome.
Arise!
Do you look hungry?
- Who are you?
I am Lilliandil.
Daughter of Ramandu.
I am your guide.
You're a star.
You're most beautiful.
If it is a distraction for you, I can change forms.
- No.
Please.
The food is for you.
There is enough for everyone that welcome to Aslan's table.
Always. Help yourselves.
Wait.
What happened to them?
These poor men were half mad by the time they reached our shores.
They threatened each other with violence.
Violence is forbidden at the table of Aslan.
So they were sent to sleep.
- Will they ever awake?
When all is put right.
Come. There is little time.
The Magician Coriakin told you of Dark Island?
Yes.
For long the evil will be unstoppable.
Coriakin said, to break the spell, we need the seventh sword on the Aslan's table.
He speaks the truth.
- But we found only six.
Do you know where the seventh is?
In there.
You will need great courage.
Now, don't waste your time.
How we meet again?
Goodbye.
So what do you think it's in there?
Our worst nightmares.
Our darkest wishes.
Pure evil.
Tavros, unlock the armory
Archers, prepare yourselves.
Dock the lanterns.
Let's get ready.
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.
When you grow up, you should be just like you.
If case we don't get through, whatever this is...
I want you to know I think of you as my brother.
Me too.
You gave up your sword.
It was not mine to keep.
Use this.
But it is...
- Peter would like you to have it.
Here it is, my friend.
The battle awaits.
Eustace, no. Wait.
Stop.
I will not accept surrender.
A true warrior does not flight out of fear.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
I'm a mouse.
You a dragon.
You have a skin of leather.
You breathe fire.
Come on, let's meet our destiny.
No matter what happens here. every soul standing before me, has earned a place on the Dawn Treader.
Together we traveled far.
Together, we have faced diversity.
Together... we can do it again.
So now is not the time to fall in fears and temptations. Be strong!
Never give in.
Our world, our Narnian lives depend on it.
Think of the lost souls we are here to save.
Think of Aslan.
Think of Narnia.
- For Narnia!
For Narnia!
Helene?
We can't see a thing.
The fog is too thick.
You're a great disappointment to me.
You call yourself my son?
And act like a king.
Edmund.
Come with me.
Be my king.
I let you rule.
- Go away.
You're dead.
- You can never kill me.
I will always be alive in your mind, silly boy.
No!
- Edmund?
Are you alright?
Keep away!
Keep away!
- Who's there?
Will we not fear you!
- Not, are you?
Keep away!
- We do not leave.
You will not defeat me.
Caspian, the sword!
Lord Rhoop.
You cannot own me!
- Stand down.
Let's get him onboard, quickly!
Be calm my Lord.
- Off me, demons!
We're not here to hurt you.
I am your king.
Caspian.
My Lord.
You should not have come.
There is no way out of here.
Quickly turn this ship about before it is too late.
We have the sword.
Let's go!
Let's turn this ship around.
Do not think.
Do not let it know your fears, or it will become them!
Oh no.
- Edmund.
What did you just think of?
- I'm sorry.
What is that?
It's too late!
Get on the boat
Come, walk.
Don't let me down.
No fear. No retreats.
For Narnia! Take that.
And that.
Eustace, hang on!
I'll kill it.
- No, the sword!
Eustace!
Come back.
- We are doomed. Doomed!
Turn this ship about.
- Stop him.
Rowers.
To your rowing position.
Forward at double speed.
- Aslan, please help us.
Pull.
Pull!
Where are you?
You must stay here until someone comes and get you!
Ed! We run the serpent, smash him on the rocks.
Stay on the port, I will keep it on the ground.
Look out!
Pull!
Try to kill me, come on!
Come on here.
No!
- Edmund.
I'm still here.
Brace yourselves!
Move!
We can beat this.
We must get closer.
- Everybody to the main deck.
Get ready.
I want everyone here.
Ready... now!
Put his head down!
Heave!
What are you trying to prove, Edmund?
That you are a man?
Do it!
I can make you that.
I can make you my king.
Just take my hand.
Just give it here.
Do it!
Come on!
No!
The spell, it has lifted.
Edmund, Caspian, Look!
Narnians!
Mommy!
- Helene.
Mommy.
Let's have them onboard, clear the decks.
We did it, i knew we would.
It wasn't just us.
- You mean?
I'm here, Lucy.
Here, Lucy.
I'm in the water.
I am a boy again.
A boy!
Eustace! I see your wings have been clipped.
Where sky and water meet.
Where the waves grow ever sweet.
It's sweet!
Look.
Aslan's country.
We must have be close.
Well, we've come so far.
So what was it like?
When Aslan changed you back?
No matter how hard i tried,
I just couldn't do it myself.
Then he came towards me.
It was sort of hurt, but...
It was good pay.
Like when you pull a sword from your foot.
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.
I mean I was a better dragon than a boy, really.
I'm so sorry for being such a sob(?).
It's okay Eustace.
You were a pretty good dragon.
My friends, we've arrived
Aslan.
Welcome, children.
You have done well.
Very well indeed.
You have come far.
Now your journey is at it's end.
Is this your country?
- No, my country lies beyond.
Is my father in your country?
- You can only find that out on yourself, my son.
But you should know that if you continue, there is no return.
You not going?
Can't imagine my father would be very proud that I gave up what he died for.
I spent too long wanting what have been taken from me but not what was given.
I was given a kingdom.
People.
I promise to be a better king.
- You already are.
Children.
I think perhaps it's time we went home actually then?
I thought you loved it here?
- I do!
But I love home and our family as well!
They need us.
Your eminence, ever since i can remember, I've dreamt of seeing your country
I have had many great adventures in this world, but nothing has dampen that yearning.
I know I'm hardly worthy, but with your permission...
I'd lay down my sword for the joy of seeing your country.
With my own eyes.
My country was made for noble hearts such as yours.
No matter how small that can be.
Your majesty.
- Nobody deserves it more.
It's true.
May I?
- Well, I suppose...just this..
Goodbye, Lucy.
Don't cry.
I don't understand.
When will I see you again?
What a magnificent puzzle you are.
And a true hero.
It has been my honor to fight beside such a brave warrior.
And a great friend.
I won't be needing this.
This is our last time here, isn't it?
- Yes.
You have grown up, my dear one.
Just like Peter and Susan.
- Will you visit us in our world?
I shall be watching you always.
How?
- In your world...
I have another name.
You must learn to know me by it.
That was the very reason you were brought to Narnia.
That by knowing me here for a little,
You'll know me better there.
Will we meet again?
Yes, dear one. One day.
You are closest to me I have as family.
And that includes you, Eustace.
Thank you.
Will I come back?
Narnia may yet of need of you.
Eustace! What are you doing up there?
Jill drops in for a visit.
We spoke often of Narnia in the days that follow.
And when all my cousins have left.
After the war ended...
I missed them with all my heart.
As I know all Narnians will miss them
Till the end of time.
RED RIDING HOOD
Full moon. Lock up tonight.
Better the wolf takes the pig than you.
We lived on the edge of a dark forest.
Few knew our village by name...
...but many had heard of the terrible things that happened there.
My mother always told me,
"Don't talk to strangers.
Go get water and come straight home."
I tried to be a good girl and do what she said.
Valerie.
Believe me, I tried.
Let's go.
Shh.
Do you have the knife?
Right here.
Look, snow white fur.
I'll make you a pair of hunting boots.
Do it, Peter.
- You do it.
- No, you do it.
That's it.
I know good girls aren't supposed to hunt rabbits or go into the woods alone.
But since we were kids, he always had a way of making me wanna break the rules.
Peter!
Trees'll still be there after we eat.
- Give me that.
- What will you give me for it?
- They didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?
They've arranged for you to marry
Henry Lazar.
Well, my mother finally got what she wanted.
Money.
Henry gets what he's always wanted.
You.
So, what do we do now?
Do you want to marry him?
You know I don't.
Prove it.
- How?
- Run away with me.
Where would we go?
Anywhere you want.
The ocean.
The city.
The mountains.
You afraid?
- No.
- Oh, no?
Really?
You'd leave your home?
Your family?
Your whole life?
I would do anything to be with you.
I thought you'd say that.
- Oh, did you?
- Ha, ha.
Let's do something about it.
It'd be half a day's ride before anyone knows we're gone.
I'll race you.
The wolf.
This way! Over here!
It killed again.
But we've kept the peace.
Well, the wolf has broken it.
Who is it?
Tell me.
It's your sister.
Mother, Father.
Lucie!
Lucie!
Thank you, Claude.
- Madame Lazar, please come in.
- Suzette.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
Let me take that.
- Hello, Henry.
- Ladies.
Lucie was a good girl.
He's your fiancé now.
He's come to offer his condolences.
- But I barely know him.
- You'll get to know him.
Now go down there. Please.
Cesaire.
Come with us to the tavern.
Let the women grieve in their own way.
- I-- I-- I want to go.
- No.
I didn't love your father when we were first married.
I was in love with another man.
But I came to love your father.
And he gave me two beautiful daughters.
We should count our blessings.
Come on, Father.
It's been almost 20 years since the wolf has taken a human life.
Twenty years.
That's because we sacrifice our best livestock every full moon.
We kept our end of the bargain.
- So now we kill it.
- Yeah!
Let's kill that thing!
No.
I've summoned Father Solomon.
- Father Solomon?
- Ha-ha-ha.
He has destroyed werewolves and witches in cities throughout the kingdom.
He will rid us of this beast.
No.
He'll rob us of our vengeance.
I wonder why she was outside on a wolf night.
Maybe she snuck out to meet a boy.
My Lucie never even thought about boys.
She was certainly taken with my grandson.
She used to come by and follow him about like a puppy.
She found out that night that Henry was engaged to her sister.
She must have been heartbroken.
Maybe she chose to die rather than live without him.
How romantic.
Prudence!
It's unspeakable.
She never even told me.
Don't worry, dear.
Henry always had his eye on you.
You're the pretty one.
I'm paying my respects.
I know exactly why you're here.
I've already lost one daughter.
Valerie's all I have left.
You have nothing to offer her.
I have a trade. The same one as your husband.
I know what a woodcutter earns.
Henry's her only hope for a better life.
If you love her...
...you'll let her go.
We've all seen the bones on the trail to Mount Grimmoor.
That's where the wolf makes its lair.
We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.
It can't come out in daylight.
It can't step onto holy ground.
- And there's silver.
- That'll kill it.
Silver!
Maybe Father Auguste is right.
Maybe we should wait.
Coward.
Maybe, my son...
...you should find your courage.
You want to hunt the wolf?
Let's hunt it.
Let's kill it!
Let's kill the beast!
Let's kill it!
What's going on?
Come on, boys!
Are you with me?!
Let's go!
Be careful.
I lost my sister. I can't lose you too.
We can't do this anymore.
You have to go through with it.
You have to marry Henry.
But you know I don't want Henry.
Don't make this something it's not.
Look, we had our fun.
That's all it ever was.
I don't believe you.
I made something for you.
I was gonna wait until our wedding, but, uh....
Just in case.
You will be happy again.
I promise.
Come on, Henry.
We should wait.
- We should wait for Father Solomon.
- No!
He'll be here tomorrow!
- We're gonna kill the wolf.
- We can take care of this.
That's it? Nobody else?
Let's go! Go home to your mama's, then.
Adrian. Thank you for standing up for
Lucie. That was no small thing.
We'll be family soon.
You'd have done the same.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Don't worry.
The wolf doesn't want me. I'm all gristle.
I mean it, son.
I promise, Mama.
Grandmother.
Oh.
Darling. Darling.
Come.
Careful.
There are so many things she didn't tell me.
And I'm her sister. I should've known.
That was her choice.
We all have secrets.
Remember what my grandma used to say:
- "All sorrows are less with bread."
- "Less with bread."
Here. Try this.
How beautiful.
I was making it for your wedding.
I don't feel like it's my wedding.
I feel like...
...I'm being sold.
Right up there.
You better watch yourself.
There's a fork.
Let's split up.
Another fork.
We'll take the steep one.
No. We should stay together.
Good morning, dear.
Morning, Grandmother.
Grandmother told us that the wolf used to kill entire families...
...snatching children from their beds.
Those stories never seemed real to me.
Until now.
Ripped the thing out!
Claude.
To Adrian.
For his sacrifice.
To Adrian.
Poor Henry.
Henry.
Your father was a brave man.
You know,
I was close enough to smell it.
And I was afraid. And I hid from it.
I didn't do anything.
I should've saved him.
- Henry--
- Just leave!
I don't want you to see me like this.
It was Henry's father, wasn't it?
The man you loved?
Lucie was in love with him.
She was a year older than me.
She could've married him.
Why did you insist it was me?
I think you know the answer to that.
I want you to say it.
Lucie was Henry's half-sister.
Adrian was her father.
Does Papa know about Lucie?
No. And you have to promise me that you'll never tell.
Father Solomon.
He's here.
Claude.
Presenting His Eminence....
Father Solomon.
Papa.
Oh, please don't cry.
You see? You see all these children?
You see how scared they are?
There's a big, bad wolf.
Someone has to stop it.
Is that the beast that killed our mother?
It may very well be.
Go on. I'll join you soon.
No.
Go.
This is indeed an honor, Your Eminence.
Welcome. You've arrived just in time for our festival.
As you can see, the werewolf has been dealt with.
That is not a werewolf.
No disrespect...
...but we have been living with this beast for two generations.
We know what we're dealing with.
Well, no disrespect...
...but you have no idea what you are dealing with.
I was like you once.
My wife's name was Penelope.
She gave me two beautiful daughters.
We were a very happy family.
We lived in a village like this.
And like Daggerhorn...
...ours was plagued by a werewolf.
One full moon, my friends and I got drunk.
We decided to hunt it.
It never occurred to us that we might actually find it, but find it we did.
It ripped...
...my best friend in half.
Quickly.
And then it was on me.
I hacked and hacked at it with my axe.
Suddenly...
...it was gone.
I had cut off one of its front paws.
I thought it might make a clever souvenir, and so I took it home.
And there I found my wife...
...with a bloody rag wrapped around her wrist.
And when I opened my sack...
...the werewolf's paw...
...was gone.
This was in its place.
I told my girls the werewolf killed their mother.
But that was a lie.
I killed her.
When a werewolf dies, it returns to its human form.
That is just a common gray wolf.
Your werewolf...
...is still very much alive.
This is one of only three silver swords blessed by the Holy See.
May I touch?
No.
This is a very dangerous time.
You all know what the Blood Moon means.
They have no idea what it means.
The orrery.
The red planet converges with the moon once every 13 years.
This is the only time a new werewolf can be created.
During the week of the Blood Moon...
...the werewolf may pass his curse on with a single bite.
During a normal full moon, a wolf bite will kill you.
But during a Blood Moon...
...your very souls are in danger.
Until the Blood Moon wanes in three days...
...you will never truly be safe.
We're safe now.
I killed the wolf in its lair.
The cave at Mount Grimmoor.
You have been deceived by this beast from the start.
It made you think it lived on Grimmoor...
...so that you would not look for it in the most obvious place.
The wolf lives here.
In this village.
Among you.
The real killer could be your neighbor.
- What?
- Your best friend.
Even your wife.
- Barricade the village.
- You can't do that!
Post men at every gate!
No one leaves until we kill the wolf!
- As you wish.
- The wolf is dead.
Tonight we celebrate!
Yes!
Go ahead. Celebrate.
We'll see who is right.
The wolf is dead!
Take it off!
I'll huff, and I'll puff...
...and I'll blow your house down!
Laugh at the little man!
Valerie, come dance.
I'll huff...
...I'll puff...
...and I'll blow your house down.
Ow!
I'll just flick this off.
I'll be fit to see the pope.
Papa.
You're my good girl.
I'm so sorry.
I know. Just go home now, okay?
Tricked you. Ha-ha-ha.
Impressive.
Where did you learn that?
Claude.
Claude, come back to the party.
Looks like Rose has a new conquest.
Come on, Prudence.
You left us!
Take it easy, friend.
I said we should stick together and you left us, and my father is dead because of it!
Please don't do this.
Keep your hands off her or I'll cut them off!
Peter.
Leave me alone.
What's the matter with you?
What do I have to do to make you stop?
I love you, Peter.
What are you doing with Rose?
You don't even like her.
I don't have to like her to get what I want from her.
You're a terrible liar.
I know you feel like I do.
I know you're burning inside.
I'll never be able to give you anything like this.
Think I care about Henry's money?
You have a future with him.
I'm not gonna let you ruin that.
Did my mother get to you?
Valerie, I'm wrong for you.
I don't care.
I could eat you up.
Don't you want me?
Hey, Peter.
Come on, give us a hand.
The only life I want is with you.
So where did you disappear to?
You know all that soft hay in the granary?
- Run!
- Get to the church!
- Peter!
- Go!
Claude!
You will die now, beast!
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground!
Get to the church!
The church!
Claude!
Now! Rope it!
Hold him!
Claude!
- It's strong.
- God is stronger.
God is stronger!
I warned you!
I warned you!
Your werewolf is still alive!
Find it!
Find it!
Find it.
Over there!
You can't escape from me.
Oh, my God. You can speak.
How?
You understand me.
That's all that matters, Valerie.
You know my name.
What are you doing?
Human eyes, dark brown.
I know you well.
You dream of leaving this village.
Let me take you away.
You and I are the same.
No, I'm nothing like you.
You're a murderer.
You're a killer too, aren't you?
What happened to the rabbit, Valerie?
I killed it.
I know. So come with me.
No.
Then the streets will run red with blood. Starting with hers.
Come on!
Father Solomon will stop you.
Father Solomon will die like the rest.
I'm coming back for you before the Blood Moon wanes.
There! Fire!
You talked to the wolf.
No, it talked to us.
No, it growled.
Wait, you heard it talk to you?
They'll call me a witch.
Don't tell anyone.
No, of course not.
- Get inside onto holy ground.
- Wait, I have to find my brother.
- And my family.
- No one leaves until sunrise.
- Go.
- For your own safety.
We were wrong to have doubted you,
Father.
I've never seen a beast as strong as this.
A creature this powerful must come from a long uninterrupted bloodline.
Each generation more potent than the one before.
We must find it in its human form.
But how? It could be any of them.
It hasn't survived this long by being obvious. Look everywhere.
Look for the signs.
Isolation.
Witchcraft.
The black arts.
Abnormal behavior.
Strange smells.
Your homes will be searched.
Your secrets brought to light.
If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear.
But if you are guilty...
...I swear by Almighty God...
...you will be destroyed.
He's still alive!
Bring me water!
Hurry!
It's a Blood Moon. So he must--
He's my brother!
A man bitten...
...is a man cursed!
Valerie, open the door.
We're all in danger.
So we've gotta leave now.
Come away with me.
Come away with me.
Come away with me.
Get your things. We have to leave now.
I can't go with you, Peter.
Why not?
I'm sorry.
What happened?
She's going to be all right.
The wolf just scratched her.
That's not a bite.
Lift her head, Valerie.
Here. Drink this, dear.
It'll help you sleep.
You sleep.
What is it, darling?
What is it?
The wolf.
It talked to me.
And you understood it?
As clearly as I understand you.
Have you told anyone else about this?
Only Roxanne knows, but she won't tell anyone.
She won't even talk to me about it.
It chose not to kill you.
I think it wants me alive.
- No.
- Bring me another bandage.
No.
I have to get clean water.
Has Claude come home?
Nobody's seen him.
There you go, back inside. Now.
You have to let us in.
I saw you with Peter.
I know you don't want me like that.
I'm not gonna force you to marry me.
I'm gonna break off the engagement.
I'm sorry, Henry.
That's enough!
Father Solomon! We found someone hiding!
In the tower!
Quickly!
- It's my brother! Don't touch him!
- Get him down!
- Interrogate him!
- He's not the wolf!
Look at him!
His speech is twisted.
He communes with demons.
Get him down! Now!
He hasn't done anything!
This is proof that he studies the black arts!
He's a conjurer.
- I know him.
- Better than I knew my own wife?
You never know what someone is capable of.
Get him down! Come on!
Give me the name of the wolf.
Give me the name.
Tell me the name!
The Romans invented this.
An ingenious system for extracting the truth.
How can he give you a name?
The boy can barely speak.
Listen to how he sings of his love of Satan.
We do this for the greater good.
What's the good in this?
I killed my wife to protect my children.
Our methods of pleasing God are sometimes flawed.
You had best develop a stomach for it.
She says it's important.
I've come to bargain for the release of my brother.
Silver fingernails.
To kill a werewolf.
Get out.
Please, I have more than money to offer.
Turn around.
Enough. Move.
Wait, please. I have something else.
Spare my brother and I'll give you the name of a witch.
Now, that...
...is worth something.
Tell them what you told me.
She can climb the tallest trees.
She can run faster than all the girls.
She wears a red cloak.
The devil's color.
That's nonsense. I made that cloak.
Silence! Continue.
And she can talk to werewolves.
I've seen it. With my own eyes.
- Do you deny it?
- No, I don't deny it.
And what was the nature of this conversation?
It promised to leave Daggerhorn in peace as long as I go with it.
The wolf is someone in this village who wants you, Valerie.
Do you know who it is?
I'd think very hard if I were you.
Tell me.
Tell me who it is.
Give me a name.
It wants her, not you.
If you wish to save yourselves, simply give it what it wants.
You can't give her to the wolf.
That's human sacrifice.
We've all made sacrifices.
The trial is over.
Go back to your homes.
I said go home. All of you!
- I thought you cared about her.
- I do care.
I do care.
I'm trying to be smart about it.
Go to the granary.
You're gonna try and rescue her?
- Well, I'll help.
- I'm not that desperate.
Oh, really? Then what's your plan, huh?
See, you don't have one.
Look, you've seen those locks.
I've got a shop and I've got tools.
You need me.
Okay. Fine.
But if you're the wolf,
I'm gonna chop your head off.
I will do the same to you.
Fair enough.
Go home!
Where's my brother? Father Solomon told me you'd release him.
We did.
Grandma.
Bread. Blanket.
Do you need anything else?
I do not want you to use that knife.
- We have to find the wolf.
- By sundown?
Listen, the wolf wants you.
But first it killed your sister.
No. I didn't know it, but Lucie was in love with Henry.
And when she found out about my engagement...
...she gave herself to the wolf.
No. Lucie wouldn't do that.
- Your time is up.
- But she might have responded to Henry.
Please see that she gets that.
Oaf.
Cesaire.
I'm gonna save your daughter.
And then I intend to marry her.
I'd like your blessing in this, but I can live without it.
What can I do?
We're closed.
It's me.
Hello, Henry.
- I brought you some biscuits.
- Thanks.
I just wanna thank you for speaking up this morning.
Here, try some.
Yes.
That was very brave of you.
I said what I felt.
You know...
...I want you to know you're under no obligation to stand up for Valerie.
You're no longer engaged to her.
She's in love with someone else.
That doesn't mean
I've stopped caring about her.
I imagine that's just how
Lucie felt about you.
She had a crush on me.
Oh, more than a crush. I think she would have done absolutely anything for you.
Even agree to meet you on a wolf night if you asked her to.
Why are you doing this?
Do you think I'm the wolf?
Are you accusing me of murder?
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I just want to find out the truth.
It's you.
My God, it's you.
I can smell it on you.
Heh. What can you smell on me?
The night my father died, I could smell the wolf. It was like a deep musk.
And I can smell it all over you right now.
What do you do out there in that cabin all by yourself in the middle of the night?
On the night that Lucie died?
You don't know, do you?
I know what you're doing. And I'm not gonna let you turn this on me.
Oh.
You're coming with us.
- I haven't done anything.
- Just a precaution.
Father Solomon doesn't want any trouble from the witch's family.
It's time to put on your harlot's robe.
Valerie.
I did my best to protect you.
You and Lucie.
I know, Papa.
You taught us to be strong.
Father Solomon had designed the mask for public disgrace.
And even my friends stared, judging me.
Stop.
What if they were right?
Maybe the wolf knew something I didn't.
Maybe there was something dark inside of me.
You should all go home!
I'm so sorry, Valerie.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Bless you, my dear.
Prudence.
Valerie?
Roxanne wanted me to tell you how sorry she is.
- She said those things to save her brother.
- I know. Tell her that I forgive her.
Of course.
But I wanted to say....
I don't know what to say.
But you don't have to say anything.
But I want to.
I want you to know that...
...you may have fooled Roxanne...
...but you don't fool me.
Not anymore.
You were always too good.
Too pretty.
Too perfect.
You tricked us.
Now you're gonna get what you deserve.
Prudence, I think you should go.
Yes.
It won't be long now.
The wolf is coming.
The wolf lives here.
Your neighbor. Your best friend.
Even your wife.
You're the pretty one.
- I could eat you up.
- You will be happy again.
Human eyes, dark brown.
I know you well.
Do you know how you kill a tiger,
Father Auguste?
You tie out your best goat...
...and wait.
Fire!
- Put it out!
- Unh.
Go!
I'm gonna get you out of here.
It's too much!
Don't move.
There! He's taken the bait! Fire!
Wait, that's not the wolf!
He's aiding a witch!
- Fire!
- No!
Run!
Run.
This one started the fire.
Lock him up. In the elephant!
- Go!
- Move it!
The witch has escaped!
Get over here! Find the witch!
Come on, Peter's meeting us with the horses.
Valerie!
Valerie!
Where's Peter?
I don't know.
He said he'd be here.
If he doesn't show...
...I'm gonna take you away.
Let me take you away.
Do you think I'm the wolf?
Find the witch!
Come on! Quickly!
Go.
That way!
We should go to the church.
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground.
Some with me! This way! Let's go!
I heard something over there.
They're in here! After them!
Valerie.
Henry. Henry.
Go. Valerie, go!
No. I'm not leaving you.
- We claim sanctuary.
- You are not on holy ground yet.
- This...
- Unh.
...belongs to me.
You want her alive?!
Kill it!
Valerie.
Step across the gate, or I'll destroy this village.
Come with me before the sun rises.
Make your decision.
I won't let you destroy my home.
- I'll go with you.
- Don't! Valerie. No.
If you promise to leave them alone.
No. I won't let you sacrifice yourself for us.
- Nor will I.
- Nor will I.
I stand by Valerie.
You can't hide from me.
- Aah!
- The witch will still burn!
Under the Blood Moon...
...a man bitten is a man cursed.
My children will be orphaned.
My brother...
...had children too.
I meant only to serve.
To protect us from darkness.
Under the Blood Moon...
...a man bitten is a man cursed.
Where's Peter?
Where's Peter?
Grandmother.
What big eyes you have.
The better to see you with, my dear.
Grandmother, what big ears you have.
The better to hear you with, my dear.
What big teeth you have.
The better to eat you with, my dear.
Valerie. What are you doing out of bed?
I was so worried.
It looks much better.
Where are you going?
To Grandmother's.
I think she's in danger.
We're going after the wolf before the storm can cover its tracks.
It'll be human again and we can finally kill it.
And I have....
What? Tell me.
Peter is still missing.
I'll do what I have to do.
Please be careful.
Valerie.
Thank God you're all right.
Where were you?
I was trapped in that brazen beast all night.
I finally broke out.
Don't come near me.
Valerie, what?
You don't believe me?
I'll hurt you.
No, you won't.
Please don't.
Grandmother!
Grandmother, are you all right?
I had a nightmare.
- Ah!
- I'm fine.
I just woke up.
There's some soup if you're hungry.
I think the wolf is out there.
It's all right, darling.
We're safe in here.
Eat up. Remember:
- "All sorrows are less with bread."
- "Less with bread."
That's right.
Eat up, my dear.
What is this?
Father, what are you doing here?
Where's Grandmother?
I had no choice.
She finally realized what I am.
How could you do this?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Oh, Valerie.
I've been so disrespected.
I've settled for far less than I deserve.
So I decided I'd leave.
For the city.
For richer hunting grounds.
Why didn't you just leave?
Because I loved you girls.
I wanted you to come with me.
- But you had to wait for the Blood Moon.
- Yes.
By birthright...
...the gift would go first to my eldest daughter.
So I forged a letter.
But when I tried to speak to her--
Henry's not coming, Lucie.
--She didn't understand me.
Any offspring of mine with my wolf blood would've been able to do so.
And then it all made sense.
Lucie couldn't be my daughter.
Your mother lied to me.
But you knew that already, didn't you?
After all these years of being so clever and so careful, I just lost control.
I'm sorry for Lucie.
You took revenge on Mother.
And her lover.
Henry smelled the wolf that night.
And then again yesterday.
He thought the smell came from your grandmother.
But she had lived with that smell her whole life.
You see, my father was a wolf too.
The smell remained on his clothing.
Mother never knew what it meant...
...till the moment she died.
I loved her.
Her and Lucie both.
I never wanted to hurt them.
Valerie, come with me.
It's the last day of the Blood Moon.
One bite, and you'll be like me.
I won't do what you do.
I can't.
Yes, you can, Valerie.
My blood already courses through your veins.
It's a gift.
It's a gift my father gave to me that now I can give to you.
I'm stronger than he was, you'll be even stronger than me.
Think about it.
We will be invincible.
There must be a God, because you're the devil.
And you're the devil's daughter.
You're not so terrifying when the sun is up.
How would you know?
Papa!
I have something for you.
Peter.
Get me out of here.
Ow.
He bit me.
When the moon rises...
...I'll be like him.
A beast.
Everything I knew was ripped apart.
I saw it all differently.
All the lies. My mother's, my father's.
He was all I had left.
Peter.
Even when I doubted him...
...even when I wounded him...
...Peter was true.
I'm so sorry.
No one can know about your father.
They'll hang you...
...for being the daughter of the wolf.
Peter.
I have to leave.
You won't be safe with me...
...until I learn how to protect you from....
I'll wait for you.
I thought you'd say that.
It was the most brutal winter
I could remember.
With time, my mother finally realized that Father would never return.
Henry found his courage.
He chose a life of honor, protecting us from darkness.
Daggerhorn fell back into its old rhythms.
The wolf didn't come back.
But the village still lived in fear.
It was the only life they knew.
I could no longer live there.
I felt more freedom in the shadows of the forest.
To live apart carries its own dangers.
But of those...
...I am less afraid.
Valerie.

Ah, and one more thing.
If you come with that medal, the best table will be waiting along with all the champagne you can drink.

Oh! Paté! Hello!
I have a message from the Interior

He's not happy with all the destruction caused by your psychopathic chase in pursuit of your own ambitions.
But as everyone can plainly see,
I have risked my life.
Paté, I have slain the monster.
- Tell that to the Minister.
- With pleasure.
Victor Maynott, I am arresting you for the premeditated murder of Monsieur Francoeur.
What? Have you lost your mind?
The opposite.
I was so set on being a loyal officer,
I did not see the road you had taken us down.
I needed a flea to show me the way.
Are you mad?
It was just a miserable little flea!
You are so wrong, sir.
There was more humanity in that flea than in the louse I see before me now!
Take him away!

Somebody told me once...
that if you stand still in the forest long enough...
you'll see signs of a hidden struggle.
Raging between forces of life and decay.
That the survival of the forest itself depends on the outcome.
And that the good guys need all the help they can get.
And that if you don't believe it, take a close look.
And if you still don't, look closer.

Do you want to talk about it, if that's...
Thanks, but I've been reading up on the five stages of grief.

I'm good like that.
There actually are a few things
I would like to talk about.
Oh, oh, oh! Ozzy!
Look who's back!
Ozzy?
He's still alive?
Well, you know, most of him.
He may be down to three legs, but he'll make a break for it... the first chance he gets.
Ozzy, go say hi.
Here, boy!
Ah, there he goes.
His depth perception's a little off... and he has a tendency to run in circles.
Hey, but that was closer than usual, you know?
He remembers you!
So, I have a little surprise for you up here.
Just follow me, take a look.
Ozzy! No. No kisses.
Well, here we are.
Welcome home.
It's like I never left.
All your things are here, you got your dolls and... your pictures, your turtle.
Oh, dear.
Well, it's good to have you back, Mary Katherine.
Actually, I go by MK now.
Oh! MK.
I like that.
It's more grown-up.
Oh! Um... Hmm.
Do you have to get that?
Oh, no. No. That was just one of my sensors.
I got a lot going on right now.
Today is actually a highly unusual day.
There is both a full moon tonight and the summer solstice... which only coincide every hundred years or so.
You can imagine, it's just crazy over here.
Hey! Uh...
You probably want some time to settle in.
I'm just going to let you make yourself at home, Mary Kather...
Oh! No, who's Mary Katherine?
MK, I mean.
Okay, Mom, I'm trying.
That was the deal.
Oh, my.
Oh!
Come on, Mom, you're going to miss them.
Hey, Leafmen!
Huh? What?
Queen Tara, we need to discuss today's ceremony.
The Boggans have crossed our border again.
You're not getting enough sunshine.
Yes, it's Ronin.
Well, I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.
I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.
You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.
When we were kids he wasn't so serious.
Would you like to hear my plan?
And he had the sweetest smile.
Look, instead of a public ceremony,
I go in with a small platoon... pretend we're stopping for a drink.
We grab a pod, bring it back to you.
It blooms, the life of the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.
It doesn't work that way.
I can't choose unless I'm there.
It's about the feeling.
I get it from the pods...
I get it from the forest...
I get it from all of us.
There we are.
Don't you have feelings, Ronin?
Yes, I feel this is a bad idea.
The Boggans have never been this aggressive.
I'm not completely helpless, you know.
I am aware.
But you're the life of the forest.
Looking after you is my duty.
Is that the only reason you do it?
Isn't that reason enough?
If that's the only reason there is.
Your Majesty.
Yes?
I'm not ticklish.
Oh!
You used to be!
Very well. I understand your concern... but this is the one day in a hundred years I can choose an heir.
If I don't do this today... there won't be a future to protect.
I don't think I saw a salute, Boggan!
We had a little skirmish with some Leafmen this morning.
A rat got caught in the crossfire... so I got a new coat.
It's, uh, just like yours!
Did you find the location of their ceremony?
Uh...
Yes, sir!
It's way outside of our borders.
You mean their borders?
The Leafmen think they can keep us contained... surround our beautiful island of rot... with their hideous green forest.
So arrogant!
All in the name of balance.
I'm sick of balance.
No matter how much of the forest we destroy... the queen regrows it with one wave of her hand.
She needs to be cut down!
At the root!
Exactly.
Today we'll show them you just can't stop the rot.
If the queen dies without an heir... the Leafmen can't regrow anything.
The balance swings in our favor forever.
Leaving you and me... rulers of a desperate, desiccated kingdom.
I won't let you down...
Dad.
I know you won't.
You look good in rat.
It's slimming.
Yeah!
Look out, look out!
Here comes your star pupil.
Oh, oh, oh!
Where have you been?
Wait, you're mad?
You told me to get back and I'm back.
On this!
And you want credit for that?
You're late.
Find a real bird and get back to your group.
You know what? No.
What did you say?
I'm not doing it.
I'm not a kid anymore and I'm tired of you treating me like one.
I'm trying to help you, I'm trying to look out for you.
I never asked you to do that.
Your father did.
Well, you can stop.
I absolve you of all further responsibility in the raising of young Nod.
Don't walk away from me.
I'm your commanding officer!
Not anymore!
I quit! Hyah!
Whoa! Thatta girl.
Easy, easy!
What are you looking at?
Nothing. I have no opinion on this.
Everyone, mount up!
Parade! Fun! Smiling!
Dad!
Dad!
Is this a good time to talk?
Ow. Hold on, I'll be right down!
Ow!
Ozzy!
Ozzy, stop!
Fetch the camera!
Why do you have security cameras, anyway?
Do people around here steal old newspapers?
Oh, no, no. They're not security cameras.
No, I have an extensive network all through the forest, yeah.
I don't know how much your mother told you about my work.
Um... nothing.
Just that you have a delusional belief... in an advanced society of tiny people living in the woods... and it ruined your career... not to mention your marriage.
Or something?
Well... your mother had a wonderful sense of humor.
But I'm not delusional.
I know they're out there.
It's intuition, like scientists intuited the atom.
These little guys are a big part of the ecosystem... the engine, if you will, and I will prove it. Here.
You have bat sounds on your iPod? Why?
To study them. They don't really fly in your hair.
That's a myth.
But I was trying to identify... the frequencies that draw bats to gather with their own kind.
So I slowed the sounds down... and I put them through some proprietary filters... and guess what I heard.
Voices?
Yes!
Isn't that cool?
Okay... if tiny men are flying around in the forest... how come I've never seen them?
No, that's easy.
It's the same reason we can't hear them.
They just move too fast, like insects.
Didn't you ever wonder why it was so hard to swat a fly?
My theory is they're actually living faster.
Like in a different dimension.
So, no matter how fast we think we are... to them we're just big and dumb and... slow.
Have you ever seen one?
Well, you know, uh...
You know what? Just because you haven't seen something... doesn't mean it's not there.
I, you know, that's...
Come on.
Okay, we need to talk.
I know it's a lot to take in.
I mean about us.
Oh, no! No, we'll do it together!
Yeah, both of us. Here,
I made this for you.
Dad, look...
I am almost old enough to be on my own anyway... so I think it would be better if I just...
Um...
You don't want to live here?
That's what you want?
No, it's not what I want.
I want you to stop!
All this!
And be normal. I just, I want a dad who's not...
Oh, um, okay.
This is big.
This is a big thing going on right now.
Let me just find...
Where are you going?
I'm just going to investigate, rather...
Okay, something must be happening.
Ooh! Uh... Let's see.
Where's my camera?
Are you serious?
You have to catch these things in the moment... while they're happening... otherwise you miss a chance that could be gone forever.
You're missing a chance right now!
Are you even listening?
Look, you've got to believe me.
I am so close.
All I need is one little breakthrough.
This could be it!
I will clear this all up when I get back!
I promise!
Sure, Dad.
I'll be here.
In reality.
Bye, Ozzy.
It's not you.
Uh, Larry? I need that getaway cab.
I said, pick me up by the... Hello?
Ugh! No bars!
Ozzy! Heel!
Stop! Play dead!
How are you so fast on three legs?
Ozzy!
Ozzy!
Ozzy!
Isn't she pretty?
She's awesome!
She moved those trees with her mind!
Mom, can I be queen when I grow up?
Oh, honey, it doesn't work that way.
Today, Queen Tara gives her power to a special Pod... so the life of the forest will continue.
It's all very mysterious, and...
Sweetie, what are you doing?
Mom!
I did it!
Did what?
Aw!
She's coming!
Don't do anything to embarrass me... or it could ruin my chances of being a Leafman.
Why do you want to be a Leafman?
They gotta wear uniforms.
Me? I like to let it all hang free.
You see this, you see that?
Yeah, don't do that.
That's vile.
Come on, I know you got a little belly, too.
Gentlemen.
Hey. Your Majesty.
Hello.
It's all right.
Relax, it's just me.
Mub, Grub, it's a very nice-looking group of Pods.
I might have a hard time picking one.
Do you have a favorite?
Well, Your Majesty, we have had quite the debate.
Really gone back and forth.
You'll note the carefully curated selection of sizes, densities, color.
With so many variables, you can't be too hasty.
Boom! Right here.
Biggest in the bunch.
Hmm.
Well, that's one way to go.
How about that one?
What? That one?
For real?
But it's so...
Perfect!
It's perfect.
Excellent choice, Your Majesty.
Sometimes the biggest one isn't the best one. Ow!
I told you, she doesn't like gaudy, Mub.
Unlike you, she's got class.
This is it.
This is the one.
Aw!
Boggans.
Your Majesty!
Get to the barge!
I told you she was awesome!
Hold the formation!
This is it, Mub!
My chance to be a Leaf...
What? Your chance to be a what?
Ronin!
Ozzy?
Oh, come on, Ozzy.
We had numbers, and we had the surprise part!
How are we losing?
Patience, son. The forest wasn't grown in a day.
But we can destroy it in one. Right?
Ha! That's the spirit!
You take the Pod,
I'll take the queen.
Nice one!
You're stealing my moves, kid!
Your Majesty, come with me!
Take her to safety!
I have to lead them away from the crowd!
You're totally my hero!
Okay... so maybe you were right.
Remind me to gloat later.
Son! No!
Ozzy!
Ah!
Oh!
Ah! Ah, ah!
Ahhh!
Huh?
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Oh, my gosh, that's an arrow.
Should I pull it out?
I don't know what to do.
Take the Pod to Nim Galuu.
Nim what?
You need a doctor.
Somebody call...
What is this thing?
It's the life of the forest.
Tara!
So serious.
I'm so sorry.
What did she say to you?
Something about glue?
Or a canoe.
Nim Galuu.
The scroll keeper.
We don't know anything about the Pod without Tara.
Maybe he does.
Take the Leafmen to Moonhaven.
Fortify it.
Keep everyone safe.
What about you?
Mandrake will be looking for this Pod... but he won't be looking for a Leafman traveling alone.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
I'll send word when I reach Nim's.
Who are you people? Is this some sort of reenactment?
That's a big bug.
No, it's about average, actually.
Then what? I'm tiny?
Oh, no.
No.
No, no, no.
I'm not sure why the queen brought you here either... but she gave you that Pod, so you have to come with me.
Make me big!
Excuse me?
I'm not going anywhere until you make me big again!
Uh... You know what?
I don't do magic.
You can talk to Nim Galuu about that, he might know something.
Might?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast, soldier boy.
You do not yank on a Pod, okay?
Especially when it's attached to something so lovely.
Talking snails.
Actually, he's a snail.
I'm a slug.
No shell over here, baby.
It just slows me down.
Ronin, right?
Head of the Leafmen?
Big fan.
I just love what you do with your jaw.
Yes, that!
We are the official
Pod caretakers, sir.
It can't survive without us.
We keep it moist.
Moist is what we do.
You're kidding.
You're not kidding. Fine.
Word of the queen's passing will travel fast... we have to travel faster.
With all this extra weight we're going to need another bird.
Bird. Of course.
By any chance... you don't happen to be part of an advanced society... of tiny people living in the woods, do you?
Some are more advanced than others.
And that's another lap down.
These racers are in it to win...
and they'd better be, we've got some
heavy betting in the crowd today.
They're clustering together...
I'm telling you, this is where I belong!
You belong in the back of the pack!
I mean racing!
The best man wins.
No other rules, nobody telling you what to do.
You talk too much!
And you ain't winning this race!
Sorry, can't hear you!
Going too fast!
Hey. Nice old fleabag you got there.
It's not the bird, it's how you ride it.
Yeah? Prove it.
Fetch!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's a dirty trick,
which, let's face it, is exactly what we've come to see.
Final lap!
This is bird racing, folks, it's not a parade.
Looks like Nod's out of the race.
Wait a minute, is that...
Nod is down but not out!
Don't let his old bird fool you!
The kid's on the comeback trail!
You know what we'll do if you win?
I don't know, lose?
It's the final lap.
They're beak to beak, wing to wing...
and it's Nod by a tail feather!
The odds-on favorite takes it home.
I bet there's a lot of happy faces in the crowd right now.
Is that the best you've got?
How was that?
Better.
Nod, you know I like you.
Yeah, I like you, too,
Mr. Bufo.
And yet, you don't do what we agreed.
We agreed that you would lose, but then you win.
Now, I can't help it if I'm fast.
You want me to lose, you gotta give me some better competition.
It's called teamwork.
Maybe if you understood that... the Leafmen wouldn't have kicked you out.
They did not kick me out.
I quit.
I admire your independent spirit, Nod, I'll miss that.
Feed him to something.
A snake would be good.
No, snakes just swallow you whole.
Now, if you put him in a hornets' nest, that's a show.
Ah, look, it's Ronin, defender of the weak... popper of parties, here to ruin the fun.
I didn't ruin all of it.
I let you hit him.
Twice.
Hop along now, little froggy.
Easy, Ronin, it's a big forest out there.
Even Leafmen gotta sleep.
You're wasting your time.
I'm not coming back.
I'm not asking.
Oh, I see. The old reverse psychology.
Make me feel guilty, get me to beg you.
I didn't come for you.
The queen is dead.
What? How?
Boggan ambush.
Ronin,
I don't know what to say.
She was your...
I'm sorry.
What's going to happen to us, to the forest?
If we don't get the Pod to Nim
Galuu's, the forest will die.
Let me grab my saddle.
What? No. I didn't ask for your help.
Really? Because it sounds like you could use a rider with my...
Ability to absorb punches?
The situation's desperate.
Let's not make it hopeless.
All right, well, who's with you?
Who's riding point?
Uh-oh.
Get your saddle.
I'll get my saddle.
This doesn't make any...
I mean, it makes sense.
Mary Katherine, you're not gonna believe these readings... they are off the charts!
The wind, and the rain and lightning!
And the birds were flying!
In a storm!
Okay, and that's not normal.
Which would prove...
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to make some lunch... and I'll tell you all about it.
Ozzy, what are you doing outside?
Did you see it, too?
Tell me you saw it.
Hey, Mary Katheri...
Or, no, MK!
MK, what did you want to talk about?
What?
What is it, Ozzy?
Hey, I'm Nod, by the way.
Hi. MK. Yeah.
Could you just face the way the bird's driving?
No, don't worry. She practically flies herself.
Great, because this whole bird-riding thing's new to me.
Are you serious?
We gotta fix that.
Here, put your arms around me.
I just met you.
Okay, but you're gonna want to hold on to something.
What is wrong with you?
Do you know how hard it is to do that without falling?
I do now!
Nod, perch your bird.
Hey, I'm just trying to keep things... light.
What did that?
Mandrake.
Tara's power always kept him in check.
Now nothing can heal what he destroys.
Except that Pod.
We have to go around.
Just for one scout?
Ever see just one Boggan?
Hold on to me. Hyah!
Still barely know you.
Nod, wait!
Whoa!
Get to the ground!
This way!
Other way!
What was that thing?
What, you've never seen a Boggan?
Someone had a happy childhood.
Come on, let's regroup.
You mean up there with those things?
They almost killed us.
Don't turn around.
Is it a Boogie?
Walk towards me slowly.
Oh, it's a mouse.
Hi, mousie!
I was gonna scare it away.
What are you doing?
Look at its little hands and its little whiskers. Oh!
Hello! Other person!
Jump!
I can't jump that high!
Ohh! Ah!
Did you see what I just did?
Out! Jump out!
Oh, great.
Hey, over here!
Over here!
Whoa, whoa!
Fuzzy mousie.
Ahh!
Nice tail.
It's flexible.
Ah! Ah! Help!
They have very sensitive whiskers.
You know, I had this.
Uh-huh.
Are you all right?
Dad? I had the most messed-up dream.
There were talking slugs and tiny little soldiers and...
Hello!
Ah, man!
Now let's move.
Where there's mice there's bound to be chipmunks.
New seating arrangement.
You're riding with me.
Thank you.
You're with the slugs.
Ugh! Disgusting.
Do you and me have a problem?
Uh, I don't think so.
What was that over there?
A little chit-chat?
That's real cute.
You trying to jump in?
What are we talking about?
There's a code amongst men.
It goes something like this.
I saw her first.
Ow!
You're a slug.
So? You think she'd want you?
Look at yourself!
Oh, that's right, you can't... because your eyeballs are stuck all the way inside your head.
What's wrong, flatface?
Are you gonna cry?
Do you want me to call your flatface mommy?
You know you're not insulting me, right?
You're just grossing me out.
You've been warned.
Ow!
Hey, if this is a bad time...
I can come back when you're done gardening.
Oh! Hey!
I imagine you're wondering why I invited you here.
I was frog-marched here at spearpoint. Ah!
How is that invited?
I let you keep your legs.
Comedy. Terrific.
Funny psychopath.
There are rumors that the Leafman Ronin was at your place of business... and that he may have rescued a Royal Pod.
Real smooth.
You got rid of the queen, but let her Pod get away.
Plus your idiot general gets himself mulched.
That idiot general... was my son!
Of course he was.
He had your good looks.
And your healthy gray complexion.
And forgiving nature.
Shut up!
What's it gonna be, Bufo?
Are you gonna talk?
Or are you gonna croak?
Where are they taking the Pod?
It's clear. Hyah!
Why is he even with us?
He's not helping.
Well, when he's not being an idiot... he's a pretty decent flier.
Could be one of the best.
Plus his father was my friend, so I do what I can.
"Many leaves, one tree."
What does that mean?
We're all individuals, but we're still connected.
It's what we live by.
Hyah!
Maybe you're connected, but I'm kind of on my own.
No one's on their own.
Not even him.
Hey, Nod, how's the view?
Well... here we are.
I thought this was a secret Leafmen mission.
How many people did the queen tell about this?
They're here looking for answers.
Nobody knows that the queen is gone... only that the blight is spreading.
So, this Nim guy can tell them?
He's the keeper of our history... but even he may not know about the queen.
He's not always up to speed.
But he'll help, right?
He's, like, the wise old man of the forest.
Uh, he's more like the crazy uncle.
The whole meadow just died.
Everything was green, and now it's gone.
I grew up in that meadow.
Why isn't the queen doing anything?
If anything happened to her, everything's going to rot!
We're doomed!
We're doomed!
Get a hold of yourself!
Oops. Sorry.
Friends!
Neighbors!
Prepare to see your worries... disappear.
Ooh!
I know rumors have been flying... but the truth is never as bad as it seems.
I have just returned from deep inside this tree... from the Rings of Knowledge... where every memory... every event that ever happens in the forest... is recorded in these scrolls.
♪ Listen, party poopers,
I've got something to say
♪ Dry your weeping eyes, we're gonna be okay
♪ So you don't have to worry about a dog gone thing
♪ The Rings of Knowledge know everything
♪ The scrolls never lie and, honey, neither does Nim
♪ It's right here in my hands, all six of them
♪ So tuck your little fears and put them right into bed
♪ It says right here that the queen...
That the queen is...
Uh...
What?
Just tell us what it says!
What's it say?
He doesn't know anything! Boo!
Fraud!
♪ Dry your weeping eyes, we're gonna be fine
♪ Everything is really gonna be all right ♪
Ronin! Did you hear about the queen?
This is terrible!
I know, but...
We gotta do something!
We gotta keep everyone from freaking out!
Yes, that's why we...
And the Pod!
We gotta make sure the Royal Pod is safely hidden... far away. And...
What'd you bring it here for?
The queen's last words were
"Bring the Pod to Nim Galuu."
She say anything else? Specific instructions? Maybe a note?
Those were her last words.
I thought you were magic.
Magic might be stretching it.
I'm charismatic.
Possibly charming.
Do you know what to do with the Pod or not?
Not a clue, but I do know where to look it up.
Follow me!
There he is!
Phony!
Um, no, it's this way.
The Rings of Knowledge!
Is everything that happens really recorded right here?
Oh, yeah.
And you've read all these scrolls?
Ah, I've skimmed them.
So, is this event being recorded?
Right now?
Of course.
Is this?
Yes.
How about this?
Yes.
What about this?
Yep.
That should be it right here.
Thanks, Marty.
Aw!
Okay. Blooming a Pod.
Gotta go way back for that.
Here we go.
Let's see.
Pod, care of.
Must keep moist.
Well, good news is, once the queen chooses it... it's going to bloom no matter what.
But it has to open tonight... in the light of the full moon when it's at its highest peak.
Yep, solstice... full moon, highest peak, mentions it a bunch of times.
What happens if it blooms out of the moonlight?
Unclear.
The last part's missing.
I gotta be honest, termites have been a problem.
So here I thought we were doomed.
This calls for a celebration!
I suppose we've earned it.
Wait... this is gonna sound weird, but...
I'm not from this world.
And I thought maybe something in these scrolls could tell me... if there's a way for me to get home.
The scrolls don't tell the future... they only guide us with the knowledge of the past.
Hey, that's a great line!
You guys got that, right?
So you can't help me?
I didn't say that.
I can't read this.
It's just dusty.
Blow it off.
It's you.
But I saw you turn into moss.
Come closer.
Oh, this is perfect!
You can make me big again.
Closer.
It's a memory.
If you can hear me now... it means you got to Nim's.
The Pod needs you.
I can't be around for it anymore.
No, don't do that!
Why would you give that to me?
You don't understand,
I have to get home... this has nothing to do with me.
You're here for a reason.
Maybe you don't see the connections yet.
But just because you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there.
I know you're scared.
Just stay with the Pod... be with it when it blooms... and then you'll get back what you've given.
You'll get back.
Well, that was intense.
I gotta read more of these.
That means I can get home!
Well, if you want to go home so bad, then why did you leave?
Lose the sword, Ronin, we're done.
We're not done until the Pod blooms.
We're bringing it home to Moonhaven.
I need you to watch it while I tell the rest of the Leafmen to expect us.
Hey, I helped you get here, but I haven't changed my mind.
Do you think just because you're not a Leafman anymore... you're not a part of this?
Well, the fate of that Pod affects all of us.
The queen is gone.
But, as always, she looked out for us... even in her final moments.
Tonight, when this Pod blooms, a new queen will rise!
I know you're sad.
I am, too.
But Tara wouldn't want us to mourn!
She'd want us to celebrate her life!
And the life of the forest!
So, stay with it.
And don't lose the sword.
Look, I'm thinking that I didn't make the best first impression.
It's okay. I've never had a guy fight a mouse for me before.
You're not from around here, are you?
What makes you say that?
If you were,
I would remember you.
To Queen Tara!
To the queen!
You wanna go somewhere quieter?
Will that be okay with Ronin?
Yeah, he said to watch the Pod... but there's nowhere safer than Nim's tree.
I think he's just pretty upset about the queen.
Here, let me show you something.
What?
Huh.
That actually gets easier.
What is...
Wow.
Grab on!
What?
Put your arms around me.
But I barely know you.
Do you want to ride him or not?
The scroll said there was nothing you could do to save her, Ronin.
You have to know that.
Send a code to the Leafmen.
Let them know the Pod is safe and we're bringing it home.
You heard him.
Go tell them, boys!
And it's happy hour at Nim's!
Or just do the first part.
I gotta admit, flying is nice, but this is riding in style.
Yeah.
Not everyone can do it.
You have to be gentle to ride a deer.
My dad taught me how.
It's one of my best memories of him.
You must really miss him.
I know how that feels.
Fruit fly, huh?
So, what's it like, having such a short life cycle?
It's great, mister!
When I grow up...
I'm going to... wish I had done more with my life, sonny.
The forest trembles at the passing of the humble fruit fly.
Excuse me, but I've lost something very dear to me.
It was left by a friend who's no longer with us.
Ah!
You found it!
If you want to take this Pod, you're gonna have to go through us!
Relax. I'm not going to hurt it.
I need it alive.
Well, we're the only ones that know how to keep it that way.
Thanks for the tip.
Stay with the Pod, that's all you had to do.
Yeah, but I just thought...
Do you ever think about anyone besides yourself?
It wasn't all his fault!
And you. I expected as much from him.
But I thought you would know better.
We're really sorry, okay?
I don't want to hear it.
That was the last part of the queen that I...
That any of us will ever have.
The queen gave it to me. I should have been here with it.
I'll do whatever it takes to help you get it back.
I appreciate the offer, but
Wrathwood is too dangerous.
But you can't go alone.
What about the whole leaves-tree thing that you said?
Nim, tell him.
Look, kid, the moon's coming up.
That's bloom-or-die time.
So if no one has a better plan...
Why don't we sneak in, in disguise?
Great idea.
I'll go as a grasshopper and you can be my cricket ladyfriend.
It's dangerous, I might get killed.
I thought you'd like that.
I don't have any Boggan armor handy.
Do you?
I know where we can get some.
Well?
I gotta say, six hands are better than two.
That's been my experience.
You might want to hang on.
Hyah! Whoa!
Stop! Please!
My son was born on a night like this.
These were his baby fangs.
And here's the first skin he ever molted.
He was big for a larva.
He took after his mother.
Your stories are boring and torturous!
And the Leafmen took him from me.
So I took something of theirs.
It's basic etiquette.
- An eye for an eye.
- Ow!
Jerk!
Tonight your Pod will bloom here.
And when a Pod blooms in darkness, it belongs... to the darkness.
It will become my little dark prince.
I'll destroy the forest with the very thing you hoped would save it.
I hate to break it to you, but it doesn't say that in the scrolls.
It does in the part I have.
D'oh!
Hey, the Boggan armor... where is it?
Over there.
Let's make this quick.
Come on.
Ow!
Oh!
Ow!
That was awesome. Here.
Up we go.
Ugh! That is some static cling.
No, that's metal, don't touch that!
Whoo!
Ow!
Knock it off.
Ow. Quit it.
Ow! No, you quit.
I'm not doing it.
Stop!
Ow. I'm not doing...
Now!
Come on.
You know... some of this stuff looks familiar.
Hey, that's my saddle!
Where are we?
Oh, it's where this guy lives.
I can't believe it.
He's been crashing around the forest like a bear for years.
Most stompers just come and go, but this guy's relentless.
- Wait. Stompers?
- Yeah.
Like us, but big and dumb and slow... always stomping on things. Stompers.
And this one is obsessed with finding us.
Obviously that's a security risk.
Can't have one of his big fat feet stepping on Moonhaven.
One of his ginormous, flabby, dirty, stinky...
Okay, I got it.
So we've been throwing him off the trail.
So you're just messing with him?
But he's found all this stuff.
He only finds what we want him to find.
Look at his map.
We've got him looking everywhere but where we are.
I love how this guy talks.
"Look at this flower."
"I hurt my elbow."
I think that's kind of mean.
"Who said that?"
It's his life's work.
He's my dad!
He what?
I'm a stomper.
What happened?
You got shrunk?
Yes! Which he knows.
Seriously?
It's been a weird day for everybody.
You got a problem with stompers?
A stomper squashed my uncle.
Oh, my gosh. Really?
No. I'm messing with you.
Too far?
Try it again, maybe she'll punch you harder.
I'm sorry.
I guess she's right about me, huh, Ozzy?
All I seem to be able to do is... drive people away.
No, Dad, you didn't! I'm here!
And you're right about all of it.
Don't stop looking.
Not now.
Dad! Dad, just turn around!
Uh-oh.
Ozzy... no kisses.
Ozzy!
Hey, how do I look?
Scary as ever.
Are you okay?
Run!
Ozzy, will you please stop?
Oh! Oh!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
They're here!
They're in my house!
No!
Ow!
I hurt my elbow!
Did you hear that?
He said it!
Whoa!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
No! Don't let go!
Don't let go! No!
Oh, oh!
Hello there, my little friend!
Dad! Dad!
Oh!
Dad! Dad!
Let's go.
You can't stay.
You're with us now!
I'll come home soon, Dad.
I promise.
Come on, MK, we gotta go.
You think he's okay?
Yeah, he'll be fine, their heads are like rocks.
Uh, smart rocks.
That's a whole lot of ugly.
Ugh! It smells like something died in here.
Something did.
How do we know where to go?
I've been here before... with your father.
He never told me about this.
He never got the chance.
How's my dark prince?
It's fine!
Good. Because if it dies, you die.
We know. You said.
Ugly says "what"?
What?
Nothing.
Shh!
There's our exit.
Meet me back here when you've got the Pod and the slugs.
How are we supposed to find them?
Follow the slime.
Aren't you coming with us?
I'm gonna make sure nobody follows you.
Don't worry, you get the easy part...
I get the fun part.
Hey, look!
It's a Leafman!
I'll keep this simple.
I run... you try to catch me.
Let's go.
When I get big again,
I am so coming back here with a can of bug spray.
Mub. Grub.
We're down here!
I told you she'd come for me.
This girl is smitten.
Mmm...
Hand me the Pod!
Oh, come on, you should work on your grip, my dude.
It's a bit womanly.
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa!
Hurry, before the guards come back!
Too late!
I have a plan!
Quick!
Everybody hide in your shells!
Oh. I have another plan!
Go! Go!
Ow! That hurts!
Those are my eyes!
Can you go any faster?
It's kind of hard when you're pulling on my brain!
Ronin!
What a surprise.
I get so few guests.
Could be the stench of death.
Some people don't care for it.
It's all right.
Ronin's an old...
What do you call someone you've known a long time... and always wanted to destroy?
I expected you to come.
But I didn't think you'd come alone.
Who said I'm alone?
Whoa.
Ow!
Ooh! So, what's the plan here?
A hundred Leafmen?
A thousand?
Don't flatter yourself.
Well, now I'm just embarrassed.
I completely over-prepared.
Go, go, go!
I'm afraid you'll find getting out... is a lot harder than getting in.
Ronin!
Hang on!
Go! Take the Pod to Moonhaven!
I'm not leaving without you!
Now you're starting to sound like a Leafman!
Ronin!
Come on!
Hyah!
We've been waiting for you.
Where's Ronin?
He gave us a head start.
But the Boggans aren't far behind.
You guys made it!
I knew you would.
You got that from the scrolls?
Some things you just know.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Moonlight comes in here, moves along here... reaches the Pod here.
At the moon's highest peak.
Only time it can bloom.
Do you know what this means?
We single-handedly saved the forest!
Eye five! Down low.
Too slow.
So, when the Pod opens, what happens to you?
I think I go home.
Well, I guess this is...
Yeah, I guess it is.
Mandrake's bats!
They're not attacking, they're just blocking out the moon.
Are you ready for this?
Are you kidding?
We're outnumbered, out of time and the fate of the world is at stake.
Why did I quit again?
See you up there.
As soon as I can find my helmet.
Thank you.
Hey, guys!
I'm going to need a uniform!
And a bird!
Oh, that's...
You...
That's all right.
I'll find them myself.
A Leafman makes do.
What are you doing?
I'm going to help.
Whoa, whoa.
You heard the queen!
If you want to get home... you have to be here with the Pod when it blooms.
Isn't that what you want?
So I should just sit here?
I didn't say that.
Then I'm going up there.
I didn't say that either.
You don't even know what you're saying.
I'm saying, who gives up everything... for a world that's not even theirs?
Dad. My dad does!
I have to get my dad!
Where do you think you're going?
The queen said I was here for a reason.
This must be it.
That's my girl.
Hyah!
Oh, come on!
Mandrake! He's headed for Moonhaven!
Grub! The Pod! It's blooming in darkness!
Whoa! Hyah!
Hey, Dad!
Come on, I need your help!
Whoa, whoa!
They're all right about me, Ozzy.
All these years just chasing things that aren't even there.
I actually thought
I saw my daughter, two inches tall, stuck in a bug jar.
I've lost my mind.
And I am talking to a dog.
Hey, Dad!
Come on, I need your help, Dad!
What? No! No!
Dad, look at me!
I'm right here!
Just check your cameras!
Ozzy, please.
I've made up my mind, okay?
Quiet!
I don't care anymore.
All I want now, is to find my daughter!
Dad, please!
Please, I need you.
Oh!
I am so over Boggans.
Ah!
Ozzy!
Dad!
Don't faint!
I won't!
How did you find me?
I got your message.
You were right.
About what?
About everything.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
How did you get so small?
Dad, it was amazing!
They're real!
And they need your help.
Follow me!
Missed me.
I wasn't aiming for you.
Ooh! This must be the delivery room.
Whoa! Boy, are you lost!
Down the hall... make a left, and then when you see the janitor with a weird eye...
Shut up!
My dark prince.
Come to Daddy.
I don't think it likes you.
Ronin!
You know how many Boggans
I had to fight to get here?
Seriously, I lost count.
Well, what's one more?
It's all real!
It's really here!
Dad, the bats! We have to get them away from the moon.
It's so beautiful.
There's no time!
But what matters most is...
Not now!
Oh!
Oh, you want me to play the frequencies that... attract the...
Run!
I'll find you, Dad!
I just have to get back before...
Oh! Oh!
Ow, ow, ow!
They really do go in your hair!
This time, when
I leave you for dead... you'll stay that way!
What's that little saying you people have?
"Lots of leaves, something-something"?
Very inspiring.
But in the end every leaf falls and dies alone.
No one is alone.
Not even him.
Look after them for me.
There's that smile.
Your Majesty.
You look terrible.
Hey, did you see how many times I got hit?
I learned that from you.
You're not going to make me say all the stuff...
I learned from you now, are you?
Well, you'd have learned a heck of a lot more from your dad.
I was a pretty poor substitute.
Don't beat yourself up. Lately you've shown some real promise.
Oh, please.
Just say you love each other.
I thought we just did.
Hey, you're still here.
Yeah.
I guess I missed my chance.
I'm sorry.
But not completely sorry.
Wow! Strong grip!
What's happening?
A queen brought you here. How about a queen sends you back?
It's working!
We have to say goodbye!
What for?
You're part of us.
Many leaves, I always say.
I mean, the Leafmen say.
Not that I'm a Leafman.
Says who?
We'll find each other!
Just follow the slime!
I will, Mub.
You're really leaving.
Put your arms around me.
I always hoped if I, uh... if I proved it to her... she'd, uh... you know.
Well, what do you think?
It's perfect, Dad.
Except, the boots are higher and the sleeves are longer.
And they wear actual helmets, not acorns.
Really?
They should seriously consider the potential.
Ozzy!
Here you go, boy.
Um...
Go. It's always for you, anyway.
Hey.
Hey!
How's work?
No, it's not work when you love your job.
"Many leaves, one tree," that's what I always say.
Uh-huh.
What do you think you're doing, Leafboy?
Leafman. You know it's Leafman.
Is it?
I wasn't sure.
Hey, MK!
What's going on, baby girl?
Hi, Mub.
We were talking.
There's a big sack of
"shut your flat face" over there by that tree.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Listen, slick.
Guys, don't fight.
Oh, it won't be a fight. I could whip him with both eyes behind my back.
I'd like to see you try, jelly butt.
I didn't want to have to do this!
Ew!
Mub, get him out of your mouth!
Dad, I gotta go Heimlich my friend out of a slug.
Yeah, that looks pretty weird.
Here don't forget this.
Tell them about the acorn helmets.
Or you could tell them yourself.
Oh!
Come on, Ozzy!

[2073][2098]Shit!
[2481][2508]Don't look at me. This|guy's the one who shot you!
[2508][2532]Hey!
[3056][3069]Six men.
[3069][3109]Ten grand a head. Sixty thousand.
[3109][3170]Wherever my daughter's spirit is,|I hope she's a little happier.
[3170][3193]I thought I would feel better, but...
[3193][3223]somehow...
[3245][3264]That's my little girl.
[3264][3280]They turned her into an addict.
[3280][3319]I saw her body and it|was hard to recognize.
[3319][3373]I keep thinking she's still alive.
[3402][3426]/Let's go Put some sake In my cup
[3426][3445]/Fill it up Fill it up
[3445][3512]/Put some sake in my cup|/Fill it up Fill it up
[3753][3776]You deserve to lose.
[3776][3793]Watching me instead of looking
[3793][3820]at all that beautiful|Siamese kitty cat out there.
[3820][3869]Boss, problem with the check.
[4121][4139]English! Why you running?
[4139][4189]'Cause I know why you're here.
[4213][4253]I just need a favor.
[4291][4309]Wait! Just hear me out.
[4309][4339]Forget it.
[4632][4668]Oh, no. Not now!
[4804][4828]Hey!
[4881][4916]Get off my car.
[4936][4975]Moron! You want it?
[4994][5012]Look, I have a gun.
[5012][5034]You'd already be dead if|I was here to kill you.
[5034][5063]You want to ask me questions first.
[5063][5077]Hey! Hey!
[5077][5111]How do you even think|that shit about me?
[5111][5129]They always send...
[5129][5142]someone you know.
[5142][5174]I'm on a job here. And you're not it.
[5174][5193]I just need some weapons.
[5193][5229]Why didn't you say so?
[5229][5282]Oh, for Christ's sake.|You know, this is Versace.
[5282][5303]It's not a knockoff, either.
[5303][5349]Do you know what it is to|get Versace into Thailand?
[5349][5387]Is that my button?
[5388][5424]I think all them titties|are going to your head.
[5424][5440]What could you possibly|know that would bring
[5440][5456]that kind of heat from the agency?
[5456][5494]You know that I was deep cover.
[5494][5528]I was too deep for them|to take responsibility
[5528][5554]once it was blown to fucks!
[5554][5570]So what about you?
[5570][5600]If you're not here for|me, then what's the job?
[5600][5635]Are you working for the agency|or are you moonlighting?
[5635][5659]A guy lost his daughter to a few punks.
[5659][5670]They put her to work.
[5670][5690]Bullshit.
[5690][5714]What would have you slumming|in with the likes of that?
[5714][5735]He's paying the rate.
[5735][5753]Okay, fine. Here.
[5753][5789]Oh, fuck! I fucking knew it.
[5789][5813]Here.
[5813][5846]Okay. Maybe I was mistaken.
[5846][5888]You know, I've been a bit tense lately.
[5888][5911]I don't know what came over me.
[5911][5931]Here. We're tight.
[5931][5946]No. You hold onto it.
[5946][5979]No, no. Never carry a gun.
[5979][5996]People get shot that way.
[5996][6015]Good point coming from you.
[6015][6029]Precisely.
[6029][6060]You sure living here's|been good for you? Huh?
[6060][6094]It's paradise.
[6304][6322]Whoa. Who's that?
[6322][6370]Relax. Only guy I can trust.
[6458][6516]I've got to do something with my hair.
[6547][6599]This is where the magic happens.
[6678][6711]Right this way. Welcome...
[6711][6735]to my little slice of heaven.
[6735][6754]Oh, this might become handy.
[6754][6769]No, no! Sorry, sorry.
[6769][6791]Wrong section. Not for rent.
[6791][6813]Not just any M76.
[6813][6838]That was used by Lee|Marvin in Prime Cut.
[6838][6853]He shot Gene Hackman with it
[6853][6875]and I've got the papers to prove it.
[6875][6907]I'm starting my own Planet|Hollywood here. But all guns.
[6907][6925]It's genius. Right?
[6925][6945]You ever hear of Pretty Boy Floyd?
[6945][6970]Not the bank robber. The movie.
[6970][7002]This is the first piece I grabbed.
[7002][7048]This M 1 was used by Clint|himself in Pink Cadillac.
[7048][7080]Grease gun. Charlie|Bronson. Dirty Dozen.
[7080][7106]I know, it's a franchise, right.
[7106][7118]I'm going legit.
[7118][7143]All I need is a name.
[7143][7165]I was thinking, you know, Cafe AK.
[7165][7196]Or Guns Zone. Like Fun Zone.
[7196][7231]But Gun Zone. Uh huh?
[7231][7254]Well, I need something long.|Working from a distance.
[7254][7294]Accuracy international. Real light.
[7294][7333]That'll do you. It's a thousand a day.
[7333][7375]That's the buddy rate.
[7414][7426]You got a suppressor for this?
[7426][7440]No. Not for that.
[7440][7458]What about a scope, 30 times?
[7458][7495]You trying to hit something|in Cambodia? Uh, 15.
[7495][7561]Best I can do. But I'll|throw in night vision.
[7659][7689]How much for this?
[7689][7704]You golf?
[7704][7750]You know, even if you|find this guy's daughter
[7750][7793]they make them all addicts|so they won't leave.
[7793][7806]And it's one needle for everybody.
[7806][7834]I already found her.
[7834][7870]Whoa. Feel that?
[7874][7929]Fucking chill just went through me.
[7939][7960]So, where you staying?
[7960][7980]Wouldn't you like to know.
[7980][8014]Gotta be careful. This|whole city's haunted.
[8014][8050]There's a lot of unhappy|spirits looking for you.
[8050][8098]There's gonna be a lot more.
[9177][9218]Initiation of a monk.
[9234][9251]What are you doing here?
[9251][9269]I tried to follow you.
[9269][9279]Why?
[9279][9306]I don't know yet.
[9306][9321]Are you alone?
[9321][9346]Yes. I couldn't keep up with you.
[9346][9373]Then I followed the|sound of the chanting.
[9373][9411]And you were here.
[9413][9431]It's not a coincidence.
[9431][9448]It was meant to be that I find you.
[9448][9479]You shouldn't have followed me.
[9479][9505]It's okay. It's okay.
[9505][9538]Do it. Do it.
[9623][9644]I won't leave.
[9644][9661]I've seen your tracks.
[9661][9715]Know you'll be trying soon enough.
[9734][9770]Open your mouth.
[10188][10229]Heroin withdrawal. It'll pass.
[10229][10257]Please let me go.
[10257][10272]I need to go back.
[10272][10286]I'll do whatever you want.
[10286][10330]I will love you. I will.
[10385][10439]You'll feel better when it's over.
[11295][11341]Come here. Time to get up.
[11486][11511]Good?
[11513][11543]There's water there for you to clean up.
[11543][11568]Here.
[11716][11740]You will kill me for following you?
[11740][11764]No. For knowing where I'm staying.
[11764][11818]Why is it important you stay here?
[11850][11870]Why didn't you do it?
[11870][11892]Because you said it was okay.
[11892][11918]It is.
[11928][11962]Nothing's ever that bad to|want to give up on life.
[11962][11982]I didn't see it as an escape.
[11982][12017]It was all right for|other reasons. Jai yen.
[12017][12044]I'm comfortable with whatever comes.
[12044][12066]The settlement for past wrongs.
[12066][12083]Then why not just stay|there and settle up
[12083][12098]instead of following me?
[12098][12130]You were sent because my|time there was finished.
[12130][12165]Shh. Come here.
[12265][12301]Now you stay there and be quiet.
[12301][12351]My name is Mae. What is yours?
[12382][12408]I have to get some sleep.
[12408][12430]You're gonna watch that club down there
[12430][12445]for the guys who had you.
[12445][12472]That is not their club.
[12472][12498]I know. But they'll be|showing up there anyway.
[12498][12512]Because you made it look like
[12512][12581]one of the guys from the|club just attacked them.
[12589][12612]Wake me up when you|see somebody you know.
[12612][12635]I can't help you kill anyone.
[12635][12653]You will.
[12653][12671]Why do you kill them?
[12671][12695]Why do you think?
[12695][12746]Because they're hurting people.
[13035][13056]Don't! You have to stop.
[13056][13090]This is wrong!
[13149][13174]Shhh!
[13195][13223]Shut up!
[13972][14012]Thanks for the help.
[14608][14627]I need to know the other places
[14627][14673]where they take you girls.
[14698][14742]I don't understand|why you won't help me.
[14742][14769]It is always wrong to kill.
[14769][14788]It is possible the people you shoot
[14788][14830]might become better people.
[14830][14875]Maybe I can persuade you.
[14878][14918]No! It is forbidden.
[14928][14941]If killing is always wrong
[14941][14960]then I get the same points against me
[14960][14973]for a holy man as a pimp.
[14973][14987]The only choice you have here is
[14987][15013]whether you will be part|of getting him killed
[15013][15031]or the guys who had you.
[15031][15081]Okay. I will take you to them.
[15088][15105]If you won't tell me your name
[15105][15130]please tell me the month|and day of your birth.
[15130][15164]Your luck today may depend on it.
[15164][15184]You can wear colors which may help.
[15184][15219]That's not the kind of|help I'm looking for.
[15219][15258]I make my own luck.
[15295][15312]Why do you talk like a monk?
[15312][15330]A long time ago, I joined them.
[15330][15342]To escape those pimps?
[15342][15384]No, my father sold me.
[15391][15422]This is it.
[15444][15465]Why would they bring anyone here?
[15465][15485]To get rid of them.
[15485][15523]There's one right there.
[15523][15571]May Ying. She loved to sing.
[15573][15595]You misunderstood me.
[15595][15671]I want to know where else they|had you working. Working.
[15685][15715]This is one place.
[15715][15727]Wow.
[15727][15762]You look troubled.
[15762][15786]Well, I didn't think there'd be as many.
[15786][15819]Or this organized.
[15819][15864]So will we stop this and leave?
[15864][15892]You're gonna have to tell|me everything you know.
[15892][15927]Eleven more? Seems like a lot.
[15927][15942]I will take your word for it.
[15942][15982]Must be all of them.
[15984][15998]What are you doing?
[15998][16017]Chang Kao.
[16017][16038]Oh, my God.
[16038][16056]Do they know who you are?
[16056][16082]If they find out, they're gonna kill me.
[16082][16108]Hey, listen, I'm sorry to|have involved you in this.
[16108][16132]But we can walk away from this, right?
[16132][16161]Maybe they don't know who you are.
[16161][16185]I won't say anything if they come to me.
[16185][16205]I'll just keep going.
[16205][16228]I don't want you to. I'm out.
[16228][16288]The deal was all of them.|You're out when it's done!
[16288][16314]Put some ice on that shit.
[16314][16344]You hear me? I'm out!
[16344][16358]Hi.
[16358][16381]I told you to wait downstairs. Come on.
[16381][16404]And I told you I'd help.
[16404][16420]You talk back, too.
[16420][16472]It's time you learned to behave.
[16628][16651]Hm?
[16788][16813]What does a painted elephant mean?
[16813][16870]It's not paint. It's naturally white.
[16883][16900]Buddha's mother dreamed a white elephant
[16900][16914]gave her a lotus flower three nights
[16914][16939]before she gave birth to him.
[16939][16970]And so he's there for a truce.
[16970][16993]Nobody will risk hitting him.
[16993][17028]I'm happy that you have decided|to stay here and continue.
[17028][17077]Not what you would normally do, is it?
[17077][17129]It'll mix up what comes for you.
[17697][17712]Hey, Jimmy here?
[17712][17739]No, no, no, no!
[17739][17776]Okay, okay, okay.
[17858][17883]Get out.
[17883][17919]Wait, no. Not you.
[17919][17936]Did you happen to notice
[17936][17973]that the girls were mostly|naked when you came in?
[17973][17999]Are those lovely breasts any clue
[17999][18040]as to who in this city might|allow me to operate here?
[18040][18065]It's the same gang you're shooting at.
[18065][18094]Do I have to tell you what|happens if Bhun realizes
[18094][18128]that you're using my|specialized weaponry to do it?
[18128][18149]I didn't know who I was up against.
[18149][18164]Well, you do now.
[18164][18191]Does the guy that hired you|know who he's fucking with?
[18191][18204]He fired me.
[18204][18240]Oh, perfect. Well, no need to apologize.
[18240][18295]Just stay as far away from me as...
[18308][18328]Where's the gun?
[18328][18346]Why bring the bag and no gun?
[18346][18367]I needed to carry another one.
[18367][18378]That's funny.
[18378][18393]Only you're never funny.
[18393][18414]You're dark.
[18414][18448]And I don't mean skin tone.
[18448][18491]Remember what you said to|me last time I saw you?
[18491][18509]"That's twice you saved my life."
[18509][18531]No. There was a time before that.
[18531][18571]Hmmm. "I swear I'll get|this cash back to you."
[18571][18587]No, that was even further back.
[18587][18618]"Take your hands off of|me, I don't go that way."
[18618][18630]You owe me.
[18630][18652]Another life!
[18652][18716]I don't owe anybody|anything from back then.
[18773][18805]Oh, fuck me.
[18851][18916]Go see this guy. They|call him the Thai Stick.
[18916][18934]Why are you doing this?
[18934][18977]They're hurting people.
[18981][19021]"They're hurting people."
[19021][19048]Christ. Even you're smiling.
[19048][19087]And you don't smile.
[19087][19110]You owe me.
[19110][19134]Now, I've seen the cigar room.
[19134][19150]M ust be a place in that warehouse
[19150][19162]where you keep the Cubans.
[19162][19187]Yeah.
[19262][19317]The Cubans aren't in the warehouse.
[19543][19585]Welcome to my humidor.
[19661][19681]I suppose you don't need...
[19681][19699]No.
[19699][19744]Colt, M4 sniper. HK PSG 1.
[19744][19773]Anything in a bigger caliber?
[19773][19824]You want to go out with a bang?
[19923][19951]For the man who has everything.
[19951][19981]Ho... wow.
[19983][20016]Barrett 82 .50 caliber.
[20016][20028]Just what I need.
[20028][20060]It's 35 pounds with the bipod.
[20060][20087]It's a lot of weight if you|have to run the hundred.
[20087][20131]I suppose there's not much point|in you running, though, is there?
[20131][20163]Who's running?
[20163][20174]It's 10 Gs a day.
[20174][20190]And that's the "pay up front
[20190][20244]because you're going to|be dead" buddy rate.
[20244][20279]Throw in the crotch gun.
[20279][20315]I like this one.
[20334][20346]Here.
[20346][20372]Sweet.
[20375][20403]Well, happiness is a warm gun.
[20403][20429]Hey. One more thing. Right here.
[20429][20452]Ow.
[20455][20483]Ow, what the fuck are you doing?
[20483][20496]You said, "Hit me."
[20496][20532]I know. But I wasn't ready.
[20532][20554]I thought you were gonna ask me why.
[20554][20569]I know why.
[20569][20605]If you get caught, you can|tell them I robbed you.
[20605][20663]It's okay. I'm okay.|It can't get much...
[20663][20674]Versace?
[20674][20722]No. It's Paul fucking Smith!
[20738][20767]I'm back.
[20786][20824]Ahh... Jesus, Mae.
[20860][20894]I gotta think.
[21139][21168]Mae, Mae.
[21170][21205]Your knots are getting sloppy.
[21205][21223]What are you doing here?
[21223][21241]I was with the monks.
[21241][21255]I saw you leaving just now.
[21255][21270]Great.
[21270][21296]You think I had gone to|tell the gang about you?
[21296][21323]Just don't do that again.
[21323][21347]I am concerned about what we are doing.
[21347][21365]I went to talk to the monks about it.
[21365][21386]Really?
[21386][21407]Why does everything I|say make you so angry?
[21407][21435]Because you actually seem to|believe what you're saying.
[21435][21453]No point in tying you up anymore.
[21453][21493]I told you that too.
[21558][21596]She was something to you?
[21596][21626]Something to someone else.
[21626][21655]So you right wrongs? Because|it's the right thing?
[21655][21695]And because it pays.
[21696][21716]You were discussing me with them?
[21716][21748]Not just you.
[21748][21773]Whether what I do is right or wrong?
[21773][21792]There is no right or wrong.
[21792][21810]Only what is and what comes.
[21810][21837]You kill those that do great harm.
[21837][21857]The world should punish them.
[21857][21882]They're not all bad.
[21882][21928]They're good for business.
[21944][21956]Take the long way back
[21956][22006]so their ghosts cannot follow.
[22009][22039]Wait here.
[22217][22255]Okay. Too crowded.
[22334][22390]Oh, I'll definitely get back to you.
[22428][22458]Here, too.
[23371][23400]Ah, shit.
[23927][23952]Keys.
[24903][24929]Oh, my God. Mae?
[24929][24951]Come on out. Let's go.
[24951][24979]Come on.
[24989][25021]You're bleeding. You've been shot.
[25021][25035]Are you okay?
[25035][25070]Not really. I didn't|know they were in there.
[25070][25085]Maybe you can help them.
[25085][25104]Well, they can leave.
[25104][25123]Let's go. Before they come.
[25123][25152]Let's go.
[25219][25237]You can't let them do this to you.
[25237][25250]Come on, let's go!
[25250][25262]No, take us back.
[25262][25293]Yes, what are you doing?
[25293][25305]Take us back!
[25305][25328]What? Come on, you're free now.
[25328][25339]Come.
[25339][25348]It's okay.
[25348][25361]Come with me now.
[25361][25378]You're free to go now.
[25378][25392]No!
[25392][25427]They'll find us. They'll kill us!
[25427][25495]It's because of the drugs.|They need to go back.
[25609][25633]What were you doing in there?
[25633][25656]They put us in the|truck when you attacked.
[25656][25690]Not the truck! What were|you doing in the house?
[25690][25715]Fuck.
[25731][25765]I went to tell them if they|would stop what they are doing
[25765][25787]you would stop killing them.
[25787][25840]We shouldn't have left the girls.
[25848][25871]That's not what I do.
[25871][25890]Even if they get out
[25890][25949]what's been done to them|is who they are now.
[25949][25989]What do you keep staring at?
[25989][26019]You crazy.
[26154][26189]Don't touch it.
[26806][26845]Well, I hope you got the|prick who stole this.
[26845][26862]You were robbed?
[26862][26902]Yes. Surprised him at my warehouse|yesterday on his way out.
[26902][26925]So, did you get a good look?
[26925][26961]For as long as it took|for him to break my nose.
[26961][26976]White boy, you know
[26976][26997]about my height but, uh, packing pounds.
[26997][27010]Blond hair. Goatee.
[27010][27035]Face like a smacked ass.
[27035][27068]Hey, I thought I was protected.
[27068][27097]They hit me, they hit you. Right?
[27097][27110]Ah!
[27110][27139]You recall any details,|you will let us know.
[27139][27182]Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
[27372][27400]I will take care of you.
[27400][27413]Mae?
[27413][27465]I will love you in so many ways.
[27468][27516]Touch you in so many places.
[27543][27585]Make you feel so good.
[27640][27676]You are so cold.
[27719][27737]Who took the bullet out?
[27737][27756]It went right through.
[27756][27781]Looks like you have|attracted a few bad spirits.
[27781][27845]Ah, here you go talking|that nonsense again.
[27852][27871]Khamin chan and other herbs
[27871][27895]and holy ash from a sacrificial fire.
[27895][27907]It will protect you.
[27907][27926]Oh, no.
[27926][27994]The monks do not know what|you do, so they help.
[27994][28023]I feel like I'm losing my mind.
[28023][28069]Maybe that's a good thing.
[28069][28098]Maybe better to let you bleed to death.
[28098][28167]It would be easier for|you to die and start over.
[28182][28216]Why are you looking at me that way?
[28216][28250]Oh, I'm just wondering|if I'm still dreaming.
[28250][28274]Or maybe you were awake.
[28274][28315]And are now dreaming.
[28335][28396]I have no idea what|you're talking about.
[28445][28510]You look like you're|being followed, English.
[28552][28580]Got you.
[28794][28813]Oh, no.
[28813][28846]Not you again. Upstairs.
[28846][28871]Come on.
[28871][28889]I got your gun.
[28889][28902]Yeah. One of them.
[28902][28927]They found my Barrett so|they're all over out there.
[28927][28938]Not anymore.
[28938][28955]Oh, great.
[28955][28988]So with that, you just|confirmed my involvement.
[28988][29002]Don't answer it.
[29002][29025]Bastards can track that as|good as the government.
[29025][29065]It's not mine. I took it off one|of the guys outside your place.
[29065][29105]Then they're checking in. Come on.
[29105][29126]We're taking the high ground.
[29126][29147]I need something for up close.
[29147][29172]Another gun?
[29172][29192]And you lied about bringing|back the last one.
[29192][29216]Right. And?
[29216][29249]No. No. No way. No. Not happening.
[29249][29280]No, no, no.
[29332][29360]Because I'm dead. Put your boss on.
[29360][29402]You want to say hello?
[29435][29461]Now am I getting what I want?
[29461][29474]What is it you want?
[29474][29490]Not you. Hold on.
[29490][29515]Well?
[29523][29543]I'll give you some time|to think about it.
[29543][29559]I'm back.
[29559][29598]We should meet. Come|to some understanding.
[29598][29626]I will never have any|understanding of what you do.
[29626][29641]Hm.
[29641][29674]You understand that most of these girls
[29674][29702]are sold by their own parents?
[29702][29739]To pay off debt, or just abandoned?
[29739][29764]That we find a place for them
[29764][29811]and for doing so take some small profit
[29811][29873]from something they'll give away|or trade for less on their own.
[29873][29894]You understand we give
[29894][29928]what little they have to offer value?
[29928][29941]You give bullets value.
[29941][29958]Now you want to give me what I want
[29958][30010]or you want to talk to the boss?
[30149][30178]I'm glad you find this so amusing.
[30178][30190]Get out.
[30190][30223]Just get out.
[30235][30253]I have to keep going.
[30253][30272]You're not gonna shoot me.
[30272][30287]I might as well.
[30287][30313]You're as good as dead|unless I get another gun.
[30313][30330]Now give me another gun
[30330][30399]so there won't be anybody|left to come after you.
[30408][30426]Cobray Street Sweeper.
[30426][30458]I'll take this.
[30458][30490]It's a thousand a day.
[30490][30520]You know, you're always out there.
[30520][30594]When did you start believing|that you can't be killed?
[30613][30643]I haven't.
[30710][30754]Do you like what you do?
[30781][30805]I do it without remorse.
[30805][30841]I cast no shadow about it.
[30841][30880]I ntent is most important|for future well-being.
[30880][30897]I ntent makes karma.
[30897][30917]What will you do with|the money you are paid?
[30917][30941]You know, all this is just|what you've come up with
[30941][30971]to fool yourself into|some kind of happiness.
[30971][30989]And what do you use to fool yourself?
[30989][31033]It doesn't get any more|real than what I do.
[31033][31062]You do not know as much|as you think you do.
[31062][31079]Starting from who you are
[31079][31101]all the way to the man|in that hotel room.
[31101][31122]What do you know about him?
[31122][31140]You've seen him before?
[31140][31163]Hm.
[31521][31545]You are crazy, man.
[31545][31563]I told you to stop killing them.
[31563][31615]You owe me. Ten o'clock.|Same hotel room.
[31615][31676]Hey, mister. How much|longer you waiting?
[31765][31796]Follow him.
[32193][32211]Hey, can I help you?
[32211][32230]Uh, yes.
[32230][32288]Twelve and, uh, fifteen are available.
[32300][32314]Twelve.
[32314][32333]She'd be my choice. Youngest.
[32333][32349]But don't let her age fool you.
[32349][32368]Down the hall. Take a left.
[32368][32414]Up the stairs. Green door.
[32712][32739]What can I do for you?
[32739][32761]Whatever you want, big man.
[32761][32801]Okay. Sit. Sit... sit down.
[32801][32836]You know the man with the big ruby ring?
[32836][32861]Where is he?
[32861][32880]I will do whatever you want.
[32880][32929]Is he the boss or a customer?
[32932][32956]There are many men who come.
[32956][32984]Where is his office?
[32984][33007]Where is his office?
[33007][33053]He is upstairs. Top floor.
[34288][34301]I want him alive.
[34301][34327]Alive.
[34721][34742]Wait. Coming out.
[34742][34773]Coming out.
[34775][34809]I can explain.
[34845][34859]Empty it.
[34859][34870]The safe!
[34870][34878]Okay.
[34878][34891]I wasn't told you were a crook.
[34891][34918]I'm not.
[34918][34946]You're now paying for the|numbers I just racked up here.
[34946][34962]What's this really about?
[34962][34985]Would you have gone at the|whole gang if I'd told you?
[34985][34999]So what gang are you?
[34999][35019]Am I a way of making|war with the Chang Kao
[35019][35041]without you losing men?
[35041][35050]Hmm?
[35050][35089]Do you really care?
[35093][35106]Huh?
[35106][35126]I wanted you alive
[35126][35145]so I could double everything.
[35145][35182]For one more man.
[35189][35222]Advisor Bhun.
[35227][35244]Why him and not the boss?
[35244][35283]The old man is sick. He'll be dead soon.
[35283][35300]You're thinking about it.
[35300][35330]'Cause if you weren't,|I'd already be dead.
[35330][35348]Why are you looking at me like that?
[35348][35375]Does any of it really|matter why you're doing it?
[35375][35413]Does it have anything to do with|my story of, of the daughter?
[35413][35461]Another million for one man.
[35855][35914]Try and focus on my neck and shoulders.
[35915][35927]Too much stress.
[35927][35942]Oh, you have no idea.
[35942][35969]But why do you say that|like it's a good thing?
[35969][35981]I want his name.
[35981][35995]And I want to know
[35995][36051]who needed me in my underwear for this?
[36051][36069]What's his name?
[36069][36081]Puddin' Thame.
[36081][36092]Ask me again
[36092][36135]I'll tell you the same.
[36172][36189]Oh, fuck.
[36189][36201]His name?
[36201][36248]You're pissing in the wind.
[36254][36274]Why do you work against us?
[36274][36291]You are in the same business.
[36291][36322]No, the girls that work for me...
[36322][36354]have filled out an application.
[36354][36413]They enjoy their work. They're artists.
[36454][36479]All right! All right! I'll tell you.
[36479][36513]I'll tell you.
[36534][36554]Not because it hurts.
[36554][36574]But because
[36574][36602]he... wouldn't care.
[36602][36620]It's Church.
[36620][36642]Curtie Church.
[36642][36680]And who would want someone with|the skills of Curtie Church here?
[36680][36713]I don't know.
[36738][36751]Where is he?
[36751][36787]I don't know that.
[36787][36804]Who is he working for?
[36804][36829]I don't know that either!
[36829][36895]Do you think he'd be|stupid enough to tell me?
[37008][37028]Why do you help him against us?
[37028][37055]Because I'm more afraid of him...
[37055][37088]than I am of you. You understand?
[37088][37148]And you haven't even pissed him off yet.
[37161][37230]What he's doing to you is|death taking a holiday.
[37265][37305]You're already dead.
[40128][40180]You don't sleep so well, do you?
[40217][40285]I didn't do anything bad|enough to deserve this.
[40295][40323]Will you go out again tonight?
[40323][40346]No.
[40363][40401]No, I'm done here.
[41701][41716]Going to the toilet.
[41716][41780]You want to watch, you|handle the paperwork.
[41878][41897]I told them who you are.
[41897][41916]For real this time.
[41916][41930]And not because they broke me.
[41930][41962]But because now you have|no choice but to run.
[41962][41991]Already decided I'm out. What about you?
[41991][42015]I'll figure something out.
[42015][42037]But you're willing to do that?
[42037][42069]Listen, I need one last thing.|I need to set a girl up.
[42069][42146]Maybe 14. Adoption and private|school. How much for that?
[42150][42190]Don't know. Ten Gs will|buy a family and a history.
[42190][42217]Another 20 will pay her|way till she graduates.
[42217][42231]Cool. Done.
[42231][42246]I told her to wait at the Lotus Temple.
[42246][42266]Your half of the money's|there, and your guns.
[42266][42282]Hey! Hey! What are you doing in there?
[42282][42340]I can't concentrate in|here if you're listening.
[42340][42375]I guess I'll, uh, you know,|see you down the road.
[42375][42411]Thanks, English.
[42412][42451]Hey! Hey! Let's go.
[42508][42526]Crap, oh, that feels good.
[42526][42542]Oh, here's an idea.
[42542][42553]Why don't you guys
[42553][42573]just go out of the room,
[42573][42586]one at a time come back in,
[42586][42616]and we'll see who's made of what, huh?
[42616][42661]I'll take you up on that.
[42748][42771]Just spoke to him.
[42771][42783]Where is he?
[42783][42812]Good news. He's going to disappear.
[42812][42839]And you'll be your father's|son again in no time.
[42839][42853]We're good.
[42853][42876]You gave his name, and|we're gonna find him.
[42876][42904]What do you mean? No. No, no,|you don't have to do that.
[42904][42924]You know he went too far.
[42924][42987]I need his head now to|assure the position.
[43203][43239]This is for you.
[43275][43317]No one ever gave me...
[43460][43471]Thank you.
[43471][43506]You're welcome.
[43509][43547]My name is Curtie.
[43547][43581]Curtie Church.
[43606][43634]Like hurt? Only friendlier?
[43634][43655]No, like Curtis.
[43655][43683]Only misspelled on my birth certificate.
[43683][43698]It was meant to be.
[43698][43711]And April second...
[43711][43758]month and date of my birth.
[43782][43836]Today's Friday, so wear|blue for luck today.
[43836][43865]Tomorrow wear pink.
[43865][43896]Ooh. Tomorrow may be|a bad day for me then.
[43896][43922]You can wear it underneath.
[43922][43972]That could make it even worse.
[44043][44110]Listen, I want to thank you|for taking an interest in me.
[44110][44169]You're wrong. I'm just doing it for me.
[44236][44286]You're leaving me, aren't you?
[44350][44375]I have someone coming for you
[44375][44400]who will help you.
[44400][44462]You have to promise me|you will wait here. Hmm?
[44462][44490]Promise?
[44508][44523]Okay.
[44523][44547]Hmm.
[44944][44959]Yeah, Jimmy?
[44959][44978]I was hoping I'd catch you.
[44978][44999]Yeah, the flight's just about to leave.
[44999][45023]At the airport already, huh?
[45023][45061]I don't blame you. Too many ghosts.
[45061][45077]Did you get your money?
[45077][45109]Yeah. It's too much. But,|uh, thanks for that.
[45109][45129]The reason I'm calling is, um
[45129][45159]your girl, she wasn't there.
[45159][45195]I mpossible. She wouldn't|leave. Did you wait?
[45195][45207]I waited.
[45207][45224]Sorry, Church.
[45224][45251]Thanks.
[45266][45324]Well, I hope this confirms my loyalty.
[45571][45604]Fucking Jimmy.
[45604][45642]Come on! Let's go!
[47440][47481]Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
[47481][47506]Wait.
[47531][47547]Oh, English.
[47547][47573]How many times did I tell you to leave?
[47573][47582]Shoot the son of a bitch.
[47582][47604]Are you insane? No!
[47604][47655]Okay. Couple million dollars|and your life for the girls.
[47655][47673]Who paid you the money to do this?
[47673][47693]Ask him.
[47693][47709]We're gonna talk to this devil
[47709][47727]while he holds a gun|to my father's head?
[47727][47761]Hey, hey. Let this son|of the bitch speak.
[47761][47808]No, it's too late for that.
[47811][47822]Don't move.
[47822][47857]Hold your fire.
[47891][47927]Changed my mind.
[47934][47963]Was it my son who arranged this?
[47963][48025]Was he trying to kill|the secret with you?
[48037][48076]Bring the girls in.
[48249][48268]There's one missing.
[48268][48301]Where's the one you took|from the temple? Mae.
[48301][48350]There was no one there except the monks.
[48350][48379]I don't remember any Mae.
[48379][48418]I'll find you, Mae.
[48473][48523]Mae. Here. That's Mae for you.
[48535][48564]Oh, that Mae.
[48564][48582]Oh, yes. That Mae.
[48582][48597]You're insane.
[48597][48611]What are you talking about?
[48611][48630]I remember her.
[48630][48648]She was special.
[48648][48668]First girl that I brought in.
[48668][48713]And that's me beside her.
[48722][48760]Some 30 years ago.
[48771][48791]It's not a coincidence.
[48791][48834]It was meant to be that I find you.
[48834][48878]Church. What's going on?
[48879][48924]Do we have a deal on the others?
[48924][48935]I want to thank you for
[48935][48952]taking an interest in me.
[48952][48974]I am just doing it for me.
[48974][48993]Do we have a deal?
[48993][49029]It's in the car.
[49130][49171]I will take care of you.
[49171][49195]Mae?
[49195][49208]Mae?
[49208][49221]Drive!
[49221][49238]You crazy.
[49238][49270]You crazy...
[49292][49321]Put the guns down.
[49321][49357]And let them go.
[49365][49380]So you right wrongs
[49380][49402]because it's the right thing?
[49402][49441]I'm happy that you have decided|to stay here and continue.
[49441][49459]We shouldn't have left the girls.
[49459][49503]Maybe you can help them.
[49527][49560]Get your bag.
[49642][49663]It was all about bringing you
[49663][49695]to a place of understanding.
[49695][49743]My voice was there to|help you all along.
[49743][49762]It was about bringing|you to the decision
[49762][49818]to stay here and right these wrongs.
[50350][50420]So I guess, uh, one of those|spirits really found you.
[50420][50431]Guess that's a good thing.
[50431][50455]Before you were losing your mind.
[50455][50486]English. Stop the truck.
[50486][50507]English...
[50507][50550]Please, stop the truck.
[50794][50818]I have to go back.
[50818][50865]I'll see to it that they get help.
[50865][50899]Thanks, buddy.
[50988][51022]I can now be with you, Curtie Church.
[51022][51045]And you can be with me.
[51045][51069]With the darkness which you offer.
[51069][51094]And which my light needs to shine.
[51094][51132]It was the initiation of a monk.
[51132][51161]A monk...
Who are you?
What is this?
Your Majesty, we caught him up in a fishing net. A fishing net.
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...
We believe he's found a...
Ponce de Leon.
Says he found
Ponce de Leon's ship.
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,
Ponce de Leon died
200 years ago.
Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he?
The Fountain of Youth.
How soon can you sail?
With the tide.
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!
Pirate puppets!
Hurry, papa, or we'll miss the hanging!
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.
Pirate hanging today!
Come on. Up you get.
Move along, pirate.
Or should I say "Captain Pirate"?
Come on.
Come on! Up you go.
Quiet! Order!
Quiet!
Now appearing before the court, the notorious and infamous pirate, pillager,
- and highwayman...
- Quiet! captain Jack Sparrow!
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!
Presiding over these trials, all rise and attend, the Right Honorable Justice Smith!
My dear sir.
Quiet!
Now... what do we have here?
Jack?
Shut up!
I don't recognize him.
Not necessary. You were saying?
Jack Sparrow is not my name.
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.
Is that so?
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would be happy to identify to the court
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense, unless you want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal.
The prisoner claims of being innocent to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?
No trial? But aren't we here to examine the evidence...
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.
Hang 'im! String 'im up!
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!
Shut it.
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which you've been found guilty of is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.
I hereby commute your sentence, and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder of your miserable, moribund, mutton-chopped life.
- What?!
- Hang 'im!
- Hang 'im!
- There.
- Balderdash!
- String 'im up! Hang 'im high!
Means shall be arranged to transport this prisoner to the Tower of London.
Thanks very much.
Ta.
Come on. Get up there.
Get up!
Hell's teeth.
Now, we're both headed for prison.
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.
Tonight, we make the coast.
Then, it's just a matter of finding a ship.
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.
I arrived in London Town just this morning to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows.
Seeing as how you're still alive,
I'd say it's all been very successful thus far.
What happened to you, Gibbs?
I thought you were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged.
Aye. But I always listened like a thief for news of the Black Pearl...
Nobody's seen where she might next make port.
Then, I hear a rumor:
Jack Sparrow's in London with a ship and lookin' for a crew.
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.
Fact is, you're signin' up men tonight.
Pub called
"The Captain's Daughter".
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd, but, then, you've never been the most predictable of sorts.
Tell me something.
There is another Jack Sparrow out there, sullying my good name?
- An impostor.
- Indeed.
- But... an impostor with a ship.
- And in need of a crew.
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.
What about you, Jack?
Last I heard, you were hell-bent to find the Fountain of Youth.
Any luck?
Circumstances arose and forced a compelling insight regarding discretion and valour.
- Meaning... you gave up.
- I did not.
I'm just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.
I shall taste those waters, master Gibbs. Mark my words.
Oh! Short trip.
All part of the plan, yes?
No.
You are... Jack Sparrow...
There should be a "captain" in there somewhere.
I have heard of you.
And you know who I am.
Face is familiar.
Have I... threatened you before?
You are in the presence of
George Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Nunburg,
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire,
King of Great Britain and Ireland, and of you.
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed you have come to London to procure a crew for your ship.
Vicious rumor. Not true.
Then you lied to me when you told me you were Jack Sparrow.
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm not here to procure a crew.
That is... someone else.
Ah... Someone else named Jack Sparrow.
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.
Find the proper one and dispose of this impostor.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a minute.
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.
And I am in London.
To procure a crew.
To undertake a voyage
- to the Fountain...
- What?
Will someone please remove these infernal chains?
Come, come.
We know you're in possession of a map.
So, confiscate the map, and to the gallows with him!
Have you a map?
- No.
- Where is it?
The truth? I lost it.
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.
The Spanish have located the Fountain of Youth.
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch, a Catholic, gain eternal life!
You do know the way to the Fountain?
Of course I do.
Look at me.
You could guide an expedition. you will be providing, then, a ship...
- and a crew?
- And a captain.
Afternoon, sire.
If I may be so bold, why is that man not in chains?
He must be manacled at once.
At the center of my palace?
Hardly.
Hector.
How nice to see a fellow pirate make good of himself.
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.
On a sanctioned mission under the authority and protection of the Crown.
As may be, but first... what has become of my beloved Pearl?
I lost the Pearl. As I lost my leg.
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.
I defended her mightily enough, but she be sunk nonetheless.
If that ship be sunk properly, you should be sunk with it.
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry, the Spanish outdistance us.
I have every confidence you will prevail and be rewarded with the high station you so desire.
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.
Jack, our sands be all but run.
Where's the harm in joinin' the winnin' side?
And you do meet a nicer class of person.
I understand everything.
Except that wig.
He's getting away!
Stop him!
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!
Come down!
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.
Guards! Guards!
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!
Find him!
Finders keepers!
There!
Is that it?
Stop that carriage!
Head him off!
Out of the way!
Stop that pirate!
Move out of the way!
Stop that man!
Don't let him get away!
Fire!
He's getting away!
After 'im! Stop 'im!
After 'im!
Filthy pirate.
Hello, Jackie.
Hello, dad.
I heard you're puttin' together a crew.
If enough people keep saying it, it must be true.
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.
Have you been there?
Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.
There'll be items required for the profane ritual.
Two chalices.
- On the map, there was a chalice.
- Two. Silver.
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You'll need both.
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.
Find out every detail before you set sail.
Oh, set sail. Love to.
But for that, I may need a ship.
Those folk, over there, they have a ship.
They're signin' up sailors right now.
And one last thing, Jackie.
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.
I hear you be recruiting a crew.
Aye. That is,
Jack Sparrow be puttin' together a modest venture.
You got some nerve, ain't ya?
Turnin' up here dressed like that?
What are you, some kind of impostor?
Have you any idea who I am, mate?
Oi, muckers!
There's a bloke here what's forgotten his own name!
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?
Oi, who's next?
Bring us some more of those ones.
Yeah, make it four.
You've stolen me, and I'm here to take meself back.
Stop doing that.
Only one person alive knows that move.
Always wanted to do that.
Hello, Angelica.
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?
I think I almost killed you once or twice there.
I'm touched at this most sincerest form of flattery.
But why?
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.
That is not a compliment.
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions.
Look, Sparrow. As long as my sailors get their money, they're willing to put up with any number of peculiarities.
Ah!... There is one peculiarity with which I will not put up with.
I will be impersonated as "captain". Nothing less.
Well, for that, you need a ship, and, as it turns out, I have one.
I could use a ship.
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.
There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days.
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.
You still have a few usable years left.
Ah... Always so charming.
You didn't answer me.
Aye. Ah, regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows of an officious-looking nature.
Wretched pirates!
Find 'em! Maggots!
Friends of yours?
I may have unintentionally slighted some king or other.
Open it!
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?
Yes.
Open this door, in the name of His Majesty.
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.
I was innocent of the ways of men.
You demonstrated a lot of technique for someone I supposedly corrupted.
Imminent danger.
Here, now, milady!
Open it!
I was ready to take my vows.
And you...
What were you doing in a Spanish convent, anyway?
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.
- There he is!
- Over there!
We are at a disadvantage.
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be, but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,
I am captain Jack Sparrow.
How can you say I used you?
- You know... exactly... how.
- I know, but how can you say it?
- So, what is it?
- What is what?
About the Fountain.
What do you know?
You don't happen to be in possession of two silver chalices, circa Ponce de Leon?
- No.
- Ha, thought not.
- Why?
- I hear stories...
Rumors...
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.
Yes, I am.
What is it?
What is required?
A mermaid, Jack.
There's been a mistake.
It's a life sentence... not death. Life!
- Barbossa!
- Thank you, gentlemen.
I trust you can tie a noose.
That's a hard thing, forcin' a man to twist his own hangin' rope.
You must lie in your bed the way you made it.
What's happened to you?
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.
The HMS Providence sets sail at first light.
If you do not care to watch it hangin' here dead, with a mouth full of flies... speak now.
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?
Is that where Jack be headed?
Have you anything you can offer me, Gibbs?
Anything at all?
Upon me naked word, you'll not see the dawn.
Hand it over.
- You fool!
- I had just enough time to study those infernal circles.
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy, master Gibbs.
- Show a leg, sailor!
- Aye, sir.
What?
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea, no idea what, when, wherefore or why.
No memory of the night afore, whence he signed up and drank away all 'is bonus money.
No, no, no.
You don't understand, mate.
I'm captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.
Scrum.
Get your elbows in!
Why is there a glass coffin?
Do I look like a man in charge?
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, captain Sparrow, sir.
I be right honored to welcome you aboard our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.
Blackbeard.
Work!
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.
- Eh?
- Zombiefied.
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.
Makes 'em more compliant.
And perpetually ill-tempered.
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.
Pull! Pull! Pull!
Five days underway, at least.
Aye. You can tell that by the smell of the sea?
Smell of the crew.
Oi. What did that poor sod do?
And how can I make sure to not?
Him? Churchly fellow.
Always goin' on about the Lord Almighty.
- Bible-thumper on this ship?
- A missionary is his story.
What I heard was he got captured in a raid.
Rest o' the ship got killed, but not 'im.
First mate wouldn't let it happen on account of his premier standing with the Lord.
A first mate stickin' her neck... for some prisoner.
- That... you don't see.
- "Her"? First mate is a "her"?
Back to work!
Steady as she goes.
You are a ruthless, soulless, cross-grained cur.
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship, upon which I am now imprisoned.
We can do this, Jack.
The Fountain of Youth, like you always wanted.
Blackbeard. Edward Teach, the pirate all pirates fear.
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.
Maybe to his own daughter?
Daughter as in... beget by?
Long-lost. Recently found.
Who loves her dear papa with all her soul.
- He bought that?
- I sold that.
Then, it's the Fountain of Youth for him, or him and you... not you and me.
No, Jack, that's the best part.
He will be dead.
Ah... You'll be handling that part yourself, then?
There is a prophecy.
Maybe you don't believe in the supernatural.
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.
The prophecy... is this:
Blackbeard will meet his death within a fortnight at the hands of a one-legged man.
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.
Oh, master Gibbs, short we are a map.
Perhaps you'd be so kind as to provide us an heading.
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.
Nay. We be privateers, not pirates, master Gibbs.
And in the King's name, we behave as such.
Aye... captain.
- Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?
- Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.
The Spaniard.
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.
Steady!
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.
Sir. Orders, sir?
He never so much as turned his head.
The Fountain is the prize.
It appears we be not even worth the time it'd take to sink us.
And now, we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!
All hands, more sail!
Ride hard between wind and tide!
The topic, gentlemen... is mutiny.
Mutiny most foul.
Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.
And a lady, at that.
And mention was failed to be made of this uncanny crew.
Make my toes curl, they do.
I got 'em. All of them.
- Well done.
- Good lad.
On to it, then. Blackbeard.
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.
That's right, mostly to his cabin.
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.
He must come out sometime.
Not really, no.
Any of you sail with him before?
- No, no.
- I've never.
Definitely not.
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.
Stays to his cabin, no one sailed with him, no one's seen him...
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.
No, no, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge, right enough.
How do you know?
I've seen the name, on the back o' the ship.
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees... you have been monstrously deceived.
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.
You've nay been informed of a destination.
Death lies before us as we sail... for the Fountain of Youth.
It would be a sorry plight, mates.
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless... we take the ship.
We take the ship, then. Now!
Go on, then.
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!
Get up! Off your backside!
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!
Help me! Fight!
Jack.
If this is a dream, you can keep the sword and boots on.
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.
No, it's not!
I thought I should give you fair warning, we're taking the ship.
Nothing personal.
Think you might be better off if you just... stay out of it.
Boggit.
Wretch!
You're either with us or against us!
I'm not with you, neither am I against you!
Can he do that?
He's religious.
I believe it's required.
Fight to the bitter end, you cack-handed deck apes!
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!
The ship is ours!
Gentlemen.
I be placed in a bewilderment.
There I were... resting, and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.
Sailors abandon their posts without orders, without leave.
Men before the mast... taking the ship for themselves.
What be that, first mate?
- Mutiny, captain.
- Again?
- Mutiny!
- Aye.
Mutiny.
And what fate befalls mutineers?
Now, we know the answer to that, do we not?
Mutineers hang!
Captain,
I wish to report a mutiny.
- I can name fingers and point names.
- No need, Mr. Sparrow.
They are sheep.
You, their shepherd.
Have I mentioned, sir, what a lovely daughter you have?
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.
Remember, father.
We need him.
If I don't kill a man every now and then,
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!
Hm?
They do not forget.
Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are.
A coward, no matter how many you slay.
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.
You dare not walk the path of righteousness, the way of the light.
No, sir. The truth is, it be much simpler than all that.
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.
I might have to kill you too, catechist.
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.
Father, I beg you.
There I be again, forgetting why the missionary is here.
My daughter... fears for my soul, or what's left of it.
You truly wish to save me, my child?
- Every soul can be saved.
- Be that true, young cleric?
Yes. Though you I see as a bit of a long shot.
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul on this hell-bound vessel.
You disarm me with your faith.
Eight bells!
Which of you unfortunate souls stood watch?
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.
You?
Aye.
Aye.
The cook.
Perfect. Lower the longboat!
Bring her about!
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.
Our laws allow the captain to show leniency.
I've given this man a chance to determine his fate, a gift not afforded to all.
Oh, you, now.
Chance to show the worth of your prayers.
Pray he be delivered from... evil?
Course made!
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...
You know when
I feel closest to our Maker?
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.
That's when the true design of this world is revealed.
And I see it revealed when, in times of hardship and tragedy, kindness and compassion are shown to those in need.
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yes?
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!
I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever, so, if your heart is set, you may drop me off anywhere you like.
That'll be all, quartermaster.
Your words surround you like fog and make you hard to see.
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam three times around your ship, then climbed back onboard.
And here you are, running scared.
- Scared...
- To the Fountain.
The quartermaster sees things before they happen.
He has foreseen my death, and so the fates have spoken.
The threads of destiny woven.
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate, mate.
- And you?
- Me?
I'm skeptical of predicting any future... which includes me.
It'd be foolish to battle fate, but I'd be tempted... to cheat it.
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.
That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised.
Mutiny served me well.
It gained me an audience with you.
- Oh.
- Aye.
To warn you.
Regarding your first mate, who pretends to be persons she is not.
Do tell.
She is not your daughter.
You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood?
Sir... the woman is consummate in the art of deception.
I know. As I mostly unwittingly set her on her wicked path.
Though I cannot claim credit for her existing abundance of natural talent.
Angelica.
My beloved daughter, the one true good thing
I have done in this life, and you claim to be the one who corrupted her?
Sir, what she is is pure evil.
More to be feared than a wild beast.
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.
- Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...
- Father!
Sweetness!
No need to hurt him, father.
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?
You see? Even now, she attends to your welfare, giving lie to the claims you make of her.
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?
Put another way.
If I... do not make it to the Fountain in time... neither... will you.
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts straight away then, shall I?
Sir.
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir, among the crew, as to our destination.
Shut your trap and make way.
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect... sir.
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.
- Whitecap Bay.
- Aye, Whitecap Bay.
And every worthless seaman fears the name, and rightly so, though few know why or dare to ask.
Be the stories true?
Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs, or forever leave it to the wider fields of fancy.
- Mermaids, cap'n.
- Aye. Mermaids.
Sea ghouls, devil fish, dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.
Mermaid waters, that be our path.
Cling to your soul, Gibbs, as mermaids be given to take the rest... to the bone.
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage, or be ready to purpose your fear!
Save yourselves!
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.
- Come about.
- Nay!
Gentlemen... I shall not ask any more of any man than what that man can deliver, but I do ask this: Are we not King's men?
Aye.
- On the King's mission?
- Aye.
I did not note any fear in the eyes of the Spanish as they passed us by.
- Are we not King's men?
- Aye!
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!
Hola!
Come. Little drink?
Wine, music, candlelight.
I think we've travelled down this road before, Jack.
Yes, we have.
I remember it well.
Winding, twisting and turning, gyrating, writhing...
Incessant writhing...
Do you recall Saint Dominique?
La Martinique.
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.
Either or.
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.
Was I the first?
I've often wondered.
You can be so charming when you want something, Jack.
The trick is finding out what.
Truth, then, is it?
Blackbeard has served his purpose.
You and I can go to the Fountain together, where we shall bathe one another in equal shares of fame and other assorted debaucheries.
And I'll tell you the ritual of the Fountain.
Yes. The profane ritual.
Can I trust you, Jack?
- I need you on me side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.
You and I... are as thick as thieves, love.
Tell me the rules.
Water... from the Fountain of Youth.
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.
With these items...
- Yes?
- With these items, you may take all the years of life from another, Jack.
- Eh?
- You know what that means.
We cannot go alone, you and I.
The ritual requires a victim.
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.
I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened.
But there is something onboard you do want.
What about Blackbeard?
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.
He keeps each ship as a prize.
You help me... and I promise you your pick.
Though I think I know the one you will choose.
The Black Pearl in a bottle?
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?
He's even more annoying in miniature.
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.
What about the one-legged man?
I need years, Jack.
Not for me. For my father.
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.
- You've fallen for your own con, love.
- No, he is my father.
The lies I told you were not lies.
You lied to me by telling me the truth?
- Yes.
- That's very good.
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.
Mm, of course I will.
So, will you not give up this quest?
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard... he is evil, and he will kill you given the chance.
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set the limits on redemption?
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.
And you are en route to getting yourself killed, and I'm not inclined to stand by and watch.
Whitecap Bay!
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!
Lay 'em out flat!
No tangles. Make 'em look pretty for our dainty guests.
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.
Come!
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.
Let's not get our hopes up.
The old moon in the arms of the new one.
First of the summer.
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.
There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour, you mark my words.
And we're the bait.
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid protects a sailor from drowning.
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son, and lovely as a dream of heaven.
But when it comes time to churn butter, so to speak, they snatch a sailor out of a boat or off the deck of a ship, have their way, and then the sailors are pulled to bottom and drowned and eaten.
Or, sometimes, the other way around.
- Sing.
- What?
They like to hear singing.
Louder.
Lord save me.
Man, look. Look there.
- You'll scare her off!
- Aye, and good riddance!
Can you talk?
Yes.
You're beautiful.
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.
Are you my jolly sailor bold?
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!
Boys! There ain't much been given to me in my brief, miserable life, there's the truth in it.
But, by God, I'll have it said that Scrum 'ad 'imself a kiss from a proper mermaid!
Out upon it! It has begun!
Light 'em up!
Muster your courage!
Drive 'em to shore!
Nets into the water!
Quickly!
Retreat, all, to land!
For your lives!
Retreat, I say!
Cowards! Back in the water!
There be no refuge on land!
On my word!
Come on!
We got one!
I'm in love!
Check the wounded!
See if you can find one mermaid still alive!
Come, give a hand!
Well done, sailor.
Did everyone see that?
Because I will not be doing it again.
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.
- Lord! Is that...?
- Mermaid.
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.
Ever walk on the beach, look back and see your footsteps in the sand?
It's like that, except the footsteps lie before me.
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.
We must hasten.
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a head'n'.
- But, sir, the men...
- They be dead already.
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?
Well, I hear nothing but seagulls nestin'.
What is it that you hear,
Mr. Groves?
Seagulls... nesting.
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?
My God!
Your head or my headin'.
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.
All hands, forward!
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?
Best you not know the exact whereabouts of my ship.
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.
What I want first... is Ponce De Leon's ship.
Why is it we've got to bring her along?
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.
What is the ritual again?
Water from the Fountain and a mermaid's tear?
And two silver chalices.
One cup with a tear, one without.
So, one with a tear and water in both...
- Quite complicated, is it not?
- Both get water. One gets a tear.
The person who drinks the water with the tear gets all the years of life from the other.
How many years?
All the years that they have lived, and they could have lived, if fate had been... kinder.
Clergyman.
On the off chance that this does not go well for me,
I would like it noted, here and now, that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must, so that I may be welcomed into that place where all the goody-goodies get to go. Savvy?
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.
I was thinking more of an as-needed basis.
Quartermaster!
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!
- She has water.
- She needs air!
- Open this.
- She will escape.
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.
See?
Onward!
Just as I thought.
Not this way!
This is the way, isn't it?
'Course it is, but we should go around to the east.
That would take us out of the path of the chalices.
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.
You're the one who insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid.
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.
- You would know.
- Someone must go.
You mean split up?
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.
Sparrow? What makes you think he will come back?
Yes, what makes you think he will come back?
We cannot trust him, father.
I'll go.
She'll go.
How much farther to the Fountain?
I'm running out of time.
About a day's march north, following that river, you'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.
You will go.
I was sure it would come to this.
You know that feeling you get sometimes when you're standing in a high place?
Sudden urge to jump?
I don't have it.
- I need those chalices.
- Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.
You will go. You will return... or I will kill her.
You won't kill your own daughter.
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols, remove the shot from all but two, but do not tell me which two.
- You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.
- Oh...
No.
No.
- Yes.
- You're sure?
'Course I am.
Again.
Please, they're not even loaded.
Again.
If you're so keen on killing her,
- why don't you just let her jump?
- What?!
If you jump... and die... then she will have her chance.
Again.
Oi...
If I jump... will I survive?
The doll.
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!
Wet. Wet again.
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.
Well played, father.
You knew which guns were loaded, right?
Of course, my love.
- Be nice to have a map about now.
- Or a ship.
Stop! Hold very still.
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.
What? What be wrong with an older man havin' a hobby?
What are you stoppin' for, eh?
Push on!
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.
Push on!
Fortune continues to favour us.
The Santiago.
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.
There's no one there.
Right, then.
We must not stop.
You will walk.
I cannot.
Walk or die.
Put your arms around me.
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.
Hold here till I say!
Such beauty.
Surely you're one of
God's own creations, and not a descendant of those dark creatures who found no refuge on the Ark.
Such beauty... and yet deadly.
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.
No. You are different.
- Different?
- Are you not? You protect.
Did you...?
You pushed me down out of the way.
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.
She has a name!
Pray tell.
She is Syrena.
Ponce de Leon.
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure, it would not match the contents of this room.
You...
- You.
- No...
- You...
- I was here first.
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.
Back, back!
We have to balance it out!
The whole ship will slide!
Right, then.
What if... we each choose an item of approximately equal weight?
Put it back!
We touch nothing!
- What about that?
- The chalices.
- Oi! Why do you get to look first?
- Fine, then.
- Together.
- Together.
Rocks.
The Spanish.
They're ahead of us, mate.
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...
I wonder why they left this behind.
Don't touch the map.
They know the path, but I can also see where they'll most likely make camp.
Jack!
Gibbs... I was just on me way to break you out of jail.
You stole my map.
Right. Best be started.
Ole.
Mermaids.
Careful, these pools run deep.
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.
Look. Look!
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live, but just... enough to make the dying slow.
Think on it.
Your people, murdered, harvested for their tears.
Syrena... won't you cry?
All die, even you.
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...
Listen.
Can you not hear your sisters scream?
Do you not hear them?
We need but one tear.
Vile creature!
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes!
Where's your voice in this?
Maybe she'll have a change of heart when the sun rises.
Oh, aye. She will burn, but I cannot wait for the sun.
Perhaps we should build a fire.
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.
I will tear every scale from her body one by one if I see fit.
If that displeases you, go pray.
I was wrong. Not every soul can be saved. Yours cannot.
Behold, gentlemen, a man formerly of faith.
That vile creature, as you call her, is worth a hundred of you.
Oh, you care for her?
You fancy her.
And do not deny what is clear to my eyes.
Question is... does she fancy you?
By... God, she does.
We are in luck!
Bring forth a tear... or witness the death of this poor soul.
Syrena... if you could manage a tear,
I would be grateful.
Sadness, yes,
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, father!
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.
Ooh, aye, mermaids are tough.
The lot of them.
Tie her up like the others.
And... get rid of this.
- You are confident?
- Yes.
I am a woman. So is she.
What's your play, Jack?
Throwin' in with Barbossa.
There is a girl... a female... of the opposite sex.
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel".
You're rescuin' a damsel?
Well, there's a first.
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.
Gibbs... this is the woman from Seville.
Ahh, you... pretended to love 'er, then you left 'er and broke her heart.
Worse. I may have had, briefly, mind you...
- stirrings.
- Stirrings?
- Stirrings.
- What? Like... feelings, you mean?
No, no, no. Not quite all the way to feelings. More like...
All right, feelings, damn you.
And you left her still.
Oh, that's low.
Thank you.
Stealth over force.
I'll take it from here on account of your... condition.
You don't have termites, do you?
I appreciate your concern, Jack, but I'll be keepin' you company all the same.
Hold here, lieutenant commander.
Wait for my signal.
There. That one.
That be the leader.
Make note of his tent because that's where...
No, wait. By God... that must be them right there.
Your sword smells funny.
Aye. Poison from the innards of poisonous toads.
Just a scratch, you're a dead man in minutes.
Would you mind pointing it the other way?
I don't like toads.
- What are you doing?
- Plannin' an escape route.
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.
Or sometimes I just... improvise.
Now what?
We stroll out, slow and steady.
Just like we belong.
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.
- Yes.
- You came for me.
Why?
You're different... are you not?
Do you know not of kindness... compassion?
Tears of sorrow, never.
Mermaids be too tough for that.
But tears of joy...
They say these be the more potent anyway.
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.
Let 'her go.
You don't need 'er now.
Let her go? No.
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.
- How's that escape route working?
- Here's your chance to improvise.
I'm attempting it.
I might be able to get a... hand loose.
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.
Better.
I want one of those.
Here's to revenge.
Sweet and clear.
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.
If you wanted the chalices, you'd seen they were missing and gone.
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.
- Oh...
- King George, privateer... wig...
Cheap theatrical facade.
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack.
No provocation nor warning nor offer of parley.
We were peppered with cannon fire.
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil.
The Pearl was pitchin' and yawin' violently.
Every plank, every rail, every spar, all at once, began to creak.
The riggin' had come to life.
Our own ship turned against us... tanglin' the crew, wrappin' around 'em like snakes.
And wrappin' around me leg.
But me arms were free and me sword was to hand.
I am the master of me ship, not Blackbeard.
I am the master of my fate, not Blackbeard.
So I did what needed done.
I survived.
So... you're not after the Fountain.
I care not for King George or tavern yarns that give hope for a healed limb.
But I'd give me left arm for a chance at Blackbeard.
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm to drive my poisoned blade through his... heart.
I'll see you get the chance, mate.
The prisoner's escaping.
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!
Go! Go!
Hold your fire!
I want him alive!
I figured that was the signal.
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack, but I've an appointment to keep.
- I'll not be goin' back.
- No need.
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.
How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me?
- You brought the chalices, Sparrow?
- Aye. Oi!
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.
And the one-legged man, he is near.
- Aye?
- Aye.
Now...
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.
- Name them.
- Firstly,
I'll be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.
Firstly, upon your word, you will bring no harm to Angelica.
I'll make no vows to the likes of you, Sparrow.
But it costs me nothing to admit that she was never in harm's way.
Secondly, then, priorly firstly...
I will be having me compass back.
Please? I do deserve it.
Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch that filthy pig?
Not the... big one, the four-legged one.
Thank you.
And thirdly... Mr. Beard, there are times, not very often, when I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds.
Chief among them, I note how poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.
Still don't. But, point being, you must let him go free.
- Is that it?
- I think so.
Quick, or the pig runs, and good luck getting those chalices.
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...
Done.
Release the swine.
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...
This will lead you to freedom, mate.
I could have swore it was somewhere right around here.
We must not stop.
A-ha!... Dead end.
Dead... end.
Dead end.
Jack, I'm starting to think you don't know where you're going.
It is not the destination so much as the journey, they say.
Chalices, if you please.
Stand back.
Jack... have you ever, in fact... seen, with your own eyes... the Fountain of Youth?
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
Quartermaster...
No, no!
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.
"Aqua... de Vida."
Master Scrum...
- Do you mind?
- Squire?
So beautiful.
Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste those waters.
Father!
The one-legged man.
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?
Edward Teach!
For crimes committed on the high seas, by the authority granted me by His Majesty the King... and with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction...
I hereby place you in the custody of the court, and declare you to be my prisoner.
My trick's out, is that it?
Such crimes do include, but are not limited to, piracy, treason, murder, torture of the most heinous sort, includin' the brutal theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg.
- You... dare face this sword?
- This far away from your ship? Aye.
Aye. That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape.
But... I'll have one last fight, by God.
Kill 'em all!
Hey, whoa! Hang on a minute.
I just... I just need to understand something.
Right. So... you will fight against them, they will fight against you.
All on account of him wanting to kill him?
Where is the sense?
Exactly.
I say, let them fight each other... while we lay back, watch, have a drink, place some wagers! Eh?
Aye.
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!
Get off me!
Scrum, the chalices!
And the tear! Follow!
Fight!
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.
I told you. I need years.
And now, yours will do.
Scrum!
Syrena...
Oh, God... You will not... take her.
If you have taken her, you will give her... back.
Give her back...
Give her back, please.
Please.
I expected fate to put up more of a fight, eh?
I will not have that smile on your face as I strike you down.
Take a gander, Edward Teach.
This land is hereby forever claimed in the glorious name of His Majesty, King George...
Someone make a note of that man's bravery.
Senorita, the chalices... por favor.
Only God can grant eternal life, not this pagan water.
Men! Destroy this profane temple!
The Fountain!
You are a fool.
You seek in this place what only faith can provide.
Faith? In faith, there is light enough to see but darkness enough to blind.
What devilry is this?
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard without a little... venomous advantage.
Jack!
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew, and this sword, payment for my missing limb!
- Hang on!
- Pull!
Do not waste my tear.
Drink this.
This one has the tear.
- You must drink the other.
- No!
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.
You take it, father... for your soul.
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.
This one takes life?
This one has the tear and gives life?
Aye, hurry!
Angelica...
Save me, my child.
No.
I love you, father.
Wait a minute...
In fact, it might have been the other way around.
This cup had the tear, that one had the... other bit.
Trickster!
- Devil!
- Father!
You, bastard! How could you?
Your father saved you.
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?
You are hurt.
In body only.
My mind is at peace... because of you.
- Me?
- Yes.
I was lost.
The wind... the tides... they ought to renew a man's faith.
But for me, only you.
Philip, I can save you.
You need only ask.
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?
Forgiveness.
If not for me, you would never have been captured.
Ask.
Forgive me.
- I hate you.
- The bloke who saved your life?...
The years I possess, stolen from my own father!
I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done.
You are cruel... and ignorant.
One pistol... one shot.
- To kill myself before I starve?
- There's no trusting you, love.
Besides, this is a well-travelled trade route.
You can signal a passing ship.
Or, you can just bite the proverbial bullet, as it were.
And how will I get free of these bonds?
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago, waiting for the precise moment to pounce.
Admit it, Jack.
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,
I'd choose the dog.
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels!
Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide!
- You're making that up!
- Wait...
I am with child. Yours.
I don't recall that we ever had...
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.
Wait!
There is something
I want to say to you.
Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met.
Go on, then.
I love you.
As do I.
Always have. Always will.
- I gotta go.
- Jack!
This is not over!
Jack!
Missed!
The Revenge is mine.
Sir...
We found this below decks.
All hands!
Ply to windward!
Get crackin', ye bloomin' cockroaches!
The Crown served me well.
But now, by the gods of sea and sky... make way for Tortuga!
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback, you made it!
Aye!
And I trust we managed a profit
- from our joint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.
The compass led me straight and true.
What of Blackbeard's men guarding the ship?
I employed the selfsame maneuver we perfected in New Guinea.
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind.
Shame indeed.
I hate that monkey.
So, the Pearl....
Any idea how to get 'er out?
We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats...
One of us must learn to play the trumpet whilst the other one goes like this...
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this...
Jack, I have to ask...
You had the chalices, the water, the tear...
You could 'ave lived... maybe forever.
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.
But better to not know which moment may be your last.
Every morsel of your entire being alive to the infinite mystery of it all.
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?
Discoverer... of the Fountain of Youth.
I have no say in it, Gibbs.
It's a pirate's life for me.
Savvy?

The Hammer of Invincibility.
The demon way.
Condor.
Ragnerok.
The Hammer of Invincibility.
Odin.
Open...
Gateway....
To Asgard!
Loki!
'Tis the demon Loki!
All off his radial bows!
Fire at the ready!
Stand your ground in the name of Odin!
Fire!
This portends to be an evil day.
Baldir?
Why did the Norns summon father?
The weavers of fate will tell father soon enough.
Now hurry. The gate will be closed soon.
Father!
Some evil is upon us.
I must go see the Norns.
We'll go with you, father.
I must do this alone.
You return to the safety of Valhalla.
Come on.
Hurry, or the gate will close. Come on.
Send them deep into Hell!
So their doom has spread its plume.
And none too soon.
And none too soon.
It is a dark day,
Odin, King of Asgard, that we summon you here to see us.
I would come for no one else.
Now speak your minds and be done with it.
I have dreamt of the stars in the sky turning black.
What does this mean?
It is a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Have you brought the Hammer of Invincibility?
This Hammer was forged by my father from the center of the Tree of Life.
His power is in this Hammer.
That Hammer is the only weapon that can kill the mighty tree it came from.
The source of life on which the mortal earth and all other worlds depend.
Now Loki has arrived to take that life.
So you must give the
Hammer of Invincibility to him.
To Loki? Never.
The time has come for Ragnerok.
Before the Sun goes down this day it will be the destruction of all worlds.
Of Asgard, Earth, and all the other worlds as well.
And you are powerless to stop it.
We'll see about that.
Thor, come on.
Is this fate?
Destroy one world... then weave another.
That is how it's done.
Your doom is decided...
And the fall of your kingdom has already begun.
I don't believe in fate.
Find me the Hammer of Invincibility, my Garmr, and this world will be yours to control.
Onward to Valhalla.
To arms! To arms!
Invasion!
Someone approaches from the north!
Drop the gates now!
Wait!
We don't have to listen to them.
We can weave our own fate.
We can control our destiny.
That is why you are the younger brother.
We can't give up.
A God of the Aesir never gives up.
I will face my own death with honor and dignity, and I suggest you do the same.
Enough!
I want to see Odin!
Odin will never speak to you.
I want the Hammer of Invincibility.
The Hammer is not yours to take.
Odin!
Odin!
I want the Hammer!
Our fate is upon us.
You two fly at the creatures to the left.
I'll cut down through the center.
We'll meet in the middle.
Yes, father.
Yes, father.
You stay back behind your brother.
But father, I can fight.
I'm not afraid.
No, son. I question not your heart, but your experience.
I need you at the end of the battle.
I need you for the finish.
Yes, father.
Valor and strength.
Valor and strength.
Valor and strength.
Valor and strength.
Thor!
Where is Thor?
He was by my side,
I swear.
Suddenly he was gone.
I wanted to die with both my sons.
Odin!
Loki!
Do not think
I'll lie and die for you.
You can't stop the future, Odin.
Give me the Hammer.
You know it's your fate.
Just give me the Hammer, Odin.
Just give me the Hammer.
We don't have to go through this, and I'll go away.
I'll just go away.
Loki!
No! No!
No! No!
My son!
Father...
Give Thor a chance...
To change...
Our fate.
Finally now it's mine.
You want this?
Back where you came!
Tell me.
Tell me where you sent it!
Find it.
Search every cave, every tree in Asgard.
Now.
No! No!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Brother?
What should I do?
Father!
Father.
Thor.
Live.
You live.
Yes. Where's your potion of healing, father?
No.
Where's your potion?
There's not time for that, my son.
It's too late.
Don't waste it.
Use it for another cause.
My father's Hammer...
I sent it... to the heart of the Tree of Life.
My son... must alone retrieve it... before Loki.
Forget the Hammer, father.
It's Loki I want, to avenge your death.
My brother's.
My son... you still think with your heart, not your mind.
The Hammer will appear... on the first full moon...
Tomorrow...
For a moment.
If you don't retrieve it, it's lost forever.
You must retrieve it, my son.
Yes, father.
You are King.
You are our chance to save all that is good.
To change the fate of men.
To change the fate of the gods.
Thor...
You are my son.
Loki!
Loki!
Loki!
Come out and fight me, you coward!
Now the real coward is on his back, just like Odin after I killed him.
You should have heard your father beg.
My father wouldn't ask a thing from you.
Oh, he cried.
He pleaded don't hurt me.
Liar!
You are the coward!
Fight me like a warrior.
Tell me where the Hammer of Invincibility is.
Release me and fight!
Your father spoke to you with his last breath.
I can smell it.
What did he say?
He said that you're as worthless as your dogs.
Let's go!
Let's go! Move!
Who are you?
Come on!
Come on! Move!
Why are you helping me?
Move!
Find them.
Kill the girl any way you like, but Thor lives for now.
Go!
Go!
All right.
Shh!
I'm Thor.
I know.
Who are you?
I'm Jarnsaxa.
I'm a servant of your father.
He asked me to protect you.
Then let's avenge my father's death.
I can't kill Loki alone, and you do not yet have the fighting skills to help.
Shh!
You don't know my--
Quiet!
What?
Come on.
It's time we go.
Come on. This is a battle we cannot win.
We must hide.
Odin!
Odin!
Your world is over.
Mine is next.
And your Tree of Life is finished.
Ah, my pet.
You found them.
Now lead me.
I'm not going to keep running from Loki like some coward.
You think you're ready to fight Loki? Huh?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not going to fight some girl.
I am a fraction of your size and I managed to best you three times.
Here.
Clear?
Huh?
Fine.
There it is.
Come on.
The portal is open.
Hurry!
Make this land a chasm of death.
Stop! Stop!
What?
What is this place?
It's a training camp protected by a powerful rune stone far older than Loki.
No enemy can enter uninvited.
We must go to the gateway.
Come on!
What gateway?
To the Tree of Life to get the Hammer.
It can't be.
This is a secret place.
How could Loki have destroyed it?
Destroyed what?
A direct portal to Midgard.
Perhaps the Norns had something to do with this.
The Norns? But they're neutral in these matters.
I'm not so sure.
Thor!
I can hear you.
Why delay the inevitable?
Where is he?
He's outside the protective barrier of the rune stone.
I don't see him.
Nor he us.
Odin is gone.
I will possess the Hammer.
We should take the fight to him.
How can we fight Loki if the fates are against us?
I don't believe in fate.
Coward, where are you?
You wanna play games?
I have games of my own
I can play.
Come, my friends.
We're trapped.
Our only chance is to wait until nightfall and then we sneak out of here.
A warrior God doesn't sneak around at night.
A warrior uses his cunning and temperance to win a battle.
And one of these...
Swung with skill.
I swing hard enough.
Skill, even above strength.
Who taught you how to fight?
I taught myself...
By watching my brother practice when I was small.
Who taught you?
The Valkyries, warrior-guardian of the gods.
I was second in command under Odin's father.
Hmm.
Swing.
Not again.
Skill above strength.
Swing.
You have no chance against Loki unless you learn the skills I have.
Then you better teach me quick,
'cause I'm going to kill Loki the first chance I get.
Thor?
I can hear you.
Come, my friends!
This is much more comfortable.
What is that?
They're coming.
I thought you said nothing could come in here uninvited.
I think I was wrong.
What?
We must find the other gateway.
Wait! Wait! Wait!
There isn't time.
Loki's probably on to us.
Then I say we ambush 'em at the next bend, kill him, and be done with it.
Look, even with all you've learned, we're still not a match for his powers.
We have to go to Midgard.
From there's we'll find a way to the Tree of Life.
But the portal was destroyed.
There is another entrance. Come on!
Look what I let them do to my father's land.
Asgard was doomed as soon as Odin died.
You have a different world to save.
Look!
Look!
New life already begins to grow.
There is hope after all.
Come on.
The gateway is just beyond these trees.
No, no, no. No!
Thor!
It didn't have to be this way.
Could have died without her, Thor.
You want the Hammer of Invincibility?
Here. Take it!
Go!
Go!
Yes.
No!
Thor?
Tell me that was not the Hammer you gave to Loki.
Of course I didn't.
I saw it!
It was always the ax.
I only made him think that it was the Hammer.
But I saw it.
You were within range.
Come on.
Loki can't be far behind.
My place is right up here.
Give me your purse.
No.
I said give me your purse.
Thank you.
Now you gotta pay.
Give me your wallet.
Thor, we don't want to be noticed like this.
Come on. Let's go.
This way. This way.
Go!
This does not seem like the dwelling of a demigoddess.
It's not supposed to.
The people here must think I'm human.
They don't believe in the Tree of Life anymore.
Here. Wear this.
You'll be less conspicuous.
Here. Take this.
Careful.
These are very powerful.
It's from Midgard.
How do you use it?
Here. Just put your finger here.
This one goes up here.
Good. Be sure this is pulled.
Now pull the trigger.
Just think of it as the shaft of a spear, and aim your point at the center of your target.
Good.
Your humans certainly understand their weaponry.
They're warriors... like the gods.
I'm beginning to like your humans even more.
We are...here.
And the nearest channel to the heart of the tree is here.
But we're going to have to open it ourselves.
How?
The tree will tell us how when the time comes.
We could wait until the dark of the night.
Let's do it.
Hmm.
Or we could leave now.
To get the Hammer, we must pass through the gateway portal to the Tree of Life.
Right there.
Here it is.
The opening has been covered up.
Can you feel anything?
A wall.
Well, we must enter the portal now or we won't get to the Hammer in time.
It will just disappear.
And go back to Loki.
Here.
Yes. Yes.
It's under this.
We have to uncover it.
Thor, I need you.
I'm here.
Concentrate with me.
We need a strong channel through us to open it.
Gateway.
Gateway.
Gateway!
Let's go.
Ready?
You feel it?
The presence of the essence of all life, right down to her beating heart.
What is that?
It's the heart beat.
It's coming from down in there.
Wait. Wait.
What if it's a trap?
You should stay.
Why?
Thor, if you die, it's over for all of us.
We go together.
All right.
You cannot escape me, Thor.
I will possess the Hammer of Invincibility.
The heart is on the other side, and the Hammer with it.
Pass through and you will be there.
Aren't you coming?
This part of the journey is for you alone.
There is a knight who guards the Tree of Life.
You must defeat him at all costs.
The heart of the tree.
Where is it?
Where is the Hammer?
Thor!
Father?
Thor, my son, the power of my fathers is now in you.
Use the Hammer.
Find it.
Take this Hammer, son, the power is now yours.
It's yours.
Oh, great Tree of Life, thank you from my heart for all that you have given us.
Give me the strength so that I might save you from destruction.
How will Loki know we've returned?
He'll know.
We must lure him back to Asgard.
I'm going to track
Loki down and kill him.
You're not ready to face Loki yet.
Why? I have the Hammer.
I have the will.
What more do I need?
The powers of your father.
A strategy. An army.
Well, I don't have an army, so I guess I'm on my own.
You're not on your own, Thor.
You should stay far away from me.
Loki is more likely to appear when I'm alone.
Do you trust me, Thor?
Yes.
We should go back to the war camp.
The war camp? Why?
To continue your training.
We will need its protection so one day you can defeat Loki.
One day?
I have to defeat Loki now.
You're not ready yet.
We should go back to the war camp.
Well, we don't have to go back there.
I took the rune stone of protection and put it inside your dwelling place.
Good.
Then we'll go back to my dwelling and safely finish your training there.
No training!
No hiding!
I kill Loki and stop Ragnerok, and that's final.
I know Loki's in here.
Loki!
Come out and face me, Loki!
Son of Odin.
You're no match for me.
The Hammer of Invincibility.
Defend yourself, Loki.
Aah!
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
I should have hit him when I had the chance.
You're brave.
Rash, stubborn, but brave.
Wait here. I'll check the perimeter.
Jarnsaxa...
You are a noble warrior.
I thank you.
He's close.
Good. This time I'll be happy to hit him in the back.
No! No!
You were nearly destroyed earlier.
You almost lost the Hammer.
Well, it won't happen again.
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Jarnsaxa cannot be trusted.
She has kissed the demons.
She is a concubine for Midgard.
You must kill her.
Thor?
She only wants the Hammer.
Kill her.
Thor, do not listen to him.
He's playing mind tricks.
He's the devil, the serpent, the spirit of trickery and deception.
Thor!
Thor!
We must go back to my dwelling, to the protection of the rune stone.
No! We can kill him.
I swear it.
Thor, please!
No!
Thor!
This is madness.
He's a liar, a cheater.
Do not believe what you see.
Maybe the Norns were right.
Maybe the Earth is doomed.
I will not let that happen.
I will not let the Norns control my fate... or yours.
We can't kill Loki.
Not two of us, not ten of us.
We must hide the Hammer as Odin did.
For how long?
Maybe centuries.
However long it takes for you to be made ready.
But everything will die.
No matter what Loki does to men and gods, as long as the Tree of Life remains strong all the other can be rebuilt.
At nightfall, then, we return to the protection of our hiding place.
You have the courage of your father and brother in you.
You have my heart,
Jarnsaxa.
Know that.
And you have mine.
One day, you will be able to channel the powers of the universe, to let it fly through your arm like lightning.
Thor?
Oh, no. Thor!
Got you.
Give me the Hammer, Thor.
Good. Use it.
Feel the power of the Hammer.
The bone of Urrl.
It is useless to you.
You cannot control it's power.
And without it, you have no power at all.
Wait!
You will destroy the only thing that can bring back your father.
What do you mean?
Speak!
Your father.
Your brother.
The power of the bone is the only thing that put them in Muspellheim Hell, and it's the only thing that can release them.
Tell me how to use it.
Tell me!
Let me live, and I will show you.
What of Ragnerok?
I'll make it that there is no Ragnerok.
No Ragnerok ever.
You are the devil, full of lies and deceits.
Aah!
Aah!
There is no Ragnerok.
Aah!
You are all safe.
You are all safe.
Give me back the bone so I can live.
Aah!
Give it to me.
Aah!
Thor!
You're alive!
I did it.
Don't you ever--
I killed him.
I killed Loki.
I defeated him.
He's dead.
I saw him melt.
And I took this from him, and he lost all of his power.
Ragnerok is over.
You took the devil's tool.
It's cursed.
You must get rid of it.
But I have his power now.
Even if you do,
Loki's powers are rancid.
They're decayed.
Aren't you happy?
Loki is gone.
His creatures are gone.
It's a trick.
It is not a trick.
Yes, it's a trick.
That is what Loki does.
He tricks.
Why is everything I do on my own wrong? Why?
Because you're young.
And you're inexperienced.
You have more courage and more heart than skills.
But one day--
I'm going to bring my brother and my father back.
You'll see.
Those are lies.
We are not mortal.
We are gods, and they are trapped in the realm of Muspellheim.
And there is nothing you can do about it.
Their fate-- their fate is my fate.
And I have changed my fate.
Have I not defeated Loki?
Am I dead as the Norns had foretold?
Your story is not over, and when it is, one day you will discover that the Norns have sewn your tales in their tapestries from the beginning.
Your father and brother are gone, and you cannot change fate.
Where are we going?
To my dwelling, where I should have taken you long ago.
Where you will be protected.
We must get rid of that wretched thing before it drives you to evil.
Tree of Life, mother of life, guard these doors so that none may enter uninvited.
Destroy that abomination.
Use the Hammer.
I will.
Don't even look at it.
Where are you going?
To find some evidence that Loki's truly dead.
And until I find that evidence, you must promise me that you will not leave the protection of these walls.
I promise.
Swear on your father that you will not leave.
I swear it by the blood of my father.
You're strong, Thor.
You have a lot to learn.
Crush that thing and burn it.
Bring my father back to life.
Bring my father Odin back to life.
Father, I will reach into the halls of my ancestors and grab you.
Bring Odin back to life.
Loki!
How did you get past the rune stone?
You invited me.
I killed you.
You're dead.
Dead?
I never was alive.
Join me, and I'll let your family live.
My family?
You mean my family, my father, who burns to Muspellheim?
And your brother.
Give me the hammer and I'll let them all out.
Liar!
Come on! Come on!
I will not rest until I have it!
Forgive me.
Forgive me for sneaking away earlier.
Are you ready, Thor, to actually take my advice?
Yes, I will take it.
I will listen to what you say.
For my father, who burns in hell.
Good. Then hear me.
We'll return to Valhalla immediately.
Let Loki smash away all the people and the buildings.
And keep that Hammer away from Loki and I promise you, one day you will return to watch him perish in the dirt.
Come, my friends.
How are you, my pet?
They are near.
They can't escape fate.
We can make a gateway here.
I'm going to need you to help me summon it.
But Asgard is a heap of sand and ash.
It has been destroyed.
We'll find a place.
I'll hide you and the Hammer.
I'm not going.
I'm staying here to save the Earth.
Thor!
Thor, please.
We don't have much time.
I beg you! We must keep the Hammer away from Loki.
It's the only weapon that can kill the Tree of Life.
So long the tree lives, there is still a chance to rebuild.
Please!
All right.
Good.
Now, hold the Hammer tight before you.
Channel its powers.
The will in your heart will make it open.
Now, you go through it first.
Jarnsaxa, do you feel
I have the power in me to carry this through to the very end, even if it means
I must fight?
Oh, Thor, you are a God beyond my understanding, the son of the master who I've served.
If you believe in your heart that you must fight,
I will live or die by your side.
I am your soldier.
Then go through, and take this.
Hide it.
Protect it.
Keep it safe from Loki.
I am not leaving this Earth until I have saved it or death takes me.
Thor?
No!
Take it! Hurry!
Before it's too late.
No! I'm not leaving without you.
No!
You shall die witch!
Lindworms!
Lindworms from underneath.
Come to me!
Go through the gateway!
I will stop them! Go!
You can't fight me, Thor.
Fate is on my side.
Every fabric of the universe is against you.
Damn the fabric of the universe.
Loki!
It's mine!
It's mine!
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
No, Jarnsaxa.
I stay here.
To my dwelling then.
The rune stone will protect us.
No.
The gateway!
The gateway to my dwelling!
Gateway!
No!
Jarnsaxa!
Now, let's see.
What am I going to do to you now?
Jarnsaxa.
No, Jarnsaxa.
Jarnsaxa, I'm here.
I'm here.
You'll be all right.
I thought you'd never come.
We've got to get you out of here.
We'll get the potion of healing.
We'll take care of you.
Leave me here.
No, I'll never leave you.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Jarnsaxa?
Very touching.
Jarnsaxa...
I could not change our fate.
I'm sorry.
Odin...
Forgive me.
You are not defeated yet...
My King.
Yes, you are my
King...
Ruler of Asgard who sits atop the universe...
Guardian of all realms.
We're in good hands...
Your hands...
For you are not defeated yet.
Thor!
I want you to witness the final moments of Midgard, when this entire planet becomes the gates to my new kingdom.
It is the end of life, the end of time, and the end of you.
Not quite.
You cling to old dreams.
You are an embarrassment.
I want you to taste the bitterness of my rise to power, go back to your worms and your dogs and leave the true gods of the nine realms in peace.
Soon the nine realms will no longer exist, and the time of Aesir is finished, and I will be ruler of the next kingdom, not Thor.
Behold, the fire of Muspellheim.
In it's fiery depths, your father waits for you... as well as others.
No!
No!
And now I'm off to kill the Tree of Life...
And unleash the final stages of Ragnerok.
Aah!
Close.
It's time.
Father?
Where are you?
Jarnsaxa?
Where are you?
I am gone...
And you are ready.
Nothing is beyond you.
Nothing is beyond you.
Nothing is beyond you.
I will forge my own Hammer.
Die, mother of living earth.
Die.
I will not be stopped!
News reporter:
We're getting reports of scores of unknown creatures destroying urban areas in Southern California.
The U.S. military is doing their best to respond to the threat.
Ragnerok.
Ragnerok!
Ragnerok!
Ragnerok!
Impossible.
I sent you to hell!
The power of that Hammer belongs to me.
There is nothing left to fight for.
It's over.
Nothing is over.
We control our own fate.
Your heart shall beat as long as I live.
How dare you come here, son of Odin.
You are an abomination.
Loki was meant to rule the next chapter of the universe when this one is no more.
But you have killed him.
Dead! Gone!
Against the will of fate, so carefully woven in this loom.
We have chaos in the world.
Shameful chaos!
What have you to say for yourself?
This world is now controlled by those who live here, and it will be, for good or ill, what we ourselves make of it.
That is true fate.

- We're on the wrong fucking beach.
- Ah...
Tide turning.
- Yeah.
We were moving faster through the channel.
- It plonked us around the fucking corner.
- No chance getting back round the coast fighting that rip.
I was hoping for a cup of tea and a cake.
- Better get off this beach.
- Mines?
- Bound to be.
: Ben...
Got a date tomorrow.
: Let me guess.
You met her down the pub.
Nurse, huge tits.
- Like a pair of ripe melons ready for the plucking.
She's got this friend...
I was...
You've got to move on sometime, Ben.
Look, just come along, have a bit of fun.
Her friend's a real doll.
She's tall, ugh, blonde.
Legs all the way up to her armpits.
Ben...
- We haven't got time for this.
I'm walking it.
- Oh, shit.
I was just admiring the view.
My little nurse is not gonna be too happy if I leave my crown jewels blown all over this beach.
You better back off, Ben.
- I trust you.
If you marry her and have kids... you better bloody well name one after me.
- Slow... and steady this time.
Better get on with it.
Don't wanna keep the nursey waiting now, do we?
- Right address this time?
- Path up there.
- Oh...
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know, I don't care.
Let's just get the job done and get the fuck off this island.
Ugly-looking place.
This is bullshit.
Where is everyone?
- They're fucking torturing some poor bastard in there.
- This isn't a rescue mission.
- What if it's one of ours?
You know what those bastards did to Blondie's men in Bordeaux.
- It's not our mission.
: Jesus.
Jesus Christ in heaven!
Help... Help us, please!
- There's bad shit going on here.
Bad shit.
Bastards. Fuckin' Nazi bastards.
- No.
It's not our war. This is our fight.
The gun, that's our mission.
- Fuck the mission.
- Jesus Christ.
We leave. Now.
We get out alive.
We get back home.
- Back home to what?
- Look, we've done what we came here to do.
We'll get fucking medals for this.
The girls will be falling all over us!
- Give me ten minutes, Joe.
- Five.
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Request radio check. Over.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.
- Fuck you.
- Joe...
- Name...
Rank...
Number. Yes?
Good teeth.
Clean.
Some people I know in Germany actually collect teeth.
Perhaps I should cut that useless tongue out.
But what use are you, if you can't... talk to me, yes?
You can thank your own people for this little trick.
Was it not your own gangster commandos who raided these very islands, killing innocent German prisoners with their hands tied behind their backs?
Cathartic, is it not?
The release of pain surging through your body.
What was your mission?
- Hmm...
- Not enough to destroy the installation, but adequate... to put it out of action for a while.
Why?
To protect your armies... as they cross the English Channel and... retake these islands?
You're a little late, aren't you?
The population here is so hungry... they're reduced to eating rats.
What is this English... Channel... anyway?
Does anybody outside of England call it that?
Do the people of these... Channel Islands even think themselves English?
So, you planned to put the gun out of action.
And presumably others of the neighbouring islands, which... as the Führer predicted are to become the staging post for your invasion of... France.
Your silence is admirable.
- Fuck you, Fritz.
: God in heaven...
It is hungry.
: You bitch!
You think I have nothing better to do than feed you?
Whore!
So, should we begin again in a more civilized way?
Or do you wish to end up like your unfortunate friend over there?
Grogan.
Captain.
Who is that woman up there?
- If only you knew the truth of that.
- Oh, I can see the truth, splattered all around this room.
What is she, a plaything for you and your men?
You take a special little fancy to her, yeah?
Want her all for yourself?
Even your own army will hang you for this.
- This?
You think a single man is responsible for this?!
She did this to them!
- You're insane.
- You may not believe this, but you and I are in the same boat.
- Call me picky, but I'm the one who's tied up and threatened with summary execution here... Fritz.
- Meyer. Klaus Meyer.
Perhaps I should rephrase.
We are in the same shit.
I admire your marvellous accent.
South Africa?
Australia? Ah!
The guttural... nuance.
New Zealand.
You are indeed a long way from home.
- Same could be said about you.
New Zealanders.
A bunch of farmers pretending to be soldiers, driving around the deserts of North Africa, attacking by night, then fleeing to hide like cowards.
So, where in England will the invasion come from?
Southampton?
Poole?
Which of these islands do you plan to take first?
Guernsey, perhaps?
Alderney?
Then to France?
Which beaches?
Oh, perhaps it's not so... bad if we were to lose these islands... to men like you.
- Never yours to lose.
- And yet here you are, thousands of miles from home.
And what... exactly is your home,
Captain Grogan?
An... island that does not belong to you either, populated by the descendents of cannibals and headhunters.
Who exactly do you fight for,
Captain Grogan?
For King and country?
Or for Britain or New Zealand?
We are more similar that you care to admit.
You are a New Zealander, but of British descent, are you not?
Was not Britain itself a nation of Vikings and Saxons, superior Germanic people?
We should be fighting on the same side, not against each other.
But enough of politics.
Very pretty.
Strong features.
Girlfriend?
Wife?
Awaiting the return of her hero husband?
Pity...
...if I were to...
Tell me exactly when the Allies plan to take back these islands.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Well, that is a soldier's lot on lonely outposts such as this.
- No!
- Soon she will be gone.
Who is she?
I have my duty.
Please.
- She's Helena.
My wife.
She was my wife.
April 1941, in London, there was an air raid.
Shelter was hit. Hundreds were buried.
I went to help.
We found only mangled corpses, women and children.
I made it home in the early hours of the morning. Our hou...
Our house had been hit.
And...
I dug again, this time alone.
And I found her.
What was left of her.
I never got to say goodbye.
This war has taken its toll on all of us.
- You say that as if you're not responsible.
- I am just a soldier, like you.
- No.
No, not like me.
Ah!
: I told you...
We're both in the same shit.
We could've helped each other.
- What could I possibly help you with, Meyer?
Torturing female prisoners?
Murdering your own men?
What kind of lunatic Special Action Unit did they pull you out of?
Jews and Gypsies not enough for you?
- I've already told you...
None of those men died by my hand.
That prisoner, she is not what you think she is.
- Sorry, Joe.
: Please, help me. Please.
Please, help me.
- It's safe.
- Don't...
You're safe now.
I can take you from here.
There's a submarine off the coast.
We can get to it.
Jesus! Jesus Christ!
Ben...
- Helena...
No... No, you're dead.
- Please...
There isn't time to explain.
The German, he'll be back.
Don't leave me here with him.
Don't let him touch me.
- How... How can this be?
- Ben! You've got to get me free.
You've got to unlock this chain!
- You were so...
You were so torn.
You-you-you were broken.
You, uh...
I held you in my arms.
- Ben... pull yourself together.
This is real. I promise.
There's a key... downstairs.
You must find it.
- Don't think about releasing her.
There's a good chap.
- What in God's name is going on here?!
- Nothing in God's name,
I can assure you of that.
Now, please, step away from her.
- Ben, help...
- Silence, you hag!
That creature is not who you think she is.
- How is she here?
- That Luger had... only three rounds left.
By my count, you are out of bullets.
You don't believe? Shoot me.
- Drop the Schmeisser.
Kick it here.
- An officer and a gentleman to the last.
How boring.
Ah!
I need you alive.
No!
Bastard!
What the fuck did you just do, you Nazi bastard?
: I've saved your life.
She'd have killed you if you'd set her free.
Listen to me.
I have information.
A weapon...
...more dangerous than anything you can imagine.
- You lying bastard!
- Kill me... and you'll never know.
- Talk!
- That creature...
She's part of it.
- Bullshit.
I can prove it.
- No. Your turn to die.
- Please, I beg you.
- You lie to me and I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, and gut you like a pig, you understand?
What the fuck is going on here?
How can Helena be here?
Tell me.
- She's not your dead wife.
Ugh... Please tell me you believe that.
I am Colonel Meyer of the SS Germanorden.
How many soldiers have the blood tattoo?
How many soldiers carry papers of that nature?
You must understand, the Führer has long been obsessed with the occult.
He set up the SS Germanorden, a specialist unit dedicated to scouring the world for... mystical materials.
I was sent here on... a highly secret mission.
The outcome which c... could affect the entire war.
These islands you're so keen to save... you know, they have something of a reputation.
- For what?
- Witchcraft.
What on earth do... do you think we're dealing with here?
You may see her as your dead Helena.
I see my loving Gretta, who is still very much alive in Hamburg.
That soldier...
That was Lieutenant Otto Schillmann.
A good soldier, until his girlfriend tried to use his intestines as a necklace.
- Enough of this fairytale bullshit.
- That is how they died.
Each one.
Ripped apart and devoured by someone they thought was the love of his life.
- Ah... you really are insane.
- The platoon stationed here were starving.
They hadn't been supplied for weeks, reduced to foraging for food.
They found... an abandoned cottage.
A ruin.
There they found something.
A book.
Have you heard of the Grimoires?
- The what?
- In the Middle Ages, witches were more feared on these islands than in any other part of the British Isles.
They drew their power from a series of ancient texts.
Grimoires.
Bad books.
Whose purpose was the invocation of demonic forces.
Allow me to prove it.
I will show you the true nature of this horror.
I need your knife.
Come, demon bitch.
You can cease pretending.
I know you need your meat.
See?
- Jesus Christ, Meyer.
What have you done?
: Benjamin?
: Do not implore his help, demon.
I've shown him what you are.
- My love... I'm your Helena.
Surely you can see.
- Isn't this what you really seek?
- I am no animal to be chained.
Release me, and the forces I serve will grant you powers beyond your wildest dreams.
- So said Lucifer in the desert to Our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Ah! Surely that holy name turns to poison in your mouth, Nazi.
- You cannot divide us, demon.
I will send you back to the darkness.
Treat this as your last meal.
I present your loving wife.
I will show you everything, Grogan.
How I summoned... this monster.
And how we will dispel it.
Ugh...
: Ben...
Don't leave me.
- Be warned... Captain Grogan.
If I die, you lack the knowledge to send that creature back to Hell.
- You be warned, there's no morphine.
This is gonna hurt... a lot.
: Oh, God!
Christ's blood!
- Keep bloody still!
: Oh, God!
Christ's blood!
Ah...
- Colonel?
Don't die on me now, not after the trouble I've been through.
: Ben...?
Ben? Are you down there, darling?
I know you're listening.
I can replace her, Ben.
I can be Helena.
Release me from this chain.
Release me, and I will take my place beside you.
- Do demons sleep, Colonel?
- Who knows?
When incarnate on earth, when clothed in living flesh--
- Yeah, spare me.
- She is Femme-Varou.
- What?
- Femme-Varou.
That is her real identity.
May I?
In mythology, the Femme-Varou are shape-shifters.
She is a carnivore.
A desecrator of human flesh.
But she comes with a beautiful and familiar face, to confuse and deceive her victims.
- You... summoned one.
- I had orders to test... the book.
- On fellow German soldiers?
- All war involves sacrifice.
An island like this is perfect.
This particular demon cannot cross flowing waters.
Even if she'd killed us all, she would be trapped here.
- But she didn't kill you all.
One does not summon demons...
...without the means to defend oneself against them.
Whoever carries the words contained within that pouch will be safe from her.
Against them she is forbidden to cause mortal harm and has no more strength than a normal woman.
- Let me guess.
There's only one of these.
- I'll admit, I was not prepared for the viciousness of her attack, or the extent of her appetite.
But she killed so many...
It's unfortunate.
But what a... what a weapon she is, spawned in Hell itself.
Imagine if she were unleashed in London, deceiving and slaughtering her way to Churchill himself.
She would... she would make Jack the Ripper look like a kindergarten tale.
She cannot be killed by mortal means.
She can only be bound in iron.
But that... will only hold her for so long.
She can be dismissed back to the netherworld, but only by the knowledge contained in there.
And trust me, she is just a lesser demon.
There are far worse than her in that book.
Help me... and the book is yours.
- Why?
Why would you do that?
- I love my country, but I'm not blind to the atrocities she's committed, nor am I comfortable with what will happen if she wins.
Perhaps it is... better if the righteous prevail.
- And what's the price of betraying your country?
- A deal.
Immunity from prosecution for myself, my wife smuggled out of Germany, new lives and a new identity for both of us.
In return...
I will educate your leaders in the dark secrets of this book.
- Why don't I just take this book and kill you?
- A brave soldier returning to rave of demons and witchcraft?
How many occult experts do you have in your army, Captain Grogan?
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
- How long was I unconscious?
- An hour, maybe longer.
: God in Heaven!
The garrison on Guernsey is sending a boat to collect me at dawn.
We must escape before they arrive.
- What about her?
- She is trapped on this island, but she is a denizen of Hell.
Who knows the strength of her powers?
For our own safety, we must dispel the demon now.
- How?
- The ritual.
It requires two of us.
The pouch. I need it.
Captain Grogan, do you have any idea with what you're dealing with here?
There are rules.
Without those words kept close to my skin,
I cannot complete the ritual.
You must trust me.
Get the candles.
- Ben? Look at me.
- Do not look at it.
- You've been swayed against your will.
- You must cut me, then yourself.
A blood sacrifice is required.
Now yours.
Do you willingly give all that I ask of you in this cause?
- Yes.
- We must be very clear on this.
- Yes.
- You have not been coerced?
- No, I willingly give.
- Then spill your blood.
: No!
- Downstairs! Quickly!
- For God's sake, there's no lock!
- We must get downstairs!
- And that'll hold her?!
- Just long enough! Go!
Make space!
We must draw a double-edged circle to protect us both.
Hurry! Now!
Stop!
Do not stand on or over the circle.
Exit and enter only through that gap.
Once everything is prepared, we will seal the circle from inside.
More candles. Now!
Baal.
Xaphan.
Samael.
Lilith.
Lucifer.
White candles around the circle.
Give me the knife!
Damn it, man!
Our lives depend on it!
The Flesh of Mankind harnessed.
The Bone of Mankind harnessed.
The Mind of Mankind harnessed.
Stay inside the circle.
If you value your life, do not leave it.
We are ready.
Let the demon bitch assail us.
- Joe?
- Ugh?
- Shacked up with the enemy, Ben? Ha!
- No, no. Joe...
- It's not real, Grogan.
Stay in the circle!
- After all those missions.
After all the boys we lost.
- It's not real.
Ha!
There's nothing there.
It's just an apparition.
A trick.
Nothing more.
- Why don't you start?
- The demon must be present.
- Why would she come down here if this will harm her?
- She will come down here because she is hungry and we are the freshest meat, the tastiest dish on the table.
- What the hell is going on?
- Quiet.
- What were you expecting, my love?
The Devil?
- Don't listen to it.
- Ah!
Efficient and organized.
Haven't you wondered why I'm attempting to entice you rather than him?
- He knows what you are.
Does he?
- And I know you, too.
: No, you do not!
: See, Grogan?
This demon cannot abide defiance.
This is the truth of it.
The abomination that seeks to seduce you.
: I wonder, Captain Grogan, do you really consider you've backed the right horse here?
These goblins in black uniform plan to enslave your world.
Do you wish to hand them the means on a plate?
: Do not listen to it.
- Their leader has long been searching for so-called wonder weapons, magical items with which he will kill your people... in multitudes.
He already holds the Holy Lance.
He had within his grasp the Ark of the Covenant.
He tried to awaken the Great Old Ones.
And now he has within his reach the power to summon Lucifer himself.
: Do not listen, Grogan.
It will try to divide us.
- I've laid bare my true self,
Captain Grogan.
Has he?
- I compel thee by the three most dreadful and mighty names of Inferno,
Abaddon, Ob and Astaroth!
How long is this gonna take?
- I must incant the dismissal for as long as necessary, to weaken it.
- It doesn't seem to be getting any weaker to me.
But I am, Ben. I am.
- I curse thee into the depths of the Bottomless Pit!
- I'll be gone from this world if you allow him to proceed.
- There to remain in unquenchable fire and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!
- Do you wish to lose me forever?
- Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will and commandment once more!
- There were happy occasions weren't there, my love?
In the short time that we had.
- I command thee, demon, who art wicked and disobedient!
- When you held me, kissed me, made love to me...
- Helena...
- Her name is not Helena!
She is a She-Devil!
A Femme-Varou!
- I've followed all your battles.
- I curse thee into the depths of the Bottomless Pit!
- North Africa...
Greece...
Italy...
- There to remain in unquenchable fire and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!
- Always in the front line.
Driven beyond reason by a desire to be with me again.
You don't have to do that now, my love.
I'm here for you.
Come to me.
- Grogan, in God's name!
Do not break the circle!
- Have you missed me, my love?
: Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will and commandment once more!
- I can be this way for you always.
- I command thee, demon, who art wicked and disobedient!
Don't be a fool, Grogan!
Don't let her deceive you!
She's a devil, a desecrator!
- Listen to him, spewing his bile.
- I command thee in the names of Peor and Nyarlathotep!
I compel thee by the three most dreadful and mighty names of the Inferno,
Abaddon, Ob, Astaroth!
- Do you know why I'm not desecrating your flesh, my sweet?
- Hear ye, fallen ones, dead names, lords of the Netherrealm!
Receive back into thy clutches this prodigal beast who is condemned to return to thee!
- Why I'm not devouring your soul?
- Balor!
Choronzon!
Adramelech!
Chancellors of all the darkness!
- The flesh of a good man is rank to me.
- Be bound and obey my command!
- The flesh of an evil man...
Give me the Nazi and you're spared.
- No... No, I need him.
- Be bound and obey my command!
- You poor fool.
Be bound and obey...
- Look.
- ...my command!
: You son of a bitch!
- Fuck you, Hell whore!
Did you honestly believe... a loyal servant of Germany would hand you over the book and betray his country?
As a willing sacrifice, you are now the agent of our success.
And when I'm recognized as the architect of this triumph,
I will rise and sit beside Hitler himself.
All I need now is the power contained within the power of a brave and beating heart.
And that is the role you play, Grogan.
How fortunate that you came here to embrace your destiny.
- You'll create Hell on earth.
- We already have.
- Time you saw the real one.
: Give him to me!
- No, please.
- Give him to me!
Embrace your own fucking destiny!
- No! You can't harm me!
- The deceiver deceived.
At last we are together, my sweet.
Did I not warn you of the price when first you imprisoned me?
You, who have butchered so many... you're still novices in the game of death.
- I compel thee, demon, be bound and obey my command!
Are you trying to dismiss me?
I thought you liked me.
- Stay back.
- Oh, look.
Some thoughtful person has built a little bridge for me.
- I compel thee, demon, be bound and obey my command!
I command thee, demon...
- Ben, your hand is hurt.
Let me look at it.
Let me.
Ben...
Darling...
You still fear me?
- Yes.
- But...
I believe your yearning for Helena is stronger, yeah?
Huh?
Ah...
What's wrong, my love?
- You think I don't know my own Helena?
- Ben...
- Her taste? Her smell?
- Ben...
- You can never replace her.
: No!
You cannot do this to me!
You wish to make an enemy of me for eternity?
Unchain me now!
You bastard son of Adam!
You're no better than the ones you despise, the ones you fight against.
- You should be thanking me.
Every one of those German sailors coming has a wife or a lover.
And all the others after them.
Plenty of fresh meat for ya.
- And when there are no more lambs to the slaughter?
- We'll return, send you back to where you belong.
- How the righteous have fallen.
- Ah, the enemy must be stopped.
This war must be won.
Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
- Quickly. They're coming.
- Bravo Seven Foxtrot, this is Alpha Nine Golf.
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!
: Hello? Colonel Meyer?
My God.
: Oh, my God.
Franz, is that really you?
Franz, Franz. It's me, Nicole.
- Nicole? How?
What's... what's going on?
Where did you come from?
- Where did I come from?
From Hell, dear.
: From Hell.

Okay.
Settle down.
Got your ears open?
This is the story of a sad flute a laughin' baby and a weepin' sword.
A long, long time ago in a land far, far away, there lived a warrior... warrior with empty eyes.
He'd trained his entire life for one purpose.
To be the greatest swordsman in the history of mankind.
He'd just achieved his life's ambition, but his heart felt emptier than ever.
These two clans had been warrin' for 500 years.
And they vowed to keep on warrin' until one of them didn't have a single man left above Styx.
And so now, here he was, peerin' down at this very last of his enemy.
When that little warrior princess giggled, it did somethin' to him inside.
But this was no time for feelin'.
For when spared that baby's life, he put his name at the top of his own clan's death list.
With nothin' but the clothes on his back and the baby in his arms, he decided to pay a visit to an old warrior friend in a faraway land.
Hey, Johnny.
I don't like your stinkin' face.
Easy, Ronald.
The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.
Good luck for some, bad luck for others.
How can I assist you, my friend from the mystical East?
Uh-oh.
Haven't been here since Smiley kicked the bucket.
Was a 3-day wait just to get your shirts pressed.
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day, he sure liked to make a mess in the after-hours, if you know what I mean.
See you in the morning.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest.
She will always be the enemy.
Here it is.
Just rub some on your shoulder.
Smiley's Oriental cure-all.
Works like a charm.
Now, honey,
I didn't forget about you.
It's alright there. It's okay.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.
Sorry about the tap I gave ya.
I thought you knew the sword.
Smiley was always yabberin' on about a guy who was gonna roll into town.
But I shoulda figgered.
What do you call her?
I do not know.
Oh. She's not yours?
Where's her folks?
Dead.
Oo-ee, best we find you another diaper.
Alright.
Smiley like your uncle or something?
Friend.
Well, if you were his friend, maybe he would like for you to take over his laundry.
-- Do not know how.
-- So I'll teach ya.
I always done the laundry around here.
That's how I repaid Smiley for teaching me the sword.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
You stay here, I'll teach you how to tie a diaper properly.
We'll be partners, 60:40.
You are the 40.
Alright now, time to get to work.
Dang, you're slower than molasses in January.
You clean that real good, yellow boy.
As clean as Snow White's panties--
If I find the smallest bit of condor crap on my fancy duds...
- Well, we gonna have us--
Didn't I tell you I'd rip 'em off if you don't watch yourself?
Let go, evil midget!
Come on, Eight-Ball, we were just havin' us some fun.
- - Really?
- - Ah!
Okay... okay...
Let go.
- Get outta here!
How 'bout a home-cooked meal for you and your little 'un?
Once that Ferris wheel is finished, it's gonna bring everybody rushin' back,
And then we can take the word
"travelling" out of "travelling circus."
Hey, Ron.
Welcome to the
Eighth Wonder of the World!
Get down here!
The chow bell ringin'!
Ha!
Bravo, bravo.
Gonna grab some vittles with us?
No thanks.
Not hungry.
I-I-I b-baked a cake.
Come on, Ron!
What the hell's up with her?
You, I knew you was trouble the moment you walked into this--
Sounds even better from inside.
You ever seen one of these before?
The sound it's makin'?
It's called "opera."
Day my poppa found his first chunk of gold, he went out and bought this thing.
Listen.
Here's my favorite part.
So at the edge of the desert, in a busted town full of broken people, the warrior began to learn stuff he shoulda learned a long time ago.
No, no! Rough!
Like the joy of gettin' dirty things clean.
Yes!
Woo hoo! That's me!
Thank you!
I told you to aim at the line, not at the coin!
All right!
He also learned the joy of losing.
You're gonna need blood and bone of about 100 dead buffaloes as fertilizer.
Smiley always tried to get something to grow.
Never, ever lasted too long.
He learned you could be happy workin' with folks.
And findin' the simple peace in some private time after a hard day's work.
What's takin' you so long?
Come on, Skinny!
You gonna miss it. Come on.
And he found that it's nice to have a few friends around when the sun goes down.
But most of all, the warrior learned there's a heck of a lot more pleasure makin' things grow than there is in cuttin' 'em down.
You bunch of pups!
Gimme back that goddamn bottle!
You win.
Show me what you got.
God damn!
I shoulda never taught you this game!
You a shark with a poker face.
What happened to her?
Please!
Help me!
-- Help me!
-- Lynne!
-- Please! Let her go!
-- Someone, help me!
-- Eight-Ball!
-- Lynne!
Hungry?
No?
Pretty thing.
Aagh!
Agh! Aah!
Damn you!
Noooo!
No! Lynne! Lynne!
Agh!
No!
No!
Only thing was, when we went to bury her, she was still breathing.
Never known nobody that close to kickin' it.
We didn't know what to do wit' her, if'n she was gonna live or die.
So we just put her in bed and waited.
Two days, and she was eating soup.
By the day three, she was already sitting up somehow and slinging daggers at the wall.
But God ain't fair.
And some people just ain't cut out for the knife.
Dang it.
My arm ain't worth a damn.
It is not your arm.
What'd you say?
Ouch!
Now you sure about this?
'Cause I'm not so good with my eyes open.
Throw.
I can't do it.
Do not talk. Focus.
It is your heart that shakes.
You dead?
Not yet.
Sure you're not fountainin' blood or anything, are ya?
Oh, shit!
Ha!
I did it!
Thank you,
Mr. Sad Flute.
Smiley told me everything.
I just taught you to focus.
Why you do that?
Okay.
I've always been dyin' to know.
Why are y'all called
The Sad Flutes?
So you got lady Sad Flutes, too?
Sad Flutinas or somethin'?
Yes.
Wow! That's nice.
Jumpin' in the moonlight and kissin' as you both fly under the stars to the tunes of The Sad Flutes--
We are called Sad Flutes because when you cut the throat, the last sound is like a sad flute.
Dang!
Skinny, sure know how to throw a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?
To be strong.
That it?
My father was working in the field.
I was helping him.
A swordsman came.
Killed my father.
Just to test his sword.
That musta hurt you somethin' bad.
Not hurt. Angry.
Course.
No.
I was angry at my father.
Here. Take it.
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.
She said, "If you hold it over your heart when you're sad, it takes away all your sadness."
It works.
Kinda.
Present?
Yeah.
That is your only friend here.
Take good care of it.
Yes, master.
Oh, tarnations.
Only to protect, not kill.
What am I gonna kill in this town, an armadillo?
Is that what I think it is?
You've sealed it.
So they cannot hear.
Hear what?
The weeping.
Of all the souls I have taken.
Who's listenin'?
My past.
And if it hears?
No more music.
This is a big country.
Where do we look?
Do not look.
We listen.
He will show.
Think of the sword as part of the body.
Like a finger.
Like a tooth.
Rather think of it like metal slicin' through a herd of buffalo!
Show me what Smiley taught you.
You do not have the power.
Well, thank you very much.
I did not know that.
But you are fast.
Just have to be faster.
Ouch!
Ouch! Is this 'cause of yesterday?
'Cause I said I was sorry!
What? Cut it out, Skinny.
I'm serious!
You are slower than molasses in January.
Come on, then!
Ah! Ouch!
Cut it out, Skinny!
Ow!
Stop it, Skinny!
Cut it out!
I'm serious!
Stop!
You bearded nut!
Merry Christmas,
Laundry Man!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Yeah!
We go!
May I have this dance?
Whose birthday?
Well...
It's sort of a long story.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, ya young punks!
Ya gonna take me for a spin or what?
I win.
No.
Until your enemy's heart stops, you have not won.
Is that so?
Did that stop your heart?
Ha! That's better!
Merry Christmas!
I didn't get my invitation.
Has anyone seen it?
No? Huh.
Never mind.
We're all here now.
No harm done.
Ho, ho, ho.
And what did Santa bring you, little boy? Huh?
Why... if it ain't a clown.
You're looking so sad.
Huh.
You know, I never found clowns that funny myself.
Don't worry, clown.
I'm a pretty good shot.
Especially when I've been drinking.
Hey!
Don't go wastin' good moonshine.
Wow.
This shit's smoother'n a calf's ass.
But this-- this party's for girls.
Let's all go to the spilloon!
What have we here?
Looks like we got ourselves another clown.
Take this clown for a walk.
Never quite understood the attraction of a circus.
Till now.
Join the others in Stockton.
I'll catch you up.
Hyah! Hyah!
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories
I'd like to revisit.
Follow me.
Dang it!
He killed my whole family!
God damn it, Baptiste, let me go or I swear I'm gonna--
-- I-I-I'm sorry, Lynne.
-- Lynne.
This ain't just for your protection, you know.
It's for the whole goddamn town.
Let me see!
We have a winner!
Gentlemen?
Maria!
He is your, uh... marido?
My apologies.
I am not the kind of man who sleeps with a married woman.
No.
Por favor.
Gracias, Senor!
Mommy! No!
Oh!
But their daughters...
Oh, that's a completely different matter.
Clean them up.
You get a bullet in the head for every louse I find.
I once strung a man up by his own hamstrings because he cooked me a steak well-done.
What?
Find that funny?
Or is it because of this?
Thank you, gentlemen.
This girl says she'll serve herself up to you instead of the spics.
Have we, uh, met before?
No. We haven't.
This is bound to be a night you will never forget.
You have good teeth.
I like that.
Colonel, as you unwrap me,
I'm sure you will find there's a whole lot more of me to like.
I have no doubt of that.
And though I may be young,
I was hopin' you could teach me a thing or two.
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.
Sharp pain can bring sharp pleasure.
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.
Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.
Lynne!
She's not here!
Now I, I might say some things during.
Feel free to answer if you like.
Nothing is too wrong.
I've been waitin' my whole life for a place where it's right to be wrong.
You know, I don't think any part of the body is dirty or bad.
Just as long as it's well-scrubbed
Yes.
Assemble.
Now.
Now where do you plan to begin the inspection?
I like where the skin creases...
Go on.
Between your nice... big...
Moment I smelt your neck... it all came flooding back.
No girl could ever smell as sweet.
You changed it all.
My world.
My face.
You changed my life, little girl.
And now I'm--
I'm going to change yours.
That certainly is a beautiful scar
I gave you.
A hard-on for a scar.
Now that is wrong.
Oops.
I forgot.
Nothing tonight is wrong.
Tell the cook to fry up some potatoes
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you what I was so generously offering ten years ago.
Enjoy the show.
No! He's mine.
-- Lynne...
-- Are you all right?
Cover me!
Hold on!
Lynne!
Agh!
Pull it off.
-- She got the wrong guy.
-- That ain't him.
Oh, God help us.
Merry Christmas!
Sweet mother of God, it's a goddamn butcher shop in here!
I must go or you will all be in danger.
We're in danger already.
Colonel's on the loose.
That's right.
Lynne here smoked the wrong guy.
Now the Colonel's coming back, and he's bringing the whole damn family.
We need the guy who did that butcher job in the saloon.
Well, I say we all just pack up and leave.
He's right! If you stay and fight, you'll die like rats.
Well, we'll die like rats with rifles.
What rifles?
You got a Chink with a sword and a buncha juggling idiots.
-- How dare you?!
-- That ain't all we got.
Hey!
Beth will understand.
Follow me.
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?
You did what you had to do.
You coulda just grabbed April and hit the trail.
But you didn't.
Knowing saving me would ruin every new thing you found here.
This New World, without you... not so new.
Hey, let's say somehow they all come and go and we're still breathin'.
You're still gonna leave, right?
That is the plan.
Um...
Maybe I could go with you?
Just think about it, alright?
Hey!
That's my primo cactus juice!
Yee-haw! Whoo!
I knew what you was from the get-go.
Don't need to look at the size of a man.
I can smell the blood.
It was on you, too.
Yeah.
Good.
Now, get my jacket clean if you can.
If I'm gonna die,
I want to look good doing it.
Why die?
'Cause we only got about a hundred sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.
That ain't much more
'n to sting them with.
You also have that.
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.
You do a good shooting.
- For a drunken man.
Why you stopped the shooting?
Well, I just went around robbing banks, hitting trains till I ran into the only force that can truly bring down any outlaw.
Sheriff?
Woman.
When I was with her,
I didn't wanna run.
What happened then?
There was a couple of Rangers who hadn't forgot about me.
They ambushed me.
Bullets flyin' everywhere.
One of 'em found Beth.
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."
So far...
Well, at least till today...
I done what she asked.
But for fellas like me and you, we are what we are.
If you truly love somethin' or somebody, Laundry Man... you get as far away from 'em as possible.
'Cause we're sand.
They're flowers.
These are yours.
These are to kill.
Come.
Closer.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Remember these places.
Fastest way to kill your enemy.
I will remember.
Company charge!
Oh...
Hey!
What the hell? Agh!
Come on!
Whoo!
Get up there!
Everybody, up there!
Come on men! Agh!
Get him, down there!
Get down.
Shoot them!
Ah!
Okay, let's get out of here.
Shoot them!
Shit.
Dynamite!
Run for your lives!
Take cover!
Ya-hoo!
Shit! We did it!
They hit Jacques!
Come on!
Back to town!
Come on.
Let's close this damn circus down!
Burn it!
Come on!
Kill.
Run.
Hey, come on!
Into the hotel!
Keep low!
Get them!
Here! Take her!
Skinny!
I-I couldn't protect April.
Guard the hallway!
And don't let a damn soul into this room!
What the--
Agh!
One more step, and she's soup.
I said stop!
Yah!
Agh!
That sure is a purty scar
I gave you.
Agh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ugh!
I'll see you in Hell, little girl.
Wear something nasty.
Yaah!
Is this the new life you have found?
Funny.
Look much like the old one.
Do you think you will tell her that you kill her mother, her father and her entire clan?
She is the enemy.
She will always be the enemy.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest.
Kill her now.
You do not belong here.
I do.
I did.
You have the perfect body for an assassin but the heart of a priest.
Your heart will become your biggest enemy.
You must kill your biggest enemy.
We are assassins.
All that we love, we will destroy.
You are assassin.
All that you love, you'll destroy.
Did we win?
We survived.
Some of us.
I'm not goin' with you.
Am I?
I guess that's the end of them.
No.
It is just the beginning.
What about the baby?
She gonna be safe?
They are listening for this to cry.
Not her.
That's right, Sand Man.
Keep walkin'.
The warrior walked away.
And legend has it, he never stopped walkin', always making sure to keep as much distance as possible between himself and the little gal he loved.
How much?
Free.
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!
You act like you've never been here before.
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.
Can you picture how drop-dead gorgeous this city is in the rain?
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s, in the rain; the artists and writers.
Why does every city have to be in the rain?
What's wonderful about getting wet?
I mean, could you ever picture us moving here after we're married?
Oh God, no.
I could never live out of the United States.
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels, and not gotten, you know, caught up in that, just, grinding out movie scripts...
I'll tell you something:
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills, the pool, everything, in a second.
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.
We're 30 minutes from town.
Imagine the two of us settling here.
We could do it, I mean, if my book turns out.
You're in love with a fantasy.
I'm in love with you.
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.
Let's meet 'em.
There are our sightseers.
If I never see another charming boulevard or bistro again, I...
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.
I could see myself living here!
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me. "
I can see myself just strolling along the Left Bank with a, you know, baguette under my arm, headed to Café de Flore to scribble away on my book.
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast. "
In this traffic, nothing moves.
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.
I'm excited about this corporate merger between our folks and the French company, but otherwise,
I'm not a big Francophile.
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into... By the way, it's fine for your father and I to disagree.
That's what a democracy is.
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party, and I happen to think you almost got to be
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!
But it doesn't mean we don't respect each other's views, am I right?
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.
Let's do that.
- Your father is just...
- Inez?
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.
Oh my G... What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.
Well, you... you didn't mention you were going to be here.
No, it was sudden. Um...
Paul got invited to lecture at the Sorbone. Sorbonne.
Oh, how wonderful!
Well, uh, Dad's here on business, and we just decided to
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.
That's great.
We can spend some time together.
Well, I think we have a lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?
- We're driving to Verrsailles.
- Versailles...
- Versailles.
- Oh,
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!
But it's too... uh...
We're late... I think what we're...
Tomorrow we're locked in to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...
You know I actually had a professor that dined there, and saw James Joyce!
Yeah, you know, like a million years ago, and apparently, Joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters.
Is that...
That's the end of the story?
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.
I hope you're not going to be as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.
Well, I mean, they're your friends, and I have to admit
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.
He's brilliant.
You know, I had such a crush on him in college, and Carol's very bright.
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.
You should give him your book to read.
Oh, come on. Why?
No, because he could critique your writing, and maybe show you why you're having so much trouble.
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot.
- Until now.
- Please... Gil...
Honey, just promise me something.
If this book... doesn't pan out, that you'll stop eating your brains out, and just go back to doing what you do best.
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...
Do you really want to give it all up just to struggle?
- Well...
- Mmm?
Mmm?
Why would you... want to do that?
I believe Louis moved his court here, uh, in 1682.
Originally, all this was swampland.
In fact, if I'm not mistaken, uh... in Old French, the word "versailles" means, uh, something like,
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled. "
- Is that right?
Uh... The... uh, middle section here uh... is... uh, 
French classical style at its height.
Uh... The work, I believe, of... uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)
- Yes.
- Uh... Mansart... I think...
- Manzard.
- ... and Charles le Brun, I believe.
Yes, that's right.
I could get used to a summer home like this.
- I know you could.
- Me, too, except, remember: in those days, they only had baths, and I'm definitely a shower man.
Where are you two planning on moving after you get married?
Uh... Malibu.
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.
I'm pushing for a little attic in Paris with a skylight.
- La bowhem?
- Yeah, all that's missing is the tuberculosis.
Exactly. Thank you.
I mean, you know, the problem is that he's not exactly sure
- he can write a novel.
- Really?
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's... you know, and... well, everyone loves your movies.
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.
Why don't you tell them about the lead character that you're working on right now?
- Yes! - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.
Well, dear, you don't have to tell them the whole plot, just the character.
- No, no, no.
- Okay.
He works in a nostalgia shop.
- What's a... What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past, people who think that their lives would be happier if they lived in an earlier time.
And just which era would you have preferred to live in, Miniver Cheevy?
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.
Oh, I see! And no global warming, no TV and suicide bombing, and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!
Usual menu of clichéd horror stories.
You know, nostalgia is denial.
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be more than happy living in a complete state of perpetual denial.
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy is called "golden-age thinking. "
- Touché.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in.
It's a flaw in the Romantic imagination of those people who... who find it difficult to cope with the depressive.
- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.
Diamonds for a wedding band.
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see it in the back row when he puts it on my finger.
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.
It's your choice. What can I say?
Gil is... he's smart, and he's very successful.
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.
Well, that frightens me.
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu, if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.
- Camille? No.
- Yes.
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.
Yes, he did marry Rose,
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.
Are you arguing with the guide?
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.
Yeah, actually, she's right.
I recently read a two-volume biography on Rodin, and
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it. I was surprised because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah, the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.
Paul is an expert on French wine.
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.
When did you read the biography on Rodin?
Me? Why would I read a biography on Rodin?
I will always take a California wine, but,
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?
Come on. I can't stand that guy.
Um... How 'bout
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.
Now, which would you prefer here?
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just start drinking them all again. I don't know.
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.
Oh, maybe it's because of the pheromones that you're giving off.
These pheromones are driving me mad!
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh... Sex and alcohol.
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire but kills the performance, according to the Bard.
Have you tasted the '61?
It is divine!
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59, and I prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling.
So, Carol... Carol and I are gonna go dancing.
We heard of a great place. Interested?
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on! but I need to get a little fresh air.
Oh, come on! Come on!
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess over where the fire exits are, then...
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.
I am very democratic, and Paul is a marvelous dancer.
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk, go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired, and I've been dying to go dancing, and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.
I'll get a cab. Taxi!
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab. I'm walking.
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to look over his novel and critique it for him.
- That would be great!
- Would you?
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!
And you wouldn't pull any punches?
- Well, I certainly won't be letting you know I won't do that.
- No.
I do that about you.
See, but, the problem is, when it comes to his writing, he has absolutely no respect for anybody else's opinion.
Really?
Oh, excuse me! Parlez-vous...
Do you speak English?
- Uh... Hôtel Bristol?
- We don't speak English. Sorry.
Hey! Get in! Come on!
Get in! We're going to leave you!
- What?
- Come on, guy.
- I didn't hear you. What?
- Come on!
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!
Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.
You're making me tired. Come on!
I can't understand you.
I'm a little drunk! I can't...
What is this, an old Peugeot?
I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.
Come on, have a drink. Come on!
- Come on, buddy! Come on!
- OK.
Give me your hand. OK.
Sit down, here.
- Let's go in. Paris, the city of lights.
- Let's go! We're off!
OK, now, where are you guys taking me?
We're going to party!
Yeah, this isn't quite fair,
'cause I've already had a lot of red wine tonight.
Relax! Have some champagne.
I do like champagne, yeah...
Cheers! Cheers!
- The night is young. Drink up!
- I'm drinking!
- Have a drink!
Yeah, drink up!

- Oh, yeah!
- You're an American?
- If you count Alabama as America, which I do.
I miss the bathtub gin.
What do you do?
- Me? I'm a writer.
- Who do you write?
- Oh, right now I'm working on a novel.
- Oh, yes?
I'm Zelda, by the way.
Oh, Scott! Scott!
- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?
Gil... the...
You have the same names as...
As what?
Scott Fitzgerald and...
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.
Isn't she beautiful?
Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's... that's a coincidence... like... uh...
You have a glazed look in your eye.
Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.
I... I... keep looking at the man playing piano, and I believe it or not, recognize his face from some old sheet music.
I know I can be one of the great writers of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try, and then I hear the songs he writes, and then I realize: I'll never write a great lyric,
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?
That's not possible...
So... um...
- What kind of books do you write?
- I... I... I'm working on a... um...
Where am I?
Oh, I'm sorry. Don't you know the host?
Some friends have gotten together a little party for Jean Cocteau.
Hey, lady. What...
Are you kiddding me?
I know what you're thinking.
This is boring. I agree!
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.
We. Are. All. Bored.
Let's do Bricktop's.
Why don't you tell Cole and Linda to come with, and... um... uh... Gil? You coming?

[Joséphine Baker's "La Conga Blicoti"]
This is one of the finest establishments in Paris. They do a diamond whiskey sour.
Good evening, everyone!
A small shot of bourbon, please.
Greetings and salutations.
You'll forgive me.
I've been mixing grain and grape.
Now, this a writer. uh... Gil. Yes?
- Gil... Gil Pender.
- Gil Pender.
Hemingway.
Hemingway?
You liked my book?
Liked? I loved!
All your work.
Yes, it was a good book, because it was an honest book, and that's what war does to men.
And there's nothing fine and noble about dying in the mud, unless you die gracefully, and then it's not only noble, but brave.
Did you read my story?
What'd you think?
There was some fine writing in it, but it was unfulfilled.
- I might've known you'd hate it.
- But darling, you're too sensitive.
You liked my story, but he hates me!
Please, old sport, you make matters extremely difficult.
I'm jumpy. Suddenly I don't like the atmosphere here any more.
Ah! Where're you going?
To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.
- He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.
- Zelda, sweetheart...
If you're going to stay here and drink with him, I'm going with the toreador.
Would you bring her back at a reasonable time?
- She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
- She's exciting, and she has talent.
This month it's writing.
Last month it was something else.
You're a writer. You need time to write.
Not all this fooling around.
She's wasting you because she's really a competitor. Don't you agree?
Me?
Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.
Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.
You're a writer. You make observations.
You were with them all night!
Could we not discuss my personal life in public?
She's jealous of his gift, and it's a fine gift. It's rare.
- You like his work? You can speak for it.
- Stop it! Stop it.
You like Mark Twain?
I'm going to find Zelda.
I don't like the thought of her with that Spaniard.
May I?
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.
I think you can even make the case that all modern American literature comes from Huckleberry Finn.
- You box?
- No. Not really. No.
What're you writing?
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?
It's about a man who works in a nostalgia shop.
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia. and... Does that sound terrible?
No subject is terrible if the story is true.
If the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.
No good.
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?
- What is it?
- Would you read it?
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like
400 pages long, and I'm just looking for, you know, an opinion.
My opinion is I hate it.
I mean, you haven't even read it.
If it's bad, I'll hate it because I hate bad writing, and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?
I'm having a hard time, you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.
Writers are competitive.
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.
If you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer!
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?
No, I don't.
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel, but I'll tell you what I'll do.
Yes?
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.
She's the only one I trust with my writing.
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!
My heart is just racing right now!
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!
Papa!
You gotta...
OK, we never said where we were gonna meet.
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd, but I had fun.
What're you thinking about?
You seem like you're in a daze.
If I was to tell you that I spent last night with Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald,
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?
Your literary idols?
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...
What does that mean?
If I was with Hemingway, and Fitzgerald, and Cole Porter.
I'd be thinking brain tumor.
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly as we've come to know her through everything we've read in books and articles.
You know, charming, but all over the map.
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit. and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her, but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!
Come on! Get up! We should quit the idle chatter, because we're gonna be late.
You know, I'm not gonna...
I think I'm gonna stay here and do some work on my novel,
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!
Come look at these, Inez.
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?
- How much, sir?
- 18,000
- Thanks.
- What is that?
There a steal at $18,000.
$18,000 for this?
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.
I know, but it's very hard to find anything like this at home.
- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet, and we're trying to keep expenses down, so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.
Well, you get what you pay for.
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.
OK, you guys want to walk back?
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!
No, there's nothing beautiful about walking in the rain.
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.
Oh, right. Yes. Great.
And then, also, I have a big surprise for you after dinner.
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible... Trust me, you're gonna love this.
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.
Okay.
I don't understand.
Where are we going?
But, you made us rush through dinner, and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.
Profiteroles? You're going to have the most amazing adventure of your life!
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do, your jaw is gonna drop.
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything, so if I'm saying it's incredible,
- it's...
- OK.
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out, and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't acting more strange, when you find out.
- This is very...
- I know. I know.
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about, but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.
I am tired from the gym and a massage, so I'm gonna get this cab.
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look, you want to walk the streets of Paris, and take it in by night, that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.
Come on, just 10 more minutes, and then we can walk home.
If I'm asleep when you get in, don't wake me up.
What am I doing wrong?
Unless she's right, and I need to see a neurologist.
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk, but not out of control.
Lost, you walk along... this is the spot...
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.
The clock struck midnight...
Hello!
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.
Let me just jump in.
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.
5 if you counted Vicente, but he had lost his hand when a grenade went off and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.
And he was young, and brave.
And the hill was soggy from days of rain, and the hill sloped down toward a road, and there were many German soldiers on the road.
And the idea was to aim for the first group, and if our aim was true, we could delay them.
- Were you scared?
- Of what?
Getting killed?
You'll never write well if you're afraid of dying.
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably... maybe my greatest fear, actually.
Well, that's something all men before you have done. All men will do.
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?
Actually, my fiancée is pretty sexy.
And when you make love to her, you feel true, and beautiful passion, and you, for at least that moment, lose your fear of death.
No. That doesn't happen.
I believe that love that is true and real creates a respite from death.
All cowardice comes from not loving, or not loving well, which is the same thing.
And when the man who is brave and true looks Death squarely in the face like some rhino-hunters I know, or Belmonte, who's truly brave.
It is because they love with sufficient passion, to push death out of their minds, until it returns, as it does, to all men.
And then you must make really good love again.
Think about it.
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.
- No. I don't agree.
- But why?
Because...
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.
I'm glad you're here.
You can help decide which of us is right, and which of us is wrong.
I was just telling Pablo that this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.
It has a universality, but no objectivity.
No, no,no. You don't understand correctly.
You don't know Adriana. Look...
Look at the motion, the painting.
It's exactly what she represents!
No. You're wrong.
Look how he's done her: dripping with sexual innuendo, carnal to the point of smoldering, and, yes, she's beautiful, but it's a subtle beauty; an implied sensuality.
I mean, what is your first impression of Adriana?
Exceptionally lovely.
Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course... uh... you can see why he's lost all objectivity.
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.
A whore with volcanic appetites.
No, no! It's true if you know her!
Yes, with you, in private, because she's your lover, but we don't know her that way!
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment and turn her into an object of pleasure.
- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- Non.
No. No. I do not agree.
And what's this book of yours I've been hearing about?
Is this it?
- Yeah, this is... uh...
- I'll take a look.
Have you read it, Hemingway?
No, this I leave to you.
You've always been a fine judge of my work.
" "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"
"and its products consisted of memories. "
"What was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation,"
"had been transmuted by the mere passing of years"
"to a status at once magical and also camp. "
I love it.
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!
I'll start it tonight, but first, you and I have something to talk about.
I've been waiting for two months for a reply from that editor.
I sent him the piece you and I looked at, plus four others,
plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...
- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.
So were you really hooked with those opening lines?
Oh, the past has always had a great charisma for me.
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.
I always say that I was born too late.
Mmm. Me, too.
For me, la Belle Époque Paris would have been perfect.
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.
Another whole sensibility, the street lamps, the kiosques, the... horse and carriages, and Maxim's then.
You speak very good English.
- No, not really.
- No, you do!
How long have you been dating Picasso?
My God, did I just say that?
Pardon?
I don't mean to... I didn't mean to pry...
Were you born in Paris?
I was born in Bordeaux.
I moved here to study fashion.
But you don't want to hear all this.
Yes, I do.
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...
I... came here to study with Coco Chanel,
and I fell in love with Paris, and also, a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked, and it was a beautiful six months.
M.. M... Modigliani?
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?
You asked me, so I'm telling you my sad story.
With Braque, though, there was another woman.
Many.
And now, with Pablo.
I mean, he's married, but... every day, it's on-again, off-again.
I don't know how any woman can stay with him. He's so difficult.
My God, you take "art groupie" to a whole new level!
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...
But tell me about yourself.
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?
Because, you know, these days, so many Americans feel the need to move here.
Isn't Hemingway attractive?
I love his writing.
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.
Oh, you must stay here.
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.
And,
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...
- Really?
- ... so I want to hear the rest of it.
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh... yeah.
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you trying to find me, if that's all right?
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?
I wish that I could.
I cant, but hopefully I'll see you again eventually.
That would be nice.
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius who's great, but he's no Miró.
I'm Gil Pender.
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.
Little old Gil Pender has his novel with Gertrude. Stein.
Boy, that girl was so... lovely.
Well, it's a shame you two didn't come to the movies with us last night,
We saw a wonderfully funny American film.
Who was in it?
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.
I probably wrote it.
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and utterly lacking in any wit or believability,
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?
Was it?
What time did you get in last night?
Not that late... uh...
I was... uh...
I'm really finding these midnight strolls great for me creatively, without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.
Yeah. We'll see.
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.
[Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me"]
#... that simply mystifies me #
# Tell me why should it be #
# You have the power to hypnotize me #
You like?
Yes. Very beautiful.
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.
You like Cole Porter?
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to kind of think I'm a member of Linda and Cole's inner circle.
I'm kidding.
Very pretty lyrics.
- Very amusing.
- Charming.
Gil?
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol at the museum for the private showing.
OK. Yeah. Right.
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet, so you'll find it enlightening, I think.
Yeah. OK.
Let's get some culture.
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.
This man was the real father of abstract expressionism.
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.
I mean, I love Turner, but, I just find this... overwhelming.
If I'm not mistaken, it took him 2 years to complete this.
He worked out of Giverny, where he was frequently...
I heard that Monet, one of the things that he used to try to...
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.
Well, he was frequently visited by Caillebotte, an artist who I personally feel was underrated.
Ah. Now.
Here's a superb Picasso.
If I'm not mistaken, he painted this marvelous portrait of his
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.
Paul, I'm gonna have to differ with you on this one.
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.
You might learn something.
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken, this was a failed attempt to capture a young French girl named Adriana, from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me, who came to Paris to study costume design for the theater.
I'm pretty sure she had an affair with Modigliani, then Braque, which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.
Of course, what you don't get from this portrait is the subtlety, and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.
What have you been smoking?
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous, it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.
He's distracted by the fact that she was a absolute volcano in the sack.
Too rich for me.
Where'd Gil run off to?
Work.
Been walking around Paris. You know, the way the city's lit up at night allegedly inspires him, so...
But that's OK, because I'm going dancing with Paul.
Where's Carol? uh... She's in bed with a bad oyster, so I'll see you guys later.
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.
Bye, sweetie.
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.
- You sound skeptical.
- No.
I've seen what he earns, but sometimes I think he's got a... got a... part missing, and I didn't like his remark about
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent people trying to take back the country.
They are not crypto-fascist airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?
Nevertheless, I don't think your idea of having him followed
- is very practical.
- No?
I'd like to know where he goes every night.
Well, we know one thing: he doesn't go dancing.
Oh! Excuse me!
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.
Oh, Delfine?
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.
Good evening, Madame.
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.
I was at Gertrude Stein's, she's almost finished with my novel, and I run into this guy.
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here, come on over. Oh, I'm not going to crash the Fitzgeralds, but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...
Oh, Pablo's home.
- We had a... bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.
Isn't this a wonderful place to throw a party?
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!
Look at that!
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.
It's so nice to see you tonight.
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!
There she is, my little Adriana!
Isn't this little Parisian dream a moveable feast?
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away from that fugitive from
Málaga one way or another.
Between Belmonte and myself, whom would you choose?
You are both perfect.
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.
She chose Pablo.
Yes, she's chosen Picasso, but Pablo thinks women are only to sleep with or to paint.
What about you?
I think a woman is equal to a man in courage.
Have you ever shot a charging lion?
Never.
Would you like to know how that feels?
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?
- No.
- You?
Only for bargains.
Let's take another drink.
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.
Who wants a fight?
Well, I hope it was nothing serious with you and Pablo.
He's moody and possessive.
Artists are like children.
Well, you certainly understand why all these guys want to paint you,
'cause you have just about one of the best faces ever.
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?
Well, I guess I am lost.
Tell me more about your book.
My book is kind of a...
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.
I just want to walk around Paris with you.
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.
That's putting it mildly.
I can never decide whether
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,
I can give you a checkmate argument for each side.
You know, I sometimes think,
"How's anyone gonna come up with a book, or a painting, or a symphony or a sculpture that can compete with a great city?"
You can't, 'cause, like, you look around, every... every street, every boulevard is its own special art form.
And when you think that in the cold, violent, meaningless universe, that Paris exists, these lights...
I mean, come on, there's nothing happening on Jupiter or Neptune, but from way out in space you can see these lights, the cafés, people drinking, and singing...
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.
- You are a poet.
- Aw, come on.
It's just... You're very kind, but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.
See anything you like?
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.
When I was in Catholic school, one weekend my roommate and I, we paid a girl from Pigalle to come and teach us all her tricks.
- Honestly?
- Yeah.
Wow. That's...
That's... That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.
I love walking with you.
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.
God, is that who I think it is?
What is she doing here, staring into the water?
Oh my God!
Zelda, what are you doing?!
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.
They were... It was so obvious they were whispering about me, and the more they drank, the more he fell in love with her!
He... Scott loves only you.
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.
- How?
- Trust me. I know.
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna... I hate the way I look!
Don't do that!
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,
I've been having panic attacks, but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?
It's the... pill of the future.
You never said you were getting married.
Yeah. You know, it's still a... ways in the future.
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a... has a very sharp sense of humor, and she's attractive. She doesn't say that we agree on everything, but...
But the important things.
Yeah, or... actually, maybe the small things. The...
Sometimes there's a little bit of a disconnect with the big things.
She wants to live in Malibu, and wants me to work in Hollywood, and...
But I will say that we both like
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the... you know... the pita bread.
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.
I should go.
Pablo will be missing me.
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I... I... prefer to be by myself for a while, but thank you for the evening.
Bye.
Sir? It's a shame.
It's a shame.
We met, earlier tonight...
At the party!
Dalí, yes?
- Yes...
- Dalí!
- I remember!
- Dalí. Ya.
A bottle of red wine!
It can't be...
Yeah...
So?
Another glass for this man, please.
I love the language!
The French!
The waiters? No.
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?
The rhinoceros? Uh...
Haven't really thought about it.
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.
Sí. Your sad eyes.
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand, with one tear.
Yes! And in your tear, another face.
The Christ's face!
Yes, in the rhinoceros.
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in... a very perplexing situation.
<>Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!
My friends.
This... Señor Buñuel.
- Buñuel?
- Sí. Buñuel... and... Mr. Man Ray.
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.
Pender!
- Yes. And I am Dalí!
- Dalí. Yes.
You have to remember.
Pender is in a perplexing situation.
It sounds so crazy to say.
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but
I have to tell someone. I'm... from a... a different time. Another era.
The future. OK? I come... from the 2000th millenium to here.
I get in a car, and I slide through time.
Exactly correct.
You inhabit two worlds.
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?
Yeah, you're surrealists!
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.
At least, I think I love her.
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!
The rhinoceros makes love by mounting the female.
But... is there a difference in the beauty between two rhinoceroses?
There is another woman?
Adriana. Yes, and I'm... very drawn to her.
I find her extremely alluring.
The problem is that other men, great artists - geniuses - also find her alluring, and she finds them.
So, there's that...
A man in love with a woman from a different era.
I see a photograph.
I see a film.
I see an insurmountable problem.
I see...
...a rhinoceros.
Did you get any work done last night?
Yeah... I just...
I'm starting to think that maybe my book is too realistic.
That I'm missing some chances to let my imagination kind of go crazy, and not be so damn logical.
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.
You know? He said he's taking us to this beautiful little inn for lunch.
But, I mean, if you don't want to go, don't go.
I'm not missing it because of you.
Hello! Bonjour!
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.
OK, now, I understand he loved his wife and he also loved his mistress.
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible, to love two women at once?
Well, he loved them both, but in a different way.
You know...
That's very...
That's very French.
You guys are way... you know... much... more evolved in that department than we are.
Do you remember me?
I was in the...
- was in the group that...
- Yes!
The group with the pedantic gentleman.
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.
Here is... his photo.
I want to know where he goes each night.
What is your suspicion? Hm?
He's engaged to my daughter.
To marry. I want to make sure that she's making the right decision.
Naturally, discretion is paramount.
Well, you've come to the right place, Monsieur.
Monsieur Tisserant will personally keep track of the gentleman, and report about his whereabouts at night.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
Hey! Thank you for stopping.
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?
- Pender.
- Prufrock's like my mantra!
OK. Sorry. Sorry.
Listen. Where I come from, people measure out their lives with coke spoons.
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.
We're just in the middle of a little personal crisis.
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.
No, it's no secret.
Adriana has left Pablo, and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.
I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!
We talked about all this!
I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.
Muy devoto. Oh, he took her hunting kudu, but she'll be back to him.
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book, it's very unusual, indeed.
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.
We all fear death, and question our place in the universe.
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair, but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're going to be dining formal tomorrow night.
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.
Why not?
I don't understand it!
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.
He rewrites the rewrites, you know?
He says, "Picasso never left his studio. "
I said, "Gil, you have absolutely nothing in common with Picasso. "
He just looks at me.
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

- Yeah?
- He was your friend.
- Cole Porter? Yeah.
And don't forget about Linda.
She was a friend, too.
- You realize I was kidding?
- Yeah. I did realize.
You're a bit young.
Yeah. You seem a bit young to be so familiar with his work.
It's because he wrote many songs about Paris.
Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was in love with your hometown, or something.
- Are you a Parisian?
- Yes, monsieur.
"Yes, monsieur. " Feel free to call me Gil.
- What do I owe you?

Earrings...
Earrings...
Whoa! Oh my God!
What are you guys doing?
Daddy had chest pains.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.
- We can't take that chance.
- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.
Yeah. Right.
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.
- Balloon?
- I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.
Don't call the doctor!
Gil, why are you so dressed up?
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.
I was just doing a little writing.
Wh... You dress up and put on cologne to write?
No, no. I jumped in the shower, just for a second. You know how I think better in the shower, and I get the positive ions going in there?
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel when Daddy just... he went pale as a ghost.
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.
John, is there anything I can get, for your color to me looks
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.
I'm sure it's the beef bourguignon she made me have.
- What is that?
- Where?
- That in your hand.
- Nothing.
- That was a present!
- I know. I know.
I mean, it's not... It... It is!
- For me?
- Yes.
It's not... incredible...
It's from the flea market.
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,
That's what I'm saying.
Honey, it's for a special dinner that we're gonna have, then I'm going to give it to you.
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...
- ... that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?
Because it's understated, but elegant.
That's what you always say.
Cheap is cheap, is what I always say.
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...
- they are...
- A little simple.
I think... I thought you loved their simplicity.
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.
Where are my pearl earrings?
Did... Did you bring them?
I don't even remember you packing them.
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.
Inez, I told you to keep everything in the hotel safe!
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.
I... I know I saw them here this morning.
Well, I would report the theft right away.
You know, she was so snotty yesterday when I asked her...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not jump to any conclusions, OK?
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!
You don't do this to people!
Yes, you do, if they've stolen.
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!
You always take the side of the help, as usual!
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.
Good evening.
I'm Doctor Gérard.
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.
Look! Are these them?
I don't know.
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.
What the hell were they doing in the bathroom?
I don't know.
They were just...
But maybe you dropped them, and when you were putting them away, and the housekeeper must've picked them up. and placed them there, out in the open where we could see them easily.
That was really thoughtful of her.
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.
The important thing is they're not stolen.
It's one of your best, until now.
I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse we're going to buy one of his paintings for our personal collection.
I think 500 Francs is fair.
500 Francs for a Matisse?
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.
You know, I was wondering if maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over of the first few chapters of my book, and if you could just tell me if I'm heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great. and have you heard from Hemingway?
Oh, they've been back for days, now.
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.
It's over. With Picasso, too.
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.
By herself?
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.
They're doing it up there.
She'll be glad to see you.
Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...
Oh. What are you doing here?
I came to find you.
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at picking up on vibrations from people- women in particular.
I sense that there are some complicated feelings, maybe, that you have for me.
Aren't you gonna get married?
Well, everything's a little up in the air right now.
I don't know what is gonna happen.
Is there some place that we can talk? Maybe more quiet?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Oh, Mr. Buñuel!
I had a nice idea for a movie for you.
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner, when they try to leave the room, they can't.
Why not?
They just can't seem to exit the door.
- B... But why?
- Well, momento, when they're forced to stay together, the veneer of civilization quickly fades away, and what you're left with is who they really are: animals.
But I don't get it.
Why don't they just walk out of the room?
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?
Maybe when you're shaving one day, it'll tickle your fancy.
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?
What are you doing?
I don't know!
I did feel, for a minute there, while I was doing it, like I was immortal.
But you look so sad.
Because life is too mysterious.
This is the time we live in.
Everything moves so fast.
Life is noisy and complicated.
I've always been a logical person.
I've never
I never acted too crazy.
I didn't stay here.
When I first came out here,
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.
Don't laugh. I just want to...
I feel like I just want to let it go.
- Here.
- Oh!
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!
Go on. Here, put in on.
They're so beautiful!
Look!
Sir, Miss, away we go!
- Who are you?
- Come up. We're too late.
- Allez!
- Come on! Come on!
Oh, mon Dieu, this is so beautiful!
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...
Here it is: La Belle Époque!
Wow! I don't know what it is about this city!
It's like, I've got to write a note to the Chamber of Commerce.
Good evening!
Good evening! Welcome.
Thank you.
Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!
So ahead of the time!
Please, have a drink of champagne.
It's a party!
Champagne.
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,
and the Belle Époque, and here we are!
I don't know why, but I have this feeling that...
I don't know, like I can't... believe my luck.
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.
You lead the way.
Look!
Oh, my God!
Pablo admires him so much!
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.
But, we know he's a lonely man.
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.
Monsieur Lautrec?
- Yes?
- Good evening. We are great fans.
- Thank you, Madame.
- May we offer you a drink?
I would be delighted. Have a seat.
He's asking us to sit down with him.
This much French I do understand, and the gesture.
You are American?
Yes, I'm an American.
I could tell from the accent.
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.
Your drawings! Your attention!
We admire everything that you do.
- I love your drawings, also. - Bon soir! - Merci.
May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.
- Bon soir. - Enchantée.
- Bon soir. Enchantée.
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.
Unbelievable. Parlez-vous anglais?
- No, sir.
- He speaks a little.
No, no. I speak very well.
Absolutely. You want to see?
Degas and I were just talking about how this...
...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.
He said... He says that this generation is empty, and has no imagination.
Better to have lived during the... la Renaissance.
No! This is the golden age.
- Non.
- It's the golden age!
Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.
What is it you do?
I study high fashion.
That's why you're dressed like that.
I understand now!
The youthful clothes.
Would you introduce her to Richard?
- Oh, yes!
- Ah, oui. He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.
He's looking for someone to do costumes for the new ballet.
So, you're interested?
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.
Oh my God! I...
I don't live here.
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...
It's best not to go into too many details. We're...
We're temporarily passing through.
Can I speak with you a minute?
May I?
Enchanté..
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.
Let's never go back to the '20s!
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.
It's the start of La Belle Époque!
It's the greatest, most beautiful era Paris has ever known.
Yeah, but about the '20s, and the Charleston, and the Fitzgeralds, and the Hemingways?
I mean, I love those guys.
But it's the present.
It's dull.
Dull?
It's not my present.
I'm from 2010.
What do you mean?
I dropped in on you the same way we're dropping in on the 1890s.
You did?
I was trying to escape my present the same way you're trying to escape yours, to a golden age.
Surely you don't think the '20s are a golden age!
Well, yeah. To me they are.
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm telling you the golden age is La Belle Époque.
And look at these guys. I mean, to them, their golden age was the Renaissance.
You know, they're trade Belle Époque to be painting alongside
Titian and Michelango.
And those guys probably imagined life was a lot better when Kublai Khan was around.
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where it was like a nightmare, where I ran out of Zithromax.
And then I went to the dentist, and he didn't have any Novocaine.
You see what I'm saying?
These people don't have any antibiotics.
What are you talking about?
Adriana, if you stay here, and this becomes your present, then, pretty soon, you'll start imagining another time was really your, you know, was really the golden time.
That's what the present is.
That it's a little unsatisfying, because life's a little unsatisfying.
That's the problem with writers.
You are so full of words.
But I am more emotional, and I'm going stay, and live in Paris' most glorious time.
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision, but at least it was a choice.
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.
If I ever want to write something worthwhile, I have to, you know, get rid of my illusions, and then I'd be happier in the past, as where I want a home.
So...
Goodbye, Gil?
Goodbye.
Pender, I read your rewrite, and you're nicely on the right track.
You understood me clearly.
If the rest of the book reads as well when you're done,

- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book. but he did have one plot suggestion.
What's the suggestion?
Well, he doesn't quite believe that the protagonist doesn't see that his fiancée is having an affair right before his eyes.
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.
That's called denial.
Thank you.
You're crazy!
Paul and I?
Where did you get such an insane notion?
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.
He figured it out, and, guess what, it makes perfect sense.
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway, or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein, or Salvador Dalí!
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!
No, no. The past is not dead.
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.
I ran into him at a dinner party.
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.
I'm jealous, and I'm trusting.
It's cognitive dissonance.
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.
Inez, you can fool me, but you cannot fool Hemingway.
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.
OK. Yes! I did.
I was with Paul for a few nights, because he's romantic, and he speaks French, and you were always working, and maybe it's the mystique of this corny city, but... get over it, Gil.
You just put this in perspective when we get home.
I'm not... I'm not going back.
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with, you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...
I don't think we're right for each other.
What?
What are you saying?

- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!
We're breaking up.
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but just because we're...
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.

I mean, Mom's right about you.
You have this part missing.
Yeah, I said that first.

- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be a martyr, but I think you'll be better off without me.
- I really do.

- I don't know.

Good to see you.

I'm returning from dinner with friends.
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.

I was just out for a walk.
Yeah, I'm actually... I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.
You know, I thought about you the other day.
- Really?
- Yeah, because my boss got a whole new album of Cole Porter songs.
That made you think about me?
I like to be thought of that way.
You're on your way home right now?
Yes.
Can I walk with you, or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.

Now, I'm sure y'all have better things to do on such a beautiful day...

The accusations against my niece are all spurious lies.
For, according to the Weather Channel, and you can verify this on Google...
...there were unseasonably strong gusts from the east...
...which caused untold destruction up and down the South Carolina coast.
So my niece will go back to the institution...

<font color="#808080">MACON:</font> Lena?
The curse began with your great-great-great grandmother.
Genevieve Katherine Duchannes.
She had the temerity to fall in love with a mortal...
...your ancestor, Ethan Carter Wate.
In 1864, he deserted.
Came home to his Genevieve.
But he was killed in front of her eyes, by Union soldiers...
...who were ransacking Greenbrier during the battle of Honey Hill.
And in her madness, in her grief, she used a spell that is forbidden to us.
To bring him back to life.
A spell that left a curse?
No Caster may reverse death.
So she lost her soul, consumed by darkness forever.
But the spell worked.
If Genevieve loved him, why'd she kill him?
In that kind of darkness, there's not even a memory of love, only power.
Everything has a price.
<font color="#808080">LENA:</font> You told me my mother was dead.
You lied to me. Why? Why?
Lena! Our words, our language...
...cannot explain all that there is.
There are other ways someone can die to us.
<font color="#808080">MACON:</font> No, I'll tell her.
Your mother, Sarafine, is the most powerful Dark Caster of all of us.
She lives in the darkness, in the shadows.
If she does appear, it's in the guise of someone else.
She has no love for you.
That's what I was trying to protect you from.
I'm gonna be claimed for the Dark, no matter what?
No, not necessarily.
I know your true nature, it's strong.
Sarafine recognizes it too.
She knows that without the curse...
...your true nature would claim you for the Light.
No, I believe the curse can be broken.
But you need to have a will that's so strong you control your own nature.
- That's what I told her.
- First thing you do, get rid of him.
- Wait, what?
- Sarafine's using you.
- That's not true.<font color="#808080">
MACON:</font> - Listen to me, Lena.
- No, listen to me...
- Ethan, Manson's right.
If you're to break this curse, you have to control your emotions.
And loving this boy puts you in terrible danger!
How could you know?
You never loved anyone.
You despise mortals.
You never even had a friend, even in our world. How could you know?
I know that no good can come from us loving a mortal.
Lena, listen to me. There's gotta be a way, another way to break the curse.
<font color="#808080">AMMA:</font> Macon!
- Don't even think that, young man!
- No!
You'll get the both of you killed.
You have to get out of her life.
Do you hear me?
Lena, say your goodbyes.
<font color="#808080">ETHAN:</font> Mason's keeping Lena at Ravenwood.
He won't let me see her.

Well, on account of his friendship with you.
Oh, I'm sorry you had to go to that trouble, ma'am.

But you know what?
I don't care about them, about the curse.
You are not going Dark and you are not losing me.
No matter what you do, no matter what they do to me, I'm still here.
Now what does that tell you?

It used to be under Washington, D.C. until Nancy Reagan made them move.
She was the only mortal they were ever scared of.
They know a Caster's here.
Amma, why didn't you tell us about this?
A Keeper has to be asked.
A Keeper, as in you're a...?
The Caster Library has been the responsibility of Seers like me for generations.
Something I had no choice about either, by the way.
And these books hold the histories of the Casters from around the world...
...the laws that keep balance between Light and Dark.
Hey! Get away from that.
Macon comes here every day and reads every book he can for the Forbidden Spell.

It's feeling scared and not being able to do anything about it...
...until you don't feel that way anymore, until you can see your way out of it.
And I yelled at you because I care about you!
That's what normal people do, who love each other...
...when one of them is acting like a brat.
Now, would you please stop raining on me?
I'm sorry.
You've got to get away from me.
I don't know what I do, it just happens.
You still don't get it, do you?
I don't want to be any further away from you than I am right now...
...one way or another.

Well, love's a risk for anybody.
I mean, "kill you" hurt you.
Go ahead.

Oh! Ooh, ah.
What part of "You cannot touch it if you are not a Caster" don't you understand?
There were Casters in the Civil War?

Just because they're supernatural don't make them any smarter.

How do you believe in all this and still believe in God?
God created all things, didn't he?
It's only men who go and decide which ones are mistakes.

Instead, I just want to talk to you.
About a word we don't hear much anymore:
Sacrifice.
It's not what I'd call a modern word.
People hear the word "sacrifice" and they become afraid...
...that something will be taken away from them.
Or they'll have to give up something they can't live without.
"Sacrifice," to them, means "loss"...
...in a world telling us we can have it all.
But I believe true sacrifice is a victory.
Because it requires our free will...
...to give up something or someone you love...
...for something or someone you love more than yourself.
I won't lie to you.
It's a gamble.
Sacrifice won't take away the pain of loss.
But it wins the battle against bitterness.
The bitterness that dims the light on all that is of true value in our lives.

I'm sorry that we never got to hang, but I always wanted to tell you...

Thanks. That's really nice of you to say.
- You're leaving?

I'm going to check out NYU.
Great. It's good.

It's on the way.

Play on the shore and don't get too near the water.
If you fall in, the Big Lobster will grab you.
If he does, I'll eat him.
If you eat the Big Lobster, then the demon will eat you.
There are no demons here.
Really?
Look. What's that in the water?
Aha! It's me!
See, I'm fine. I was just joking. Look!
Go, Daddy!
Great! Great!
Hurray Daddy! Yay, Daddy!
You're so silly.
Sheng!
What are you doing here? Where's your Dad?
My condolences.
Thank you, your Holiness.
Here's a little money and two ancient salted fish.
Please accept them.
As a Taoist priest, my sole purpose is to help the world.
I can't accept such precious things.
Hey everyone!
Now that the demon's been caught...
...it's up to you to decide what to do with it.
Kill it!
Isn't it dead already?
Kill it again!
Revenge!
Revenge!
I... want... revenge!
You're all mistaken. That's not the killer.
It's just a stingray.
He's gentle, kind-hearted and cheerful.
A fish of good character. Just a bit too big.
Who are you?
I am the unshaven Buddhist monk,
Chen Xuan Zang.
I am a demon-hunter.
We know about stingrays, but we've never seen one so big.
The Priest says it's possessed by a demon.
Mayor, look.
That's really not the demon you're looking for.
A good father was savagely killed by the demon.
How his innocent family suffers.
While you ...you just talk nonsense.
You scumbag!
Scumbag! Scumbag! Scumbag!
Everyone, listen to me.
The real demon has not yet appeared.
Shut up!
Have you ever lost a husband?
Madam, I don't have a husband.
Have you ever lost a husband?
Madam, believe me.
I've never really had a...
Kill him!
This stingray is innocent!
The demon is still in the river!
Everyone's got to stay out of the water!
That's nonsense!
He's clearly working with that demon.
String him up! Burn him!
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
Everyone, listen up.
I've already killed the demon.
It's perfectly safe here.
You can go in the water with nothing to fear.
Go!
Go in!
It's fine. It's really safe.
Look, it's safe.
It's really safe now.
We're safe now.
Hey!
Danger! Get out, fast!
Hey! Danger! Move!
Get out! Danger!
Hey!
Danger!
Look over here! Over there!
The demon...
Help!
Your Holiness, why did that happen?
We're fine... we're fine.
Once you're on shore, everything's okay.
Yes... everyone stay calm.
Get on shore. We'll be safe here.
Sheng, Sheng!
Give us back our money!
What are you doing?!
You tricked us!
What are you talking about?
I caught a demon for you, didn't I?
Who knew there was another one?
What do we do now?
Stay calm.
We're so high up... we'll be fine.
How high are we?
Very high... look!
Don't move! Stay down, and you'll be fine!
Don't run! Stay down!
Just play dead! Don't run!

Come out!

My baby! My baby!
Please help!
Please save my baby.
Please help!
Hey, this robe was very expensive.
Sorry... please help.
Hey, you have to compensate me.
Okay... that really, really hurts. Let go!
No.
My baby's back! My baby's come back!
Thank you!
You're very welcome.
Your Holiness.
Your skills are greater than mine, your Holiness. Please help.
No I won't. Hands off!
I can't defeat him in the water...
...but if you and I jump down and bounce him onto shore...
Then we can do something.
Hands off or I'll kill you!
I swear! I will beat you to death!
I'm cold-blooded!
Thank you, your Holiness.
Let me!
Let me!
Let me!
Kill it!
Make way! Make way!
Calm down!
Everyone listen up. Let me handle it.
I'm a professional demon-hunter.
300 Nursery Rhymes
My child, my child... why are you so bad?
Bullying, cheating... how can you do that?
Learn to be good... learn to be loving.
Love is in your heart... filling your life with warmth.
Be good, be good and come home soon.
My arms are always ready to embrace you.
My child, repent with a sincere heart.
You'll always be my dearest child.
Be good, be good and come home soon.
Study hard for a better future.
Turn back and become a filial child again.
We were all born pure, like children.
You're a demon-hunter too?
Based on what?
The Demon Hunter's Handbook.
What Handbook?
300 Nursery Rhymes?
It brings out the goodness within demons.
We are all born naturally good.
And also I add my own unique style... hope everyone likes it.
Says who?
My Master.
And you believe him?
You might not... but I certainly do.
Actually, I like childish pranks too.
Look!
She is the real demon-hunter.
Hello, everyone! You're very welcome!
Thank you!
Just let me know if you have any trouble again.
No need for this. All donations are welcome!
All donations are welcome!
Master
Xuan Zang
I failed again, Master.
I know.
The Water Demon you encountered today...
...used to be kind.
One day he was saving a child by the river.
The villagers had mistaken him for a kidnapper.
They killed him and tossed his body into the river...
...feeding his body to the fish and creatures.
He was filled with such hatred and resentment that his spirit transformed into the Water Demon.
He returned to seek revenge on the villagers.
A question, Master, if I may?
Is the 300 Nursery Rhymes really that powerful?
Why do you ask?
I just want to destroy the demons, like the other demon-hunters.
Killing is not the best way.
Never forget our principles and beliefs.
A good man turns into a demon when his heart is overcome by evil.
We must remove the evil and keep only the goodness.
The 300 Nursery Rhymes wakes up our inner goodness, conquering the evilness in our hearts.
Are you doubting our beliefs?
No.
Just my own powers.
But you did your best.
You saved a baby, didn't you?
I could have saved more people...
...but I wasn't able to.
Master, you didn't see that girl.
She was only 4 or 5.
And I just couldn't save her.
They're dead because of me.
So many deaths.
Master, I'm so useless.
Maybe you chose the wrong disciple?
I did not choose the wrong disciple.
Absolutely not.
You're just missing that little 'something'.
What's that little 'something'?
Just that little 'something'.
When you attain your enlightenment, you willfully understand and by that time...
...you will know the boundless powers of the Nursery Rhymes.
Go, go.
Master!
I know... just keep at it.
Master!
Just go!
How come there's no one here?
Great! We can be alone now.
Don't worry, Handsome.
Let's not hold back anymore.
Calm yourself.
I can't... just looking at your gorgeous face.
Then stop looking.
You're terrible.
Welcome, you two! To the Gao Family Inn.
This way, please... you came just in time.
It's empty now, but soon it will be crowded.
Allow me to present our signature dish.
Take a look.
This is our famous roast pig... freshly made.
Crispy skin, tender meat, juicy... yet not greasy.
How do they make such delicious roast pig?
Even the decor here is unique.
Look at those gorgeous candelabrum.
But not as gorgeous as you, of course.
Must you keep talking about my looks?
Are you so shallow?
What girl doesn't want a handsome boy?
Come on... don't be angry.
Come on... let me look at you.
Look until you get so sick of me and die.
Did you get enough?
How come you're still alive?
What did you think of our roast pig?
It was great! Did you make it?
No, no. The owner KL Hog is our chef.
Presenting the "Master of Meat"
Um... yummy and tasty.
Sir, how did you make the pork so delicious?
Hey! She asked you a question.
So rude of you not to answer.
Come, let's go!
Sir... please join us.
I have so much to say to you.
Come on... let's go!
Or you won't get to see my gorgeous face.
Oh, really? Thank goodness!
I was just joking.
Why would I want you to be upset?
Just turn away.
I'm already upset.
You're so mean.
Sir, do you find me unattractive?
Then why won't you talk to me?
Please just say something.
I beg you... please talk to me.
Welcome to the Gao Family Inn!
You certainly have good taste.
All our guests love our food and décor.
Look at our stylish candelabrum.
Doesn't it feel romantic?
From the number of repeat customers...
...you can tell how good our food is.
Come...
This is our signature dish.
Our famous roast pig.
It's crispy outside, yet tender inside.
It melts in your mouth.
I guarantee you'll be back for more.
We're very busy today.
Please wait... I'll find a table for you.
Sir.
I have a table for you. This way please.
I'm a demon-hunter.
Just reveal yourself.
What do you mean?
Oh really?! Go ahead!
Okay, you're asking for it.
Miss, can I help?
Yes! How can I help?
Get lost.
Sure.
Please no more. I'm gonna explode!
Can you be more gentle? Thanks.
Enough of this!
Just come out!
Come on!
Come on!
Come out and help.
I've been waiting to help. What should I do?
I've got the demon's essence in his throat.
Now go suck it out quickly.
Okay.
How do I suck it out?
With your mouth.
You mean you want me to use my mouth...
...to suck it out?
How else?
Got it!
May I ask... is there another method?
Hurry! I can't hold on much longer!
How about I hold him down and you suck instead?
What do you think?
You idiot! Stop fooling around!
Or we'll gonna die!
Okay, fine. I can do this.
Sorry... I can't.
Run!
He won't come chasing after us, will he?
No, he's injured, too.
Are you all right?
No big deal... it's nothing.
Give me a hand.
Demon hunters don't care about formalities.
Push this pressure point for me.
That Pig Demon was very powerful.
Of course.
We could receive the highest bounty for him.
Isn't that what you're here for?
I'm not doing this for money.
I'm doing this to help the people.
With skills like yours?
You must have a death wish.
I don't care.
That weapon of yours is amazing.
It's my demon-hunting heirloom... the Infinite Flying Ring.
Infinite Flying Ring.
You're wounded.
What?
Your nose is bleeding.
A little too much excitement.
I'm Chen Xuan Zang. What's your name?
My name is Duan.
Miss Duan... thank you for saving my life.
You're thanking me?
Miss Duan, Miss Duan.
When a girl closes her eyes, it means she wants you to kiss her.
Stop pretending.
Come on... you know you want to.
Xuan Zang. So... how did it go last night?
What are you talking about?
You were flirting.
What do you mean, Master? That's impossible.
How do you feel about romantic love?
That's just Lesser Love... it's got nothing to do with me.
I'm in search of Greater Love.
Want a bite?
No.
Master, please don't.
It's against our beliefs.
Eating the goose is just a physical act.
You may want something but you say otherwise.
That's the little 'something'.
How dare you eat my goose leg! Have you paid?!
I have no money.
No money?!
Stop right there, baldy!
Stop running!
Master, so you knew about the Pig Demon all along.
The man's name was KL Hog.
He was as ugly as a boar...
...but he was a kind man.
He loved his wife dearly, but she cheated on him with a handsome man.
They murdered him with a nine-pronged rake.
When his love turned to hatred, he became a demon.
He swore he would kill all women lusting after handsome men.
How tragic for him.
Master,
I'm unable to handle such a strong demon.
Maybe you should take over.
Well, sure... but I'm quite busy these days.
To defeat such a powerful demon...
...you must go find the strongest King among kings.
He might teach you the secrets of conquering demons.
Who is he?
The Monkey King, who has been imprisoned...
...by Buddha under
Five Fingers Mountain for 500 years.
Monkey King?
He's just a legend... no one has ever seen him.
He's quite easy to find.
At the foot of Five Fingers Mountain...
...look for an old temple.
In front of it, you can find a statue of Buddha.
...13,000 feet high and 2,560 feet wide.
The Monkey King is there.
Really? It's that easy?
You'd have to be blind...
...to miss something 13,000 by 2,560 feet.
There's no time like the present. Get going.
Also, that Monkey King...
...is tricky, evil and full of hatred.
Be careful.
How do I convince him to help me?
Use your knowledge... and this
300 Nursery Rhymes
We've come here from the West to hunt demons!
Any demon-hunters are our enemies.
We kill demons and demon-hunters too!
No matter how strong you are, you're dead if you meet us.
Are you a demon-hunter?
I'm not a demon-hunter.
But you're out so late at the demon's lair.
You still deny it?
Are you a demon-hunter?
Me?
Wait!
He's my husband. We just had a fight...
...I ran out and he came to get me.
You got it wrong, really!
He's only a music teacher.
You take out...
...your song book and show her.
Hurry!
See?!
Fine. Prove you're a couple.
Do it right here.
What do you mean?
Do it! Now!
Do it?
We couldn't possibly do it here in public.
I'd rather die than do it with her.
What?! You'd rather die.
You think I want this!
Don't hit her! I'll do it!
I'll do it!
You can do it.
Just look at me.
You can do it.
You've really gone too far!
We're gonna die...
Hurry up or you're next!
You're animals!
You slaughter the innocent! Beasts!
Such beasts!
Fine! Take off your clothes!
You're worse than animals!
Come on!
Come on! I'll help you... hurry!
Hey, just keep going.
So you're all in this together?
Alright, game's over.
Too bad. No fun.
Pay up!
Did it go well?
Go well?!
You've ruined it!
Look at how you sprayed the blood!
You're still spraying!
It's broken... mechanical failure.
You're all... useless!
Please don't be angry, Boss!
Boss? What's going on?!
I had no choice. I'm already yours.
What do you mean?
Have you forgotten?
You kissed me and felt me up that day...
What? He kissed you and felt you up?
Shut up!
Lady Warrior, I apologize if I have offended you.
I'm just a simple, common demon-hunter.
I have... my dream.
I only live for the Greater Love.
Lesser Love isn't for me...
...but no matter what I say, you'll never understand.
I'm a demon-hunter too. I can understand.
That's good.
But my wish is...
...to find the man of my dreams.
To start a family with him...
...then live a simple life...
...and that man is you!
You're crazy!
What shall we do with him, Boss?
Take him away!
Let me go!
I need to pee.
Boss, this guy goes around with a Nursery Rhyme book...
...going on about
Greater Love and "Lesser Love".
Clearly, he's an evil guy...
...who abducts women and children.
Boss, you must be possessed!
Even a sophisticated guy like me can't seem to attract you.
Seeing you fall for him really breaks my heart!
Which one is your heart?
These two... my nipples!
You've made it so obvious to him, your feelings.
This guy doesn't appreciate you.
He's so rude.
Not just rude... it's downright inhumane!
What do you think, San?
I feel...
Can you first remove that get-up please?!
It's broken. I can't get it off.
Someone help me.
Stay away!
I feel... when I died just now...
...he seemed to show some empathy.
But when so much blood spurted out...
...and he didn't suspect anything...
...that shows his low level of intelligence.
Frankly speaking, he's an idiot.
So, who's more dumb, you or him?
Him, for sure... wright?
Little Sis, was it rude of him to refuse my advances?
Yes, but this also shows his positive qualities.
He knows what kind of woman he wants.
You understand me so well, unlike those stupid men!
Although he looks weak and vulnerable...
...if you like him,
I'll support you all the way.
You're wrong... he's braver than any of us.
Although he looks like a nobody...
...he dares to fight the demons with just his Nursery Rhymes...
...and not even for fame or fortune!
Now that's what
I'd call a true man of courage.
I get it... now I understand.
Right? I get it now.
But... he doesn't like me.
That's not true. I'm sure he likes you.
But you shouldn't act so tough.
You should try to be more feminine.
Come on, just try it!
Not like that. Why don't you try this?
I don't know how.
Don't worry...
The Obedience Charm
You'll do exactly what I do!
Go!
Sorry, I just need to pee.
But you won't let me out, so I have to do it here.
Sis, help me.
Back off! You're spraying it on me!
Back off! You're spraying it on me!
But I haven't started peeing yet.
How could I have sprayed you?
Plug it up with a stopper!
Plug it up with a stopper!
You're so cruel.
There's no need to plug it up.
I can hold it in.
But I don't have a stopper!
If you won't plug it, I'll rip it out!
If you won't plug it, I'll rip it out!
Is there any justice in this world?!
Great, yank it out for me!
Cut the crap!
Sorry... I didn't mean to...
Get lost!
Great, it's finally stopped.
What the hell did you do?!
I swear... I'll kill you!
You friggin' S.O.B.!
Okay, go for it! Go on... if you dare!
Where's my sword?!
I'll get it!
I can't take it anymore!
Kill him!
What's wrong with you?! Stop it!
Stop playing tricks on me!
Wait!
I said, stop playing tricks on me!
Prepare the battle chariot!
Ready!
Get in!
Start up the "Ironblood System"
The "Ironblood System"?
The "Ironblood System" uses hammering...
...to push air from the air sacs through the tubes to...
...push the propellers and move the gears to generate power...
...then refills the air sacs and repeats the procedure...
...that generates inexhaustible kinetic energy.
Then the chariot can move.
Hurry! It's catching up!
Full speed ahead!
Fast, isn't it?
Can you please be a bit more careful?
What should we do?! The Pig Demon's up ahead!
Do I look scared?! Just crash into him!
Don't miss me too much.
Wake up!
Don't scare me... Don't die!
Wake up!
Caught you! See how worried you were...
...and you still won't admit you love me?
I knew it!
I almost forgot about that Pig!
Almighty Foot, why must you always compete with me?
We all followed the demon's aura here.
Whoever captures the Pig Demon first...
...is the best demon-hunter of all!
All right, let's forget the Pig Demon.
How about a one-on-one fight?
The Pig Demon's tough, and even tougher under a full moon.
Who else could beat him, other than me?!
Look who's bragging!
Hello there, Prince Important!
They say your Sword Play is the best in the world!
It's time for my Almighty Foot to take you on!
I'll let you be Number One.
It's lonesome at the top.
How could you commoners understand?
Keep it low-key, okay?
Stop throwing the petals.
Boss, didn't you tell us to throw them?
What does the cough mean?
Are we throwing the petals or not?
No!
But you still have to pay us!
I know!
Actually,
I don't know what she's talking about.
Wow! Where did you pick up these four "lovely blossoms"?
Out in the wild.
I was lucky to find these four!
Why not just walk on your own two feet?
That would make me the same as you.
I, Prince Important, have my own style.
You're not important, just impotent!
Listen, you can't just make random accusations.
Can't you read this word?
It's "impotent"... no, wait, no!
It's "important".
I'm Prince impotent... no, no!
I'm not Prince Important!
I'm impotent.
You... I was... I tell you, when I was a child
I was impotent. Buddha would know.
No, wait, no...
I've been very important since I was born.
I'm trying to stay impotent.
Enough!
You all have amazing fighting skills.
Why not unite to fight the demon?
If you let him go now, stronger under the full moon.
And then all our lives will be over.
With no fame or fortune left to compete for.
You don't deserve to be demon-hunters!
And who is this beggar?
I'm not a beggar. I'm also a demon-hunter.
Oh, got it... give him some food.
We don't share the same goals and beliefs.
I must go.
Well said! I admire you so much!
I support you. I'll go with you!
Go away!
You keep blocking my way to Buddhahood.
Give me back my book.
What's wrong? We were doing so well.
Give me back the 300 Nursery Rhymes!
300 Nursery Rhymes??
Are you sleeping?
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
Give me some face in front of all these people.
300 Nursery Rhymes??
Fine!
You! Hey, what are you doing?!
Go ahead...
...hit me.
Useless garbage... Idiot!
Go to hell!
Take a good honest look at yourself.
If not for me, would you be alive today?
You think you're Prince Charming?
Demon-hunter, my foot!
This fellow here is the true hero in my heart!
Want to go for a drink...
...and get to know each other, Handsome?
Shh... I'm a humble guy.
It's such a burden to be so handsome.
You ugly people couldn't possibly understand.
Forget the drink then, let's just get a room.
I'm not available.
Boss!
Leave me alone!
Miss, do you have time for a drink?
Sir? Do you have time?
Well, I've never dated a man before... this is my first time.
So be gentle.
I'll try.
Five Fingers Mountain Starting Point
Five Fingers Mountain Starting Point
At the foot of Five Fingers Mountain, look for an old temple.
In front of it is a Buddha statue...
...13,000 feet high and 2,560 feet wide.
The Monkey King is there.
Water Reflection Mirror
Get off me!!
I'm here to find the Monkey King.
I... I...
Monkey King... I'm the Monkey King!
You're the Monkey King?!
Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.
Mr. Sun, I'm so honored to meet you.
I'm Chen Xuan Zang.
Mr. Chen! Mr. Sun!
Mr. Chen!
You're finally here... after 500 years!
No, Mr. Sun!
Sorry, I'm a bit overwhelmed.
Sit... sit, sit!
Mr. Chen, how handsome you are!
You, too, Mr. Sun!
According to the legend...
...you seem just a little bit... different.
Here's the story...
500 years ago,
I was an ordinary monkey.
I had a tiny disagreement with Buddha...
...and he used the Buddha Sutra...
...to blast me down here!
But I recognized that I was at fault, so I locked myself up in this tiny little hole and for 500 years I've never left once.
I've just...
...studied and studied the Buddha Sutra.
Look at me.
I've already dissolved the demon spirit within me and expelled it from my body.
I've even lost my demonic look.
So now within me, all that remains is
...truth, goodness and beauty.
So the Buddha Sutra is good, great and amazing!
Actually, Mr. Sun, I've come here to discuss another important matter with you.
Please go ahead.
Please teach me a way to tame the Pig Demon.
KL Hog?
Yes, he's evil and has killed so many people.
No one has a clue what to do.
There is, in fact, a way...
Come...
This seal is the Holy Fire Spell.
I brought it down from heaven.
It can destroy all demons and monsters.
But I don't want to kill him.
I just want to awaken his inner truth, goodness and beauty.
Right... didn't I just say that?
Its primary function is just that... to awaken truth, goodness and beauty.
Oh no... it's too precious!
Not at all, it's only worth a few bucks!
But still... I can't.
Take it, I insist.
I said it's a gift... just take it!
Mr. Sun, is this the seal Buddha used to suppress you?
By refusing my gift, you've offended me!
Don't you know who I am?
You know the
13 Gangsters of Flower Fruit Mountain?
I'm Number One!
In those days, I had a cleaver in each hand...
...from South Heaven Gate to Penglai East Road...
...chopping back and forth for three days and three nights...
...blood flowed like a river...
...just chopping up and down...
...without blinking an eye!
Didn't your eyes get dry...
...from not blinking for so long?
What?! Does it really matter if they're dry or not?!
What does that have to do with anything?!
I was just curious.
Do you get the point?!!
Was I talking about my dry eyes?!!
I was just wondering...
...such a long time without blinking.
Don't freaking talk to me about my eyes getting dry or not!!
Damn it!
Mr. Sun, please calm down!
I didn't mean it like that!
I meant I killed without so much as a blink.
And all you're concern about is my dry eyes?!
Fine, I'll show you!
Damn it!
Are they dry?!
Are they? Are they dry?!
Are they?
Can you see?!
Can you see?!
Yes.
What else have you got?
Bring them all out!
Let me smash them all for you!
Take them out!
That's why I can't speak sensibly with you young people!
You ask to borrow something.
No problem... I'll lend it to you.
Mr. Sun...
I'm fine now, thanks.
Young people nowadays have no appreciation.
Where's the gratitude and respect?
Mr. Sun, you want it?
Don't interrupt!
You want to eat it? Open it yourself!
I don't want to eat it.
You told me to bring it out for you to smash!
Oh my goodness!
Let me out of here!
It's been 500 years!
How much longer do you want to keep me trapped here?!
I've changed...
...done the enlightenment thing...
Buddha, why won't you believe me?!
You ask Buddha why he doesn't believe you?
But do you believe in him?
If you did in fact experience enlightenment, he'll be even
He would never give up on you.
You're saying
I didn't really experience enlightenment?
Let it go. That's not the point.
If you just do goodness with all your heart, you'll reap the rewards.
Help me tame the Pig Demon to show you're doing good.
It's your chance to fight evil and give back to society.
You want my help? Impossible!
Do you know how hard these 500 years have been?
I haven't had a single bite of my favorite food, bananas!
You want to get the Pig Demon. Lure him here.
Though he was hurt by his wife and her lover...
...he still loves his wife deeply.
He always liked to watched her dance in the moonlight.
He even wrote a song for her to show his love.
So it's simple.
Get a pretty girl...
...to sing and dance to that song under the full moon.
And the Pig Demon will naturally show up.
And then?
And then leave the rest to me.
What are you doing?
Mr. Sun, what do you think about me dressing up as a woman?
Mr. Chen, stop embarrassing yourself.
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
It's only just a banana.
Why are you still following me?
Because I'm worried about you.
I was up there when I heard you say you needed my help.
So I came down.
Who said we needed your help?
Didn't you just say you needed a pretty girl?
Go away! This is serious stuff.
Sorry, Mr. Sun!
A pretty girl!
You know just what to say.
I've always been this way...
I say what I think.
You're making me blush!
You look even nicer that way!
How about you stop saying what you think?
He offended you just now!
Let me apologize for him with this gift.
Oh no, I can't accept. That's too much.
Give me a chance.
We don't even know each other well.
All good friends begin as strangers.
Mr. Sun, keep this up and I'll leave!
If you leave, what will I do?
You're naughty! We're not alone here!
Who else is here?
Fine... let's go catch the Pig Demon!
Miss, you just said you wanted to help us lure the demon.
Can you dance?
I only know one dance.
Good!
Step.
Step.
Step.
Down.
Up.
Up.
Come on!
Try it!
Lift your butt a bit.
Quite good.
Miss, your dancing's really good!
Not at all!
Not as good as you!
You're really good!
Really!
So may I go up and lure the Pig Demon now?
Good! Really Good!
This guy looks really familiar.
My love is gone, she'll never return.
I silently mourn my lost love.
Though flowers wither, they'll bloom again.
My long-lost love is beyond the clouds.
Unrequited love fills my heart with sorrow.
In our lives we can't change our destiny.
Once we're parted, we can love no more.
Could this be the fate heaven planned for me?
KL Hog!
KL Hog!
Long time no see.
Let's
Thank you so much, Mr. Sun!
You've done great service to the people!
Not at all.
After 49 days, the Pig Demon will be reduced to ashes.
I know you have your own demon-taming beliefs, so I'm handing these two over to you now.
Thank you for your help!
Are you tired?
You should go home and get some rest.
Didn't I tell you?
When a girl closes her eyes, she wants you to kiss her.
Miss Duan, I think I can help you!
Mr. Sun!
Sorry... I know I'd treated you badly before.
But I've changed.
I've decided to become a gentle, faithful wife and mother.
Would you accept me now?
What are you doing?
I've decided to marry you!
This represents my love for you.
Why are you looking at me?
Where else can I freakin' go?!
Ignore him. Are you willing?
This Infinite Flying Ring grows roots in your flesh.
You will never be able to take it off.
What are you doing?!
I don't love you.
I don't want to marry you.
If I can't remove the ring,
I'll remove my finger!
I get it now.
I won't bother you anymore.
I spent three days putting your book back together.
But I can't read very well so I made a mess of it.
I don't want it.
She's gone...
Too bad.
Miss Duan has such a great body.
How do you know?
I saw it with my eyes.
Why didn't I see it?
Must be because you're blind.
Mr. Sun, thanks again for helping me.
Goodbye.
No need to rush off... leaving so soon?
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. What could possibly be wrong?
Goodbye, goodbye!
Mr. Chen...
...is the moon full tonight?
Very full.
That's wonderful!
The cave opening's blocked by that lotus.
I can't even remember when I last saw the moon.
Finally, I tricked you!
Oh, it's you!
You really thought you could buy me off with a banana?!
Actually, the lotus was the real seal and this is the real me!
You've released me from the seal!
I've finally escaped Buddha's control!
All you did was get out of the cave.
Buddha's still here.
Still here?!
Go to hell!
Put down your hands!
Buddha be praised.
Put them down!
Put them down!
So now, allow me to deliver you to Buddha!
Who's there?!
The legendary King of Demons, the Monkey King?!
Why are you so short?
He may be short, but he's more demonic than ever!
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!
This is worth skipping dinner!
Is this a Peking opera costume?
It's so cute...
So you're always frowning... are you unhappy?
If you're unhappy, I'll play with you!
Didn't we agree that he's mine?!
Same rule. Whoever wins, goes first!
Okay!
Stone, paper, scissors!
Are you upset?
Stop throwing the petals!
Hey, come on!
I'm in a hurry! Let me go first!
Pretending to be an animal, in front of me?!
It's just a crazy monkey!
It deserves to be stepped on!
Today, you will die by my Almighty Foot!
Oh look! Almighty Foot has stepped on a nail!
My foot has been pierced!
My food has been pierced!
Yes, I know!
I know! I can see that! Good!
Quite Please!
Oh. My foot! My foot!
Can I please get some help?
With what?
Moving that foot!
You should have said it sooner.
Why didn't you say it sooner?
You should have said it sooner. Say it!
Why didn't you say it sooner?
Why didn't you say so? Should have said so.
Help me move the foot!
Why didn't you say it sooner?
Move him!
Wow! That wasn't bad. I really had fun today!
Yeah, me too! Of course, it was all just for fun...
Time for me to go!
Your turn!
I'll kill whoever touches him!
No! Run!
How dare you do this to him?
What do you take me for?
Run! You're no match for him! I beg you!
I'm not going!
What then?!
What did you do to him?!
Don't think I'm so nice!
I've caught you again...
...and you still won't admit you love me?
I love you.
I've loved you...
...from the moment I saw you.
How much?
Very much.
There's never been a day that...
...I don't think about you.
How... long... will you love me?
1,000 years...
10,000 years...
10,000 years...
...that's too long.
Just love me...
...now.
Didn't I tell you?
When a girl closes her eyes, she wants you to kiss her.
I just destroyed the woman you love.
There's nothing left of her.
How can your Buddha help you now?
You're hurting so much that you want to die!
What can your Buddha do for you now?
The Buddha Sutra
Buddha!
Buddha!
You had me imprisoned for 500 years!
But now I'm free!
And now I will destroy you!
Now how do you feel about
Greater and Lesser Love?
About love between a man and a woman?
Love between a man and a woman...
...is all part of the Greater Love.
Love is neither greater nor lesser.
Having experienced pain,
I can truly understand life's suffering.
Knowing stubbornness, one can let it go.
Knowing what one wants, one can release it.
Now you understand that little 'something'.
Do you now know your mission?
There is suffering in this world.
It's not I who can rescue the world from hardship and deliver mankind from misery
That power lies only in the 22 scripture books in India
Go on your journey to the West for the scriptures.
It will be full of challenges and demons.
These three each have skills...
...and can protect you at all times.
I hereby grant you your holy robe and ritual items.
From today, you are a disciple of Buddha.
Your holy name is Tripitaka.
Go forth!
If there was only one person in the world who would make you happy, who was made for you, what would you sacrifice to find him?
How many centuries would you search for him?
And if you were to ever find him, would you let him go?
Wouldn't you hold him as tight as possible with both arms and never, ever let him go?
What did we jet to Paris for anyway?
You shouldn't have killed the pilot.
Charlotte?
Two more pages.
I want to know how it ends.
Now.
- What a shame.
- What?
It isn't your fault.
Let me guess.
Her eyes were too pretty to be true.
Don't listen to her, Louise.
You'll be lucky sometime.
Sometime.
Watch out!
Freeze!
Get down on the ground!
Get down, I said!
Hands behind your head!
Spread your legs!
Stay down!
Freeze!
Out of the way!
Let go!
Police!
Ow!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Did you see a guy run past?
This tall?
Hooded sweatshirt, dark pants.
Sorry.
What have you got?
Not a trace.
I can't believe it!
May I sit down next to you?
I have to rest a bit.
That rat was too fast for me.
What'd he do?
Who?
The rat who was too fast for you.
He ripped off a Russian pimp we were about to arrest.
Oh.
I bet he doesn't know who he ripped off, but he nearly screwed up our operation.
Tom.
Hi.
Doesn't that hurt?
It's okay.
There's broken glass everywhere.
Thanks for the warning.
It's too late.
What now?
I have to arrest you.
- If you catch me.
- If I catch you?
I got away once.
I didn't know who I was chasing.
But now I know who I'm running from.
Does it make you faster?
What kind of cop are you?
We could...
Stay here.
Stop it.
I don't want to hurt you.
Sorry, Tom.
"Insufficient funds.
Contact your bank. "
Hey, sweetheart.
You didn't tell me your probation officer is so nice.
Could I have a glass of water?
Yes, of course.
- Are you crazy?
- Fuck off, man!
Let her in.
Cold nights
Let your eyes shine
Hollow dreams
And my soul makes its demands
Fast breathing
Our bodies quiver
Gently trembling...
And my soul is burning
I'm dying of thirst.
Buy me a drink if I pay?
No, don't!
Don't.
Keep it.
As a down payment for gazing into your beautiful eyes.
Where are your friends?
What friends?
Nobody your age goes out without their clique.
I fly solo.
If you want to be different you have two choices.
You are destroyed by their world, or you create your own world.
You need money for that.
All you need is courage.
And you have both.
Enough for two.
I'd rather do my own thing.
Good luck.
You don't see it yourself.
Your eyes are blind, although they betray you with every glance.
What are you talking about?
About what's inside you.
And what is it?
Something special.
Rare.
Breathtaking.
You'd be the first human being to notice it.
I'm no human being.
Berlin. There was a tragic plane crash last night.
A plane coming from Paris crashed within city limits...
The lions first dig into the fallen prey, always a bloody but fascinating spectacle.
I was so excited about you coming that I couldn't sleep.
Nora.
Come on!
Good evening.
What did you do to me?
Sit down.
What did you do to me?
Don't.
I know what you need.
What's in there?
Your new life.
To immortality.
That's all bullshit!
You're all crazy!
Oh.
Your new trophy doesn't seem to get the picture.
You'll have to show her the proof.
If you want her to swim, throw her in the water.
- You have a girl for me?
- Yes.
- Does she have any experience?
- Not yet.
What are you doing to me?
I'll teach you something you don't want to learn.
Don't show any sympathy.
The more evil the man, the sweeter the blood.
She said you're a shy girl.
We'll take care of that.
I paid for you!
She learns fast.
We rarely treat ourselves to pimps.
Just wait.
Oh, Louise.
Pretty please.
You have two red ones that you never drive.
Let go.
Let go.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
What's all this shit?
Ohlsen, where are the stiffs?
Downstairs.
- Morning.
- Hi.
Did you tell anybody?
Where'd you get that idea?
Okay.
How many stiffs are there?
Two. A burned body here.
The second one's in the back.
They died about eight hours ago.
Is the one in the back burned too?
- Yeah.
- Who found them?
- Two young kids.
- Did you question them?
Well, I'll be damned.
Am I dead?
You won't quench your thirst with abstinence.
Well?
How does it feel?
Yes.
I know.
You have no idea what wonders await you here.
I know how you feel, Lena.
I remember my own transformation.
It was a masked ball at court.
It all happened so fast.
I hated her at first.
How could she do it to me?
But then we travelled all over Europe together.
She showed me the world and opened my eyes.
When she burned to death in Nice a century later,
I wanted to join her.
I was so desperate, so lost.
But something held me back, a longing, a hope, and I began to search again.
And now...
I've found you at last.
There's no way they could have manipulated the tapes.
Hmm.
There.
Huh?
We have a witness.
I don't get it.
Zoom in.
What's that on his ear?
Cool!
You should have given her a wedding dress.
Welcome to the family.
You look fantastic.
- Shall we?
- I don't have any shoes.
Oh, my poor little Cinderella.
Take yours.
Press.
The one with the fewest bags has to pay.
Got a favourite restaurant,
Lena?
Do we eat?
Just for fun.
We eat, drink, sniff coke, and fuck as much as we like.
But we never get fat, pregnant or hooked.
Enjoy it.
Billions of babes would kill to be in our place.
Did you see that?
It can smile.
The waiter isn't on the menu.
That was my dessert.
Enjoy it.
Doesn't satisfy my hunger, but it still tastes awesome.
Mmm! Mm!
How old are you anyway?
- Tut, tut!
- Never ask a lady's age.
If Louise hadn't found me at the Love Parade, I'd be 37.
Hey, sweetheart.
Smoking isn't permitted here.
Was that all you wanted to know?
How many of you are there?
40 women in Europe,
100 worldwide.
- And the men?
- Extinct.
They were too loud, too greedy, and too stupid.
Some were killed by humans.
We took care of the rest.
And we swore never to bite a man who had the gift.
Long live emancipation.
Yes, for over 200 years, no man, neither mortal nor immortal, has told me what to do.
No king, no boss, no husband.
What woman can make that claim?
Excuse me.
If you ever hit on me again,
I'll have you fired!
I know.
It was a bit mean.
But he's cute, isn't he?
Why do you treat him so cruelly?
I don't want to hurt him.
You just did.
I mean, really hurt him.
People fall apart so easily.
Come on!
Charlotte.
Charlotte!
You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
I didn't mean to rush into it.
I'm sorry.
Stupid Louise.
Stupid, stupid, stupid Louise.
"Print job in a print queue. "
Good morning.
- You're early.
- Yeah.
Did you even go home?
I couldn't sleep.
- Why not?
- No idea.
Afraid of missing something.
I'll give you some advice.
Find something to offset your job.
- Like a hobby?
- No, a private life.
Cuddling and smooching.
I'm working on it.
Are you going out?
I wasn't home the last two nights.
Didn't you notice?
You're old enough.
Lena?
How did you find me?
Hi.
I almost didn't recognize you.
You have a police record.
And you want to try to arrest me again?
No, I'm afraid of you.
Wait a sec.
You ripped off an asshole who pimps out little girls.
If I arrest you, you'll get 18 months probation for car theft.
And that isn't fair.
Here.
What is it? unwrap it.
I wanted to wash it, but my washing machine is broken.
I found it behind the pillar after you'd left and I could get up again.
Thanks.
You bet.
Changed your style.
- I like it.
- It's just a dress.
No, you're up to something.
You just saw me once before.
You get a feeling for it in my job.
Your hair is different.
It's no longer dyed.
You never used to wear shoes like that.
I can tell by the way you wobble.
Anything else?
Yeah.
You wouldn't have had coffee with me at our first encounter.
Will you leave me alone then?
We just got started.
For good.
I promise.
Come on.
Give it to me.
Here.
How's your hand doing?
It's healed.
- Not bad.
- I have good genes.
Why would someone like you want to be a policeman?
Someone like me?
Someone who seems to be okay.
Thank you.
It's one of the few jobs that pays for an adrenaline kick.
Racing through streets, kicking in doors and chasing crooks.
I love it.
Did you say that when you applied?
Sure.
And you?
You always wanted to be a pickpocket?
Not anymore.
That's good.
Did I say something wrong?
- I have to go.
- Really?
- Yes.
- What a shame.
Can I walk with you?
Sure.
- Everything okay?
- Yes.
You promised.
Tear it up when I'm out of sight.
Hey, Lena, why shouldn't we see each other again?
My boyfriend would make trouble.
You think I can afford clothes like these?
It's my way of getting out of this place.
You're the lousiest liar.
"There's a strange element among us. "
Had enough nightlife?
Louise would say, you'll get used to it.
She wants you to be happy here.
I became too depressed for her taste.
And now she thinks you're the one she's spent centuries looking for.
You'd better not disappoint her.
I was a very untalented actress.
I wouldn't have survived in sound films.
Louise and I met opening night.
My husband and my little daughter had already gone home.
You were beautiful.
Would you have bitten me otherwise?
Or Nora or Lena?
Oh, Charlotte, don't ruin the evening for us.
Because we're all in such a good mood.
The ladies are quite moody today.
You spoil us.
So you aren't tortured by unfulfilled wishes.
I miss the sun.
I was afraid you'd miss something that I can't give you.
- Where is he?
- In there.
- Who are you?
- Drop it!
Are you a policeman?
Drop your gun first.
Slowly.
Show me.
Put me in the most secure cell in the best prison.
Please.
Hi, boys!
Mwah!
Get out of there!
We'll press charges!
Please, don't.
Have mercy.
I won't say it again!
Get out!
Why not take off your silly uniforms and jump in with us?
- What did she say?
- We should get in the water.
We have so much room.
What do they pay you, to miss out on all this fun?
Look.
She's topless.
It's our big chance.
It won't come again.
You won't harm them, will you?
I promise.
Ladies.
- Hello, Mr. Security.
- Hello.
- What's your name?
- I'm Bernd.
Bernd.
- What do you do up there?
- I keep watch.
- It's completely normal.
- Really?
Yes, by all means.
Absolutely normal.
Will you tell me your name?
Guess.
Chantal.
Mm-mm.
Mandy?
Babette, Nicole,
Steffi,
Isabel.
Where's my partner?
Did he leave already?
Do you know where my partner went?
Nora!
"For Whom The Bell Tolls"
Charlotte!
No, Charlotte!
Charlotte!
Stop overreacting, and accept who you are.
Nora!
- Why did you do that?
- Why not?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Oh, please!
We need an ambulance!
Mm-hmm.
- Yes?
- Yes.
No, no, no!
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Tom Serner here.
Leave a message after the beep.
Hello, Tom.
It's me, Lena.
I...
I didn't know who to call.
I...
They're dangerous...
What illegal substances do you consume?
- Who? Me?
- Yes. Drugs!
Drugs?
No!
Why did you burn your partners?
In German, please.
I told you everything.
I didn't kill anyone.
It was the women with devil's eyes, and they run on the ceiling.
Ah, they have wings, huh?
You mean they can fly?
Why did they steal my Lamborghini?
What?
My Lamborghini!
Very expensive!
- What colour?
- Silver.
Silver like cross.
Where did you find the Lamborghini?
At the Grand Hotel?
- No, let the SWAT team wait!
- SWAT?
Not my decision.
Hello, Tom. It's me, Lena.
I didn't know who to call.
What's up?
Got a girlfriend?
Wake up, my Romeo.
No.
No!
What did you do?
Shh.
The police are storming the hotel!
I'll stop them.
Position your people at all exits.
Yes, immediately!
- Which floor?
- The fourth.
How did they find us?
We'll take the safe cars.
Don't move!
Charlotte!
Get in,
Charlotte!
- Where is Nora?
- Behind me.
Shit!
- Stop!
- What for?
Stop!
We have to help her!
Fire!
She won't make it!
Go!
- Charlotte!
- No!
Be reasonable!
Don't leave me alone!
Nora!
Come on!
Gone.
Come on.
Hurry.
Freeze!
It's all over!
Please, Lena.
Don't hurt him!
We're heading toward the light.
Get out!
What a crazy day.
Who was that policeman?
I saw you together once.
I have no idea what you mean.
How does he know you?
He wanted to arrest me for a trifle.
For a trifle?
Nora burned to death for a trifle.
We're on the run for a trifle!
And you led them to us!
That's wrong!
I didn't tell him.
How did he find us?
You kill people every night!
Do you think nobody notices?
She's right, Louise.
We were never good at cleaning up.
- Are you on her side?
- I'm on nobody's side.
Just calm down.
Of course.
Of course.
We need money and new passports.
I want to say good-bye before we leave town.
It smells like death here.
When was the last time that Charlotte saw her?
She's asleep.
Maybe it's better this way.
Mommy.
Come on.
Come on.
It's time.
The next sunrise we'll see is in Moscow.
Charlotte.
No!
Charlotte!
No!
I'm sorry.
Open the door!
Don't do this!
Open the door!
Charlotte!
No!
Open the door!
Charlotte!
Charlotte
I wanted to see you before I go.
Who are you?
I can't explain it in words.
Stay there!
Let go.
- Stop it.
- Look right at me.
Let go!
No, damn it!
Lena!
Look right at it.
- An ambulance.
- No, look at it.
Just shut up.
No!
Lena, no!
Come on!
Sorry, I had to do it.
I'm sorry too.
Fucker!
Good evening.
How do you picture your future, Lena?
Even if he stayed with you, which I doubt, he'd only have 60 years at most.
And then...
Then you'd be alone.
And then your loneliness will devour you bit by bit.
Believe me.
I know what I'm talking about.
Be quiet.
No.
Lena, run away!
Louise, don't hurt him!
Please!
I'll give him his life, under one condition.
Tell me you love me.
So that I believe you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you, Louise.
I love you.
The loveliest lie
I've ever heard.
No!
No!
Now we're the only ones left.
Headquarters?
I'll call for a manhunt.
I'll do it.
Headquarters.
Come in, please.
Okay, call in forensics.
Headquarters.
Come in.
Good luck.
Hurry, hurry, step this way.
Get your tickets now.
Don't be shut out, friend.
Step this way.
See the most wondrous sights imaginable pulled from the four corners of the Earth.
Acts to delight, to thrill and to mystify!
Walk through these gates and into a world of wonder!
She is here, ladies and gents, live and in person.
That gun-slinging, sharp-shooting honey-pie of the Wild West.
He has traveled the world and baffled the crown princes of Europe.
- He will amaze! He will astound!
The Great and Powerful Oz!
I always knew that I was destined for show business.
And now look at me.
A magician's assistant.
To think, an hour ago I was just selling oil cakes on the midway.
Yes, well, opportunity comes when you least expect it, my dear.
Wow! What a get-up.
- You won't need this.
- Oh.
You are playing the simple country girl.
Oh!
A gift in honor of your debut.
Oh!
Now, this belonged to my grandmother.
A tsarina from Mirkutsk, and a decorated war hero.
Your grandmother?
Yes. She was killed in battle, the poor thing.
Which battle?
- Which battle?
- Uh-huh.
Well, there are so many.
You've heard of the Battle of Kreplach?
No.
No? Good.
That's where she died.
And this music box was the only thing to survive.
But I know that Grammie would want you to have it.
- Professor.
Frank!
The sock is on the door.
We're rehearsing.
How many times do
I have to tell you to knock?
Knock.
I knocked.
- What is it?
- Showtime.
Why didn't you say something?
Only a half a house.
Here's the take.
Pitiful.
All right, this is your cut.
For you, the applause will be approbation enough.
Well, how do you think I feel?
A man of my talents,
I should be playing the Orpheum Circuit!
Instead of some dusty podunk in a second-hand jacket falling apart at the seams.
You're gonna have to patch this thing again.
- Again?
- Yeah.
- Let's go. Hat!
- Hat.
- Hat. Okay.
- You're the new girl, huh?
- Yes.
Good, we needed a new one.
The last one left us.
Poor thing.
Suffered from a broken heart.
Attack. Heart attack.
But she's resting comfortably now in Abilene expected to make a full recovery.
Perhaps you'd like to join her.
Now, remember, when I ask for a volunteer...
I raise my hand.
You are overqualified for this job, my dear.
Let's go make some magic.
Ladies and gentlemen, the show has already begun.
There are still a few seats left.
Don't miss your chance to see
Oz, the Great and Powerful!
Journey with me now, across those deserts to the mystical lands of the Arabian Peninsula.
For 5,000 years, her lonely spirit has been trapped.
But tonight, we will attempt to free her.
I shall require a volunteer from the audience.
Anyone.
Anyone.
How about you, madam?
Oh! Yes, I would like to volunteer.
How kind of you. Please.
Just remember what I told you.
A simple country girl, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, you have nothing to fear, just so long as you believe.
For when you do believe anything is possible.
You are growing sleepy.
Your eyelids become heavy.
Sleep!
Come, Fernanda!
Allow yourself to merge with this woman before me.
Can you hear me, oh, Queen Fernanda?
Yes.
Then rise.
Rise!
I command you to rise!
Rise from your tomb of sand.
Rise as your spirit...
I see a wire!
You are mistaken, sir.
I am not!
There is a wire!
There is a wire holding her up!
A wire?
I see it, too.
It's right there.
Clear as day.
Can't you see 'em?
He's fooling us.
A wire!
What need have I of wires?
Frank.
Make me walk!
What's that?
Make me walk.
Not now, kid. Let us leave the wonders...
But I believe in you.
Look, it's not much, but it's all that we have.
Whatever you could do.
I would make you walk, it's just...
It's just that...
Well, go on, then.
Make the girl walk.
Make the kid walk.
Come on, you big phony.
Yeah, come on!
I would make her walk, of course, but unfortunately there is a distemper in the ether tonight.
Make the kid walk, you big phony.
You see?
I'm sorry, but...
Thank you. Thank you.
Oz, the Great and Powerful.
Why didn't you close the damn curtain sooner?
I was dying out there.
There was nothing you could have done.
I didn't really think it was that bad.
Of course not.
You're just a trained monkey.
You know, you shouldn't be so mean to me all the time, Professor.
After all,
I'm the only friend you've got.
Friend?
You're not my friend, Frank.
I don't need a friend.
What I need is someone who knows when to close the damn curtain.
It's a woman.
Ah! Finally some good news.
You want me to wind up a music box?
No.
Not for this one, Frank.
Hey, Annie.
Hello, Oscar.
Hmm.
You look lovely.
Thank you.
What is this? Gingham?
You know it is.
It was a wonderful show.
Oh, don't tell me you watched that debacle.
I don't know why you didn't just tell that poor girl the truth.
What truth? That I'm a fake?
They would have had my head.
And worse, they would have demanded a refund.
Come on, have a seat.
I'll get you some tea.
- Ooh!
It's been a long time.
I haven't seen you since...
The last time you rolled into town.
It's not often enough, Oscar, seeing you once every few months.
Well, it is a traveling circus.
How's everything on the farm?
How's your ma?
She didn't send me a pie this time.
I hope she's not mad.
I meant to write.
I need to tell you something, Oscar.
That's never a good start to a conversation.
John Gale asked me to marry him.
That's why I've come.
I thought you should know.
Oh.
I think that's...
That's wonderful, Annie.
I said I had to think about it.
Oh, men love that answer.
I wondered what you thought I should do.
You could do a lot worse than John Gale.
He's a good man.
So are you.
No.
I'm not.
I'm many things, but a good man is not one of them.
But you could be.
If you wanted to.
Well, that's just it.
I don't want to.
See, Kansas is full of good men.
Church-going men that get married and raise families.
Men like John Gale.
Men like my father, who spent his whole life tilling the dirt just to die facedown in it.
I don't want that, Annie.
I don't want to be a good man,
I want to be a great one.
I want to be Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison all rolled into one.
That's all I ever wanted for you, you know.
Greatness.
Then you understand.
I do.
But do you?
Uh, Professor, you need to look outside.
No, Vlad, please.
It was his grandmother's.
- Ahl
I'm gonna rip him in half!
- No, please!
- Get off!
It was just his grandmother's music box.
It meant nothing.
Oz!
I have to go.
Congratulations on the engagement.
Oscar.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Oz!
I'm gonna rip your head off!
Zim Zallah Bim!
Oz!
There he is!
He's out here!
No, Vlad! Don't hurt him!
Vlad!
- Vlad, no!
- Whoa!
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!
I'm gonna crush you!
Oz! Where are you going?
Mr. Baum, I'll catch up with you in Milwaukee.
Half of that balloon is mine!
And the other half is mine!
All right, you loafers!
Roll up those tents!
Oz!
- No, no, no.
- You're not getting away!
Where's my thing?
Come here.
Get him down, Clowny.
No, you don't!
Oh, no, you don't!
Ah!
So long, sucker!
Get back here!
Oz!
Oz, you're gonna need these!
Throw it! Now!
- Hat!
- Hat!
Ha-ha!
You're a dead man!
Farewell!
Au revoir! Auf Wiedersehen!
Run!
Run!
No, no, no, no, no! No!
Whoa!
Please, I don't wanna die!
I haven't accomplished anything yet!
Just get me out of here and I'll do great things!
Please! Give me a chance!
I promise!
I promise. I can change.
Thank you. Thank you!
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Oh, no!
No, no. No, no.
Come on, buddy.
I can't swim.
No! I can't swim.
Somebody, help me!
Thank goodness.
I thought I was dead.
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?
There is still hope for me!
You won't regret this!
I saw you fall from the sky.
Oh. Uh... Yes, my balloon hit, uh, an inverted thermal.
I couldn't compensate.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Oh. It's actually quite nice.
I'd be more concerned with the River Fairies.
Their teeth are small, but very sharp.
River Fairies?
What's a River Fairy?
- Ow!
Ow! Get off!
Ow! Ow!
Psst. Psst.
Go on, get out of here.
Spiteful little things, aren't they?
Where...
Where am I, exactly?
Where do you think you are?
I have no idea. It's...
It's like no place
I've ever seen.
You're in Oz.
Oz?
But that's my name.
Oscar Zoroaster
Phadrig Isaac Norman
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.
But everyone calls me Oz.
I knew it!
The king's prophecy was true.
He said that a great wizard bearing the name of our land will descend from the heavens, and save us all.
And here you are.
Here to claim your throne.
"Claim my throne"?
You mean, like a king's throne?
Well, yes. Because you will be our king.
Your king?
Like, in a palace with a crown and a scepter?
Yes, a beautiful scepter and a grand palace.
Oh. And you will save all the people.
Was that a gold scepter?
Yes, there's more gold than you could ever imagine.
And Oz will now be what it once was.
Because you are the Wizard, aren't you?
Yes.
I'm the Wizard.
- What was that?
- The Wicked Witch's minions.
They've been sent here to kill you.
Kill me?
A wicked witch? What?
- Oh!
We better hurry or your reign will be over before it's begun!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Oh! Whoa!
- Oh!
Come on!
In there!
Give me your leg.
- Huh?
Oh... Perhaps the Wicked Witch has summoned them back.
I don't think I like witches.
What?
I... I, too, am a witch.
I am Theodora the Good.
You're not a witch.
Of course I am.
Where are all your warts?
Where's your broom?
What would I do with a broom?
Fly.
With a broom?
Never mind.
You were afraid?
Yes.
That something might happen to you.
So, this Wicked Witch, just how wicked is she?
She's as wicked as they come.
She poisoned her own father.
That's pretty wicked.
He was a king and a wizard, like you.
But she wanted the throne all to herself.
Poor man.
But my sister chased her away from the Emerald City.
I can't wait for her to meet you.
She was starting to doubt you'd ever come but now she'll see.
And you're going to fix everything.
Yeah.
You know what I think we need?
A little music.
Is that magic?
In a way.
It's a music box.
You've never seen one?
Well, this belonged to my grandmother.
A tsarina from Mirkutsk.
Go on.
I want you to have it.
No one's ever given me anything just because they wanted to.
A pretty girl like you?
With the visage of Helen of Troy, no less?
I'm sure you have dozens of admirers.
You don't know much about witches, do you?
Maybe not, but I'm told
I'm a fast learner.
May I have this dance, milady?
Now you're gonna tell me no one's ever asked you to dance before.
No one ever has.
Then it's high time that you learned.
Put your hand here.
And your other hand here.
Nice, isn't it?
Yes.
It's incredible.
Yeah.
Here I thought
I'd live a lonely life and then you showed up.
Not only are you the Wizard but you're the person
I belong with.
Well, we sure get along. And...
And?
And.
Like you said, we belong together.
Oh! I was hoping you would say that.
- Yeah.
Help me!
Somebody, save me!
That poor little creature.
Wizard, we must save him.
Somebody, help me.
Oh, no, no, no.
Allow the Wizard.
Help me!
Come on!
Of course I'll save this little talking monkey in a bellhop's uniform.
You, mister!
Please, hurry up.
Do you have anything sharp?
Like a knife or something.
How about your teeth?
What kind of teeth you got?
Calm down, it's gonna be all right.
You gotta get me out of these vines.
Calm down.
I'm gonna die.
It's gonna eat me.
Don't worry. These vines aren't gonna eat you.
Not the vines, the lion!
- Lion?
We're gonna die.
- We're gonna die!
Eat him first!
Eat him first!
Zim Zallah Bim!
Be gone, coward!
Fear my greatness!
- You were wonderful, Wizard.
"Wizard"?
You mean the prophecy was true?
Indeed.
All right, well,
I've saved the day.
It was nothing, just a little prestidigitatic display.
- Shall we to the palace?
- Oh! Yes.
Good day, sir.
Wait, please, sir.
My name is Finley.
My master's home was ransacked by the Wicked Witch's baboons.
And I've been hiding in these woods ever since.
But now you've saved my life, oh, Wizard.
So I hereby swear a life debt to you.
No... No need.
From this moment on I shall be your loyal and faithful servant until death.
Well, he is cute.
All right, you're hired.
Wonderful.
Let's shake on it.
My bag, monkey.
Surely.
You must travel light.
I got it.
You two run along.
It's the Emerald City.
Just down this hill, along the Yellow Brick Road.
Wow.
It'll all be ours now.
It's a good thing green is my favorite color.
You are going to make the best king Oz has ever known.
Thank you.
And I will be so proud to be your queen.
My queen?
We'll spend a lifetime together.
But right now, there's thousands of people in Oz waiting to witness your miracles.
Thousands?
That's a big show.
Phew!
What now, Wizard?
Monkey, tell me again about that life debt.
- I devote my life to you.
- Mmm-hmm.
Whatever you wish, whatever you want.
It is my sworn duty to deliver for you
- until the end of my days.
- Mmm-hmm.
And there's no getting out of it?
None, sir.
It is irrevocable.
Good.
Because I'm not the Wizard.
Oh, sir, your sense of humor is as boundless as it is wondrous.
- You remind me...
- Monkey.
I'm not the Wizard.
Well, you could have told me before I sealed the life debt.
It's too late.
You got to come clean for that innocent young girl.
I'll deal with her later.
As my new assistant all you need to know are the three "ups".
Show up, keep up, shut up.
But...
What's the third "up"?
Right. Now, listen,
I'm depending on you.
We need to convince the good people of Oz that they've found their wizard.
Hello, Knuck.
Theodora, we've been expecting you.
I shall blow a fanfare.
No, no, no, no.
No. Not now.
This is the Wizard.
How do you do, sir?
- This is the Wizard?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.
- Halt.
All hail the Wizard.
All hail the Wizard.
All hail the Wizard.
The mightiest of mighties.
The greatest, most powerful and most genuine of real and true wizards.
Thank you.
A wizard above scrutiny with no covert agenda or subversive intention whatsoever.
- Okay.
- A wizard of the highest moral rectitude.
He's just a real, good, solid wizard, everyone.
The Wizard, here he is.
How'd I do?
Forward, march!
Hello? Guys?
Can I get in the carriage?
Can I please get in the carriage?
- I shall blow a fanfare.
- Not now.
Is that it? Is that my throne?
Do you like it?
I do so hope you like it, because I've been personally watching over it awaiting your arrival.
Oh...
Much obliged.
Praise be you are here at last and the prophecy shall be fulfilled.
Oh, this is a glorious day for us all.
And may I add, you're as handsome a king as we've ever had.
Flatterer.
Who is this fetching woman?
This is my sister.
I am Evanora, the royal advisor.
I have been protecting the Emerald City whilst we awaited your arrival.
I am here to serve you as I served the king before you.
Well, I look forward to being served.
Oh, sister, I like him already.
Oh... My scepter.
Oh, yes, go on then, have a seat.
How does it feel?
Fits like a glove.
Goodness.
Knuck will show you to your chambers and then we can, uh...
We can chat more later.
Can't wait. Monkey, my bag.
Yes, Wizard, right away, oh, great and powerful one.
- Thank you, sourpuss.
- Whoa!
My name is Knuck!
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?
You dare escort that oaf in here and allow him to climb on the hallowed throne?
And why not?
He is the Wizard.
"The Wizard." Or so he says.
Did it not occur to you that he might be an imposter in league with the Wicked Witch and sent here to kill us?
The Wicked Witch?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not the one who's underestimating her cleverness.
Or maybe it's you
I'm underestimating.
Have you finally joined her side, sister?
I am on no one's side.
You know that.
I simply want peace.
It's all I ever wanted, and the Wizard can do that.
He's a good man.
What do you know about goodness?
Deep down, you are wicked.
I am not wicked!
That temper really is wasted on you.
Do you honestly think that I could conspire against you with her?
You are my sister and I love you.
All right.
But I do need proof that he is who he claims to be.
But he has already proven himself.
Not to me, he hasn't.
Thank you for the tour.
It's my job.
Giving tours?
Taking care of the king.
Of course.
And on that note
I was thinking it might be nice to have a royal feast.
Maybe a grand roast.
You know, my sister has been telling me that your magic is really quite powerful.
Oh, really?
Yes, uh, boggling to the minds of all who witness it.
Oh, I do wish I could see it for myself.
- Yes.
Why not show me now?
- Now?
- Here.
All things in good time.
And a good time for all things.
So wise. So true.
Well, um, there is one last room that I would like you to see.
The royal treasure of Oz.
It belongs to whoever is king.
It's all right, Wizard.
Go and enjoy your riches.
It's mine!
Mine!
Oh, no more second-hand suits for you, baby!
Nothing but the silks and satins!
Ali Baba!
And one of these things!
What is this?
- A chalice.
- A chalice!
I've always wanted a chalice.
And now I've got one.
Well, uh, not quite yet.
You see, you only become the king after you defeat the Wicked Witch.
That's the prophecy.
And since you haven't done that yet, you're not...
- I'm not actually king.
- Not yet, no.
You still have to get rid of the Wicked Witch.
Right.
And killing her won't be easy.
No, I don't suppose it will be.
Mmm.
Wait a minute.
No one said anything about killing anybody.
Oh. Well, if you're not interested in being king that's all right with me.
We can just forget about the whole thing.
The gold and the rubies, the chalice.
I'm interested!
I'm just not too keen on killing a lady.
She's not a lady.
She's a wicked witch.
And your magic is the only thing strong enough to destroy her.
All you have to do is journey to the Dark Forest and destroy her wand.
- Her wand.
- Yes.
It's the source of all her power.
Without it, she dies.
I haven't even said goodbye to Theodora. She will be upset.
I will talk to her in the morning.
I will tell her how much you love her...
No.
No, don't...
Don't say anything.
All right. I will say whatever it is you want me to say but are you going to save us all or not?
I'm your wizard.
We're really gonna do this?
How hard could it be to kill a wicked witch?
Hard. Really hard.
It's very, very hard to kill a wicked witch.
And what about that poor girl back there?
I think she really liked you.
She'll get over me.
They always do.
She's a pretty young witch.
There'll be plenty of wizards knocking at her door.
Oh, every lie you tell gets us one step closer to the Emerald City dungeon.
Then don't think of them as lies.
Think of them as stepping stones on the road to greatness.
Wait, I got it.
We'll turn around and go back.
You'll come clean.
You apologize for lying about being the Wizard and for lying to that poor girl. Okay?
You gotta really seem contrite. You gotta sell it.
Maybe you could even cry.
Can you cry? I could cut up an onion.
We're not going back.
We're gonna find this wicked witch, steal her wand,
I'll get that big pile of gold and you can have a nice pile of bananas, all right?
Bananas.
Oh, I see.
Because I'm a monkey,
I must love bananas, right?
That is a vicious stereotype.
- You don't like bananas?
- Of course I love bananas.
I'm a monkey, don't be ridiculous.
I just don't like you saying it.
How about this?
We offer to wash all the windows in the Emerald City
- for an entire year.
- Uh-huh.
They'd have to forgive us.
Or we could give them a little help with their infrastructure.
I noticed some yellow brick potholes back there.
That looks bad.
We're not going down there.
Someone might need our help.
Not that you care.
Get back here!
You get back here!
We gotta get the Wicked Witch.
What are we doing over here?
What happened here?
Hello?
- Hey, there.
- Are you all right?
Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.
This is Finley.
Hi.
My name is Oz.
Are you...
Are you the Wizard?
Oh, you...
You've heard of me.
Everyone has.
Good. Then you know there's nothing to be afraid of.
So, just come on out of there.
But I can't.
Oh. All right, hold on.
Get this off of you.
Oh, no.
I'll never get back together.
Don't worry.
I think I have something.
Give me that bag.
I, uh, packed something...
There it is.
What is that?
Magic in a bottle.
Magic?
Let's give it a try.
All right.
Just give it a little dab.
Like so.
Okay.
Should work.
There we go.
Ta-da!
Oh, no, no, no!
They're coming back!
It's okay.
They're gone.
- The Wicked Witch sent them.
- Why?
Last night.
The whole town was celebrating out in the streets because we had heard that you finally arrived.
Me?
Everyone was so happy.
But then...
But then those things flew in.
And then...
And then they...
Here we go.
Last piece.
Would you like to try to stand?
There.
All right.
There we go.
Easy.
Okay.
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Oh!
Okay.
Now walk to me.
I don't think I can.
I think you can.
Come on.
All right.
You did it.
Thank you.
"Dark Forest."
All right, this is it.
Just head on down that way, about two, three hours.
You'll hit the Emerald City.
Tell them I sent you, they'll take great care of you.
Nice meeting you.
But.
I wanna go with you.
What?
Aw...
On a witch hunt?
No, you're just a little girl.
I'm not as delicate as I look!
That didn't hurt.
I'm coming with you.
Listen, we have one rule in show business.
Never work with kids or animals.
And I'm already working with this thing.
- Relax.
The answer's no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't...
Don't do that.
You're fine.
You're gonna leave me alone.
Look, you're...
You're fine.
On a road in the middle of nowhere?
All you have to do is take the Yellow Brick Road.
You'll get there.
It's crying again, what do I do?
Oh, no.
Off. Come on. Off.
Off of there!
Scat! Get off!
Please let me come with you.
No! Get off of there!
I promise I won't bother you!
No dolls on the witch hunt!
- Please, let me come!
- Fine.
Fine!
If you wanna come, come.
We'll all go, it'll be a big party.
Great. Let's go kill ourselves a witch!
You'll die, you'll die, you'll die!
Did those crows just say that we were gonna die?
They did.
Wizard?
Come on.
I'm scared.
Think there are ghosts out here?
No. Of course not.
Evil spirits maybe?
The undead?
The undead?
Will you stop that?
No. Get off!
Something's got my tail.
Something's got my tail!
Will you calm down?
No! What is it?
- Look out!
- I wanna go home!
I wanna go home!
- Hey!
- Hat!
Thanks.
Look out!
- Come on.
Hate the Dark Forest.
Hate the Dark Forest.
Oh, my gosh. That was close.
Where are we?
This must be the place.
So, how are you gonna kill the Wicked Witch?
All I need to do is get her magic wand.
Once I destroy that, she's finished.
Why don't you just use this?
- It's got a knife!
- Where'd you get that?
I'm made of china.
I gotta protect myself somehow.
Give me that.
- Hey!
- Honestly.
- "Honestly" yourself.
Look.
That must be her.
Come on.
She put down the wand.
But how are we gonna get it?
Hey!
Now, listen up.
Here's the plan.
The Wicked Witch is the triangle.
Monkey, you're the X.
I'm the O.
China Girl, you're the squiggly line.
I wanna be a heart.
Can I be a heart?
All right, fine.
You're a heart.
Okay, now, heart stays here as O makes his way over here.
X counters thusly.
Clear so far?
Bless you.
Good work. You just sneezed away the plan.
- Sorry.
- Never mind.
Just go over there and make some of your animal noises.
I'll grab the wand when she's not looking.
Get out of here.
Yes! Come on, come on.
Oh, no!
Moo!
Moo!
Moo!
A cow?
Moo!
Come on. Come on.
- Hurry!
- I got it!
- Break it.
- Break it, Wizard.
- All right.
- Break it!
Did you say "Wizard"?
No!
Are you really the Wizard?
Um... That's a complicated question.
I mean, what is a wizard? I...
Um...
Yes.
I'm the Wizard.
Then there's hope.
What's going on?
Not sure.
I sneezed the plan away.
I have waited so long to meet you.
So, we've never met?
Certainly not.
I'd remember a thing like that.
You've never been to Kansas?
What is Kansas?
Is that where you're from?
My, you must have traveled very far to get to the Land of Oz.
I did.
I'm Glinda the Good.
The Witch of the South.
I thought Evanora was the Good Witch.
Evanora is the true Wicked Witch.
Conniving and as cruel as they come.
She's fooled most everyone, including her own sister.
She made everyone believe that I poisoned my father
- but it was her.
- Then, she's the one who destroyed my village?
I'm so sorry, child.
Here's your wand.
Sorry I mooed.
And to think, you almost killed Glinda for a bit of gold.
A bit?
There were mountains of it, buddy.
Not that I was going to do it.
I wasn't really going to break your wand.
Follow me.
Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
It cannot be.
Curse you, Glinda.
You should be dead.
I'll see you dead yet.
Curse you and your pretty little face.
Sister.
Sister, the Wizard is missing.
I've looked everywhere, but he's gone.
What is it?
Where is the Wizard?
Where's the Wizard?
With Glinda.
Then it's happening.
Oh, sister, he's fulfilling the prophecy.
He'll bring her darkness to the light and peace to the land.
Yes, I'm certain that's what is happening. It must be.
Where did you get that?
This?
Oh.
It was a gift. From him.
He came to my chambers last night.
Oh, how we danced.
- For hours, it seemed.
Oh, I can still feel his body pressed against mine.
Oh, sister, you were right about him.
He is the great Wizard.
He must be, to make me feel the way I feel.
Oh, no.
Not you, too, sister?
He said we would rule Oz together.
He said I would be his queen.
Did he?
Are you quite sure it wasn't you who said it to him?
You fool!
Serves you right.
I want Glinda and that wizard torn to shreds.
Do not fail me a second time.
Fly!
On the day my father died, we lost a kind and noble leader.
And a dark shadow was cast across this land.
I've had to stand alone against Evanora and watch as towns were destroyed, children were orphaned and my heart was broken.
I've been unable to protect the good people of Oz by myself.
With only faith in my father's prophecy, I've waited.
For you.
Great Wizard from Kansas, to come and set things right.
Oh.
So, that's the prophecy.
Um...
Well, you see, when I agreed to be king,
I didn't realize how complicated all of this was.
She knows.
What?
Evanora knows you know the truth now. Look.
Oh, no.
Uh...
What do we do?
Wizard, now is the time.
The time?
Use your magic.
Oh...
My magic. Yes. Uh...
I think we should run.
Run?
Yeah.
You heard the Wizard. Run!
Let's get out of here!
Let's go!
They're gaining on us!
What are you doing?
Is... Is that gonna stop them?
I don't know.
Nice work. We lost them.
Phew! That was close.
Yeah.
Wait, I hear something.
They're getting closer!
Wait for me!
Look out!
Monkey!
Little China Girl!
Wizard! I'm over here!
- Help! Catch me, please!
- Got you!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
I'm okay, too.
Just go!
Great! A bunch of fog.
This is her big idea on how to save us?
Well, it was the best I could do under the circumstances.
Uh...
Oh, okay.
Whoa!
Catch her!
Get me! Don't let go!
Monkey, grab her!
Don't let go!
Don't let go!
Pull my tail. Ow!
Not so hard.
They're getting closer!
What do we do?
What do we do?
Just do what I do.
- Unless you've got something.
- Uh...
No, you go.
Wait. What are you doing?
Wanda!
Where are you going?
She said to do what she did.
Just because she jumped off the cliff, you're gonna jump off the cliff?
I have wings.
- What about me?
- Come on!
Um...
Whee!
Whoa! Oh! Oh!
Whoa!
Wow.
Whoa!
Oh! Oh, Oh, Oh!
These things go kind of fast, huh?
Hey, is... Is that a wall?
Of sorts.
It repels our enemies and protects us from harm.
But we're headed straight for it.
Yes, we are.
And going very fast.
How do you, uh...
Does this thing have any brakes? Uh...
I'm going too fast!
I'm gonna die!
You needn't worry, Wizard.
It's a magic wall.
And all good-hearted souls get to pass through.
I'm gonna die!
Wanda!
Oh!
It's beautiful.
They've waited a long time for you, Wizard.
All hail the great and powerful Oz!
Hail!
Thank you!
Wow, you're a wonderful crowd.
You put the "merry" back in
"the merry Land of Oz."
Hi, what's your name?
- You're very beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.
Girls, listen,
I am not a toy. I am not a toy!
- Oz! Oz!
- Hello!
What? No fireworks?
What are fireworks?
Remind me to show you sometime.
Glinda, I didn't know if you'd like these, or these.
They're both so beautiful,
I couldn't possibly decide.
We need your help, Wizard.
Please save us!
You know,
I should tell you, um...
I might not actually be a wizard.
Yes, I know.
Oh.
At least, not any kind of wizard we were expecting.
You could tell?
Yes.
I can also tell you're weak, selfish, slightly egotistical and a fibber.
I see.
Anything you don't know about me?
Whether or not you'll save my people.
No. I just told you
I'm not the Wizard.
But they don't know that.
If you can make them believe, then you're wizard enough.
These are desperate times, after all.
Can you make them believe?
Will I still get that gold?
Uh-huh.
Good people of Oz.
Your Wizard is here!
What's the matter, sister?
Look at how happy they are.
Do you think she'll be his queen?
Well, of course she'll be his queen.
- What did you expect?
You can't compete with Glinda's charms.
No one can.
Oh, God. Sister, it hurts.
Such is a broken heart.
Your precious wizard did that to you.
Make it stop.
Would you like me to?
One bite is all it takes.
One bite and your world will change forever.
One bite and your heart will become impenetrable.
One bite and you and I will finally share the throne.
Unless you'd rather see
Oz and Glinda there.
You're the wicked one.
Not Glinda.
Sister, you lied to me.
It's nice, isn't it?
How clear everything becomes.
What is happening to me?
Oh, it's just your heart withering away.
Fear not, Theodora, for soon you will feel nothing at all except beautiful wickedness.
Sister?
Oh, sister, you're hideous.
I can cast a simple enchantment and have you looking just the way you were before.
No!
This is who I am now.
I want him to see me like this.
I want him to know that he was the one who made me this way.
Oh, dear.
It's imperative that you behave like the great leader that they think you are.
Morale is essential if we have any hope of defeating Evanora.
- And I assume you have a plan.
- No.
You have a plan.
You're going to lead us into battle and take back the throne.
And do we have an army to help do this?
Of sorts.
The Quadlings, Your Highness.
You're soldiers?
No, sir. Farmers, mostly.
Farmers?
But you can fight.
No, sir.
Many of us can hoe.
Oh, you can hoe.
- And I can work with iron.
- That's good.
- I bake bread.
- Yummy.
- I can sew.
- Not so helpful.
I can make a scarecrow.
Ah!
Well, that'll come in handy.
- It might.
- Hmm.
And these are the Tinkers.
Are you kidding me?
We're tougher than we look, Wizard.
What they lack in stamina the Tinkers make up for in ingenuity.
They can build anything.
And I'll tell you what else.
We can build anything.
Yeah, I got it.
And we're prepared to storm the Emerald City.
If you don't keel over on the way there.
Ow!
And, finally, the Munchkins.
Please tell me, you gentlemen can fight.
No.
But we make pretty clothes.
Also, we sing.
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.
I like it,
I think it's cute. I hope you like it.

All right, enough.

Munchkins, stop!
- They do make beautiful clothes.
- All right.
Now, listen, Wanda.
Glinda.
Guys, um, take five.
Uh, Glinda, these are all very lovely people.
But do you honestly believe that they can kill a wicked witch and an army of flying baboons?
I don't expect them to kill anyone.
What do you mean?
I mean the good people of Oz are forbidden to kill.
Forbidden to...
You want me to lead an army that can't kill?
If this was easy, we wouldn't need a wizard, would we?
Somethings wrong!
- Look!
- What is that?
- The wall!
- What's happening?
The Wicked Witch isn't powerful enough to get through the wall.
It looks like she's managing.
Not by herself, she isn't.
What does that mean?
Is someone helping her?
Everyone, take cover!
Run quickly! Take cover!
Get the children to safety!
Run!
Glinda!
There's so much good here.
It sickens me.
Ah!
Still think your Wizard can save you from the likes of me?
Speak up, or I will tear out your tongue!
Now, who is that?
Don't you recognize me, Wizard?
Have I changed so much?
Theodora?
May I have this dance?
Huh?
Hey, hey!
I get it!
You're a little upset!
Theodora, stop.
You're hurting him.
Theodora, what happened to you?
You happened to me.
This isn't you.
It's your sister.
She's worked her magic on you.
I'd hoped you'd be able to see through her.
Oh, Glinda, so naive.
Just like your father.
That's why it was so easy for my sister to kill him.
She only killed a man, not what he believed in.
Begone, Witch, before the Wizard makes mush of you!
Oh.
How sweet.
You all believe in him.
Well, so did I, once.
And as for you my pretty one.
When I return with my sister and her army the Yellow Brick Road will be red with the blood of every Tinker, farmer and
Munchkin in your kingdom.
You underestimate us, Theodora.
We are a strong and united people.
And now the Wizard is here to lead us.
And as for your Wizard, he will be the first to die.
And you will all see that he is nothing but a deceitful, selfish and extremely mortal man.
Give me that!
It was a broom that you wanted.
Wasn't it, Wizard?
It's all right.
It's all right!
She's gone now.
Don't be frightened.
Now that the Wizard is with us...
Wizard?
Leaving?
But you promised to help us.
Yeah, well, that was before I knew what we were up against.
An army and yet another wicked witch?
This one bent on destroying everyone, especially me?
We can defeat them.
There must be something.
Something we haven't thought of.
Something that we're not seeing.
Something we're just on the verge of.
Glinda.
You need a real wizard.
Better yet, a general.
But you're all I have.
So, you're not the wizard
I was expecting.
So, you don't have the powers
I thought you'd have.
But you're here.
There must be a reason.
Maybe you're capable of more than you know.
Glinda, I wish
I had the answer.
But I'm just a con man.
I'm a carnival magician.
I'm just not the man you want me to be.
Someone needs to tuck me in.
Yes, of course.
Allow me.
My papa used to do it.
I see.
Perhaps you'd prefer the Wizard, then?
Yes, please.
All right.
In you go.
- Here you are.
- Uh-uh.
Just a moment.
Bring forth the covers now.
Yes, ma'am.
Comfy?
All right. Goodnight.
Do you grant wishes?
Do I what?
Grant wishes.
The old wizard could grant wishes.
Ah.
People would travel to the Emerald City and ask him for things.
And if they were good and noble wishes, he would grant them.
Is that right?
Do you know what I'd wish for?
Hmm. A pretty dress?
To have my family back.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I can't grant wishes.
I'm not that kind of wizard.
That's what I thought.
Um, you see, where I come from there aren't any real wizards.
Although, there is one.
Thomas Alva Edison.
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.
- Did he grant wishes?
- No.
But he could look into the future and make it real.
He created the electric light, the phonograph.
He created a camera that could take moving pictures.
Pictures that move?
Yeah. Can you imagine?
And all he had was a little bit of wire and some glass.
With almost nothing, he made the impossible real.
Is that the kind of wizard you are?
It's the kind of wizard
I'd like to be.
Well, you are that kind.
I can tell.
I'd rather you grant wishes, but that's a good wizard, too.
Goodnight, Wizard.
Glinda. I've got it.
What have you got?
I've got a way out of this mess.
- What is this?
- A battle plan.
It's all in there.
Illusion, misdirect, sleight of hand.
Look,
I know I'm not the wizard that you were expecting but I might just be the wizard that you need.
You said you were just a con man.
Precisely.
Nothing but a trickster?
Yes.
A terrible cheat?
The best there is.
The carnival magician's going to put on a show.
I'll put on the show of a lifetime.
The likes of which the Land of Oz has never seen!
Magic, mystery, prestidigitation!
It'll be my greatest trick yet.
Tinkers, gather around!
Quickly, now.
This is what you're gonna build.
Where I come from, this is called a praxinoscope.
Although, I've made a few modifications.
It allows you to project an image into space.
Impossible.
Nothing's impossible if you put your mind to it.
- Bully.
- Bully!
These three roads all lead to the Emerald City.
To the east are the deadly poppy fields.
- We'll have to steer clear of them.
- Why is that?
One good whiff and it's everlasting sleep.
And we're not exactly a terrifying army when we're awake.
All right.
We'll steer clear.
Or maybe not.
In the conjuring business, flash is always good.
Gives the audience a little "wow".
You gentlemen will be combining sulfur rock, nitrate of potash and charcoal to create what is commonly known as black powder.
Whoa!
Mr. Quimby, we need 200 bales of hay delivered to the main road by noon.
Mr. Zim, have the Quadling carts...
Looks good.
My very own Winkie Guards soon you will be facing Glinda and her army of weaklings.
And when they see our towering might,
- they will run and flee for the hills and...
- No!
We shall not let them flee!
We shall show them no mercy!
Now, I've added this adjustable lens to your design along with a few other things.
Have a look.
Yes! Edison himself would be proud.
Now, there's something else
I need you to do.
But I'd rather you just keep it between us.
Yes?
Do you know how to build a hot air balloon?
This is all very impressive but you still haven't told me how you plan to get this thing into the Emerald City.
Relax. I know someone.
What do you mean you know someone?
Hello, Wizard.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't old Sourpuss.
My name is Knuck!
Now, you two be nice to each other.
- Let's move it, Wizard.
- Can you give me a break?
I'll break your nose!
Guess I'm up.
Time to do what I do, right?
Cue the con man.
Would you stop? A con man couldn't have done all this.
You're much more than that.
Well, then, it looks like
I've got you fooled, too.
The only person you've got fooled is yourself.
For protection.
Not that you need it.
Great people of Oz.
Today we fight to free the land from the villainy of the Wicked Witches.
We are few but we are mighty!
- Quadlings.
- Tinkers.
- Bully!
- Munchkins.
We face great odds, but we are armed with our courage, our hard work, and most of all, our faith in one another.
We have nothing to fear as long as we believe.
For when we do believe anything is possible!
Onward!
Halt!
Good day there, fellow Winkie guardsman.
What is your business here?
Supplies for battle.
We bring supplies for battle.
I was told of no such delivery.
Where are your papers of transit?
Why this delay?
Do you not recognize me?
I'm Knuck, the City Herald.
Sir, I'm just trying to do my...
- What I meant was...
- Hmm?
Let them pass!
Let them pass.
What's this?
They dare march on us?
- Tear them apart!
- Fly!
It's a trick.
Pull!
Retreat! Retreat!
Curse you!
Oh, it's not over yet.
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.
Into the woods!
Watch out!
Ah!
Away with her.
- Oh!
- Herald.
- Great Wizard.
Who's this?
Emerald City underground.
Unload the carriage.
Yes, sir. To the rear.
Let's go!
Let's go.
You two, get the trolley.
Everything's ready.
All we need now is you.
Yeah, come on.
I just have to do one thing first.
There's no time.
- Get this carriage in position.
- Yes, sir.
Hurry!
I told Glinda you would do this.
She said I was wrong about you. I guess I wasn't.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about that thing the Tinker built.
- The balloon.
- What balloon?
That's my cue.
All right, you guys.
Just remember, stick to the plan.
Stick to the plan?
The plan was you.
We're supposed to stick to you.
You guys will do great.
So long.
Come back!
We can't do it alone.
- Wizard!
- Wizard, I don't know what to do!
Citizens of Emerald City.
Witness what happens when you defy me.
Glinda did very well for herself today, I'll admit.
Leave her alone!
Unchain her, you witch!
We know the truth.
You poisoned the king!
Guards!
Get them under control.
The citizens of Emerald City will not tolerate this!
We will not!
Silence!
Silence!
Ooh...
What should I do now?
I'd get your sister and fly out of here.
Really?
While you still can.
Well, I think I'm going to do something quite different and I'm going to do it, ooh, very, very slowly, because
I just can't take the sight of that pretty, pretty face.
Ooh, I'm going to wipe out your light until there is nothing left but my darkness.
I have been waiting for this for a long time.
Oh, no.
He said it was going to be his greatest trick yet.
Did he tell you the trick was on us?
How predictable.
I knew that buffoon of yours couldn't be the Wizard.
Out of my way!
Give up, Glinda.
Why do you continue to resist?
Because I believe in the Wizard.
So did I, once.
Behold!
Look!
Your Wizard!
Where is he going?
He's abandoning us.
How could he?
- No!
No!
Aw!
Not so great and powerful after all.
You, there! Move back!
Hey.
Hello, monkey.
Oz!
- I thought you were dead.
- Shh.
You were crying pretty hard.
Was that for me?
Oh, no. Some of the smoke got in my eyes.
On. Right.
Wow, you fooled everybody.
That was your greatest trick yet.
That was just the opening act.
Let this be the final word.
Your prophecy is dead.
Like the king who spoke it and the wizard who tried to fulfill it.
All dead.
It's showtime.
And they will be joined in death by Glinda the Good.
Farewell.
Say hello to your daddy for me.
The dreams of the people live on.
Fear me not, good people of Oz.
Fear me not.
For it is I,
the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!
More tricks?
After everything.
How dare you defy us!
Dare?
How dare you, wicked sisters?
No one defies Oz!
Guards. Destroy him.
Forward!
Attack!
Guards! Come back here this instant!
You thought you could kill me?
Me?
Thanks to you,
I have shed my mortal shell
and taken my true ethereal form.
I'm now more powerful than ever.
I'm invincible!
Do you still doubt me?
Doubt you?
I defy you!
Beautifully done, sister.
Thank you.
Hurry.
You're taking too much time.
Hold.
Hold.
They think they're winning.
Turn it back on.
What? Turn it back on!
Oh, we got a loose wire.
Oi!
Screw's stuck.
Hold on.
Use this.
- Got it.
- Right.
This can't be.
You cannot defeat me.
I'm immortal!
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!
Now witness and observe
as I unleash the stars!
Behold!
So, those are fireworks.
He is the Wizard.
We got Evanora.
She's on the run!
All right! We got one!
- Yeah!
Come back here, you coward!
Glinda.
It's you.
And you said that
I was the weak one!
I may not be able to kill you.
- Now.
- Okay.
But I can kill the one you love.
Higher.
I'm trying.
Ready! Fire!
Begone, Wicked Witch!
Begone!
I hate you.
Begone, forevermore!
The Witch is gone!
The Witch is gone! Yes!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Bully, bully!
I knew we could do it.
Right.
Theodora, I know your wickedness
is not your doing
and should you ever again
find the goodness within you
you are welcome to return.
Never!
Not so fast.
You and I aren't finished yet.
You have the throne, Glinda.
What more could you want?
You can't give me that.
You took what mattered most to me.
My father.
I'll never again feel the comfort of his kindness but I'll settle for the freedom of his people.
Of course, Glinda.
I think at the very least, they deserve that.
What's the matter, Glinda?
Out of bubbles?
I don't need them.
Bubbles are just for show.
What have you done?
Look what you've done to me!
Now everyone will see you as you truly are.
In the name of my father,
I banish you from the Emerald City never to return.
Good people of Oz,
I have here a missive from the great Wizard himself.
"With little more than pluck and belief, we made the impossible happen."
"As your Wizard,
I hereby decree the Land of Oz will forever be free."
Okay.
Close the curtains, please.
I'm trying.
All right.
Let's give it a try.
- Is it on?
Is this thing working?
It's Wonderful.
Well.
If it isn't the most beautiful witch in all of Oz.
Hi, Glinda.
Hello, Wizard.
Well done, Tinker.
Your machine works beautifully.
That's just workmanship.
What you displayed was real courage.
Your father would have been more than proud.
He would have marveled at the woman you've become.
Zim Zallah Bim!
Excellent work, everyone.
Now we're ready in case anyone wants to speak with the Wizard.
Now, remember,
Oscar Diggs died so that the
Wizard of Oz could live.
When those witches come back, and they will come back, we're going to need everyone to believe.
Your secret's safe with us.
Good.
And now it's time for some gifts.
Gifts?
- Gifts?
Knuck, not now.
What kind of gifts?
Well, you know
I can't grant wishes, so this will have to do.
First, the Master Tinker.
To the man who can make anything, my lucky thingamajig.
May it assist you in the reconstruction of the Emerald City.
I will cherish this forever.
Thank you for your faith in me.
And now for Sourpuss.
My name is Knuck!
Sourpuss, I grant you something you are in need of most.
Something that, where I come from can turn the saddest day into a happy one.
- I don't want that.
- It is yours.
- Take it back.
- I cannot.
Knuck, you look nice with a smile.
You do look nice.
Thank you.
Finley, you stood by my side when any monkey in his right mind would have flown away.
To you, I give something that I've never given to anyone.
My friendship.
Now you're my partner.
You're my friend.
That's all
I ever really wanted.
My turn, my turn.
Come here.
I'm afraid I can't give you what I know you want most of all.
All I can offer you is this.
It's us.
I know it's not the family that you had in mind.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
I wonder what you're gonna get.
Oh, I don't need anything, child.
You better have something for Glinda.
But of course.
I've saved the best for last.
For you.
A sight envied by all and seen by none.
You'll be astounded by what you find behind the curtain.
Oh, my.
It's very tight in here.
It's nice, isn't it?
I know what you're up to, Wizard.
What? I'm just giving you a tour.
And I want to thank you.
For opening my eyes.
And what do you see?
That I have everything
I ever wanted.
For the record, I knew you had it in you all along.
Greatness?
No. Better than that.
Goodness.
Now, Knuck.

Sleep, baby sleep
Baby will sleep soon!
Sleep, baby sleep
Baby will sleep soon!
The frame isn't made of the same wood as the bedposts.
They require a harder wood, much finer, with denser fibers.
They are made from yew wood.
- Cemetary trees?
- Yes. They are marvelous.
Very interesting. Poisoned splinters bring death.
Hard wood defies time and allows the creation of fine pieces.
Without yew wood, there is no spindle, and without the spindle...
We lost track of the time.
Like the scatterbrains you are.
I'll let you make your gifts,
I've already made mine.
The princess will die when she's 16 years old.
From piercing her hand with a spindle made of yew.
We mustn't worry the princess.
- You must put it right. - You're more experienced than we are.
Carabosse is a most powerful fairy.
I can't fight against her.
You've bragged of your experience.
I have more than you.
Let me concentrate.
I can ameliorate Destiny.
- Show-off!
Quiet!
The princess will not die, she'll merely fall asleep.
Her sleep will last 100 years.
100 years? What a drag.
Why not 2000?
We can make the best of it.
We were late because of you.
Admit it.
I could say that the princess could play hooky, and live her life in a dream.
I'll make it so that she pierces her hand at 6, and awakes at 16.
What for?
In any case, childhood is interminable.
GOOD AND PEACEFUL SLEEP, ANASTASIA.
Six Years Later
You remember your anger when you learned that
I was pregnant?
And look at you now, besotted for your granddaughter.
You weren't like that with me.
You were a lot less well-behaved.
I am the knight Vladimir.
I am the knight Vladimir.
You must realize that you're not a boy.
Yes! And I am the knight Vladimir!
Unfortunately, Anastasia,
Nature has decided otherwise.
I am a princess.
It's me who decides!
No.
Anastasia, what have you done this time?
You'll kill me.
You see what you've done to your beautiful dress? It's ruined.
Dresses are stupid.
I'll wear no more of them.
But that one fit you like a dream.
I'm not a dream,
I'm a knight.
Fine, I'll get some bandages.
Ouch.
You should have thought first.
Now I have to disinfect it.
It didn't even hurt. Knights don't feel pain, you know...
Try to arrive at adulthood in one piece.
Ah, my brave soldiers.
My army against sleep.
But look out:
I'm the Commander in Chief.
So...
Aside from my alarm clocks,
Above all I love my dictionaries.
Their words tell me stories better than any novel.
No, not stories.
They tell me the sense of things.
Everything is recorded.
Every word is like a tarot card that tells Destiny.
"Herbeline.
"Noun. Feminine.
Thin ewe kept in seclusion."
Like me. I'm a herbeline.
"Hermaphrodite.
"Noun and adjective. Masculine.
From 'Hermaphrodite'...
Mythological.
Said of a being that unites the characteristics of both sexes.
The leech is a hermaphrodite.
In zoology, what one calls the creatures that have a male genital gland and a female genital gland
(leech), the creatures that..."
We must utilize our powers.
- If that's what you can call it.
- You want to demoralise us?
Believe in my experience:
If she must sleep a hundred years, it is time for her to sleep a hundred years all at once.
Only our goddaughter doesn't live in a fairy-tale castle.
The ancient times are past.
Someone who sleeps a hundred years won't pass unobserved in modern times.
We can't put her entire world to sleep.
We'll be more discreet than the first time.
If she wakes 100 years later, alone in the world... she could die of fright.
- We must warn her.
She can't know.
It would be too cruel.
You don't know mankind:
They know they will die, and they live without thinking about it.
They even waste their time.
THEY WASTE THEIR TIME?
Of course. It's even their favorite pasttime.
Miss Anastasia, you will end up waking the dead!
And in your family, there's one you shouldn't wake.
Drat, drat and drat! If I'm a princess that can't do what I want, what's the point?
But must I really die?
You must sleep.
Don't over-dramatize.
It's going to be very annoying in 100 years, if you don't keep your promise.
You have the key, you will escape.
I want to shiver, you understand?
It's crazy how sometimes time passes slowly.
Three or four days before the performance seemed interminable.
I was in a hurry for the disaster to happen and change my life.
The life of a little girl, it's very annoying.
With tiny steps, nice Japanese girls
Walk in rhythm
Through the blooming meadows
Winter is over, the dawn with burning eyes
Tints the dew with pink and blue
Then this, then that, when the sun flies up
With tiny steps, nice Japanese girls
Walk in rhythm through the blooming meadows
Get onstage!
I don't want to be in a girl show!
Do it for your grandmother.
What's the point, if Papa isn't here?
Get away from me, you rot!
We're going to talk, the two of us.
I don't speak to rot covered with boils.
I am your own rot.
Come, I'll give you a chance.
If you can knock down the crossed shinbones, if you can do it, then you are free.
If not you'll end like the others, beheaded, deliciously rotting.
Hand me that.
Whatever your heart desires.
I am true, all is false.
I am in a hurry to finish with you.
You're not very big, you'll make a nice appetizer.
It isn't possible...
Twice in a row?
Yes!
And you don't even exist!
Yes...it's started to freeze.
Are you from among the living?
Mama, is that the little sister that you promised me?
It's...
But you're a real little girl of flesh and blood.
I'm hungry.
You want some?
Poor little dumpling...
And there you go.
Clean as a new penny.
Good for giving to the saddler, all this.
You look like a real little boy like that.
If I'd expected a girl to fall out of the sky...
That looks great on me.
You know, even if I am bigger than you, we're going to be great friends.
No, no, no, stop.
No, no.
No, don't tease her.
No, Peter!
Yes, that's it!
Spin her around, that's great.
That's great. Continue.
It's not nice what you did.
It was very naughty.
You'll see, in the spring, We'll have roses of different colors.
You're hurting them.
If I don't do that, there won't be any roses.
This way, they'll be forever beautiful.
Eternity doesn't exist.
You see that?
Those are called "eyes".
I'll leave three or five, it depends, and from every eye will grow a large stem full of a new force.
But when you cut off the tops of the oaks, they never grow back the same.
Because they're trees.
It's pretentious and ugly to want to constrain trees.
But the more you cut the more they grow, because they're brambles.
Do you believe me?
Yes, because you can't be bad.
Look.
It's the Queen.
The others force-feed her royal jelly, so much that she can't move.
She is the prisoner of her duty.
I'm afraid!
I don't want to be like her!
But you won't, that won't happen to you. Don't cry.
You aren't a bee.
I don't want to be buried so I can't move. Never again!
Don't cry, I'm here.
Nothing will happen to you.
I'll protect you, agreed?
You promise?
Here.
It's too much!
It's like a shower of edelweiss.
Those are white bees.
Do they also have a queen?
Certainly. The most beautiful and the coldest of them all.
The Queen of Ice.
She can't be caught.
Never does she land.
If she lands, all at once, hop!
She takes off to hide among the black clouds.
During the winter nights, it's she who roams the streets of the cities.
Her cold gaze covers the windows with tiny patterns of frost.
It would be beautiful to see her.
Don't say that, you wretch.
Anywhere she gazes, everything becomes gloomy and cold.
Come on. To bed.
I hate this Snow Queen.
If she comes,
I'll put her on the burning stove and she'll melt.
You're foolish.
I'd love to see her.
I'm sure that it would be marvelous.
Can you imagine? To live in the land of eternal snow.
You're making me cold.
I saw her.
I saw the Snow Queen.
- First off, she doesn't exist.
- I saw her, I tell you.
She looked me in the eyes.
I felt a shard of ice pierce my heart.
I want to sleep...
Why are you crying, you idiot!
Wipe away these tears, they make you frightful!
Besides I'm not hurting anymore.
The only thing that hurts me, is to see how everything is ugly, sinister and shrunken here!
And you're as ugly and thin as a rat.
You should see yourself, my poor girl, and understand what it's like living with you.
A skinny stupid dwarf!
A nice present you've become!
What's happened to you, Peter?
Do me the favor of apologizing immédiately.
Apologizing for what?
You think it's a life, for a boy my age, to be shut up with his mother and an ugly girl like her?
I'm sure that whatever's in your eye... keeps you from seeing the nice side of things.
Let me see.
Lower your head.
I don't see anything.
No, I don't see anything.
Obviously, idiot! It was a moment ago I was in pain.
Now it goes well, and I am very happy with my new perception of things.
Poor Peter, you think you're grown-up and intelligent.
You know what's happened?
You're at the difficult age, my boy.
- Peter...
- Now what?
You've never spoken to me as cruelly as you did now.
There's a first time for everything.
Explain to me what has happened.
I don't know.
Perhaps...
Nothing is stable in life.
The only stability is boredom.
Boredom.
You can't know how it imprisons me, how I feel I'm in a perpetual vice.
Is this a life, to stay in this tiny house, with only my mother and...
You're very nice, in a state of blissful wonder, as if it were enough to be blissful in order to be happy.
You're not happy?
Yes, but now,
I'm not anymore.
I want to live, and I know what you call happiness will keep me from iving.
Where is it? Where is it?
"Puberty.
Collection of physiological and psychological modifications that are produced with the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics".
It's noted in the definition.
- Where are you going?
- Where I want!
You've been brave, we've gone at a good pace.
I am the Snow Queen.
But you are entirely frozen.
You'd do best to get under my furs.
Is that better?
My sled...Where is my sled?
It's behind you. Your childhood is now behind you.
Now I'll no longer kiss you, for a final kiss would be your death.
Impudent boy, you're lucky
I wish to spare you.
Who are you?
Phantom train 1724 mustn't stop.
You mustn't stop here.
You are therefore doubly in violation, we don't let bare feet into the kingdom!
It isn't my fault.
Somebody left me here.
I didn't ask them to.
If I'm barefooted, it's because I left looking for my friend.
No one ever stops here.
We put up mannequins to discourage all intrusions, in the hope that no invasion comes during a storm, for evidently, we must arrange them so that they don't blow away.
Excuse me, I've got work to do.
This is a very peaceful country, that doesn't tolerate strangers.
You'd better leave.
How I'd love to have a doll like you.
Hey, you!
I'm closing the station.
You can't stay.
Besides, it's dangerous at night.
Tell me where I can sleep.
Is there a hotel?
You're stubborn!
I told you they don't allow strangers.
What am I going to do?
I'd like to go somewhere.
I waited for a train but none stopped.
I could take you to the prison, but it's full.
Our princes are very cruel.
What have you come to do in this country?
It's because of Peter, he's my friend.
A wonderful boy, much taller than you.
Ssh! Be careful.
This isn't the place to make yourself noticed.
He disappeared six months ago.
He's taller than me.
He has flashing eyes.
He's very strong.
He's the most intelligent boy I've ever known.
He can calculate in his head fractions and square roots.
It might be.
It might be that I've seen him.
Thank you, that's the best news this year!
Calm down! Show a little reason!
This isn't the place to make yourself noticed.
Don't make me say what I haven't said.
I said: It could be that the one
I'm thinking of is whom you're looking for.
Maybe or maybe not.
I've said nothing more.
Walk through this gallery.
Your destiny awaits you.
Make up your mind,
I don't have much time.
It's getting late.
Be careful you don't offend the queen, she has a terrible temper.
I don't know if I should let you in.
Hide in here.
Don't move for any reason until it chimes midnight.
- I prefer the suit of armor.
- No, don't argue.
I'll come back to look for you later on tonight.
And be careful that no one notices you.
"Be careful that no one notices you." Honestly...
It's good that I especially like the sound of alarm clocks, and that the tick-tock of my own is something I miss, because from this point of view,
I was spoiled: I had to count
2,000,550 tick-tocks and hear chime seven times the hours and as many times the half-hours, before you came to get me out of there.
Come with me,
I'll show you the way.
Don't be afraid, you shouldn't meet anyone, but be careful.
You mustn't be noticed.
"Be careful, you mustn't be noticed"...
My God, that's all they say here.
- Did you see their dreams?
- They passed too quickly.
Yes, evidently, it takes a certain experience.
They dream that they are alone in the world on an island of precious pearls and gold, and it will be thus for all Eternity.
Every night they dream the same thing.
Evidently, Peter loves to make the same drawings and have always the same dreams.
My job is finished here, young lady.
If you achieve honors and dignity, we hope that you will remember us.
- Yes.
- But if it turns out badly, you've never seen me.
Understand?
You must be very careful.
You mustn't be noticed.
Have no fear.
A brother can't recognize his sister.
Peter...
Peter, it's me.
Peter, wake up.
Guards! Guards!
Seize her!
Shall we cut off her head?
Have mercy!
My dear, you should have been cautious and not make yourself noticed.
Ah, now we're not so proud.
You are guilty of the crime of offending royalty.
Let her go!
She's only a child.
Certainly, she's connected to people of greater size, but she's only a child.
Do you understand you took a great risk in coming fraudulently into my room?
So that I might choose to let you live, you must tell me everything.
Or would you prefer to lose your head?
But I'm telling the truth.
Someone spoke so well of the prince, that I believed he could only be my friend Peter.
How could I know this wasn't him, when I'd left to look for him?
Peter is exactly the same, with all the best qualities in the world, in fact.
You're right.
My prince is wonderful.
Like Peter.
You're lucky, because you found him.
I'll never find Peter.
What time is it?
Oh, it's too lovely! I love watches and alarm clocks.
I give it to you.
Oh, thank you! Thank you.
I'm confused, Your Highness.
In any case, I'm very happy.
I've arranged that you be provided with delicacies.
Farewell. Never fear:
You will find Peter.
It was a long time ago that I lost him.
Patience. Time seems very long because you are so young, but you'll see, I who am older than you...
How lucky you are.
Don't say that, wretched one.
Time passes quickly.
And you'll realize that soon enough.
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Goodbye, Your Majesty.
Goodbye.
- Her flesh must be tender.
- Let her go! Let her go!
She's mine, you understand?
Let her go!
They won't kill you as long as I don't get angry with you.
But if I do get angry with you, it's I that will kill you.
You are no doubt a princess.
No.
And I told her my story.
She thought that I had experienced some very strange things, and that in comparison, although she was older than me, nothing had happened to her at all.
This is Granny, called Old Shrew.
What?
It was she who led the men in the attack, but now, she's old, so she can't do anything.
That's very funny, my girl!
I've got 24 of them.
Kiss him!
Don't be afraid.
These pigeons are domesticated.
They are afraid of us, not the other way around.
This one, you should keep your eye on.
If not, she'll take off, and with such speed, you won't have a chance to catch her.
Every night, it amuses me to tickle her neck, so that she knows what it's all about.
What if she doesn't like it?
What if she doesn't like it at all?
I give the orders.
Come on, we're going to bed.
Aren't you going to keep your knife while you sleep?
I always sleep with it.
You never know.
Are you afraid that I'll do to you what I did to the doe?
I know very well you're going to do it.
I'm not even afraid.
You know that this is a real knife.
I press a little harder...
Blood trickles.
You can't know how it makes me itch.
I know that if I do it, afterwards, I will slit your throat.
I don't wish to.
I don't want to.
But I'm itching to.
Aren't you afraid?
Aren't you afraid of me?
You are mad.
You must never trust me.
I am not bad, but that's what excites me.
Sometimes, I can't control myself anymore.
You are brave for a girl.
It's the princess that gave them to me.
Do you only meet princes and princesses?
High society, that's how it is with them.
The Queen of England doesn't meet just anyone.
You talk in your sleep, you're too funny.
It's a kind of dream, but not so stupid.
Would you really like to find your friend Peter?
- I would give my life.
- Don't say that. Life's precious.
I believe that he's in Laponia.
I can't think of where else he could be.
But if you swear you will return and give yourself up...
I swear.
Oh my, all of this...
It's good, huh?
- But it sticks to your teeth.
All the men have left, there's only my grandmother left.
She won't leave.
She's tough.
But she has a thing for the bottle.
What am I doing here?
Help! Get me out of here!
Who put me here?
Get me out of here!
Little thieves!
Stay there!
Who are these little thieves?
I would have liked to keep her.
But too bad, I'm going to untie her and let you go, so that you can return to Laponia.
Now I don't want to leave.
Eat, my doe. eat.
Perhaps I'll die of cold before the end.
You took your time getting here!
I know you're very clever.
You could, with a bit of string, tie up all the winds on earth.
If you undo the first knot, there's a good wind.
Untie the second, ships slice through the waves quickly.
But if you untie the third and fourth, you will raise a storm that will blow down all the forests on earth.
And you know how to make a potion that gives the strength of a dozen men.
Not so quickly, my young friend.
I only do what is just, and what I have to do.
Help me to tear Peter from the clutches of the cruel
Snow Queen.
Ssh!
Ah...You see...
Let me mull it over.
But your case isn't an easy one.
Oh no, no, no.
It isn't easy.
"When the dragon rampant
"bites the tail of the winged dragon,
"and the winged dragon
"swallows the tail of the dragon rampant,
"and the dragon rampant
"absorbs the winged dragon,
"the result is... the Ouroboros!"
Is this the Ouroboros?
This Book of Spells comes to me to confirm...
Your friend is a prisoner of the Snow Queen.
But he is very happy, and thinks he is among the happiest of men.
But he's mistaken, isn't he?
He's mistaken, but he's happy.
The Snow Queen will retain her hold on him.
But couldn't you make a potion that would give me the power to break the spell?
I cannot give you a power stronger than that which you possess.
Don't you see that animals and people are compelled to serve you?
You departed bare-footed and without mishap, you've travelled half the universe.
It's not from me that you could receive strength, oh no!
The doe will take you ten leagues from here, to a grove of red fruit in the midst of the snow.
Pay attention.
That's where he'll return to you.
No, no. Mama told me it was forbidden.
"Don't eat strange fruit,
"especially red berries: they could be poisonous, and you could die."
Yes, but I risk nothing:
I'm dreaming.
Yes, I risk dying while I sleep.
No, no...I'm too young to die.
But if you die while sleeping, you then awake.
What are you doing here?
Please leave.
But first tell me what you're doing here in an old-fashioned dress.
I am in my home.
And you're dressed in a fashion that is very strange.
And you look a lot like Peter.
Yes, you look a lot like him.
My great-grandfather was called Peter.
My name is Johan.
My name is Anastasia.
I know, it's a pompous name.
My grandmother liked it,
I don't remember why.
You see that I didn't lie.
That's my grandmother.
But careful, don't wake her.
Grown-ups are very annoying.
As for little vixens, they're stupid, mawkish and pretentious.
I hate girls.
But who are you?
Peter's beloved.
And you aren't Peter.
If only I hadn't lost in the exchange...
You shouldn't have done that!
I'm certainly much younger than you!
- How old are you?
My mother had me when she was 15, and my father was the groom.
He was very, very handsome.
And so are you.
But...if I did the same with you,
I would waste my youth, because you are much too old for me.
But I'm 18. You have strange ideas about the world.
That's the way I am.
All or nothing.
Then it's nothing?
Not more than seven today.
One...
Three...
Six...
Seven...
Eight...
- You're cheating!
That's enough for today.
- It looks like you want it.
- No, I don't want it.
You know what it's called, a girl like you?
A tease.
In fact, you're more clever than I thought.
No, no.
I like to flirt with you.
But I'm not sure you love me.
It's too soon.
What did you do yesterday?
I went to school.
If you don't cheat!
You're wearing a corset?
But what kind of creature are you?
A woman.
Actually a young girl.
Your skin is soft.
How can you endure these awful stays?
To be beautiful, you must suffer.
There are some that don't.
And they're very beautiful.
- More beautiful than me?
- Are you jealous?
What does that mean, jealous?
To fear that I prefer someone else to you.
- But it's impossible.
- Yes, it's possible.
You make me tired, with your funny dress with laces.
Mind you, it's exciting.
- Exciting?
A turn-on.
You're a turn-on.
But you're also a ninny, pretending you're a princess.
But I am a princess!
No one dares disobey me!
No one dares contradict me!
I get it.
You're not 16.
I am 16!
Fine...I'll come back when you're more grown up.
Take heed.
Perhaps you'll be too old.
And perhaps I'll no longer love you!
A pretty boy, but I wonder if it's really worth the trouble that you run after him to the end of the world.
How beautiful you are, and how I missed you too!
You could have stayed with me.
- Yes, but...
- I know. You love him.
And if you love him, you'll cause yourself a lot of pain.
You must never tell a boy you're in love with him.
I told him that I'd risk not being so anymore.
That's better.
There.
That's where he stopped.
I've got the right to go much further, since I'm a girl.
It's girls that can teach girls all about love.
Really?
Often boys are too clumsy, or too much in a hurry.
And if they're a little better raised, they're afraid of virgins.
You've already had a boy?
Men!
All those that I liked.
Bandits don't make a fuss.
That boy who worries and feels the shudder of remorse because you are too young...
I slept with a man for the first time when I was 13.
If I could have done so at 12,
I would have.
I think I've got the devil in my body!
And how many have you had?
I stopped counting.
Anyway, what's the point?
There are those that count, and those that don't.
But...there's also the one who doesn't count anymore.
Who is that?
He that you loved very much, and now you're apart.
Does that exist, being apart from someone you've loved very much?
All the time.
Anyway...Sometimes you find them again.
Look at you and me...
I think I love girls better than I love men.
They have more mystery.
Especially a little girl in love who doesn't know what to do about it.
Let me take care of it.
With a girl, it doesn't count.
Tell me that I'm your friend.
Not your little friend...
Your great friend.
You're the first girl that I've loved.
Before, I wanted to be a boy.
I hated girls.
I wanted my mother to call me Vladimir.
And I never wanted to have breasts.
Now, I want some huge ones.
Everyone's stupid when they're little.
Anyway, you had guts.
I couldn't frighten you.
And the knife?
- The dagger?
- Yes.
- I liked it.
I was very afraid, but that's what I liked about it.
I've always been treated as if I were made of glass.
Here...
Look.
I've got your watch.
I stole it.
I wear it always.
I thought I'd lost it.
You never pay attention.
You're so spoiled.
- And you're such a thief.
- That isn't called thieving.
- Pinching.
Pincher!
Johan, where are you going?
This is the third time you've done this. You leave...
I don't know...You must stop it now, Johan.
We already talked the other day about it.
Mama, I'm 17.
It's an easy year.
I'll get my diploma.
I should make the most of it.
Afterwards, I won't have the time.
But your diploma, you must get it with honors.
Exactly, it's the last year that
I can goof off.
Don't worry, afterwards
I'll take my prep classes.
Then, I won't time for anything.
Agreed, but promise you won't come in too late.
And that you won't drink too much, because alcohol, you know.
I'm not going out, I'm going to the studio. I invited Paul.
All right. If it's Paul, OK.
Agreed. But you won't come in too late, eh?
Kiss.
- I want to leave.
- And if I won't let you?
You know I could hurt you?
That I could kill you?
No! That would be a shame.
- A shame for who?
- For my daughter.
I haven't been here in 4 days but I haven't forgotten you.
You're lying...
You're lying! You're lying!
- You'll catch cold. - I've caught a cold! I did it on purpose.
Stop!
I'm helpless before you.
I don't know what to do.
Me neither!
When you weren't there...
I love you.
Our story scares me.
Why?
Because we're too young, the two of us.
It shouldn't be so intense, so absolute.
Swear that I'm your first and your last.
You're the soul of Peter, the first and the last.
What's this business about Peter?
My absolute, ever since I was little.
I've looked for you through the long dream and nightmare of childhood.
What are you saying?
The truth for young girls.
Don't be jealous.
Take me to your world.
No, impossible.
It isn't made for you.
It would drink you, it would steal your eternity.
Mine, not ours.
Ours too.
Anastasia...
Anastasia.
You want me to go?
Anastasia?
What? You don't want to talk to me anymore? Is that it?
I don't know you.
I thought I'd go mad when I couldn't find you.
You realize what you've done to me?
I did to you what you did to me!
We were too young, you said so all the time.
I want this baby, he's mine!
I'll call him Vladimir.
It's the name I gave myself when I was little.
But you're crazy!
You could have asked my opinion!
You told me to be reasonable!
I was in my fashion!
Stop! You're hurting me!
You didn't have the right to disappear like that!
Do you love me like before?
Like before.
Only it's after.
You see, I go out all alone in your world.
THE ACCOUNTANT: Since the birth of time,
humanity has endeavored
to restrain evil men in prisons.
But since Cain fled
the murder of his brother,
evil men have fled the walls of punishment.
So, it doesn't matter
if you're a badass motherfucker on the run,
because you think
you're better than everyone else,
and somehow entitled
to do what you gotta do.
No.
Because, you see, badass motherfuckers
are never fast enough.
In the end, they will all be accounted for.
Son of a bitch! Came out of nowhere.
- Didn't she say he was dead?
- You see him?
- I think we lost him.
- I swear she said he was dead.
- Keep watching!
- Well, fucking he ain't!
- Drive the fucking car!
- I'm driving the goddamn car!
I don't see him.
SIDE PASSENGER: He knows.
He knows what we did to her.
He knows! He's gonna make us pay!
- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- I think we lost him.
I ain't never telling you where they've taken her. Never.
I know.
You took my leg, you fuck!
I'm sorry, man.
Where is she?
- I don't know, man.
- Where is the baby girl?
I don't know, man.
I don't know.
Stillwater! Hey! Hey!
Okay, Deacon's Tree, man. Stillwater Marsh!
Texas, I think.
You're too late. You gotta know that, right?
First full moon, she's dead, man.
She's dead and hell's gonna walk the motherfucking earth.
Hell already is walking the earth.
You tell him I'm coming.
Tell him I'm coming to get her back.
Raise a little hell, raise a little hell
Raise a little hell
Raise a little hell, raise a little hell
Raise a little hell
So, I tell him, I says, "Frank, that's it.
No more free milk.
"You gonna have to buy the cow, you son of a bitch."
But you are not fat, Piper.
What? No, Norma Jean. "Buy the cow."
Marry me.
I'm saying he's gotta marry me.
I cut him off.
You cut him off?
- (LAUGHS) Not just yes, but hell, yes!
- (LAUGHING)
No tits, no ass, and I told him,
"If I see that big ol' dick anywhere near my face again,
- "I'm gonna bite it in half."
- (LAUGHS) You said that?
PIPER: Yeah, sure did.
Oh, my God. How long has it been?
Oh, two days. But that's like a decade in horny fucker years.
So, he bought you a diamond?
Oh, God, no.
If Frank had money for a diamond,
I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago and put this shit hole in rear view.
But he did get down on one knee and ask me to be his bride.
- No way! Oh!
- Yes, way!
Honey!
Come on, come on!
You think I pay you bitches to stand around and yap?
Get the fuck back to work.
Sit on it, baby.
Hi, guys. I'm Piper.
Can I get you something to drink?
We'll take this.
"She's a Brickhouse" breakfast.
Ten monster flapjacks for $4.99.
- And three waters.
- All right, and what can I get for...
That's it. Just the pancakes, if that's okay.
Okay, coming right up.
Lou, one Brickhouse!
Hello, beautiful. Coffee?
Black, with sugar.
Have you ever heard of a Stillwater Marsh or a Deacon's Tree? In Texas, maybe?
Stillwater Marsh, yeah, I've heard of it, but it ain't in Texas.
Stillwater is in Louisiana.
Small town?
Honey, Stillwater is a prison.
My daddy did some time there before it closed.
I'll get you that coffee.
Here's some muffins and warm milk.
- But we didn't order...
- It's on the house.
So, you gonna ask me what time my shift ends?
It's a full moon tonight.
I always feel a little randy with a full moon.
Full moon's two days off.
You sure about that, sweetie?
Pretty sure.
Now, that's a hell of a ride out there.
Is that yours?
The Charger? I wish.
Is it hers?
PIPER: All right, here are them waters.
I'll be right back with the flapjacks.
Sure. But if you're looking for a ride...
I told you I wanted sugar.
On the house? On the fucking house?
Relax. We gonna throw them muffins out, anyway.
If they're not gonna pay for them, somebody's gonna have to pay the price.
I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch, never touch me like that again.
- Let go of my balls.
- Shut up.
Muffins are on me. I quit.
Put some honey butter on them muffins.
They'll taste an awful lot better that way.
(SINGING) Sucking on my titties
like you wanted me, calling me all the time
Like Blondie, check out my Chrissy behind
It's fine all of the time
What else is in the teaches
of Peaches, huh?
What?
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away
Oh! Motherfuck!
Now, that's not so bad.
I can fix that if you'd like.
I would. Thank you.
If you give me a lift.
I'm only going as far as Blackfoot Falls.
The truck stop there.
I'd be much obliged.
Thank you.
Just so you know,
I don't pick up hitchhikers.
I didn't have my thumb out.
Need some help there?
You, fat fuck. Come here.
What'd you call me?
What did you just call me?
I called you "fat fuck."
And we had better leave it at that.
Unless you'd prefer I call you
"dead fat fuck."
What?
I'm looking for someone.
Maybe 40 or so, 6'1", probably looked out of place.
Ah!
He was here earlier. Traveling light.
- Likely on foot.
- Who are you?
I'm The Accountant.
That supposed to mean something to me?
It will if I add you to the books.
And if you don't tell me what I want to know.
You had something to say?
He was here. Earlier.
- Where did he go?
- That way.
On foot.
I appreciate the ride.
You all right?
Yeah. I mean, I quit my job. Again.
But this time it's different 'cause...
I don't know, my man's out of work and we just got engaged.
Is he a good man?
Yeah.
Yeah, he is. I mean,
I guess you can just tell these things.
- No, no, no. Fuck!
- Baby, I'm fucking you all right.
- Yeah.
- No fucking...
MONA: What the hell do you think you're doing? Psycho bitch.
Piper, Piper, I can explain.
She was just showing me something.
Get out! Don't.
Fuck you, Piper. We're in...
I didn't quite hear what you said!
I said, "We're in..."
FRANK: You made me cheat on you.
This is your fault.
- Would you...
- Hey!
Piper, stop!
You've got nowhere else to go, and you know it.
Oh, baby. You don't think
I can find a guy better than you in Florida?
Florida? Hell, no. Texas? Maybe.
We'll see about that.
No, no, no. You're not taking my car.
You're not taking my car, bitch!
Your car? Who's been making the payments, you out of work, skanky, Mona-fucking piece of shit?
You're insane, woman.
Look what you made me do! Come on.
I'll get you some ice.
Frank, sweetie.
I'm gonna tell everybody what I caught you doing with my pink dildo.
You don't wanna be with me?
Fine. When I'm done, nobody's gonna wanna be with you, ever.
- Go to hell.
- (SCOFFS) Ha!
Hey.
I am one with the darkness.
I am one with the darkness.
I am one with the darkness.
It burns through me.
It burns through me. Now to you.
... forge our bond together.
And offer the sacrifice
that will set us all free.
We will walk through
the valley of the shadow of death.
WOMAN: No!
No! Please, don't take my baby.
KING: And only through...
- Give me the baby.
- WOMAN: No!
You want me to roll up the window?
No.
You can use my jacket if you're cold.
Thank you.
You didn't kill him, did you?
Your fiancé? No.
Thanks for that.
Are you hungry?
I could use a drink.
Oklahoma?
Mmm-hmm.
You mentioned Florida.
My business is in Louisiana.
Can you get me that far?
- What business?
- I'm looking for someone.
I'm Milton.
You're Piper, right?
Well, Milton, if you try and kill me and dump me in the woods,
I'm gonna cut your nuts off.
Yes, ma'am.
All right, then.
(SINGING) All the planes have been grounded
Greetings, folks.
Welcome to the Bull By The Balls.
Roy.
Milton.
Thought you were dead.
You hoped I was dead. Not the same.
You planning on staying?
You got a problem with that?
Your money's good as any, I expect.
But be gone by dawn.
That goes by the name of the sandman
What was that all about?
In another life, I used to drive a truck through these parts.
I'd enjoy a visit with his sister.
- And he took offense?
- Yes.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- You sure?
- Howdy.
I'm Candy.
Start you off with some drinks?
- Beer.
- Same.
I need to see some IDs, too.
What the hell is this?
Guess it's been a while since you did that visiting.
You want a drink? You gotta be a member.
Dry county.
Oh, shit. Sorry.
- That was in my pocket.
- Don't look at me like I'm some sort of thief.
I lifted it for protection.
If you stole my ride,
I was gonna have to hunt you down.
Did she say something funny?
Yeah, this license isn't just expired, it's antique.
All right, then bring me a black coffee with sugar.
Aw! Now, now, now. For you, handsome,
I don't know,
I think maybe I can bend the rules a bit.
Don't tell nobody.
You gonna tap that or what?
Tap?
Geez, Milton, how long has it been?
I've had a lot on my mind.
Uh-huh. Right. Suit yourself then.
But no one ever reaches the end and says,
"I wish I hadn't fucked so much."
Where you going?
I'm going to take a shower, lie in a warm bed,
- do my nails.
- What about your beer?
You drink it. I'll see you at dawn.
Here you go, big boy.
Like an eagle in the eye
of a hurricane that's abandoned
Get you a drink, friend?
MAN: It's a nice place you got.
You rent that out for parties here?
We sure do. You planning a party?
Yeah. I'm planning on having one of them tonight.
Reverend Jonah King,
the self-proclaimed prophet...
FRANK: Mom, Mom, look, it's over.
Piper's gone. I just want my car back.
- Look, I gotta go. Cops are here.
...are wanted for questioning...
- I love you, too. - ...in the brutal
murder of the young parents.
About fucking time.
- I called you guys like...
- There was a traveler.
- 6'1". (SNIFFS)
- What?
Ah! Yes, the traveler.
Angry with attitude.
Sumbitch kicked me in the... Who are you?
- I'm The Accountant.
- The...
I called a cop.
The "sumbitch," where did he go?
Fuck should I know?
I woke up and all three were gone.
- All three?
- The bitch, the sumbitch
- and my car!
- What kind of car?
Look, Hugo Boss, you ain't no cop, me ain't no talking.
Two sumbitches in one day?
You leave me no choice.
I'm gonna take this stick from Kentucky and beat your ass with it.
- What kind of car, Frank?
- What?
Your car, what kind is it?
Why does everyone keep hurting me?
- (SCREAMS)
- Answer. The.
Question.
(GROANS) '69 Charger, you fuck.
440 or the Hemi?
Wait, wait, wait. Get me off this wall.
Please. No!
Where you going?
Please, get me off the wall.
Hey, fuck tard, that's mine.
Shithead, shithead, that's...
TROOPER 1: You call about a stolen car?
TROOPER 2: Frank Raimi?
In there.
I'm looking for someone.
6'1", not from around here.
He's driving a '69 Charger.
He's traveling with her.
Jesus.
- TROOPER 1: Excuse me?
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
Show me your hands, asshole.
- This is your lucky day.
- What's the matter...
You're...
You're a Fed?
I'm in pursuit of a traveler.
John, John Milton.
He's with the girl in this photo.
- But the guy in the room, he's...
- Dead. Yes.
I'd say it's unfortunate, but I'd be lying.
Only his mother will miss him.
Look, Troopers, I need your help with my pursuit of this fugitive.
If we three could apprehend him...
- You are ambitious.
- I guess.
Yes, we are.
I can tell that you are.
Success will mean promotion, pay raise.
I guaran-fucking-tee it.
Now, we are going to hunt this Milton.
We are going to find the Charger that he's driving and when we find him, you will shoot to kill.
Shoot to kill.
That's against protocol.
Yeah. This man is highly dangerous.
He has killed. He will kill again.
He must be taken down on sight.
The time it takes you to follow your protocols, that's the time it takes him to end your life.
Shall we?
CANDY: Come on.
- Oh! Fuck, yeah!
- Um, are we gonna do it?
Depends on how well you do those nails.
Oh! (CLICKS TONGUE)
See, you gotta be careful.
You're gonna have to redo that one.
CANDY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God!
Sorry. Shut the fuck up in there! Come on!
Shut the fuck up!
Move it. You can move that cock.
Oh! God damn it.
Sorry about that.
CANDY: Come on. Come on, move it.
Hang on.
NEWSREADER: ... March 15th,
in a dumpster behind a local strip club.
The case is set to go to trial
in February of 2011.
In other news tonight,
new details are emerging
in the case of a missing Colorado infant.
Investigators, in cooperation with
the Colorado state police,
have issued an all points bulletin
for Jonah King's immediate detention
in connection with the murders of a young
married couple in Loveland, Colorado.
Their infant girl is believed to have been
abducted by this religious sect.
A nationwide Amber Alert
is now in full effect.
You may recall we broke the story first
that the young mother...
Investigators refuse to comment.
Although, our own Nathan Brown
has recently learned...
Look at that handsome devil.
Fools do not know how blessed they are to look upon the messiah of the next age.
The girl is in 11. And Milton, he in number 12.
This Milton is no friend to us.
He will try and keep us from what we are rightfully owed.
He is the blight, and we are the rain.
Go forth and pour your anger upon him.
CANDY: Oh, yeah.
Oh, baby. Why don't you fuck naked?
I never disrobe before a gunfight.
Oh, yeah.
(SINGING) I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
Gimme candy I've never had
Tastes so sweet, makes good love bad
Fallen out with my love
A grievous time to pass
Sugar done break my heart
A heart not meant to last
In spite of saddened days...
CANDY: Come on, baby. Don't be shy.
That baby is as good as dead.
CANDY: Oh, fuck yeah!
Shit! Shit!
Fuck him, motherfucker! Fuck him.
Who's a punk-ass motherfucker?
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
I know that you want the candy
Gimme candy I've never had
Gimme candy I've never had
Tastes so sweet, makes good love bad
Oh, hell.
Would you calm down?
He definitely took the bait.
- You know these people?
- We should hurry. There are probably more.
TROOPER: Look, there's Jonah King.
Troopers, remember why we're here.
PIPER: Milton.
Milton, you owe me some answers.
TROOPER: It's him.
Freeze!
Milton! Fuck!
Promotion and pay raise.
Promotion and pay raise.
Get down!
(GASPS) Drop it!
- No!
- You sorry mother...
Fuck you! Die, you...
PIPER: Oh, my God.
- Milton, what are you doing?
- I'm going after him.
Why? You wanna join me?
PIPER: Bleeding's almost stopped.
It's just a graze.
Milton, those cops shot at us with no warning.
They weren't trying to arrest us, they were trying to kill us.
They were trying to kill you.
What, are you a murderer?
You escape from prison or something?
- Go on, what is it?
- Both.
Jesus, what have I done?
What have you fucking got me in to?
Milton, I shot a cop!
I'm gonna go to jail!
Do you understand that? Fuck!
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't shoot you in the face.
I'm driving.
PIPER: You know what I mean!
Fuck!
They took her baby.
They took her little girl.
The little girl on the news?
- The little baby everyone's looking for?
- Yes.
They killed my daughter.
They took her baby.
That baby girl is all I got.
She's the last connection to my daughter.
I am going to get her back.
Shotgun. It's already loaded.
Roll it down.
Now!
Get the other gun ready.
No, no, no. The old one.
The big one in the case, have it ready.
- It's...
- (STATIC BUZZING)
It's over, Milton. Stop the car.
- I can't do that!
- Really?
What makes you think you have a choice?
Because you're obnoxious, first, and because I have something I gotta do.
(LAUGHS) Well, then you should've done it
a long time ago.
I didn't have to do it a long time ago, did I?
Oh, Milton, I will kill that pretty little
woman in the backseat to get to you.
You think you're Loki, huh?
You think you're Baron Samedi?
- I won't allow that.
- Again,
what makes you think you have a choice?
This does.
Piper, wait!
He ain't one of them that killed your daughter, was he?
He's someone else.
Anyone not trying to kill you?
MILTON: No.
What kind of fucking gun is that?
The kind you use on guys like that.
I need to reload. You drive.
God damn it.
You. You! You can't be here.
- Rookie!
- Sarge, this old joke, he can't stomp around the crime scene.
Captain, sorry about that.
Sarge, you'd better get this guy out of here right now.
Cap, he's green, that's all.
Standing on evidence is what he's doing.
.45s.
- Bag them and tag them.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sarge. Tag these.
Why do we have two dead Colorado troopers within our great state of Oklahoma?
And how did these gentlemen come to be on the wrong end of a disagreement?
The guest in this room, John Milton,
I take it he's not among the departed?
- No, sir.
- TROOPER: Cap, we got a live one.
CAP: I want roadblocks, Sarge.
All over the state. You know the drill.
Get me a blanket and get a medic in here, too.
You're gonna be okay now.
We was fucking.
He killed him while we was fucking!
- Who did?
- No, you don't understand.
It's never happened to me before, you know?
Has it ever happened to you?
Let's get a shrink in here, too.
Dude, you think there's anybody in there?
I guess.
The doors are still closed.
- Jesus...
- Carpenter.
And despite what you've heard, prefers short hair.
You almost fucking killed me, man.
Not even close.
I won't see you again until you're 73.
You, I'll see in three months.
TEEN: Hey, what does that mean?
MILTON: My daughter got mixed up with King straight out of college.
PIPER: She knew him? She knew Jonah King?
She knew him, yes, yes, she did.
Her world was in a tailspin, and King was preaching quiet revolution.
It was four months before she realized
"quiet" meant hiding in a basement, cutting the heads off of chickens.
Jonah King's into voodoo?
Not voodoo, satanic magic.
He was recruiting for his own personal Armageddon.
Understandably, my daughter wanted out.
When she told him she was leaving, he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron.
Jesus.
She learned her lesson, was a good little follower for 18 months, then one night,
she got Jonah alone
and stabbed him in his face
with a pentagram pendant, and vanished into the darkness.
Milton, your daughter was in a cult for two years, and you didn't even know about it?
I mean, why didn't you help her before?
I didn't find out about any of this until...
Until after I got locked up.
You're not gonna reload?
Only three bullets to begin.
Milton, that's his van.
Pull over.
(PEOPLE SINGING
ALL THINGS BRIGHTAND BEAUTIFUL)
Stay here.
ALL: (SINGING) Each little flower that opens
Each little bird that sings
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all
All things bright and beautiful

Man, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Let her go and give me the child.
Or I'll blow all your heads off.
Drop it. Or we will gut her.
Your choice, sugar. But either way, we win.
MAN: We don't play, boy.
Milton, isn't it?
Why you here?
- Why you making such a fuss?
- You know why I'm here.
All I know about you is you abandoned your daughter.
Crushed her so completely, she told everyone you were dead.
No, Milton.
I cannot, in good faith, hand over this child to you.
But sacrificing her under the full moon is okay?
This child is unbelievably blessed.
Look around you. World is on fire.
- People are suffering.
- (LAUGHING)
And they will continue to suffer until change comes.
Yeah, go ahead and laugh, boy.
Change is gonna come.
Thanks to your lineage.
This child will open the door to a new world order.
The charlatan murders my daughter and then feeds me his philosophy.
Your daughter's death was an accident.
I saw the whole thing.
I saw who you are when no one's looking.
And I saw what that night cost you.
Milton, you're embarrassing yourself.
You forced my daughter on her knees, and she made you pay for it.
Isn't that right, Leather Jacket?
You were there.
Dickless made you swear not to tell anyone.
MAN: Yo, John.
Give me the child.
Give me the child.
I said, give me the child.
No!
KING: Back off!
My child, it'd be pretty easy for me to shoot you in the throat, watch you gurgle, while I eat my morning grapefruit.
But I don't think so, Piper. You...
You interest me.
I could take your life.
Or I could bestow my blessings upon you.
Teach you, like I taught Milton's daughter.
You remind me of her, you know?
So much spirit.
But I broke her.
And I will so enjoy breaking you the same way.
Let's go for a ride.
Let's go!
PIPER: No! No!
No! Milton! Milton!
I'll fucking kill you!
Fuck you! Fuck you! Get off me!
No! No!
Fucking get off me, you motherfucker!
This is gonna be fun!
- Feisty bitch! Feisty bitch!
- MAN: We're going for a ride, girl.
You see this here femur bone?
That belonged to your daughter.
I keep it with me wherever I go.
PIPER: Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fucking let me go!
Next time,
I'll shoot you in your fucking mouth.
Shall we proceed?
We'll bury them out back.
Now, get the fucking shovels out of the truck.
No, you go get the fucking shovels.
WOMAN: Fuck!
MAN: Go! Go! Down!
How come he ain't dead?
It don't matter. He's gonna be.
Well, look at this.
He's still coming.
- Who's still coming?
- Milton.
- Milton.
- MAN: What?
- Stay down.
- He's alive.
MAN: But you shot him in the face.
KING: Don't you see?
We stand at a crossroads.
Y'all didn't think we could just kick up our heels, and change the world, did you?
Mmm-mmm.
We got a fight coming. A glorious battle.
He's coming around!
Fuck you!
WOMAN: I'm going to kill you, you little bitch!
I've changed my mind about you, Piper.
You are too willful to be taught.
I am going to kill you, and then I'm going to defile your corpse.
Between now and then,
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Oh, Piper.
Knock her ass out!
KING: You're so willful.
Willful!
Goodbye, sweet Piper.
He's coming right at us!
Piper!
Jesus, Milton. How?
It's still in there.
The bullet. I can... I can feel it.
How are you still alive?
We don't have time for this.
They're getting away.
Thought you were dead.
CANDY: This license isn't just expired,
it's antique.
She told everyone you were dead.
How long were you in prison?
Were you in prison at all?
Jesus, Milton, has anything you told me been true?
I used to know a guy who lived out this way.
You have one of those portable phones?
A cell phone?
You mean a cell phone, Milton?
Yeah, I got a cell phone. It's in my purse.
- You just gonna ignore me?
- I'm gonna try.
We have to hide the car. I'll push, you steer.
Forget about it. Who cares?
You should. You killed two cops.
(SINGING) Here we are
Burning up in our cars
And in our hearts
With your tea
Lucky states as the day breaks
The blind are leading the blind
- Scorcher today, huh?
- Help me.
Christ on a cracker. My apologies.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's a symbol of our pact with Lord Satan.
Pact, huh? Ooh!
Funny, he's never mentioned you.
Whoa! Those are fucked.
Here, have some water.
(LAUGHING) Amateurs.
I'm gonna die, ain't I?
- Milton's work, I take it.
- Yeah.
Son of a bitch shot me!
Wait. How did you...
Who are you?
I'm The Accountant.
I'm curious, and I never get curious.
- What do you people want with Milton?
- You're the who?
Does it matter? Milton.
Why is he important to you?
He isn't! He's the one chasing us!
- Why?
- Because...
Because of what we did.
Because of who we took.
Well, color me curious, what did you do?
And who did you take?
Let me know if I hurt you, Milton.
I tried to get her back.
I really did.
I know.
Fucking devil worshippers.
They freak me the fuck out.
Messing with powers they ought not to.
Turns my shit white.
None of it's real.
No, Milton. UFOs and Bigfoot and ghosts, that's bullshit.
Devils and demons.
Once you open those doors, you just can't close them.
But you know that, don't you?
- You're dead.
- Yeah, we've been getting that a lot lately.
No, toots.
I carried his coffin.
Webster, are you gonna keep stroking that.357, or you gonna yank it?
That depends.
How is this possible?
You heard about my daughter?
I did.
Then you know why I'm back.
I don't...
Can you explain this, please?
He loved his daughter.
A lot of daddies love their daughters.
But it don't explain shattering reality.
Well, that one loved his little girl enough to make her hate him.
Uh, he was...
He was a bad, bad husband.
But he was a good father.
And then, we went and got mixed up in the wrong crowd.
And once you are in, there ain't no getting out.
So, to protect her, he vanished while she was still in high school.
And I went with him.
- But you got out.
- Yeah, I did.
But only 'cause he paid a little visit to some fellows who wanted to kill us when the job was done.
He went alone, you see. I would've gone, but I didn't know.
I would've gone.
That fire making you homesick?
Cold beer?
Fire isn't the worst part.
It's the video feed.
It's not about your suffering, your burning.
It's about the suffering of those you love because that's all you see in full detail.
And there's nothing you can do to shut it off.
My daughter was 16 when I got shot.
I watched her weep.
I watched her curse me.
I watched her join that cult.
I watched the murders.
My tree-hugging, sandal-wearing son-in-law first, and then...
And then my daughter.
Burning is nothing compared to watching your child's head being torn off.
Thank you, Webster. I don't believe
I'll be having that beer just now.
Not unless I'm drinking it from Jonah King's skull.
John, I can't fix that car.
But I can get you where you need to be.
Milton, if memory serves, you were always partial to the Chevelle, yes?
- Yeah.
- FEMALE OPERATOR: 9- 1-1.
- Hi.
- What's your emergency?
- About that fella who killed all them people at the Bull By The Balls last night.
Sir?
I know where you can find him.
Stillwater Marsh Penitentiary shut down ages ago.
You wanna guess what Deacon's Tree was?
- Hanging tree.
- Yeah.
Last hanging was in '38.
They left the tree to taunt the inmates.
Google Maps says it's an eight-hour drive.
- We should be...
- Webster,
- I need you to stay here.
- What?
No. You went alone last time.
I'm not going alone.
Are you gonna take that little girl over me?
Give me the shells.
You're a goddamned walking contradiction, you know that?
How many times you walk towards the straight and narrow only to get covered up in someone else's blood?
Whose blood are you gonna end up covered in this time?
- This time it's different.
- Is it?
He's not coming?
Piper,
I need you. But I won't lie to you.
This is going to be rough.
Are you sure about this?
My whole life has been nothing but waiting.
Waiting on tables, waiting on fools, waiting for it just to mean something.
And now, it means something.
I'm with you until the end.
What do we do?
Nothing yet.
Shit.
You just keep driving them to us.
We'll do the rest.
And make sure you peel off before the fireworks.
Troopers, fall in!
Gentlemen, these two have killed two of our own.
I know you want to make them pay.
Therefore, when I tell you to aim for their tires, what I mean is aim for their heads. Are we clear?
ALL: Yes, sir!
Very well then.
Please, aim for their tires.
There'll be even more ahead.
Just keep driving.
I'm sorry.
Here we go.
End of the line, folks.
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands raised.
May as well give the boys a clear shot at their tires.
(THAT'S THE WAYI LIKE IT
PLAYING ON RADIO)
What the hell is that?
Well, this is unexpected.
Everybody, clear the road!
Get out of here!
Get down.
Give me that thing!
You want us to shoot out his tires, Captain?
No goddamn way.
No ever loving way in God's good heaven are you an FBI agent.
I need you boys to stand down.
Captain, you know what this badge means, right?
Federal Bureau of get-the-fuck-out-of-my-way.
You boys have blundered into an ongoing Federal case.
Now, lower your weapon.
- You.
- Hey, hey, hey! Captain!
It seems you're serving two masters.
Take out your phone and call him.
Call Jonah King.
Tell him Milton is dead.
Do as he says, Trooper.
You heard the agent.
The rest of you, stand down.
Everybody, stand down right now,
God damn it!
Why aren't they following us?
Because you're a straight up, certifiable, cop-killing murderer, and they're scared of you.
So, what now?
Now we drive.
(SINGING) Ride with the devil
Hide with the lord
I got no pistol
Ain't got no sword
I got no army
Ain't got no land
Ain't got nothing
but the stone that's in my hand
Stone in my hand
Stone in my hand
All the love that's in my heart
And the stone that's in my hand
Wait for me here.
Piper?
Milton.
- Get away from her.
- I think not.
I shoot you with this, you know what it means.
No heaven, no hell.
You cease to exist.
Damn it, Milton, shoot him.
All the more reason to keep Ms. Piper in close proximity.
You are weary, Milton.
You might miss again.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Anubis?
You can't stop me.
Stop you? (SCOFFS)
Milton, you wouldn't be here without me, you ungrateful shit.
That little roadblock back there, that would have stopped you.
So, I want you to holster that iron God-killer, and say, "Thank you."
I said, holster and "thank you."
Don't hurt her.
Thank you.
Now, unbuckle the belt.
Right here, please.
Ah, that's better.
You're not the first to get out, and I doubt you'll be the last, but I have got to know, how did you get out with the God-killer?
I just walked in and took it.
Oh.
Wouldn't want to be you when he finds out.
What's he gonna do? Not let me back in?
- Why are you helping me?
- It's 'cause of those crazy fucks.
They figured out how to bring hell to earth!
Milton, it's real. Jonah's gonna do it.
- That's cute. You haven't told her?
- Told her what?
Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a little secret.
The Dark Lord, Satan, Beelzebub,
Lucifer, simply the warden of a very large prison.
Quiet man, actually.
Thoughtful and he's well-read.
I happen to know, the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly.
- Why are you really helping me?
- We all have a job to do.
Getting you here makes my job easier.
You get what you want,
- I get what I want.
- Then help me now.
- No.
- There are 40 of them down there,
- and you and I could...
- No.
You want to save her, Milton?
Then you go, and you do it.
If you win, I win.
If they take you down, I win.
And I hope you like butter on your popcorn.
It's sure to be a grand show.
You're still here? Milton, the clock's ticking.
Midnight approaches,
- and the moon is full.
- Give me the keys.
THE ACCOUNTANT: I'll be right here.
KING: My children, we have come so far to this place where the dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet.
From its death, we shall all be reborn.
ALL: Reborn!
We...
We have been cast out and hunted.
But no more!
No more.
With this sacrifice, we shall no longer be shunned.
They say the meek will inherit.
They lie! We are not meek! We are chosen!
And soon, the hounds of perdition will howl at our command!
For now, with a single thrust of this dagger, we shall all be set free!
MAN: What the fuck?
That's him!
Come on, let's get him!
Here, take it.
No matter what, that child dies tonight.
I tell you to, and you cut his throat.
MAN: That's him.
They're both with Milton.
Oh, yeah? You think you can stop all this?
- (BABY CRYING)
- (SHUSHING)
We're gonna kill your friend and the baby.
And we're gonna live forever.
Forever?
If forever to you is the next five seconds, then you would be right.
Well...
You be ready now.
If kill you, you can't take him.
Someone else will come.
Someone else always comes.
Piper, he didn't steal that to stop me.
He stole it to slow me down.
He's getting what he wanted.
Go to him.
Now, before it's too late.
Hold on tight. It has quite the kick.
Hey, dickless.
Well, this has all gone to shit.
Where are you going? Milton?
The victory is still mine, friend.
Bring that baby over here now.
I want him to witness this.
I said bring the fucking baby to me!
I'm gonna beat you to death with all that's left of your daughter.
A daughter who hated you.
The daughter who you let die!
All right, then.
I just want you to know that your daughter's death will pale to what is about to befall this child.
I'm going to kill you.
Ah, Milton, so many have tried.
But I am armored with a power that you will never know.
Nothing of this earth can kill me.
I'm not of this earth.
Milton.
Milton!
- No, Milton.
- Where is she?
I'm curious, would you have let him do it?
That's what I thought.
See you soon.
She's here.
I am finished now.
Keep her safe.
Anyone tries to hurt her, I'll kill them.
I know it.
That's why I chose you.
Webster will look out for you both, as long as he can.
(SOBBING) No, Milton.
Milton, please, don't go.
Love her for me, Piper.
Love her, and make her yours.
I know I don't have a right to ask for your promise.
I promise. Milton, I promise.
Thank you.
No.
Hey.
Come on.
Hi.
- How was that?
- I've seen better.
Guess she doesn't know you can beat him, slow him, shoot him, even stop him.
But you can't kill a dead man.
Shall we?
Even in hell there is compassion.
Just so you know, I don't plan on staying.
Milton, you got what you wanted.
I did, but if he puts me back in that hole,
I'll still get out.
Remarkable.
I actually look forward to that.
You think you're Wotan?
Give me the keys.
(SINGING) I'm still alive
Must have been a miracle
It's been a hell of ride
Destination still unknown
It's a fact of life
If you make one wrong move
with the gun to your head
You better walk the line
or you'll be left for dead
I'm a runaway train on broken track
I'm a ticker on a bomb
that you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins
I'm still alive

Benedict.
Is this true?
You have found the boy?
Yes.
He's not safe here.
Nonsense, this is a fortress.
The full resources of the Order are at our disposal.
Respectfully,
Benedict, the devil himself wants this child.
Only one place is safe.
That is the Sanctuary.
The Rider must take him.
You do enjoy your wine, Moreau.
In a few days, the winter solstice will be past and with it the hour of the prophecy.
Then the boy will be of no use to anyone.
By that time.
Brother, you will all be dead.

JOHNNY:
It doesn't matter how far you run.
There are some demons you just can't escape.
My name is Johnny Blaze.
I rode a motorcycle for a living.
I did a bare-ass, 360,
triple backﬂip in front of 22,000 people.
It's kind of funny.
It's on YouTube. Check it out.
But when my dad got sick,
I did something way crazier than that.
ROARKE: You look like you could use a little help.
Are you willing to make a deal,
John?
Attaboy.
JOHNNY:
Do it.
Save his life.
Do it!
Yeah, that is right. I'm the guy who made the deal with the devil.
I know what you're thinking.
Doesn't this kid watch movies?
Does this ever work out fine?
Let's just say good judgment was not exactly my forte.
I was possessed by an ancient demon.
In the presence of evil,
I change into a monster,
and I pray
on the wicked,
and I suck out their souls.
And you don't wanna be around when that happens.
See, there's good and bad in all of us.
And maybe you're not a murderer,
but you did something you wouldn't want the Rider to see.
A white lie, an illegal download.
What about you? And you?
I've tried to fight it, to hold it back,
but the darkness inside me only gets stronger.
That's why I had to run
halfway across the world.
And I'm still running.
Who are you?
My name is Moreau.
My brothers are dead, as should I be, if not for the intervention of God.
(CLAUDE-JOSEPH ROUGET DE LISLE'S
"LA MARSEILLAISE" PLAYING)
And you are John Blaze.
Go away.
MOREAU:
I can't do that.
Ah.
It likes the dark places.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Rider.
You thought that you could control it.
Make it work for you, huh?
That you were stronger than this deep, hungry thing?
This sickness.
Why are you here?
Aah!
What do you want from me?
I need your help and you need your soul.
So we make a deal.
You know about making deals, don't you, Johnny? Huh?
Nice bike.
This child.
He is in danger and for more than his life.
You will save him.
I don't save people.
MOREAU: What brought you out here, Johnny Blaze?
Thousands of miles from your place of birth and your dark rebirth.
You were brought here for this.
This little kid, what makes you think I can find him?
This man that you met years ago that put the curse
On you?
Roarke.
The devil has many names.
He is the link that connects you to this child.
Let the Rider follow his stench.
It will lead you to the boy.
You said something about a deal.
The church of my masters is an ancient one.
We are prepared to give to you the one thing you want the most of this world.
Bring us the boy, and we will lift your curse.

No, no, he's not dead, he's just blocked.
But you know something.
Let's go.
JOHNNY: Yeah, okay, well, let me just get something straight.
The guy who kidnapped Danny and tried to kill you and blew me up with grenades, you two were like boyfriend, girlfriend?
Carrigan was a gunrunner, a drug dealer, a mercenary.
I didn't care about that.
I just saw a ticket out.
Right, okay, and so Danny is...?
Danny, what, is Carrigan's son?
No.
Um...
When you met the seducer, he offered you something.
Yeah. My father's life.
Shocker, he lied.
For me, it was only myself.
It was supposed to be big for Carrigan, but it went bad.
I made it out a third-floor window.
I was choking on my own blood.
I knew I was gonna die.
I could feel it.
And that's when he found me.
ROARKE: You look like you could use a little help.
Roarke.
He promised to take the pain away, to save my life.
But he asked for something in return.
A son?
Maybe you can never understand.
No, I get it.
You're the devil's baby mama.
I guess that explains why Moreau wants
Danny so bad.
Moreau?
Yeah.
Black, French, alcoholic priest, a dick. Know him?
He tried to help us.
I didn't let him.
Well, we're both gonna work on our decision-making.
Where you headed?
Someone I know.
He does Carrigan's dirty work.
He'll know where to find him.
JOHNNY: Why does the devil walk on earth in human form anyway?
I have no idea.
Maybe he doesn't know either.
Maybe he just
passes on from body to body,
through history, waiting for the perfect fit
But I know one thing:
On Earth, he's weak.
His powers are limited.
He needs emissaries
to do his dirty work,
so he finds them or makes them using his greatest power:
The power of
the deal.

John?
You talked to Carrigan?
I talk to a lot of people. I got what you need for the shakes, my friend.
Carrigan must've told you about that thing that killed his men last night. Huh? Yeah?
That thing is inside of me. See, you're a bad man and this thing, the Rider, he feeds on bad men.
And he's hungry. He's hungrier than he's been in years.
That's why I'm shaking!
Because right now, the only thing standing between you and the Rider is me.
And he's just... He's...
He's scraping at the door.

I'm gonna let him out.

It looked like it did.
NADYA:
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry!
Sorry. Does it hurt?
It looks like it does.
What are you waiting for?
Do it! Do it!
He's coming.
NADYA:
Unh! Let me go.
DANNY:
Enough.
Let her go.
So that happened.
(LA MINOR'S "TIHIY VECHER"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
There you go.
It was a bee. I thought it was gonna sting your face.
Well, are you feeling better?
Your leg's all healed, huh?
Like all by itself.
That's weird.
Where's my mom?
She's gassing up the truck.
Ahem. I know that it's a little awkward.
Me rolling with you guys.
I mean, after everything that you've been through.
Dude.
You're cooler than the guys she usually hangs outwith.
Huh.
Hey.
So, what's next?
Moreau thinks that the danger will pass in a few days.
If we just get Danny someplace safe, a holy place, where his people can protect us, then we can ride it out.
Okay.
I've already contacted Moreau. He's gonna catch up with us on the road.
We gotta move fast because the ones who are hunting us, they're not done.
Plus, I have some personal issues
I'd kind of like to get fixed.
ROARKE:
You're not done, Carrigan.
You were to bring me
Nadya's son.
I do expect you to fulfill your obligation.
S... S... S... Sorry, jackass, but I'm dead.
Inconvenient.
What'd you do to me?
Gave you a second chance.
You're a little less than alive now.
But also more.
You see, I've given you power.
The power of decay.
Of darkness.
Whoa.
I want that boy, Carrigan.
Now you've got no excuses.
DANNY:
The machine last night?
Yeah?
You made it change.
That's how it works.
Whatever he rides changes with him.
And what if he took a taxi?
Uh...
I don't know.
I don't know. Why?
Or a roller coaster or a ski lift or a camel or a...
Dude.
What if you have to pee while you're on fire?
Oh, it's awesome. It's like a flamethrower, you know? It's like:
When you change, when you're him, does it feel good?
Sometimes.
What does it mean?
Are we just bad?
No.
This power that we have comes from a dark place, but it's not who we are.
It never will be.
And we can use it to do good, to help people. Ahem.
Like I'm helping you and your mom.
I know why you're helping.
She says you wanna get rid of it.
I can't ever do that.
Hey, Nadya. I hope you have finished shooting at me!
JOHNNY:
Hey.
You wanna have some fun?

JOHNNY:
So this is it, Moreau's happy place.
These guys will lift my curse?
They don't even have shoes.
Amen.
MOREAU:
Amen.
METHODIUS:
You mustn't be afraid.
It was God that led you here.
What's up?
MOREAU:
I know. A little uptight. Not so bad once you get to know them.
Now go on.
They will take good care of you.
What about you two?
We will join you later. We have some business to complete between us.
I made a promise to you, John.
Why can't he come with us?
No!
JOHNNY: Danny.
Danny, you're safe here.
We made it.
The only thing that can hurt you and your mom now is me.
I need to make sure that will never happen.
It'll be all right.
I promise.
Whatever.
NADYA:
Come on.
Are you sure about this?
Come on.
JOHNNY: Where are we going?
MOREAU: To my favorite room.
If there is one thing these sons of bitches know, eh, it's wine.
This bottle would fetch
50,000 euros at an auction.
Moreau.
Oh, yeah.
What is it?
It's...
This thing inside of me.
I'd like to know before we, uh, commence.
Zarathos was an angel, a Spirit of Justice.
Sent to protect the world of men.
But he was tricked, captured,
brought down to hell,
corrupted.
Driven insane.
Heh.
His mission to protect the innocent was perverted into a lust to punish the guilty.
He became
the Spirit of Vengeance.
Yeah, but the angel, the Spirit of Justice, he's alive in there?
Somewhere?
He could be.
Do you feel him?
No.
Cheer up, my man.
Soon you will be free.
This bottle...
Ah.
This one is over 2000 years old.
I've had my eye on it for a while.
When this is over, we will share it, huh?
There's something else.
This thing that Roarke has done to you is not easily undone.
You risk death.
Worse than death.
You must confess the one thing that is most difficult for you to talk about.
Um...
My dad.
I didn't do it for him.
I made the deal for me.
I couldn't let him go.
It was selfish.
He was ready to die.
He knew it was his time.
And I thought I could change that.
I'm sorry.
This is the lamb of God that takes away all the sin from the world.
Happy are those that are called to receive him.
You say that you're not worthy to receive him.
I'm not.
Okay, that's good enough.
The body of Christ.
Ahem. Uh, amen.
You've been carrying this bread around for a while.
May God lead you into the eternal life.
That is, John, if today is, in fact, your last.
MOREAU:
Where you go now, I cannot follow.
Are you ready?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey.
Merry Christmas, you assholes!
Make the deal.
Moreau!
Moreau!
Moreau!
Moreau!
You did it!
Moreau!
Moreau!
It worked.
NADYA:
No! Let me go!
Help me!
Hey! What are you doing?
NADYA: Get off me!
Let me go!
What are you doing?
What will be done.
MOREAU:
The day of prophecy is tomorrow.
We were to hold the boy until the danger passes.
The danger will not pass,
Moreau.
As long as the boy exists, the power will always be inside him.
You lied to me.
You lied to me!
This child must be destroyed.
No!
No!
You might have protested while the child was being conceived.
Now it is too late.
(IN LATIN) Take them away until the thing is done!
(IN ENGLISH) Go!
MOREAU:
Danny's soul can still be saved!
That boy is one of God's children!
No!
He is not.
Pretty neat, huh?
Mm.
Peace, brother.
(CARRIGAN GRUNTING
AND PANTING)
Damn.
Bet you're happy to see me.
Did Danny do this?
No. Somebody got here before they could...
Before they could kill him.
JOHNNY:
There's no sign of him.
Whoever did this wanted him alive.
I think we all have a pretty good idea who that would be, Moreau.
NADYA:
Yeah. So now he's with Roarke. Some protectors you turned out to be.
What exactly does Roarke have in mind for Danny?
What are his plans for his son? Is he putting money away for college? What?
MOREAU:
It is the day of prophecy
As was the day Danny was conceived.
The child must be in his 13th year before the rite can be performed on the dawn of winter.
The rite.
Roarke fathered the boy as a vessel, as a container for his power.
The ritual will transform his essence, his soul into the boy.
There will be no more Danny.
Only Roarke.
No!
Why the hell didn't you tell us this?
Hey.
You made a deal with Roarke!
Both of you!
Something I would never do.
The prophecy had to happen at the dawn of a new day.
Maybe there's still time.
Do you know where Roarke has him?
I think so.
What, so now you want to play hero?
You got what you wanted.
Yes, I did.
Thank you for holding up your end of the bargain.
You're welcome.
JOHNNY:
If I can spend my last day as a free man without a curse over my head, I'll take it.
But I promised Danny he'd be safe.
And if I walk away now,
I'm just trading one demon for another.
So let's go.
Was there ever any doubt?
Don't touch me.
Cutting it a bit close, aren't we?
CARRIGAN:
You have any idea what I had to go through to get this little turd?
Look, the planets don't align for your pagan party until daybreak tomorrow.
So get off my ass because
I'd say I'm ahead of schedule.
Danny.
Do you know who I am?
Well, I'm sure your mother told you a lot of things about me.
What's the matter with your face?
MOREAU: Uzak Gökten.
The farthest point from heaven.
That is where the ritual is to take place, according to the prophecy, of course.
Of course.
Without the Rider, we stand very little chance against Roarke.
You were supposed to have faith.
I do.
But also, I think we should have weapons.
JOHNNY:
Guns and wine.
Naughty priests.
I'm starting to like you again,
Moreau.
You wanted to know why I look this way.
Think of a flamethrower.
Is that funny?
Okay.
A flamethrower made out of papier-mâché.
All that power.
But try to use it, you burn up.
This body I'm living in, it's weak, human.
It's dying.
It was never made to do the things that I can do.
But you, you're only part human.
You have all the power that I have inside of you.
Like father, like son.
But this corporeal form can wield the power without burning itself up.
To help you relax.
That will keep him sedated until the ceremony.
Who are they?
MOREAU: Politicians, murderers, people of influence.
The devil's soldiers.
They've traveled from all over the world to witness the anointing of the new king.
JOHNNY:
Oh. The new king.
Please.
MOREAU:
If Roarke succeeds, he'll have a new form, one more powerful than he's ever known.
And a shadow will fall upon the earth.
(ALL CHANTING
IN DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
NADYA:
Twenty-five,
30 men. More inside.
The ritual has already begun.
Danny's soul will be lost forever at the break of dawn. This is when Roarke is at his weakest.
Nadya?
You all right?
I've made a lot of mistakes, Blaze.
But Danny...
Danny's the one...
The one good thing
I ever did.
Well, ahem, that being the case, we had better make sure he doesn't turn out to be the Antichrist.
(ALL CHANTING
IN DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
Okay. Not much time.
What's the plan?
Plan is you go, you grab the boy, you run and you don't stop.
What about you?
Me? I'm going through the front.
Okay. Ha, ha.
Not bad.
This might be good on a salad.
Johnny Blaze!
Go.
Ahh.
Catch this one, huh?
What a waste of good wine!
(GROUP CHANTING IN
DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING IN
DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING IN
DEMONIC LANGUAGE)
That felt good.
Come on.
Danny, listen to me.
I shouldn't have gotten rid of the power.
I know that now.
He's gonna erase you, Danny.
Moreau.
I can still see the light!
Oh.
Ugh. That's gross.
ROARKE:
You have no power, Blaze.
You're nothing but an insect like the rest.
Food for the mills
Of hell.
No.
Not yet.
Oh, you wanna watch?
The apple doesn't rot far from the tree! Heh, heh.
Danny.
This is not who you are.
It never will be.
My powers and yours are the same.
That's what you said.
Right?
Dad?
Like father, like son.
Do it.
No!
Whoa.
MAN:
Whoa!
(SHOUTING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKS IN

CARRIGAN:
Come here.
CARRIGAN:
Enough!
I was never afraid of you.
Roadkill.
You!
Worst fucking deal I ever made.
GHOST RIDER:
Go home.
NADYA:
Danny!
The angel.
Moreau said that the Rider was an angel that went crazy.
I can feel him, the angel.
I can feel him.
Danny?
Danny?
Did we win?
I'm gonna say yes.
Hell, yes.
JOHNNY:
My name is Johnny Blaze.
I'm the Ghost Rider.

(man) O 'Rourke, Dylan. Age, 28.
Cause of death?
High speed car crash.
Very romantic, very sensational.
Very James Dean.
[crash]
[thundering]
[footsteps]
Here how I keep track of time, Dylan.
Every October
16th, I find you here.
Ten years of clockwork.
[clap of thunder]
What do you want with me, detective?
I'm just looking out for you.
It still doesn't make sense.
Her ring was missing.
She never took that ring off.
The-the cabby--
There's a lot of illegal cabs out there, Dylan.
We've gone over all this.
It was an accident.
It was no accident.
I need to find out what really happened.
Go home.
[bell tolling]
Denial's the first stage.
Elvis. Take that guy.
Some people actually believe he still exists.
Yeah, denial.
Christ, I can't believe Elvis is dead.
Then depression.
Shit, Elvis is dead.
What am I gonna do?
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
And then anger.
Why?
Why did he have to die?
And finally, acceptance.
All right. It makes sense.
It's all God's will.
The king is dead.
Rest his soul.
Do you know what
I'm saying, Mr. Stark?
You know, your family and friends probably just can't accept the fact that you're dead.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Frank Sinatra was a no show at Dean Martin's funeral.
Can't get much closer than the Rat Pack.
I think it's time to call it, lad.
Just five more minutes.
For Jesus sake, Dylan, no visitors are comin'.
Bastards are probably already out spending his money.
Tomorrow'll be a big turnout though.
Young kid's about your age.
Actually, he's a year younger.
You knew him?
He was the quarterback on my high school football team.
We hooked up for 27 touchdowns one senior year.
So you'll see all your old friends tomorrow.
I-I haven't seen any of them in a long time.
All the more reason to catch up.
You ever fantasize about, you know, watching your own funeral?
Of course.
Doesn't everybody?
My father always said you can only really tell a man's character by who shows up at his funeral.
That's a little late by that point.
One of life's great fucking ironies.
But Dylan, if you've got to wait 'til your funeral to find out what makes you tick, my heart aches for you.
Rest in peace.
Would you like some tea, Dylan?
Tea? For Jesus, Liz!
He'll have a shot of whiskey.
No. I-I don't drink.
Better you than me.
Liz, I'm going to decorate the inside of me glass.
You give the fucking insomniac a tall tumbler of warm milk.
Is your family in the city?
I don't talk to them anymore.
Uh. Liz, he never puts that bloody thing down.
It's a sentimental thing.
The yo-yo almost always comes back to you.
Reminds me of the mistakes I've made.
Mistakes. We all make mistakes.
There's a difference in mistakes and regrets.
Oh.
Decko gave me that.
The hands are for friendship, the heart is for love, and the crown is for loyalty.
Someone close to me had the same ring.
And if the heart is pointed inward, it means your heart is taken.
Shite. They'd better go get me Viagra.
[laughs]
[panting]
I like him. Don't get me wrong. It's just that--
This genetic Viagra is full of shite.
I can't quite figure him out.
Oh, Liz. He's just a lad, that's all, who needs some guidance.
Don't feel sorry for him-
There are people who float through life wantin' to be alone.
It doesn't bother them that they don't affect anything or anyone.
Dylan probably feels sorry for us.
He doesn't have to be like others.
[guy on video] And, uh, so you guys've been together for a while, but you guys didn't really like each other when you first met.
That's true. Yeah.
Freshman year, we met.
It kinda, we didn't hang out as much, and, you know, that kinda changed probably--
Different friends and then--
And then we--remember that party we went to?
Yeah. That's when we probably started hanging out there.
Yeah, and then we made out that night.
[laughs]
So, what do you guys have planned after graduation?
We're going to college together.
Uh, so, keeping it alive, huh?
Yeah, forever.
Forever.
Shit!
Forever.
Someone close to me had the same ring.
Dylan.
[knocking on door]
Dylan-
[knocking]
Please, open up.
I know you're in there.
Dylan, open the door.
Lei' me in.
I wanna help you through this.
I'm missing you-
Dylan! Dylan, open please.
Please.
[crying]
What, are you nervous?
We'll take care of him.
Go on. It's all right.
Ew. Does he work here?
I thought he'd be a big shot lawyer or something by now. How pathetic.
Is that who I think he is?
You gotta be kidding me.
I haven't seen him in years, man.
I thought he was dead.
Didn't he use to date Natalie Penner?
Natalie Penner. That's what fucked him up.
Fucking chick, man.
His best friend, Steve.
Yeah. Don't you remember?
Dylan and Natalie were together and then Steve, than fucking rat snake.
Yeah, he just sharked her.
[no audio]
[cell phone ringing]
And the yo-yo returns.
So, did you see some of your old pals?
Some of them.
Did you talk to any of them?
No.
Listen to me, son.
Here's your opportunity to rebuild some relationships.
Some of those relationships
I'd just rather bury.
Hi!
Hi.
Are you two married?
No. Not yet.
So, when are you getting married?
In May.
Congrats. May what?
May, the day never come.
I'm just trying to get my career going.
I just don't really have much time for all that wedding type shit.
Now, don't get me wrong. She's a great girl.
They just think what I'm thinking.
So, where are you working?
Wright and Price law firm. Trying to get partnership.
There's some thick coin.
I, uh, couldn't believe when I heard about Shawn. It was just--
I don't know. It feels like yesterday he was--
When he was throwing touchdowns to Dylan?
Speaking of Dylan, does anyone know what he's been up to lately?
Dylan!
Steve. How are you?
Real good, man.
Christ, it's, uh, been a long time.
Shit!
Oh.
Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to have an extra one, would you?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Have two.
Thank you.
You--y-you work here?
Yeah, I do. And you?
I've made partner at Axler, Wright and Price law firm. Thick coin.
So, who's the ghost?
Old boyfriend.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
How long has it been since you've seen that poltergeist?
Ten years ago.
You make that sound like eternity.
Yeah, a lot's happened since then.
A lot of waiting?
A lot of waiting.
He's special.
He was special.
So, uh, this--
This, uh, you know, job get you laid?
What's that?
Excuse me. Dylan, there's a flower delivery out back.
I could use your help.
See you, Steve.
Catch you later,
Dylan.
Natalie.
Hi.
When did you start smoking?
Oh, ten years ago, but it seems like--
Like yesterday.
Yeah.
[laughs]
You know this is the seventh death from our class?
You'd think we'd run into these people at weddings, but instead you get, "You're cordially invited to a funeral."
Are you still in med school?
Did you finish?
No, I didn't start.
I'm a nurse.
Nurse?
You've probably seen some of my patients.
I'm really not that good yet.
You remember the finger I sprained during the Carson Heights game and you, um, taped the wrong one?
I can't lift anything with this now.
I'm so sorry.
No. I'm-I'm kidding.
[laughs]
Oh!
I should go back inside, you know.
Steve can't stand smokers.
Natalie.
Ten years have, uh, really done you justice.
Thanks.
Done you justice?
I'll always be grateful if you got a lot to clean up after the party.
Good indication you've got friends.
No wonder my place is so clean all the time.
I bet if it was you in that box today, you'd have the same turnout.
You have to be somebody.
I've been gone too long, and people forget.
You'd be surprised what death brings out in people.
No, it'd be another Mr. Stark.
No, bollocks. It'd be bigger than Jack Kennedy's funeral.
Let's have my funeral then.
All the Guinness you can drink says nobody shows up at my wake.
You serious?
Yeah. We'll-we'll put my name in the obituaries. Easy as that.
[chuckles]
It reminds me of the good old days.
You, you faked a funeral?
April Fool's day, 1975.
Me and me Da got my brother to believe I was run over by a tractor.
He comes into the church.
I popped out of the coffin.
Scared the living shite out of him.
[laughs]
What did he do?
He beat the shite out of me.
[chuckles] Didn't talk to me for six years.
Whatever happened at throwing eggs at houses and burning bags and dog crap?
The Irish don't mess around when it comes to pranks.
(Decko) O'Rourke, Dylan Age 28
He was a graduate of Pennington High School and member of the City
Championship football team.
Cause of death?
High speed car crash.
Very romantic.
Very sensational.
Very James Dean.
Undoubtedly the ugliest corpse I've ever seen.
You probably would look better six feet under.
What about the high speed car crash?
I'm supposed to be a m-mangled wreck. Right?
Mm. Internal injuries.
Happens all the time.
Okay. If someone wants to touch my hands, they'll be warm.
For fuck's sake, Dylan, it isn't a petting zoo.
All right.
Nobody will touch you-
Just don't yawn or you'll give some poor bastard a heart attack.
You sure your parents don't read the obituaries?
No, they don't.
Even if they did, they wouldn't be here.
Show time, Dracula.
[train whistling]
Where's the money, Charlie?
Answer me, you junkie bitch!
Ah. For God's sake, Dylan, it's getting late.
That was a stupid idea.
You win the bet.
All the apple juice you can drink on me.
Dylan.
Sleep tight.
[door hinges squeaking]
Decko.
Dylan O'Rourke.
What the fuck did you do?
Where the fuck are you going? Huh?
You're watching me, huh?
I bet you're watching me right now.
You're probably wondering who the fuck I am, right?
Hey, you know what?
You know what the two shortest verses in the Bible are?
It's only two-two words. Just two words.
Isn't that amazing?
It's only got two words.
Were you friends with him?
No.
So, how'd you know him?
I read the obituaries.
How'd he die anyway?
Car crash.
Yeah, they say better to be late, you know, in this life than early in the next.
Do you make a habit out of going to memorial services?
Well, you know, I'll be honest to you.
I try to go as many as possible.
You know, during the week 'cause it's kinda great therapy, right?
I mean, you should really try it.
You should. If you're ever feeling depressed, just go to a funeral.
And no matter how sad or how low or had bad things are, it's never as final as this, right?
You wanna die?
I wanna go without a clear conscience, you know.
I wouldn't-wouldn't wanna go without that.
Not 'til I'm ready.
I don't wanna-don't wanna go without making amends.
Red roses, well.
[sighs]
Dylan, I guess you were special.
I'll leave you two alone.

She shows up, she starts talking about, uh, the shortest verse in the Bible.
That's the best mass to attend.
In and out, short and sweet.
And suddenly
I-I hear this voice.
The weird girl's voice?
No. Natalie's voice.
Natalie?
The old flame?
Natalie's there alone and she leans over the coffin.
I can't be sure, but I think she said ”I love you.”
[whispers]
I miss you.
She did?
Well, I--she whispered it, you know.
But it was "I-I something you."
So, you didn't hear the "love" part.
Not really.
So, she could've said "I hate you."
Possibly, but why would she drive all the way down to a funeral home to say "I hate you"?
Did she bring flowers?
Dozen red roses.
Not yellow or pink. Red.

Your old flame came to your wake, Dylan.
She brought roses!
That says a lot about your character.
Yeah, maybe.
Right, I show up at her door?

I need to know where I'm going.
I think you're a little confused.
I'm not confused.
I know what you are.
I know what you are.
Fuck!
Where's the money, Charlie?
[shouts]
Where's the fucking money?
Who the fuck are you? Huh?
Who the fuck is this, Charlie? Huh?
Answer me, you fucking junkie bitch!
What? He's just a friend of yours?
He's not my friend.
He's my guardian angel.
Guardian fucking angel, huh?
Well, we got a little problem here.
I'm an atheist.
I don't believe in little faggoty angels.
Go ahead, shoot him.
He's already dead.
Shoot him.
Just shoot him!
[gunshot]
[gunshot]
[panting]
What the fuck?
Idiot.
I told you you were dead.
Who was that guy at your place?
Terrence?
He works for some guy
I owe 20 grand to.
L-I-I- should be,
I should be dead.
Should be?
You are dead.
So us poor trapped souls.
I've always kinda been obsessed with dying, and it's my death.
I'm not ready to go, yet.
Why aren't you ready?
Family?
No, no family left.
Friends or something?
No, never even been in a carpool lane.
I got nothing.
As soon as I'm clean, I'm gonna go with you. I promise.
I'm not actually dead.
You are dead.
You just don't know it.
Excuse me.
Can you see me?
Yeah.
Okay. You satisfied?
Wait, wait, wait.
Could you, could you touch me?
Excuse me?
Just-just touch my face.
Case. I mean, does that, does that prove to you that I'm not dead?
You're in denial.
I mean, she-she saw me, she touched me.
How could she do that if I was dead?
How could I interact with people?
Because you believe it so intensely that you've become real to yourself and to others.
Believing is seeing.
So, anybody could be dead.
Like-like-like this, that guy?
Could be.
Walking dead are all around us.
I feel bad for you.
You're just trapped in Purgatory.
Really could go either way for you.
So, how do I get out of Purgatory?
Well, first of all, you need to accept that you're dead.
Then I think you have one more chance to make things right.
[echoing laughter]
[loud thumping]
What's it like?
What's what like?
What made you die.
Are you crazy?
Don't call me that.
I am not crazy.
You just leave me the fuck alone until you're ready to deal with who the fuck you are, okay?
Then you can come find me.
(Charlie) You are dead.
You just don't know it.
[woman singing]
Hey, fuck Charlie.
Fuck us instead.
Oh. What's wrong, Dylan?
What'd you say?
How do you know my name?
I didn't say anything.
Come on, sweetie.
Let me call you whatever you want us to call you.
Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie, let me in.
Charlie? Open the door.
Oh! Fuck!
Oh, no.
Charlie. Hey.
Wake up.
Somebody help!
Come on.
Fuck, come on!
Charlie!
[monitor beeping]
What are you doing, Charlie?
And where are you right now?
You said you didn't wanna leave like this, right?
You're not dead, and
I'm not, either. Okay?
I'm gonna be around for a little while.
[heartbeats]
[nurse over PA.
] Visiting hours are now over.
Sir, visiting hours are over.
It's time to leave.
Dylan?
Natalie.
Oh, God.
I'm-I'm so sorry.
I can explain everything.
That funeral, we faked it.
I'm not dead.
I mean, obviously,
I'm not dead.
I'm really sorry.
I know. I know you faked your funeral.
And you're not dead.
Decko?
Did he invite you to the funeral?
He didn't want you to be alone.
How do you know Charlie?
Are you on her emergency contact list?
I'm kinda all she has right now.
[Natalie laughing]
Yeah, but after that,
Remember when we broke into the rec center and we went skinny dipping?
Yes.
That was fun. We were starving, and we went to that place.
Burger place with those huge burgers.
Yeah.
Bacon and fried egg and there was, like, ham on it.
[laughs] I don't like the special sauce.
Can you hear mine?
Yeah.
Can you hear it?
[laughs] Didn't we go?
Didn't we run out of gas?
Oh, yeah. It was that night.
We ran out of gas.
We called, we had to, we called--
AAA
[cell phone rings]
That was fun.
Oh, hold on.
Hi, honey.
Oh, no, no, I'm just busy at work.
I'll be home soon.
Okay. All right. Bye.
Dylan.
I would've gone to your funeral regardless.
[monitor beeping]
[monitor alarm sets 0177
[monitor beeping normally]
Are you okay?
[whispers]
I'm okay.
Hi. What are you doing here?
I knew I'd find you here.
It's where you always come when you wanna be alone.
Yeah. Mm-hm.
Oh, my God.
What do you say?
Yes.
I haven't been here since we graduated.
Do you blame me for that night?
Every time I saw you,
I thought of what happened.
I've missed you.
I missed you every day for ten years.
You're in love with someone else!
No. I love Steve.
But I'm in love with you.
Dylan?
I brought Dylan a couple of my famous roast beef sandwiches.
Can I leave them with you?
Sure.
Good. We can have a smoke then.
How long have you been married, Liz?
Um, almost 25 years.
He's a little much at times, but no matter how dirty his laundry, he's mine.
Oh. I do carry this little DUI photo to remind him what an asshole he can be when he's drunk.
[laughs]
I would've married
Decko since I met him, but he made me wait.
Why?
I was with the man I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with.
And I fell in love with his best friend.
Over time I questioned myself, and now and then I still wonder if I chose the right partner.
So, you went back to Decko?
No. I stayed with Decko.
He was the best friend.
Decko?
Mm-hm.
What happened to--
Patrick Keating?
Mm, oh.
My beautiful ghost.
I imagine he thinks of me, that there's a candle burning out there somewhere.
Do you love Decko?
Absolutely.
But I do believe it's possible to love two people.
When you're on your deathbed, don't look back on your life with regret.
It is a hard life to live.
Wondering.
Natalie.
Hey.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah.
Uh, listen.
God, I-I don't even know where to begin.
Really. Um, I just--
[monitor alarm sets 0177
That's Charlie.
What's wrong with her?
[coughing]
You're okay, Charlie.
Just relax.
Hey, you Te okay.
I'm sorry, sir, but you need to step out.
Dylan, I 'Il come and get you-
Has he made his peace with you, yet?
Who?
Dylan.
Never stops thinking about you.
What are you doing here?
I don't know what she has right now.
Where's the money, Charlie?
[clap of thunder]
[thundering]
I thought you were dead.
You shouldn't screw with people like that.
Prank?
It was more of a reality check.
Got that address you wanted.
Listen, you shouldn't go there.
Why?
It's not the guy who took a shot at you you have to be worried about. It's his boss.
Who's his boss?
Just tell me who she owes money to.
I'm sure I can make a deal.
These aren't the type of people you just make deals with.
[tires screeching]
Get some sleep.
Seeing shit that isn't there.
(Decko) How much money are we talking about?
Twenty grand.
You really care about this girl?
You know, I've been the only one to visit her.
Just like she was the only one to visit me.
That's a hell of a lot of money.
How are you gonna get that?
Don't worry about the money.
Look, I don't understand.
You hardly know this girl.
Think of yourself.
Go to college, start your life.
Be fucking selfish for once, can you?
Why--
Why are you doing this?
I have to save somebody.
I'm here to see
Mr. Brennan.
Tell him I'd like to make a deal for Charlie.
So, how do you know Charlie?
Is she a friend of yours?
You could say that.
Now, that's not what
Terrence told me.
He says you're her, uh, guardian angel.
Well, now, Terrence, atheist. Comes back here ranting and raving about some halo, wing-wearing wacko that he puts two slugs into.
I saw the holes in the wall.
He missed twice.
I told you Terrence was a useless piece of shit.
He can't even shoot straight.
So you, you wanna make a deal for Charlie, hm?
It's 20 for her debt.
Goddamn.
I feel like putting a bullet in my own gun just to see if you really are a fucking angel.
Charlie's debt's repaid.
You have my word.
And everybody knows what that means.
Where'd you get that one?
Hi. Have you done it?
Have you made your peace?
I really need you to hurry, okay?
'Cause I'm really ready to go.
I'm ready to go now.
Ready to leave this life. I'm clean.
I just have to ask you something.
This, this ring, it--
I-I found it in the pawn shop.
Brennan said that you pawned it.
Ten years ago.
Did you pawn this?
Answer me. Where did-- Where did you get this, Charlie?
Where did you get this?
There was an accident.
Charlie, the people who were killed were my parents!
This was my mother's.
Who was driving that taxi?
I needed money.
I stole the taxi.
And I picked up the fare.
I lost control.
It was an accident.
You what?
You stole this?
Dylan, I'm so sorry.
Don't you fucking touch me.
What do you need, kid?
I'm looking for
Detective Milano.
Milano? He's not here anymore.
Do you know when he'll be back?
He died five years ago.
I just saw him the other night.
Don't think so.
That--
That-that can't be.
Are you okay?
You seeing shit that isn't there.
Dylan.
Are you okay, lad?
What's the biggest funeral you ever have?
Hm. About ten years ago.
We had a standing mourning service.
Spilled out into the street.
I had to borrow chairs.
That was my parents' funeral.
I don't remember you there.
That's because
I wasn't there.
I couldn't be.
They were there because of me.
I mean, Christ, I haven't even visited their grave.
I was supposed to pick them up from the airport.
When I didn't show, eventually they took a cab.
That taxi crashed.
I was with Natalie when I found out.
[cell phone rings]
I blamed her.
I blame myself.
That's the night I left her.
You know, we made plans to go to college together, and we put it on hold.
My fucking life.
My whole--
That guilt has been eating you alive inside for too long.
You're gonna let it destroy you.
As it should.
No. Listen to me, son.
Don't call me "son".
You leave me the fuck alone.
Get that through your head. I don't want your help.
Leave me the fuck alone!
You listen to me, boy.
You have got to forgive yourself.
I can't!
You can!
Stop living in the fucking past!
Don't you understand?
The past is all I have.
I have nothing else.
You get that?
No! You have a life now!
You have me.
Now.
And Dylan, you have Natalie.
Oh, God.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Forget about the past.
She's come back to you.
Don't let her get away again.
That gin.
Every time I see that girl's face,
I think about that night.
I think about what I did and what I didn't do.
Forget about what you didn't do.
It's what you're going to do now that counts.
Hi.
Hey, babe. You, uh, got some mail.
Steve! Why did you wait so many years to ask me to marry you?
I-I woke up and
I realized what I had.
[sighs]
Was Charlie Scheel released?
No, but she just suddenly took off.
I'm ready to leave this life.
I'm clean.
[beep]
Hey, Natalie. This is Linda from Mercy.
I have a message from your patient, Charlie Scheel.
She said it's urgent.
What are you doing, Charlie?
Jesus wept.
That's the shortest verse in the Bible.
Charlie, come on.
You're making me nervous.
Jesus went to visit his sick friend Lazarus.
But he was too late, and
Lazarus was already dead.
But instead of just grieving for him, he resurrected him.
That's what you've done for me.
How did you do it? Did you make your peace, yet?
No.
I'm getting so bored of this, Dylan.
Waiting for you.
You know what, Charlie?
You Te gonna have to keep waiting.
You and I?
Have been walking dead for years now.
Me and you.
This could be our Resurrection Day.
Charlie!
Charlie, if you jump,
I am not coming with you.
I'm still in love with Natalie, and I'm gonna be with her.
You hear that, Natalie?
I'm sorry I haven't visited sooner.
But it's better to be late in this life than early in the next.
Rest in peace.
I've always loved the bastard.
He's got a lot of really good pubs.
He means colleges.
Now, make sure you keep focused, Dylan.
Fresh starts.
No regrets, love.
I know.
The French believe every time you say goodbye, you die a little.
But what do the fucking
French know?
You've been a really good friend.
Thank you.
Drive safely.
Thank you.
Take care. Take care.
We'll be back.
You ready?
Yeah.
So, if I turn the ring around and the heart points in, that means I'm taken.
Correct.
Okay.
That looks better.
Thank you.
What was it like?
What's what like?
What made you die.
Walking dead are all around us.
She saw me. She touched me.
How could she do that if I was dead?
How could I interact with people?
You believe it so intensely that you've become real to yourself and to others.
Believing is seeing.
You Te just trapped in Purgatory.
Really could go either way for you.
So, how do I get out of Purgatory?
First of all, you need to accept that you Te dead.
Then I think you have one more chance to make things right.
You wanna die?
I don't wanna-wanna go without making amends.
[Natalie laughing]
So, what do you guys have planned after graduation?
We're going to college together.
Oh, so, keeping it alive, huh?
Yeah. Forever. Forever.

With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
But not for me.
My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads, we're cavemen.
Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
Night after night, day after day.
Yep, home sweet home.
When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world.
And I struggled to survive my family.
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.
The Erfs, mosquito bite.
Throgs, common cold.
And the Croods, that's us.
The Croods made it, because of my dad.
He was strong, and he followed the rules.
The ones painted on the cave walls.
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.
Welcome to my world.
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
Because what we didn't know was that our world... was about to come to an end.
And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
You are supposed to wait for my signal. Eep?
Boo.
Ow! No!
We've been in that cave forever.
Three days is not forever.
It is with this family.
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.
No, Sandy, come back here.
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
No, I mean, you're already out now.
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.
But if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
The signal isn't so you know it's me.
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.
Mom, we're ready to leave.
Mom?
Still alive.
It's still early.
And you're still fat.
Breakfast formation!
I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast.
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.
And never not be afraid!
Yay, breakfast.
Who's up?
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.
Heads!
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.
Okay. Thunk...
Go.
Come on, Thunk.
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.
Release the baby!
Get them, Sandy! Go!
Get them, Mom!
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!
Thanks.
Eep!
Heads up!
Hey Dad, can we eat now?
Just wait till we get home.
Eep, put on the brakes.
Eep!
- Who is hungry?
- All right! Good one, Dad.
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.
That's all right. I ate last week.
Two knuckle warning!
Come on, Croods. Go, go.
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.
The moon is full. Bath night.
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.
I don't want to lose my protective layer.
Mom, you've got ants.
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
Is she still out there?
You know she hates the cave, Grug.
Please come back tomorrow.
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.
It is a little dark, Grug.
It's not that dark.
Eep!
Eep?
Come on, I have to close the cave.
Eep!
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Eep! Come down!
- That was too close.
- I was watching. I was fine.
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.
Why don't you know?
Stop looking for things.
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.
What is the point of all this?
What was that?
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?
No one said survival was fun.
Nothing is fun.
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.
- Eap.
- Grug.
- Yes.
- Off!
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...
- Off.
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge, that's all.
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things... and she needs her own space.
What things?
How long is this going to take?
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!
See? She's listening.
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
How about a story?
Eep loves those.
That's a good ide...
How about a story, huh?
Yeah, tell us a story.
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.
Eep, your old favorite.
I haven't played with that thing in years.
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.
She was alive because she listened to her father... and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror.
So she was happy.
But Krispy had one terrible problem.
She was filled with... curiosity.
- Grug.
- Yes. yes.
And one day, while she was in a tree... the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
And no sooner than she climbed to the top... she saw something new and died!
- Just like that?
- Yes!
Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
Same ending as every day.
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.
Good man, Thunk.
All right, everyone sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.
Air.
You talk.
I'm a person, like you.
Sort of like you.
Okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
Would you mind not...
That tickles.
Hey, hey, hey!
Quiet!
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Eep is gone.
What? Grug!
Stay in the cave.
Wow. You are really strong.
Hey! No! It's mine.
- Please! Wait.
- No!
- It's dying! I can fix it!
- No! I caught it!
Please! Please.
I hate the dark.
Come on, come on, come on.
It does what you tell it?
Yeah. Sort of.
The sun?
No, no, no. Fire.
Hi, fire.
It's not alive.
But you said it was dying.
Sorry.
It comes from where you come from?
No. No, I make it.
- Make some for me.
- Okay.
Make!
It doesn't come out of me.
Make! Make it!
You do this a lot.
Are you dead?
Can I have your fire if you're dead?
Clear!
Hey, those are cold!
You think? Listening shells, activate.
I concur.
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.
I don't even know you.
I'm Guy.
Guy?
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.
Also, keeps my pants up.
What are "pants up"?
Who are you?
Eep.
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.
What?
I'm calling it "The End."
How do you know?
I have seen it. It's coming this way.
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.
Fire. Lava.
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...
Believe me, everything we are standing on will be gone.
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.
It's our only chance.
Come with me.
I can't.
Okay.
Here.
If you survive, call me.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hey!
Dad!
Are you hurt? What took you?
Nothing. I left on my own.
You what?
Dad, let me explain.
You never let me talk.
You're grounded.
Hey!
Eep!
Mom.
Grug! What happened?
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.
Eep?
You will never believe it.
I found something new.
New!
New is a big problem!
Wait, wait!
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
- It wasn't bad.
-"New" is always bad.
No. He was nice.
What? Excuse me? He?
I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
Strange.
Usually it's the reverse.
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...
There was a boy.
Watch. I'm going to call him.
What is wrong with you?
It was dangerous.
It was beautiful!
You want to see dangerous? Here!
My sniffer!
Okay, that's it!
We're going back to the cave... and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
What!
You can't keep me inside forever!
He said this would happen.
Get to the cave!
Go!
Look out!
Stop!
Is everyone okay?
Yes.
Grug, the cave... it's gone.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there!
No. No one is going anywhere.
What else did that boy say?
Grug?
Just go! Just go!
Go!
One, two, three, four, five...
Six.
Where are we?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Down.
In a lower place.
But one thing is for sure, we can't go back the way we came.
Sandy? What is it?
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!
We can't be out in the open like this.
We need a cave.
Now, step where I step.
Okay. Stay quiet.
Hopefully, nothing big knows we're here yet.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait!
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Wait.
So, Dad... just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?
If it was me...
I'm just throwing this out there... if it was me choosing the cave...
I would go with a smaller cave.
Wait.
Dad?
I'll take care of this.
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!
Now you got them right...
Man, they're really...
I'm loving this.
Dad, I got it.
Just stop running into their fists.
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.
That's right. You can't get past this!
Climb! Climb! Climb!
Cave!
Go! Go!
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!
Okay.
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.
And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
It's scared of the dark.
Wait, we're scared of the dark.
Kill circle!
Eep!
Eep!
- Cavies!
-"Cavies"?
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.
The huge primitive teeth?
Yeah.
The excessive body hair.
That one has got a tail.
Yeah.
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.
No! It won't help.
They're my family.
What?
The sun is in his hands!
No, no. It's "fire."
Where did it come from?
He made it.
Make some for me!
It doesn't come out of him.
Make. Make it!
You're a lot like your daughter.
Great, now he's broken.
It's a baby sun.
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.
Now, we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave... and pretend today never happened.
Isn't this fun, Eep?
Eep, don't touch him.
Goodness knows where he's been.
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.
What a cute little guy.
Hey. Stay back.
No, no, no, wait!
It likes me.
Hey! It's biting me!
Thunk! Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.
They're biting me!
More fire babies.
Hi.
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.
Yeah. But I won't let him.
Hold on, son. Come back!
No, stop! Let me go!
Get out! Out! Out!
Eat up, babies!
No, stop touching me!
Die!
I win!
They're not so scary once you get to know them.
Who are you people?
I'm sorry.
We're the Croods!
And you are?
Guy.
Hi, Guy.
Wow!
It looks like magic.
And smells like food.
No, don't eat it, it's new.
Still alive!
Come on, keep eating.
Hey, where is Guy?
No!
Going somewhere?
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.
No. That was just the beginning of the end.
The end of the end is still coming.
Eep. Drop it.
We can't let him go!
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?
What if it takes a few days?
What if the birds come back?
We need his fire, dummy!
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!
Stay here if you want, but let me go.
I've got a dream... a mission, a reason to live!
Not anymore.
I've got an idea.
Let's go to that mountain.
It's too far.
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
There are caves on that mountain.
Have you been there?
It's a mountain.
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.
And water. And sticks.
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.
Crazy sticks. Let's go.
Quiet!
That thing is weird.
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.
That's just Belt.
I've made a decision.
We're going to that mountain.
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.
Just feels right.
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.
I don't think my feet can do that.
I'll never live long enough to get there.
Let's do it.
Come on, just think.
Our whole family packed together on a long, slow, trip across country?
Days and nights with just each other.
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.
We'll become closer as a family.
Get her off!
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye.
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail?
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!
Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?
Because I will turn this family around so fast!
Dad, I gotta go!
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.
- I'm touching...
- Gran.
Dad, I still gotta go!
Fine. Just go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
No.
- How about now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
Now?
I can do this all day long.
No, no, no and still no.
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
Grug, we're all pretty tired!
We'll eat when we get there.
It's taking too long!
I'm grabbing a snack.
Don't do that. He will cut you.
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.
What's a pet?
An animal you don't eat.
We call those "children."
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.
- It's food!
- No, please!
Not that. That!
Food fixes everything.
Show me your hunting face.
Not you. You're still grounded.
Come on, Thunk.
My feet hurt.
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.
I wasn't ready.
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!
Why are you doing this?
What are they doing?
Hunting.
Get it off! You stay away from me.
No, seriously, what are they doing?
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.
Now you're just rubbing it in.
There, who's hungry for scorpion?
What happened to the egg and the bird?
We lost him.
But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground... the scorpion grabbed a hold of me... and one thing led to another and here we are eating him.
So, win-win.
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.
I need more.
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?
You're too skinny.
If she was going to eat anyone it would be...
Mom!
She's locked her jaw!
Get a stick! Get a stick!
Stay away!
You sick old monster!
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!
Hold her still. Use a rock.
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?
Why are you rolling away?
I just want something to eat.
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
Please.
I'll let you help me hunt.
Really?
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.
Tell my story.
Okay.
What do you call this?
A trap.
What does it do?
Well...
How long have you been alone?
So, what do we do?
How's your acting?
You're good at this.
No. Sorry.
Okay.
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.
Your other hand...
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.
Going under.
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.
Yeah, I noticed!
Where's Eep?
She's awesome.
Eep!
Dad,no!
It's an avalanche of flavor.
Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.
What are "left overs"?
When you have so much food to eat, you have some left over.
We never have that much food.
Grug, how about a story?
That's a good idea. How about a story?
Yeah, tell us a story!
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger... who lived in a cave with her family.
There were a lot of rules... but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night.
And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
So easy to remember!
I know.
But, while everyone was asleep... she went out anyway.
- No!
- Yes!
And no sooner than she did, their cave was destroyed... and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk... with some weirdo they met... and die!
The end.
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.
My stories never end like that.
Yes! Two stories in one night!
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.
Her father and mother told her,
"You may go anywhere you want..."
"but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
And die. Good story.
But when no one was looking... she'd go near the cliff... for the closer she came to the edge... the more she could hear, the more she could see... the more she could feel.
Finally... she stood at the very edge.
She saw a light.
She leaned out to touch it... and she slipped.
And she fell.
And she flew.
Where did she fly?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
It would be so bright.
A place not like today, or yesterday.
A place where things are better.
Tomorrow isn't a place.
You can't see it!
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.
That's where I'm going.
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.
And when we wake up... we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
Tomorrow?
A cave.
That was too close. it almost caught us.
I was watching. We were fine.
We gotta move faster.
Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander"?
I'll take a shamble at this point.
Hey, do you have a minute?
How did the tiger fly?
I only share when I'm outside the log.
I'm funny that way.
Leave this to me.
Hey, Thunk... you have a spider on your face.
Oops.
He's loose!
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.
Do you mean these rocks?
Do not step on these rocks!
Step aside, girls.
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.
You cannot walk on those!
Get back here now!
There goes our chance for survival.
And our log!
Okay.
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly... but it doesn't get better.
How about...
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.
Come on.
I can help you... but we're going to have to make a few changes around here.
The log ride is over.
Drop the log.
Now, kick it away.
Farther.
Really?
Okay, smart "Guy"... now what?
Good fish, good fish.
Okay. Now you can look.
I love them!
Where are my feet?
They're still there!
Okay.
You're really heavy.
Really?
Thank you!
Hey. Wait!
Okay.
She's up. We're good. I'm good.
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?
I'm calling it a "brain."
I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
Dad, I don't have a brain.
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.
Now, let's get to that mountain!
Wow! I love those!
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
So, how did the tiger fly?
She jumped on the sun... and rode it to Tomorrow.
No,no,no.
Hi, Dad!
Bye. Dad!
You've seen rain before, right?
We don't get out much.
Eep, looks dangerous.
Dad, you say that about everything.
Careful.
Really? Okay.
No, no, no. Not cool!
So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been dumping my bones here since last week."
Last week!
That's a funny story!
It's not a story. It's a joke.
What's a "joke"?
Just making something up to make you laugh.
- One for you.
- Thanks.
One for you. And this one's for you.
Okay.
Okay! That's enough!
I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
Wait, you're saying we should split up?
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.
They can handle it.
We can do it, Dad.
No,no,no.
It's my job to keep you safe.
I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.
Except for you two.
And that's final.
Hello?
Is everyone all right?
We're okay, Grug.
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?
Stay where you are. I'll find you.
No. Too slow.
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
Dad?
Yeah.
Okay.
Remember, never not be afraid.
You can do this!
It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay.
I'm going to pass out.
Sandy. Sandy!
Give me another one.
You dropped these.
Come with me.
Here, boy! Catch!
Yoo-hoo!
Gran?
Mom?
Wow.
Grug?
I'll go get him.
Good boy! Who's a good boy?
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!
You need a name. You want a name?
I'm going to call you Douglas.
Can you do tricks? Roll over.
Come on, Douglas, roll over.
Good boy, Douglas!
I was in love once.
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.
It was quite a scandal.
We fed each other berries, we danced.
Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your grandfather.
Croods!
Get down here.
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.
Guy is with them. Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.
Okay. I'm going to go up... and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!
Sleep pile?
How about a story?
Anyone?
And then Torg said,
"Know it? I drew it."
That makes no sense.
I know it was hard for you to bring us along... but they had the best day of their lives.
Thank you for that.
I want to show you something.
More suns in the sky than you can count.
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.
Tomorrow.
That's where we'll be safe.
I'm going with Guy.
No. Not my little girl.
Come with us.
I can't go without Grug.
That makes one of us. Count me in.
Really, Mom? Now?
Grug has no idea how to protect us.
In fact, he has no ideas at all!
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...
Face it.
If he actually had an idea of his own...
I'd have a heart attack and die!
Grug?
- Dad!
- Dad!
He's a big guy. How could he just disappear like that?
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen Dad.
Haven't seen him.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
I was up all night, because all these ideas just kept coming to me.
Is that a snake?
Belt, new and improved.
It's even self-tightening!
What is that on your head?
It's called desperation.
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."
And this one, I call it a "ride."
Rhymes with "Grug."
That doesn't rhyme...
It's going to get us places faster than shoes.
Yeah! Try to keep up!
I wish I had a ride.
And painting is a thing of the past.
I call this a "snapshot."
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
I call them "shades."
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.
Where do you get these great ideas?
Since I don't have a brain... they're coming from my stomach, down deep below... and then up again into my mind.
Grug, we have to keep moving.
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."
Isn't that something?
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."
Mom?
I know. It's bad.
I almost feel sorry for him.
No, I don't.
What are you trying to do, Grug?
See, I thought if I could have ideas... like Guy... maybe Eep would listen to me.
And maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.
Grug.
Is that what this is all about?
And I also thought it would kill your mother.
So win-win.
We're here!
Wow.
Cave!
Everyone inside.
Hurry up. Let's go.
Let's go. Go!
No!
No more caves, Grug.
What?
We're going to jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!
Wait. So you're all going to do this?
Thunk?
Sorry, Dad.
You have to stop worrying for all of us.
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!
The rules don't work out here!
They kept us alive!
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.
There's a difference.
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
We would be dead if we listened to you!
We have to follow Guy now.
Guy.
Guy? Run.
This is pointless!
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.
You're being irrational and counterproductive!
Big words anger me!
Keep talking.
Countermeasures!
You remember how you were this morning? You changed.
Idea man. Modern man.
I am a caveman!
No, no, no, wait!
No!
What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
Tar.
No. I have to get back to them.
Stop struggling.
No!
Grug, stop!
No one gets out of this.
Believe me...
I know.
Your...
Family. Yeah.
Sorry.
I was little when it happened.
Last thing my parents told me was...
"Don't hide."
"Live."
"Follow the sun."
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."
You followed the light.
My daughter is a lot like you.
No.
She's like you.
She loves you, but always forgets to say it.
Just like you forget to tell her.
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.
It's okay. That's what dads do.
That's right.
But we can't do that from here.
We need one of your ideas.
Come on. You can do it.
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!
I've got it.
Wow.
Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has.
Let's go.
There he is.
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.
Move me.
Okay, he sees us.
That's our cue. Now, work it!
He's not coming over.
I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.
Scared? I'll show you scared.
Hand me those acting sticks!
Hold on!
Yes! You did it.
- Grug!
- Dad!
Hey! We're okay!
Yeah.
We're okay.
Grug, your call.
Take us to Tomorrow.
Hurry!
Come on! We're going to make it!
You were right.
There it is! The sun!
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!
Run!
I don't understand.
The sun was right here.
It was right here.
We have to go back to the cave.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.
Everybody, hold my hand.
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.
Grug. What's wrong with you?
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!
Grug, listen to me.
We've got to get back to that cave.
No more dark.
No more hiding.
No more caves.
What's the point of all this?
To follow the light.
I can't change.
I don't have ideas.
But I have my strength.
And right now... that's all you need.
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!
It's too risky!
It's a chance.
I'll take that chance.
I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
That's a joke, right?
What's a "joke"?
He made it!
He made it.
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
You're not coming, are you?
When you make it, so will I.
No!
You did good.
Dadda!
Gran...
No mush. Just throw me.
Wait.
You surprised me today... lunkhead.
Still alive!
Time to go.
No.
I have too much to say to you.
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.
I can fix it.
This works good.
What do you call it?
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."
Because it rhymes with "Grug."
But you can change it if you want.
No. I like "hug."
I love you.
I...
Dad...
I'm scared.
Never be afraid.
There!
I see him!
Hey!
Hey, I did it!
Back! Stay back!
Stay back!
They're in trouble.
Hang on, I'm coming!
How do I get across?
I have to think. What would Guy do?
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?
What would I do?
Hold this.
I have... an idea!
Run!
Yes!
Douglas?
Hey, I know that guy.
Hold on!
It's not safe here.
I'll tell her.
I never got to tell him.
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...
Get out of the way!
Wow. You sound just like him.
Get out of the way!
Dadda!
He did it!
He's riding the sun.
But, not very well.
Everybody out of the way!
- Dad!
- Grug!
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?
I love you, too!
One, two, three, four... five... six... and seven.
And a half.
And eight.
Nine.
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!
A boy has to have a pet.
Turns out I'm a cat person.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there.
Yes! Coming through!
Wait!
This is me. My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in by the suntans and pets...
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...
but now we know the Croods will make it.
Because we changed the rules...
the ones that kept us in the dark.
And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change.
Release the baby!
Sort of.
So, from now on, we'll stay out here...
where we can follow the light.
The Vampire and Lycan
clans had been at war
for centuries before I was born,
their conflict
hidden from
the human world.
I was turned
by a Vampire.
Given the strength
to avenge
my family
against the Lycans.
And I was good at it.
Then I found Michael Corvin,
a human that was
turned to neither Vampire
nor Lycan,
but a hybrid
of the two.
Everything changed.
Allies turned
enemies,
and the Vampire elders I had
protected for over six centuries
wanted me dead.
We retaliated,
killed the elders,
and for a moment of time
we were safe.
But then
a new darkness arose.
In the nine days
since the first discovery of the non-human species,
scores of so-called "covens" have been uncovered.
Estimates of the number of infected have skyrocketed.
Military sources confirm
that the primary measures
of defense against the non-humans are
ultraviolet light and silver,
to which the infected appear to have fatal sensitivity.
Tents are posted at every barricade throughout the city.
A test will be administered
to verify
if you're clear of infection.
Spray her!
Spray her with silver!
- Get it out here!
- Help! Run!
No, no! Run!
We've begun our second attack wave
using ultraviolet
and silver-nitrate
munitions, which are
deadly to the infected.
Due to the volatile
situation,
martial law was declared two hours ago.
Many of us have
lost loved ones to this.
Please know that you cannot help them or yourself.
It's shocking
that not one
but two distinct
species may have been coexisting within human populations.
The existence of Vampires and Werewolves
now appear to have actual basis in fact.
The city remains reluctant to share new
information.
We are getting reports on what appears to be a mass cleansing.
Fire!
Get back! No cameras!
There's no cure.
There it is!
Engage contact!
- Man down! Man down!
- Cover me!
The Purge.
Human beings no longer kill each other.
We are the enemy they've been waiting for.
Escape has become our only chance of survival.
Therefore,
Michael and I are leaving tonight.
Halt!
Delta 6 in pursuit!
Stop! Get down on the ground!
She'll be here any minute.
- You be ready to go.
- Better hurry.
Tango Unit moving into position.
We have the hybrid in sight.

No, no, no. No, no, no.

No. Let her go.
She'll lead us
to Subject 2.
No, don't shoot!
Let her go.
Attention, all units.
Subject 1 and Subject 2 have escaped the perimeter
and are no longer under Antigen control.
Secure the outer gates and use extreme caution upon encounter.
Report immediately upon coming into contact...
Hey, how did you get in there?
You're not allowed in here.
The pier is closed.
Since when?
A long time ago. (Some on.
How long?
About 12 years ago.
Since the cleansing. Why?
You okay, ma'am?
Attention, all units, code three call.
Receiving a report of an assault,
Exit 39 underpass.
Possible non-human aggressor.
Proceed with caution.
CDC already en route.
All area units respond.
Ma'am? Hey!
Ma'am?
- What are you doing?
- Stay there! Don't move!
- Identify yourself!
- Get back here right now!
Whoever it is, they couldn't have made it very far.
I'll alert CDC to keep an eye out.
They're en route.
There's no way this attack was human.
You don't know that.
Don't know what?
The guy's shredded.
His throat was in the gutter.
Just let me handle it.
What's to handle?
This has Lycan written all over it.
Detective, when was the last time you heard about a reported Lycan killing?
A couple years ago.
How many years have you been with this department?
What? I've been here for three months.
Exactly.
You question me less until you know a bit more.
We clear?
Crystal.
Detective Sebastian.
Detective, we've just received a report.
There's been a disturbance at Antigen Labs.
A witness says there was an escape.
They said someone jumped
out of a window.
This is a priority
investigation.
We need you over there ASAP.
We're on our way.
Hey, let's go.
Johnson, you're the lead.
You got it, detective. Will do.
Who's in charge?
There's a Detective Sebastian here to see you, sir.
Where is he?
In the lobby, sir.
You'll be relieved to know the situation is well under control.
What happened?
I repeat, well under control.
I repeat, what happened?
Ah, yes, there are reports to be filed.
One of our test subjects attempted to escape.
We were forced to put it down.
So nothing got out?
Only a stray bullet.
And the test subject?
Flash-burned.
Will that be all?
A few things to attend to.
You could imagine.
Doctor, we received an anonymous call that something else escaped through a window.
Detective, our mission at Antigen is to develop ways of preventing infection, not releasing it into the general population.
I lost my son to this disease.
There's no room for error with me when it comes to the safety of the public.
If something had escaped, the authorities would have been notified.
You are an authority, are you not?
Now, if you'll excuse me...
The guy in charge says it's nothing. Let's go.
Yeah, and he's full of shit.
Look at this.
Want me to report it, sir?
No. I'll do it.
I don't mind.
I can do it for you.
All right, sir.
The prisoner that helped me escape, the one you called Subject 2, was it a hybrid?
Yes.
What were you doing with us?
We...
We help the government identify the infected.
We were using your DNA to try to find a cure to prevent another outbreak.
You were told that I would lead you to the hybrid. Why?
Subject 2 is restricted information.
I don't have the clearance.
You're lying.
No! Aah!
No, please!
All I know is there's a connection between you.
Your brain waves fall into sync when you're close to each other.
You can see through each other's eyes!
Please don't!
I'm the one who let you go!
Now we're even.
What the hell was that?
Creepy is what.
I'm calling it in.
Let's go.
Shit.
Doni.
Why not?
We're the same.
Why are you following me?
We monitor the police frequencies.
Well?
Do you know what attacked that human under the bridge?
No.
Lycans.
What remains of them, yes.
They've been hiding down here like rats since the Purge.
Diseased and starving, they rarely show themselves above ground.
Which means that something has got them riled up.
Something you're not telling me.
Michael!
Do you know her?
No.
They will come back in numbers.
We can't leave her here.
Come on.
Let's try the van.
Get in. Move! Move!
Three of them behind us.
Go!
Hurry, Selene!
They're getting in the back!
Fucking piece of shit!
The girl! They're taking her!
You drive.
She's not healing.
We have a doctor that can help her at our coven.
How did you find me?
What's your name?
Subject 2.
And you are Subject 1.
I freed you.
Do you not know who I am?
They told me that I had no mother, that she died when I was born.
I never believed it. I...
I felt you.
Saw images through your eyes.
But then someone outside my door, they said since I was no longer a child, the wait was over, that I'd be dead soon.
And that my own mother, right next door, would never even know
I'd existed.
What did they tell you of your father?
They must have told you something.
Do you see images through him?
No.
Only you.
No, please!
She's never stepped foot outside the lab.
How can she possibly survive?
I understand the risk of reporting her escape to the authorities.
No record of her birth.
Questions will be asked.
I'm well aware of that.
But if she dies, all our years of research...
Rather than tell me how to do my job, why not take a look at your own professional conduct?
And how your continual need to endow this creature with human traits has led to the laxness of its security protocols.
It's not a human being, Lida!
It's not your child.
It's not to be coddled.
It's a blight of nature.
Stop worrying.
It'll come back to us.
Get Olivia at once.
Again you break my rules. Why?
She was attacked.
She is not healing.
And for this you compromise our safety?
You have no reason to fear us.
Do you think I'm foolish enough to take you at your word?
No reason to fear a Death Dealer who fell in love with a Lycan, who murdered two of our elders, and who, at every turn, has betrayed her own kind.
Do you know who this is?
Yes.
But it was we who betrayed her, Father.
Let her through.
She's not healing.
She was attacked by a lower Lycan.
Two hours ago.
Her cell repair is active but weakened.
She has no origin bite marks or scars.
I've never seen a child like this before.
When did you last feed?
Feed?
Give her blood.
Child, you must.
Slowly.
Slowly.
There.
There, now.
She's healing.
- And quickly.
- Good.
Take her to my room.
She needs to rest.
No.
Look at the eyes.
I never believed it.
They do exist.
This is not one of us.
No, it's something more, Father.
What do you know of her?
I was held captive at a place called Antigen.
One of the other prisoners freed me.
I believed it was Michael Corvin the only hybrid
I knew existed at that time.
Yes, yes, your Lycan lover, long dead.
What is this, then?
None of your concern.
As soon as she regains her strength, I will leave with her.
I used to hear stories of the Death Dealers.
That they were a thing of the past, never to return.
I'm glad they were wrong.
You knew who I am... and yet you still brought me here.
Thank you.
You're a fighter.
We could use more like you to teach us.
I'm not sure your father would agree.
There was a time when he would have.
That's why he dislikes you so much.
I think it reminds him of the days when he defended us with fire and steel rather than hollow words.
He knows how much we need you.
I'm not a leader.
But you fight for what you believe in.
You always have.
I don't know what I believe in any more.
I don't recognize this world.
But you haven't changed.
I saw it in your eyes when you looked at the child.
You will protect her.
It's in your blood.
It's who you are.
When you leave, take me with you.
You distrust me.
Of course you do.
I made you feel unwelcome.
And for that, I'm sorry.
Ah.
Those eyes, they're special.
I know exactly what you are.
My father says that, should we survive as a species, these relics will help our descendants know who we were and how we lived.
And what do you say?
That if we continue to live as we do now, then we disgrace the past and don't deserve a future.
We must resist the humans wherever and whenever possible.
Between the first and second Purges,
Lycan youth rallied in the same way against the prudence of their elders.
Their calls for violent action carried the day.
The result?
The Werewolves are nearly extinct.
Is that what you wish for us, extinction?
Yet you bring her offspring into our home.
Do you honestly believe the humans will allow her to remain free?
They will hunt her down at any expense.
- Then we can help protect them.
- Protect them?
They leave tonight.
This isn't prudence.
This is cowardice, plain and simple.
How dare you?
How dare you do so little?
I dreamt of the day we would meet.
Like a silly little girl.
You're as cold as one already dead.
Yesterday
I was with your father.
He was only a little further away from me than you are now.
I went to sleep.
And when I awoke the next day,
I learned that, overnight,
12 years had passed.
And instead of the only man
I've ever loved, there stood a girl with his eyes.
My heart is not cold.
It's broken.
I'm so sorry.
What is it?
They're here.
Stay here. Wait for me.
No, take me with you.
Please.
I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.
Lock the door.
Everybody to the shelter. Now!
No!
Prepare the armory.
Do as I say! Go, 90!
Pay heed to me!
No! We stand and we fight.
No! Have you no sense?
Stop this now!
We lived safely for years and you brought humans into this coven.
They want the girl.
They'll stop at nothing to get her.
This day was bound to come, with or without us.
Let's move!
Munitions, let's go! Everyone!
Are you mad?
We have no more than a handful of fighters. We will be annihilated!
And what's your plan, Father?
Let's go! Now!
Where are you going?
To get her away from here.
He's right. I shouldn't have come.
He doesn't understand.
The humans will follow us out.
Hold them off till then.
They're only here for her.
She's more powerful than any of us.
They fear the day she discovers it.
I have to get her out of here.
Lycan!
Silver ammunition!
Now!
Defend the second rotunda!
Move! Move!
Open the door!
Let's go.
Move! Move!
We need to go.
What the hell was that?
Take her somewhere safe.
No.
Take her. Go.
Where is she?
They took her.
They accepted her.
As a gift from me.
Do you know what you've done?
Do you have any idea?
What would you have had me do?
Fight to the last to protect the very one who brought this upon us?
We're defeated.
Our coven is destroyed.
My son is dead.
Because of you.
Why?
Because he helped that child of yours.
If they kill her, so be it.
Your son died because he was fighting for all of you.
Because he knew that running is not survival.
Those were Lycans.
Not extinct.
More powerful than ever.
That thing was more than twice the size of any Lycan I've seen.
They risked showing themselves after more than a decade in hiding because of her.
And you handed her over to them.
She is the last direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus.
The only hybrid child that has ever existed.
Whatever it is the Lycans want from her, your son knew it was worth dying for.
What are you doing?
David.
A force of two dozen Lycans attacked and destroyed one of our covens last night.
You're not surprised.
You knew the Lycans were not extinct.
How?
Just a feeling.
I'm not good with feelings.
I want to know how.
This is not the place for this.
And you're not gonna kill me.
Really?
No.
Because you wouldn't need a fucking gun to do it.
A few years ago, the government declared
"mission accomplished" on Lycans.
The feds announced that we were to only focus on your kind now.
Three months ago, a friend of mine sent me this.
It arrived two days after he was found hanging from his own ceiling fan.
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.
Every case was investigated.
Every blood test came back negative.
My friend began to wonder:
Were they all false leads or was someone trying to protect the Lycans?
Helping them replenish their packs, letting them regroup.
What about your own department?
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.
If you're protecting someone, I don't care.
I'm not after them. I just want her.
No.
Even if there are others in my department, they wouldn't have the authority.
This goes much higher.
I believe, all the way to the top.
Or to the bottom.
What do you mean?
Who administers the tests?
We're a bit short on time, so if you please, take a look at these.
This schedule takes you from the moment we adjourn through to the final manufacture of the vaccine.
If we stick to this plan, inoculations should begin within three months.
Any questions, now's the time.
After today's surgery, there will be no communication between us until we meet again in the inoculation center.
Doctor, in terms of your test subject, he continues to demonstrate immunity to silver?
Absolutely.
And additional inoculations, administered only as a precaution, triggered side effects we never imagined.
Vast increases in strength, muscle mass, self-healing.
Stamina.
You said she was essential to our research.
- Yes, and will continue to be.
- How?
By vivisecting her?
You weren't meant to have that.
I cared for this little girl all these years, and you expect me to sit by while you...
Harvest its genetic material?
I expect nothing from you.
I hired you to look after it, and for the most part, you did an excellent job.
Saving the lives of thousands.
What are you talking about?
An entire species saved from extinction.
Jacob.
After today, you won't have to wait so long between injections.
Are you sure she's ready?
Estrogen levels high, intervals between menses holding steady.
It's come of age.
Everything's worked out just as we'd hoped.
You're the first proof of it.
I'm proud of you, son.
Now that it's with us again, we'll have all the genetic material we need, ready for cloning.
Enough to produce an endless supply of vaccine.
Imagine.
Our species immune to silver.
No more hiding.
Every Lycan under our command as powerful as you are.
I've even begun injecting myself.
I only wish Mother were here to see it.
Your mother chose to remain human.
She abandoned us.
Remember that.
Of course, Father.
Look, if you're right about Antigen, who knows how many Lycans will be hiding in there?
The second you step foot inside, you'll be surrounded.
I'm hoping so.
I know you want her back.
I can help you.
Why?
Just tell me what your plan is.
It's worse if you try to fight it.
Trust me.
So how is it you're actually able to survive in the sunlight?
It was a gift.
From a man named
Alexander Corvinus.
The founding father.
I used to be married, to a nurse.
One day at work, she was bitten.
Nobody knew but us.
We lived like that for a few years.
Then came the Purge.
The feds were conducting door-to-doors and when they knocked on ours... well, she told me she loved me... and then she let the sunlight in.
I had to watch her burn.
Okay.
You got me?
Yes.
Good luck.
Shit. It's her.
In daylight?
It's her!
- Go!
- Okay.
Wait for my cue.
I'm ready.
Ops Code A. Repeat, Ops Code A.
Breach on Level 1.
Intruder ascending in Elevator 4.
I want all levels ready on that elevator now!
Anesthesia ready?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Security units on alert.
Ops Code A.
Intruder on premises.
Secure the east wing.
All units, intruder's ascending
in the elevator.
Come on.
Let's go.
Move!
There's your cue.
Copy.
They're using silver-nitrate gas.
Bombs on all the floors.
It's Subject 1. We need to evacuate.
Fine.
Start a propofol infusion.
We're not canceling this procedure, understood? We're moving it.
You find her and you destroy her.
With pleasure.
I'm here.
I got movement on a van in.
Parking Level 3.
No sign of the girl.
They'll be on the move.
Just don't lose them.
She's in the service elevator.
Get her.
I'm coming down.
Selene. Selene!
They're heading for Parking Level 2.
Selene.
I need to know
where you are!
Ah, shit!
Do you copy?
Selene, where are you?
I see her. I see her.
Parking Level 2.
They're loading her into the van.
Selene, where are you?
Fuck it.
Hold it right there!
Stop! Stop now!
Michael?
Get her!
Take her out!
Selene, Lane has her
in the van.
They're on the move. Where are you?
They are leaving with her!
Do you hear me?
I'm on my way.
Come on, faster.
Don't stop.
Hit him!
Selene, they're heading for Parking Level 1.
Aah!
Selene, they're getting away on Parking Level 1. Do you copy?
I'm coming.
Everything okay?
Levels are holding stable, sir.
Baseline vitals...
Fuck you.
Get away from her!
It's worse if you try to fight it.
Trust me.
I heal instantly.
I'm counting on it.
You came back for me.
I said I would.
Selene.
You should go.
There's a safe house not far from here.
Go. I'll send them on a different path, buy you some time.
Thank you. Come on.
David.
Are we going back in?
We are.
What is it?
Michael?
The roof.
Though the world has changed, our enemy remains the same.
The Lycans
will rebuild.
And will hunt for her father as they did
for her.
But as they grow stronger,
so will we.
The Vampire coven will not only
survive this world,
we will reclaim it.
Long ago, in a land far away,
there once rose an empire, that stretched from the steppes of China,
to the shores of the Mediterranean.
That empire was Persia.
Fierce in battle, wise in victory,
where the Persian sword went, order followed.
The Persian King Sharaman,
ruled with his brother Nizam upon the principles of loyalty and brotherhood.
The King had two sons who gave him great joy.
Rejoice!
But in the eyes of the gods, the King's family was not yet complete.
Not until the day he witnessed a single act of courage
by an orphan boy from the streets of Nasaf.
Get out of the way!
Stop!
Stop!
Run!
Run, Bis!
Run!
Stay here.
He's getting away!
Let go of me!
In the King's name!
- What is your name, boy?
- Dastan, Sir.
And your parents?
Boy...
Brother, take him up.
Moved by what he saw, the King adopted the boy Dastan into his family.
A son with no royal blood,
and no eye on his throne.
But perhaps, there was something else that worked that day.
Something beyond simple understanding.
The day, a boy from the unlikeliest of places,
became...
a Prince of Persia.
The fabled Alamut, even more stunning than I imagine.
Don't be fooled by its beauty prince Tates.
It's a city like any others.
Soft countries make soft men.
They stooped to treachery, and now must pay for it.
The father made clear,
Alamut is not to be touched.
Some consider it sacred.
But since our wise father isn't here, the decision rests with me.
I'll have one last counsel with my noble uncle, and my two brothers, trusted Garsiv, and...
Where's Dastan?
Come on! I bet my entire month's allowance on this!
- This is embarrassing!
- Why don't you give it a try?
Give it in here!
Is that all you got?
Prince Dastan!
Where's prince Dastan?
Prince Dastan isn't here.
Your Highness, please.
Prince Tus has convened the war council.
I'm on my way.
Our finest spy, intercepted a caravan leaving Alamut.
Swords, of the best workmanship.
Steel tipped arrows.
A promise of payment from the
Warlord Kosh, to Alamut.
They're selling weapons to our enemies, Dastan.
An arrow such as this slew my horse in Kushkan.
Blood will run in Alamut's streets for this.
Or our soldiers will fall from its walls.
Our orders were to subdue Kushkan, not to attack Alamut.
- Wise words, little brother.
- Words won't stop our enemies, once they're armed with Alamutian blades.
We attack at dawn.
Well, if that's your decision, then let me go in first.
- Who wants to share, Garsiv?
- I'll ride at the head of the Persian Army!
Dastan leads the company of street rabble!
They may not be much for manners, but they're pretty handy in a fight.
- The honor of first blood should be mine.
- Garsiv, you've got your hands on your sword again.
- Where's it should be.
- Oh, my brothers...
Ever eager.
It's said the princess of Alamut, is a beauty without equal.
We'll march into her palace and see for ourselves.
There'll be no doubt of your courage
Dastan, but you're not ready for this.
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.
Princess Tamina, the Persian Army my princess, has not moved on.
Their faith has little love for any truth, other than its own.
Or perhaps it would be safer if you didn't stand so close.
Whatever their faith, their bows aren't that strong,
Nor it's their aim.
Gather the council.
Tell them, I sit in the High Temple,
I must pray.
The High Temple? Alamut hasn't been breached in a thousand years.
Everything changes with time.
We should know this best of all.
Remind me why we're disobeying your brother's orders?
Because Garsiv only knows how to attack head-on, it would be a massacre.
The Alamutians would be busy with the main gate, so we slip through the side.
Have you been drinking?
That's our way in.
There are two gates.
The outer one's easy, it's the inner gate that's impossible.
That gate mechanism is protected by two men gard towers.
Yeah, there's always a way in, Bis, you take care of the outer gate, you leave the impossible one to me.
That's how you won't be happy if you get us all killed.
Oh. Wonderful speech, Bis.
Rousing!
Sound the alarm!
Hold this.
Watch your back.
- Eastern gate's open.
- That's Dastan's men.
He's gotten in, Dastan's done it.
Redeploy to the eastern gate.
Redeploy to the eastern gate!
They breached the eastern gate.
- Collapse the passages to the chamber.
- Princess.
Go now, everyone.
- You know what you must do.
- Our wealth must be kept safe.
Out of the way!
Silly songs and scented smoke could do little for you now!
I think you'll find there's more to her than that, hey Garsiv?!
So for once, the stories are true.
We know you secretly build weapons for enemies of Persia.
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.
And what weapons we had you overcame.
Our spies say differently.
You can save a lot of pain...
All the pain in the world will not help you find something that does not exist.
Spoken like one wise enough to consider a political solution.
- Join hands with Persia's future King.
- I'll die first.
That can be arranged.
Don't!
Prince Tus...
Promise me, the people of Alamut will be treated with mercy.
Hey, the Lion of Persia!
The Lion of Persia!
They're calling you the Lion of Persia.
You've never excelled at following order, Dastan.
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No, no.
No, you have some celebrating to do.
There is however, tradition.
Since you took the honor of first assault, you owe me a gift, homage.
- A beautiful dagger.
- He delivered you the city and its princess,
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.
First dispatches just arrived, my prince.
Wonderful news.
Your father's interrupted his prayers in the eastern palace to join us.
No doubt to commend this on our great victory.
We've had indications that Alamut was arming our enemies.
Indications? You've got to have more than indications to occupy a holy city, with my troops!
This adventure, won't sit with our allies!
But I suppose you didn't take that into account.
Don't look for your uncle, boy!
The decisions and its consequences rest with me.
I know you're eager to wear the crown.
But trust me when I tell you, you're not yet ready.
No man would know better than you, father.
Because your trust is something I deeply cherish.
I'll oversee the search for weapons myself.
I vow I will not stand before you until I hold proof for Alamut's treachery.
The third step is the hardest!
Brother!
We've uncovered signs of tunnels on the eastern edge of the city. I'm on my way there now.
Oh, you'll miss the banquet!
You and Garsiv can handle father in my absence.
- You do have a gift to honor him with.
- Of course.
Bis, gift!
It's been momentarily misplaced!
I knew you'd forget.
The prayer robe of Alamut's regent.
The holiest in Eastern lands, a gift the King would appreciate.
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favor.
A rare jewel. Present her to the King for me this evening, Dastan.
Sure you really want another wife, brother?
Listen to me, Dastan!
A marriage to the princess assures me the loyalty of her people.
Unbound to us, she's a dangerous liability.
If father doesn't approve our union,
I want you to end her life with your own hand.
So, I'm escorted by prince Dastan, the Lion of Persia.
Must feel wonderful winning such a claim for destroying such an innocent city.
Oh, a pleasure to meet you too, princess.
And allow me to offer, that if punishing the enemies of my king is a crime, then it's one I'll gladly repeat.
Then you are a true prince of Persia.
Brutal. Without honor.
Don't make the mistake of thinking you know me, princess.
- Oh, and what more is there?
- Wait here with Her Highness.
If you can manage it.
I suggest a hint of humility when you're presented to the King.
For your own good.
You've eased father's anger, uncle?
One day, you'll have the pleasure of being brother to the king, Dastan.
As long as you remember your most important duty, you should do well.
- Oh, and what's that?
- Making sure his wine glass stays full.
I'm told that another of my sons has joined the rank of great Persian Warrior.
- We missed you, father.
- I was praying for you and your brothers, Dastan.
Family, the bond between brothers that is the sword, that defends our empire.
And I pray that that sword remains strong.
I was hoping my actions would spare our men unnecessary losses.
A good man would've done as you did, Dastan.
Acting boldly and courageously to bring the victory and spare lives.
A great man would've stopped the attack from happening at all, a great man would've stopped what he knew to be wrong, no matter who was ordering.
The boy I saw in that square, was capable of being more than just good, but of being...great.
Well in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.
Some questiones the wisdom of my bringing a boy from the streets into my family.
I saw a boy whose blood wasn't noble, but whose character was, a King in spirit.
Thank you, father.
May I present, the prayer robe of Alamut's regent.
What can I grant you, in return?
May I present the princess Tamina.
Tus wishes to make a union with her people through marriage.
It is my deepest wish that this win your approval.
In all my travels, I have never looked upon a more beautiful city, Your Highness.
You should've seen it before your horde of camel-ridding illiterates descended upon it.
Clear as you will make a fine queen.
But...Tus already has enough wives.
You Dastan, might take fewer chances, if such a jewel waited you in your chamber.
The princess of Alamut will be your first wife.
Oh, what say you, Dastan?
He plunges into a hundred foes without thought, but before marriage, he stands frozen with fear, and that's for those who say he's not yet wise.
I need a drink.
Stand aside.
Out of my way!
- Father...
- Oh, God help us, the robe, it's poisoned!
- Somebody help him!
- The robe Dastan gave him!
- Why?!
- Somebody help him!
- Seize the murderer!
- Somebody help him!
- Bis! Bis!
- Come with me!
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here!
- You're going to need my help.
- Come on!
- Close the gate!
- That way!
Close the gate!
Get down!
There, onto the murderer!
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!
My loyal subjects, the whole world grieves at the death of our beloved King.
We are all stricken by his loss.
But the murder came at prince
Dastan's hand, only makes our pain worse.
I didn't murder my father.
That robe was given to me by my brother.
- Tus did this.
- And now he stands to be crowned king.
I didn't kill my father.
- I believe you.
- You shouldn't be here,
- I shouldn't have let you come.
- But you did.
I promised my brother I'll kill you, if he couldn't have you.
Well, the solution would be to kiss me, and then kill me.
But I have a better solution.
I kill you, and your problems are solved!
Perhaps we could find another solution.
Well, the solution would be to kiss me, and then kill me.
But I have a better solution.
I kill you!
Give back what you stole, Persian!
No!
- Did you see that?
- See what?
Go for that sword again, and I swear I'll break your arm.
Again?
- You've used up all the sand!
- What?
What is this?
Incredible.
Releasing the sand, turns back time.
And only the holder of the Dagger is aware what's happened.
He could go back and alter events, change time.
And no one knows, but him.
How much can it unliken?
Answer me, princess.
You destroyed my city.
Our invasion wasn't about weapons forges, it was about this Dagger.
After the battle, Tus asked for this Dagger as tribute,
I didn't think anything of it, but now I see.
With it, he could change anything. He could change the course of a critical moment in battle,
He could foresee the blade of a rival.
He wouldn't just be the king, he'd be the most powerful ruler Persia ever seen, greater even than my father.
It was all about this dagger!
My treacherous brother must be brought to justice.
And as such, I have doubled the reward for his capture.
Meanwhile, I shall strive to protect our Empire, as my father would've demanded.
A new reign has begun.
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.
She is the most famous horse in the Empire, this would skew its tracks.
- Tracks where, where are you going?
- To Avrat, where my father will be buried.
You're wanted for the King's murder, you're going to march into his funeral alongside thousands of
Persian soldiers.
I hope Nizam will be there, he's the only one I can trust.
He'll see I was set up by Tus, step aside, princess.
Every road to Avrat will be covered with Persian troops.
Well I a'm not taking roads,
I'm going through the Valley of the Slaves.
No one goes near that wasteland, it's filled with murderers and cutthroats.
- Yes, so they say.
- Your whole plan is suicide.
My brother murdered my father, and left his blood on my hands.
If I die trying to set that right, then so be it.
So, you're going to leave me here, in the middle of nowhere?!
Noble Dastan, abandoning a helpless woman in the wilderness.
What does your precious honor have to say about that?
Oh, give me the strength not to kill her.
Mounts up, we can't be far behind him.
Without the right sand, it's just another knife. Not even very sharp.
- This sand, is there more of it?
- Of course not.
- How can I get some?
- Try standing on your head and holding your breath.
Did you see what you're looking for, prince?
Start walking.
So, if you can't prove to your uncle how the Dagger works, why on the world would he believe you?
It's not your problem, princess.
You know, you really walk like one.
Head held high, chest out, long stomping strides.
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.
No doubt it comes from being told since birth, the world is yours,
- And you actually believing it.
- I wasn't born in a palace like you!
I was born in the slums of Nasaf, where I lived if I fought and I clawed for it.
- And how did you become a prince?
- The king, marches the market one day, and he... I don't know, he...
He found me.
He took me in, he gave me a family, he gave me a home.
What you're looking at is, the walk of a man, who just lost everything.
Welcome to the Valley of Slaves,
Your Highness.
- I'm desperate for a drop of water.
- Well, there's more than we have since you emptied our canteen hours ago.
I wasn't born in this desert like you Persians, all shriveled and angry.
- My constitution is much more... delicate.
- I think you mean spoiled.
The wells of Alamut are fame for their clean, cold water.
Perhaps less time admiring your wells, and more time guarding your walls, and you wouldn't be here.
Ah, a miracle, I've silenced a princess!
Tamina?
Tamina?
Can you hear me?
Yes, Dastan,
I can hear you.
Do you know where you are Persian?
And yet you're enter still?
In the heart of Sudan there's a tribe of warriors, known as the M'Baka.
They strike fear into the hearts of all they cross.
The M'Baka, are masters of the throwing knife.
Wielding blades, said to have been blessed by the Creator, Himself.
Their aim is so murderously accurate, they can decapitate three men, with one strike.
No. I wouldn't even bother doing that, if I were you. Do you know why?
This is Seso, he is a M'Baka,
I have the good fortune of saving his life, which means, he is now enduringly indebted to me.
So tell me Persian, is there any good reason why I shouldn't tell Seso, to put his next throw so little higher?
So, this is the one, eh?
Yes, you're right, she's not bad.
She could smell better than that.
Still we have a deal.
- Clever princess.
- Deal?
What deal?
- Such a noble prince.
- Such a gentle princess.
I've taken you over with my fainting act, eagerly leaping to assist the foreign beauty.
- Who said you're a beauty?
- There's must be a reason why you can't take your eyes off me.
You're... I...
I don't trust you, and you're not my type.
Oh, I'm not some desperate slave girl!
I'm actually capable of voicing my own folks!
- Too many for my taste.
- Oh yeah, she'll make a very nice addition.
What you intend to do with her?
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.
It's hard for me to admit, but you were right.
- I did see what I was looking for.
- Dastan, listen to me.
When my uncle sees the power of this Dagger, he'll believe me.
Dastan, I know. I haven't been entirely honest with you.
- But your lies are so clever.
- I'm the guardian of the divine covenant.
That Dagger is sacred, it's been smuggled to a safety when you stole it.
- If the Dagger gets into the wrong hands...
- I will take care of your knife.
- You don't want to miss this.
- You don't understand what's at stake!
- This is the matter for the gods, not man!
- Your gods, not mine. Come on!
Come on!
Run quickly. Come on, ostrich!
- Ostrich racing?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.
Whatever they like in beauty, they make up for it. Fighting spirit.
- And the races are easy to fix.
- I've heard all these terrible stories of this place.
The bloodthirsty slaves, murdering their masters?
That's a good story, it's well told, ever evolving, but alas untrue.
- But the skeletons that we saw...
- Ah, I bought those from a gypsy in Bukhara.
I crafted our lurid reputation, in order to fend off the most insidious evil, that's been lurking this forsaken country of ours.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Taxes.
Dirty Persians, their armies, their fortresses, their roads, who pays for it all, eh?
The small businessmen.
You see, that's why I started a little campaign, to spread some false notoriety.
I spread it like a venerable disease in a Turkish harem.
Behold the mighty ostrich!
Come on, my beauty!
I love this!
And the tax collectors stay clear of me, and my customers, everybody's happy.
Hey! Get the girls on! Get the girls on, come on. Crowd control!
Don't you stand there!
Run, don't walk!
Hey, you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages.
Don't look at me like that, you know what I'm talkin' about!
Do your job, crowd control.
Thank you!
You know, I think our little arrange is going to work out very well, young man.
- Don't touch!
- Oh, ho, ho! She's a lively one! Where did you find her?
In the slave market to Lurs
I was headed to Avrat.
I trade her for a camel, when she attacked me!
- The camels are safer.
- Noble, Sheik Amar.
I appreciate your hospitality, you run a fine establishment.
- But if you could give me the supply...
- You know something, Persian?
You bear a remarkable resemblance to the disgrace prince, who fled after murdering the king.
Have I told you about the M'Baka?
- Yes, you have.
- Eh, nothing beats a good story. Eh, but yours however, trading her for a camel? Please.
I mean look at her. She's worth at least, two.
And as for you, young man, did you know your brothers offered rewards for you, it's quite frankly, between you and me, borders on the obscene.
I traded my own mother for that kind of gold.
What? You didn't know what she was like?
Take him down to the Persian outpost.
Wait, wait, wait. Look, that...
- Nice knife.
- It's nothing.
- That's worthless.
- Really?
Melt it down for the jewels.
What's the boy doing?!
No, no, you might kill a bird!
Hey, over here!
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you!
- Get to the tunnel!
Look at this! That's it.
No more fermented goat's milk after the third race, do you hear me? Get off, come on!
- The gate!
- Get him!
Stop!
- Lift the lever, it opens the gate!
- Give me the Dagger!
- This isn't the time, lift that lever!
- Give me the Dagger!
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.
Move, princess!
Dastan!
Persian!
Looking for this?
Next time, you...!
They all come for my father's funeral.
There are a hundred Persian soldiers watching that gate.
Maybe more, if want you to stay closer to this Dagger, you're going to have to help me in the Avrat.
All these foreign dignitaries,
I'm guessing you're known up here.
Couldn't you have found somebody lighter?
The Mugals of the Hindu Kush are noble people, you should be honored.
Oh yes, terribly.
- Dastan, where's the Dagger?
- You're welcome to search me for it.
You'll have to be very thorough.
Tus isn't here, he must be in Alamut.
The Sand that fills the Dagger, there's more that hidden somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?
That's why Tus stays there.
That's why he's got our army searching for.
I have to get a message to my uncle to meet me.
That's impossible.
- Difficult, not impossible.
- One more proof, you're insane.
Why do you look so impressed?
Out of the way!
Make way!
- Turn around!
- What?
You used to buy those for me, when I was a boy.
You used to spit the seeds at Garsiv.
You shouldn't have brought me here, Dastan.
I had no choice uncle, follow me.
I didn't kill father, you know
I'd never do such a thing..
Your actions speak otherwise.
I had no choice but to flee.
Tus gave me that cloak.
- He was the one who poisoned it. - Dastan...
- But he's not here, is he?
At his father's funeral, instead he remains in Alamut.
Our allies will see our invasion is just, the search for Alamut's weapon forges is important.
Yes, but not if there were none.
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.
Tus is after power, that's why he murdered father, and now he searches not for weapons, but for the Sand, that fuels the mystical device.
This is why you brought me here, Dastan?
Mystical devices?
Do you remember after the battle you stopped Tus for taken the dagger I'd won?
That dagger is the reason he invaded Alamut.
This dagger, you have it with you?
Yes.
It has incredible powers.
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?
What? I know he was in there.
And where is that so-called evidence?
Tamina.
- Your hands are burned.
- Yes...
From trying to pull the poisoned cloak of your father.
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.
It's just that a...
Tus is my brother, how could he betray me like this?
I can't say Dastan, perhaps he never respected you as you deserve, and he saw you as someone he could use.
Someone to keep his wine glass filled.
My service to your father was different.
- We shared the same blood, Dastan.
- How many times did father speak of you saving him from that lion?
- That was his favorite story.
- One of many, yes.
- No, that was his favorite.
- I'm afraid you're speaking in riddles, Dastan.
Wait, Dastan!
Over here!
Murderer!
I didn't kill father!
What you're going to do now?!
Where is he?!
Hey!
Garsiv...
- I didn't kill father.
- Then God will pardon you.
After your head rolls.
We don't fight with the sticks anymore, little brother.
That's all you got?
Your Majesty,
I thought you were staying in Alamut.
Tell me about Dastan, uncle.
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me, in the market place.
I just got away.
Tus, my death would weaken your young reign.
- Dastan hopes to start rebellion.
- He wants the throne?
I fear so, my Lord.
Putting Dastan on trial would give him a stage for his sedition.
My advice would be to avoid a trial.
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.
Whatever Dastan's crimes, a public trial will best communicate the king I hope to be.
Strong, honoring the rule of law.
- We are not savages.
- You grow more a king every day.
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.
HASSASINS LAIR
- I need to speak with our guests.
- About them, my Lord, their practices are unusual, the servants have seen things.
Heard strange sounds, last week one of the horses vanished.
Just make sure that the servants keep their mouths shut, or I promise you, they will vanish as well.
I have another task for you Hassansin, but you'll have to be quick, your prey has a head start.
You brought what I requested?
These practices, they don't interfere with your skills?
In trance we can see visions of far future.
Visions of death.
Destiny and the curse.
In the trance we can find anything, including your nephew, prince Dastan.
Then I hope you shall see more deaths.
Soon.
Get down, it's a Persian patrol.
What aren't you telling me?
The trail's been left, maybe they are tired of your pawn shop for lies and backstabbing.
I had no choice but to leave you.
I take it your uncle didn't listen.
It wasn't Tus that killed my father, it was Nizam.
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burned.
He said it happened trying to pull off the cloak that killed my father,
I've gone over and over at my mind, he never touched the cloak, he must've handled it before.
It was Nizam who poisoned it.
What could this turning back a few moments of time give my uncle? None.
He murdered my father for more than just a dagger.
What aren't you telling me? You know, you've got quick hands, so do I.
If you want it back, you tell me everything.
No more games, no more lies.
Can we get out of here?
Oh...only a princess thinks she can outrun a sandstorm.
Nizam is coming to kill us, he needs me dead.
I need to know why.
In Alamut rests the beating heart of all life on earth.
The Sand Glass of the gods.
Long ago, the gods slipped down on man and saw nothing but greed and treachery.
So they sent a great sandstorm, to destroy all, wipe clean the face of the earth.
But one young girl begged the gods to give mankind another chance.
Offering her life in exchange.
Seeing the purity within, the gods were reminded of men's potentials for good.
So they swept the sand into the Sand Glass.
The Dagger was given to the girl who saved Man.
Making her the first guardian.
The Dagger blade is the only thing that can pierce the Sand Glass and remove the Sands of Time, but the handle only holds one minute.
But if one were to place a Dagger in the Sand Glass, and pressed the jewel button at the same time?
- Sand would flow through endlessly.
- You could turn back time as far as you like.
Yes, but it is forbidden.
When my father was a boy,
Nizam saved his life hunting.
One day the two princes were stalking a beautiful buck,
but they weren't aware of a lion stalking them.
Nizam saved Sharaman.
My father told us the story over and over again.
I don't understand.
Nizam wishes to go back in time and undo what he did.
Not save my father, let him die.
Then he will be king for a lifetime.
And my brothers would never be born.
The storm's passed.
Dastan, the Sands contained within the Sand Glass are incredibly powerful.
Opening the Dagger while it's inside the glass breaks the seal and destroys the Sand Glass, causing it to crack and shatter.
The Sands of Time would no longer be contained, and they would carry the gods' wrath with them once more, destroying everything in their path.
And all of mankind would pay for Nizam's treachery.
This is all that would be left of us.
The secret guardian temple outside
Alamut is the sanctuary.
The one place where the Dagger can be hidden safely, the only way to stop this Armageddon.
That's the truth, Dastan.
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.
I can't do that.
- I'm coming with you.
- You're going to help me!
We can sit here and chat, or you can get on the horse.
Our journey is blessed.
We'll stop for the water and push for the mountain's pass by the nightfall.
- You enjoy telling me what to do.
- Only because you are so good at following orders.
Don't press your luck.
Persian!
We parted under certain rush circumstances,
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
We've been tracking you for a week.
That little riot you started, it went on for two days!
My beloved racetrack, all washed away like the footprints in sand.
See Lita there...
Look at her?
She's all that's left of my gaming empire.
And no matter your skills as a promoter, you can't organize an ostrich race with just one ostrich!
Am I right?!
Yes sir, come with me.
Did you know that the ostriches have suicidal tendencies?
Look at this poor thing.
She used to be a grand champion, and now I have to watch her night and day to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.
Suddenly occurred to me, that the only way to recoup my tragic losses, was to track down the two young lovers who cast this dark cloud upon me.
Oh yes, I'm gonna need the prize on your head, your brother will be very pleased to see...
The sand dervishes Persian, they are common as camel dirt...
Sheik Amar, listen to me...!
- I'd rather not.
- Nice knife.
Noble Sheik, we are on the sacred journey to the temple...
Temple, the temple, there is nothing more sacred than Persian's gold.
Give me the Dagger, there are too many of them.
You can't kill them all, you wanna live, give me the Dagger!!
Give me the Dagger!
Persian, how did you do that?
Instinct.
What?
We have to get out of here.
- What happened last night?
- Those vipers were controlled by Hassansins.
- Hassansins?
- For years they were the covert killing force for the Persian kings, for my father ordered them disbanded.
Nizam must've disobeyed my father's orders and kept them intact.
This is a secret government killing society.
That's why I don't pay taxes!
- We can't stop.
- Oh perhaps you can't, but we can.
We could use your help getting to the temple.
Hah, by crossing the Hindu Kush with the storm blowing?
You attract troubles like flies around rotting mango and your insane...
There's gold at the temple.
More than ten horses can carry.
- Tax-free.
- Sir!
- Do you have any idea where you're going?
- I memorized this path as a child.
Every princess must, it's sacred.
It's here.
The sanctuary, the one place the Dagger can be hidden safely.
I was expecting golden statues, waterfalls.
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.
Don't cut yourself, princess.
Hey, here!
Not long dead, last night maybe.
Tortured first.
- Hassansin.
- Nizam knows this place.
All dead.
- The entire village, about my gold...
- Where are you going?!
- There is only one way to stop all of this.
- What?!
To make sure the Dagger is safe, the temple holds the stone the Dagger came from.
What temple? This is a pile of stones and rocks!
The first thing we learned, if all else fails, put the Dagger back into the stone, the stone will envelop it, pulling it into the mountain, returning to the gods.
- The original promise, must be paid.
- What promise?
The gods must take back the life they spared.
You'll die.
- Stay there! Stay there!
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
Give me your sword, give me your sword or do you fortake given that honor.
There are bodies down there, murdered by Hassansins, on Nizam's order!
- He's the traitor!
- Hassansins no longer exist!
- You always thought you are so clever.
- This is no trick, Garsiv.
Sir, all dead inside Sir, more in the village.
- There is only one way...
- Stay there!
Nizam wants me dead, wants me silenced.
A trial will be too public.
Do you know this?
He said this much, didn't he?
I know it hasn't been easy between us Garsiv, but still... we are brothers.
Touching words with my sword at your throat.
You've often questioned why father has been so much time in prayer.
Before he died, he told me that the bond between brothers is the sword that defends our empire.
He was praying that that sword remains strong.
Why would I go into Avrat for father's funeral, when I knew it was so dangerous?
Nizam recommended your death,
Tus disagreed, ordered you brought back alive.
Nizam wants me dead, and he's hired
Hassansins to make sure that does happen.
He's afraid of what I might say, and who I might tell.
Tell me, brother.
Garsiv?
My Garsiv?
Hassansins!
Shut up!
Protect the Dagger!
Persian, behind you!
Tamina!
Forget them, throw these!
Find her!
Hey! Over here!
You know what they say about men with big swords!
Tamina, let me do it.
Only a guardian can return the Dagger.
This isn't something you can do, Dastan.
I'm ready for this.
I'm not.
Tamina!
Out, enough, out!
Garsiv!
Dastan, I'm sorry.
Save the empire.
Brother... Brother.
- Where is the Dagger?
- It's gone.
Protect the Dagger, no matter the consequences, that was my sacred calling.
That was my destiny.
We make our own destiny, princess.
We'll get it back.
We're going to need another horse!
- Where will you go?
- To Alamut.
Nizam will use that Dagger to pierce the Sand Glass, and he has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped.
What?
Oh, a knife thrower with a conscience.
Our friends in the palace said that the Persians have broken through to the first level of the tunnels.
They will reach the Sand Glass within hours.
Nizam's keeping the Dagger in the high temple, guarded by some sort of demon,
- covered in spikes.
- The Hassansin that killed my brother.
It's the only thing that stands between us and the Dagger.
No man can stand within twenty yards of him and live.
Some don't need to get that close.
Spare some water, sire.
You sure about this?
I owed the boy.
But, you are a M'Baka, scourge of the Namibian plain.
Me, I'm a slightly dishonorable entrepreneur, this... nobility business is not the cloth we're cut from.
Hurry.
My friend, has anyone ever told you that you talk too much?
Come on.
Have I told you about the M'Baka?
- Yes, you have.
- I hope your brother listens to you, Persian.
He's here.
Seal every gate!
Find him!
- It's clear.
- Dastan, I don't...
I don't think you should do this.
Is that concern I hear?
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.
- You flatter yourself, prince.
- And you used to be a better liar, princess.
Perhaps I'm out of practice.
This won't be the last time we'll be together.
- Where is the Dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats, such soft hands.
- It's been found, my Lord.
- The Sand Glass?
I don't have the Dagger.
Leave me.
Hello, Tus.
Dastan!
- We need to talk.
- Then talk!
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber, now!
We are brothers, did you know?
The robe that killed father was poisoned by Nizam.
- Nizam? You are mad.
- Who gave you the robe, Tus?
Who gave you the robe?!
You trust him, as did I, but Alamut wasn't supplying our enemies with weapons.
- Nizam lied to us.
- Why he would do such a thing,
- what could he gain?
- Listen to me carefully.
Beneath the streets of this city lies an ancient force, a container, holding the fabled Sands of Time.
Nizam wishes to use it to corrupt history, he wants to turn back time and make himself king.
Sands of Time?
Heresies Dastan, pagan madness.
I've seen its power with my own eyes, Tus.
Nizam discovered its resting place, and if we don't stop him our world could end.
If you're gonna kill me, the best you do it now.
This is no ordinary dagger.
You press the jewel on its hilt, and you'll see.
I should have the strength to do this before we invaded the city.
- What are you talking about?
- To act of what I know is right.
No matter the consequences.
- The soldiers remain out...
- Stay where you are!
He took his own life.
Then, God have mercy on the traitor, for he chose the path of the coward.
We both know Dastan was many things, but not... a coward.
This is no ordinary dagger. Press the jewel on its hilt, and you'll see.
No matter the consequences.
Stop!
A moment ago you died before my eyes.
- Oh, you pressed it.
- How did you know I would?
Cause we are brothers.
The day we left for war, our father told me a true king considers the advice of the counsel.
But always listens to his heart.
You shouldn't defy to go so far for me to believe you.
Your Majesty, the soldiers tell me that...
I see that Dastan has indeed return.
Tus, remember what I told you!
No, a moment.
Poor Tus, so eager for the crown.
And you, Dastan, always charging in, so desperate to prove you are more than something that king scraped of the street.
What a glorious mess we are.
It seems that bond between brothers, is no longer the sword that defends our empire.
Yes!
He was one of us.
He was the priest of the temple.
That's how Nizam discovered the existence of the Sand Glass.
He corrupted the guardians, infected us.
We are no longer pure.
We must hurry.
Pulley.
Get pulley, now!
The guardians built passageways underneath the city, a secret access to the Sand Glass.
If we move fast enough, we can get there before Nizam.
That would be the stand to the Sand Glass chamber.
There is only one safe path.
Faster!
Follow in my footsteps.
Nothing can touch the surface, other than where I step.
Run, Dastan!
Run!
Dastan!
Nizam!
You murdered your own family.
Sharaman was your brother!
And my curse.
I looked up to you.
Dastan!
I never understood, why my brother brought trash into the palace.
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.
It's where you stay under my reign.
Tamina!
Nizam, don't use the Dagger to undo your past!
- It will unleash...
- Unleash, what?!
Gods' wrath?!
Hell itself?!
Don't do this!
Stop him! If the glass shatters, the world dies with it.
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.
- Let me go.
- I won't.
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!
I wish we could have been together.
- Dastan!
- No! Tamina!
- Dastan!
- Tamina!
Prince, Dastan!
- Bis, you're here?
- Of course I'm here.
Our men surrounded Alamut's palace, battle is over.
Not yet.
Wait!
Wait!
Brave soldiers of Persia, we have been deceived into attacking this holy city!
- Alamut, has no weapon forges!
- Dastan!
- Have you gone mad?
- I cannot stand silent in the face of treachery.
This war was set up by one trusted above all us.
- Our uncle Nizam.
- Dastan has fought hard today, perhaps too hard. What he needs now is to get out from under this burning sun, to rest.
Gather his wits.
The weapons we've found are forgeries!
There are no weapons here uncle, and you know it!
And the spy, who supposedly intercepted them, was hired by you, to persuade all of us, to invade Alamut!
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?
You yourself led the attack, brought us this great triumph.
I should never have let the attack happen.
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.
It will never be you.
You'll never been king, you don't have the heart.
You will die in a shadow of a great man.
Get him down from there, before he makes even bigger fool of himself!
Tus, before we left Nasaf, father told you this:
"That the true king, considers the advice of the counsel, but he always listens to his own heart."
Father and I were alone.
How could you know that?
He's right, he knows us and he knows we are capable of.
- Just listen to your heart.
- He defies your order, leads attack and now wants to turn back, Tus...
Take action here.
The spy knows the truth, find the spy!
Bring him to me, we'll wring it from him.
You had what every man could ever dream, love, respect and family.
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?
Princess of Alamut.
I was misled to attack your city.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Let me try to make amends?
It would be to our mutual advantage, that our nations be united by a bond stronger than friendship.
Marriage.
Your marriage to one who is both conqueror and savior of your city.
Dastan.
Royal blood or not, he's every bit a son to our father.
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.
The true prince of Persia.
Get up there, before I take your place.
Hello, princess.
It's a customary to accompany a proposal with gifts but, uh...
I was surprised and unless I'm unprepared.
I've nothing for you, save... that which is already yours.
Walk with me, prince Dastan.
How can I trust the man who breached the walls of my city?
But I'm starting to think that I'm no longer the same man who breached those walls.
That's a short time for the man to change so much.
Perhaps.
It sounds as if you've discovered something here.
- What might that be?
- The new spiritual awareness.
- A destiny.
- Yes, exactly.
I believe we make our own destiny, princess.
You have an unfortunate lack of curiosity.
- With no doubt, one of my many flaws.
- Please don't mock me, prince.
I hardly think we know each other well enough for that, princess.
But I look forward, to the day that we do.
It's beautiful here.
It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.
The Order uses it now as a safe house.
What's left of us, at least.
Muggles think these keep evil away, but they're wrong.
I need to talk to the goblin.
How are you?
Alive.
You probably don't remember...
That I showed you to your vault the first time you came to Gringotts?
Even amongst goblins you're famous, Harry Potter.
You buried the elf.
Yes.
And brought me here.
You are...
...a very unusual wizard.
How did you come by this sword?
It's complicated.
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
It's complicated.
The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need.
We didn't steal it.
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one...
...but it is a fake.
It was placed there this summer.
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.
Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.
Who is the acquaintance?
A Hogwarts professor. As I understand it, he's now headmaster.
Snape?
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?
Why?
There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Perhaps.
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.
This is impossible.
Alone, yes. But with you, no.
Why should I help you?
I have gold. Lots of it.
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?
That.
That is my price.
Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there.
She kept asking you what else we'd taken.
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there, another piece of his soul.
Let's find it and kill it, we're one step closer to killing him.
And what happens when we find it?
How are we supposed to destroy it now you've given the sword to Griphook?
I'm still working on that part.
He's weak.
Yes?
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.
OLLIVANDER: Anything, my boy, anything.
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.
Walnut.
Dragon heartstring.
Twelve and three-quarter inches.
Unyie...
Unyielding.
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Treat it carefully.
And this?
Hawthorn.
And unicorn hair.
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Was? Is it not still?
Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.
I sense its allegiance has changed.
You talk about wands as if they have feelings...
...can think.
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
And what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?
It is rumored there are three:
The Elder Wand...
...the Cloak of Invisibility to hide you from your enemies...
...and the Resurrection Stone to bring back loved ones from the dead.
Together, they make one the master of death.
But few truly believe that such objects exist.
Do you?
Do you believe they exist, sir?
I see no reason to put stock into an old wives' tale.
You're lying.
You know one exists.
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand and where he could go looking for it.
He tortured me.
Besides...
...I only conveyed rumors.
There's...
There's no telling whether he will find it.
He has found it, sir.
We'll let you rest.
OLLIVANDER: He's after you, Mr. Potter.
If it's true, what you say, and he has the Elder Wand...
...I'm afraid...
...you really don't stand a chance.
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then.
Are you sure that's hers?
Positive.
Well?
How do I look?
Hideous.
You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?
We're relying on you.
If you get us past the guards and into the vault, the sword's yours.
Madam Lestrange.
Good morning.
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?
You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed school girl.
Hey. Easy.
She gives us away, we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats.
Understand?
No, he's right. I was being stupid.
Okay.
Let's do it.
I wish to enter my vault.
Identification?
I hardly think that'll be necessary.
Madam Lestrange.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
They know.
They know she's an imposter.
They've been warned.
Harry?
What do we do, Harry?
Madam Lestrange, would you mind presenting your wand?
And why should I do that?
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand given the current climate.
No. I most certainly do not understand.
I'm afraid I must insist.
HARRY WHISPERS: Imperio.
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.
What is that, Griphook?
Griphook.
Arresto momentum.
Well done, Hermione.
Oh, no, you look like you again.
The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments.
Can be deadly.
You don't say.
Just out of interest, is there any other way out of here?
No.
What the devil are all you doing down here?
Thieves!
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Lmperio.
That doesn't sound good.
Bloody hell.
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.
Here.
It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
That's barbaric.
Lumos.
Blimey.
Accio Horcrux.
You're not trying that one again, are you?
That kind of magic won't work in here.
Is it in here, Harry?
Can you feel anything?
That's it. Up there.
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.
Give me the sword.
Stop moving.
Got it.
We had a deal, Griphook.
The cup for the sword.
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say anything about getting you out.
Griphook!
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!
Thieves!
Foul little git. Least we've still got Bogrod.
That's unfortunate.
We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?
You're the brilliant one.
I've got something, but it's mad.
Reducto.
Well, come on, then.
Relashio.
GOBLIN: He's moving! Aah!
Now what?
Reducto.
Hold on.
That was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.
We're dropping.
- I say we jump.
- When?
Now.
He knows. You-Know-Who.
He knows we broke into Gringotts.
He knows what we took and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that.
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.
Never mind. What happened?
Well, he's angry.
And scared too.
He knows if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.
I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest.
There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.
What?
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.
We can't do that. We've got to plan. We've got to figure it out.
Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked?
We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.
He's right.
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.
Um, well, we'll go to
Hogsmeade, to Honeydukes.
Take the secret passage in the cellar.
It's... There's something wrong with him.
It's like, you know, in the past, I've always been able to follow his thoughts.
And now everything just feels disconnected.
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
No. No, it's more like he's wounded.
If anything, he feels more dangerous.
VOLDEMORT IN PARSELTONGUE:
- Man 1: They're here!
- Man 2: Search everywhere!
MAN 1: Look down by the stables! You two, come with me!
Man 3: Any sign?
Man 4: Potter!
OLD MAN: In here, Potter.
Did you get a look at him?
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.
Harry?
I can see you in this.
You bloody fools. What were you thinking coming here?
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.
It's you who I've been seeing in here.
You're the one who sent Dobby.
Where have you left him?
He's dead.
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
Who gave that to you? The mirror?
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.
- Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.
Albus told me.
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it...
...but ask yourself, where would you be if I didn't?
Do you hear from the others much? From the Order?
The Order's finished.
You-Know-Who's won.
Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Did he now?
Nice job? Easy?
We've been hunting Horcruxes.
We think the last one's inside the castle, but we'll need help getting in.
That's not a job my brother's given you. It's a suicide mission.
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home. Live a little longer.
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?
What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you?
In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name?
Did he ever mention hers?
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.
A boy who goes chasing
Horcruxes on the word of a man...
...who wouldn't even tell him where to start. You're lying!
Not just to me, that doesn't matter. To yourself as well.
That's what a fool does.
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter.
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.
I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother.
I don't care that you've given up.
I trusted the man I knew.
And we need to get into the castle tonight.
You know what to do.
Where have you sent her?
You'll see soon enough.
That's your sister, Ariana, isn't it?
She died very young, didn't she?
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter...
...on his journey to find power...
...including Ariana.
And she was devoted to him.
He gave her everything...
...but time.
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
He did save our lives twice.
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.
(WHISPERS) That doesn't seem like someone who's given up.
She's coming back.
Who's that with her?
Neville.
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.
Hey, Ab, we've got a couple more coming through.
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.
That's because it never existed till now.
The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year.
This is the only way in or out now.
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.
How bad is Snape as headmaster?
Hardly ever see him. It's the
Carrows you need to watch out for.
Carrows?
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.
They like punishment, the Carrows.
They did that to you? Why?
NEVILLE: Today's Dark Arts lessons had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse.
On first-years.
I refused.
Hogwarts has changed.
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope. Be a surprise if we can digest it.
Blimey.
- Harry!
- Yeah!
Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
Okay, let's not kill him before You-Know-Who...
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?
- We have a new weather.
- REPORT: Lightning has struck.
What's the plan, Harry?
Okay.
There's something we need to find.
Something hidden here in the castle. And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.
Right. What is it?
We don't know.
- NEVILLE: Where is it?
- We don't know that either.
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.
Um, it'll be small, easily concealed.
Anyone, any ideas?
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
- Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
- LUNA: Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
Hasn't anyone heard of it? It's quite famous.
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost, for centuries now.
There isn't a person alive today who's seen it.
Excuse me. Can someone tell me what a bloody diadem is?
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.
Harry.
Hi there.
Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.
What is it, Ginny?
Snape knows. He knows that
Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Many of you are surely wondering why
I have summoned you at this hour.
It's come to my attention that earlier this evening...
...Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
Now...
...should anyone...
...student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter...
...they will be punished...
...in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression.
Furthermore...
...any person found to have knowledge of these events...
...who fails to come forward...
...will be treated as...
...equally guilty.
Now then...
...if anyone here...
...has any knowledge of Mr.
Potter's movements this evening...
...I invite them to step forward...
...now.
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies...
...you still have a bit of a security problem, headmaster.
And I'm afraid it's quite extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood?
Tell them how it happened that night.
Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him.
Tell them.
Coward!
VOLDEMORT: Harry.
Potter?
VOLDEMORT: I know that many of you will want to fight.
Some of you may even think that to fight is wise.
But this is folly.
Give me Harry Potter.
Do this and none shall be harmed.
Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.
Give me Harry Potter...
...and you will be rewarded.
You have one hour.
PANSY: What are you waiting for?
Someone grab him.
FILCH: Students out of bed.
Students out of bed!
Students in the corridor!
They are supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot.
Oh.
Sorry, ma'am.
As it happens, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune.
If you would, I would like you, please...
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the hall.
Exactly where is it I'll be leading them to, ma'am?
The dungeons would do.
FILCH: Right. Come on. Come on.
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?
Time, professor. As much as you can get me.
Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle.
Potter.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too, professor.
Hold the fort, Neville.
GIRL: Hurry up, come on!
Harry. Hermione and I have been thinking.
It doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.
So we were thinking...
Ron was thinking. It was
Ron's idea. It's brilliant.
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary with a basilisk fang, right?
Me and Hermione know where we might find one.
Okay.
Okay, but take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.
Gotta start somewhere.
LUNA: Harry. Harry!
Let me get this straight. You're giving us permission to do this?
That is correct, Longbottom.
To blow it up? Boom?
Boom!
Wicked. But how on earth are we gonna do that?
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?
As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.
I can bring it down.
That's the spirit. Now away you go.
You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.
Well, that doesn't mean we can't delay him.
And his name is Voldemort,
Filius. You might as well use it.
He's going to try to kill you either way.
Piertotum Locomotor.
Hogwarts is threatened.
Man the boundaries. Protect us. Do your duty to our school.
I've always wanted to use that spell.
Protego Maxima. Fianto
Duri. Repello lnimicum.
Protego Maxima.
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.
You won't find anything where you're going. You're wasting time.
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.
- Later.
- Harry Potter!
You listen to me right now!
Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenolaw's diadem?
"There's not a person alive who's seen it." it's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead.
It's very impressive, isn't it?
If you're to find her, you'll find her down there.
- Aren't you coming?
- LUNA: No.
I think it's best if you two talk alone.
She's very shy.
You're the Grey Lady...
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.
I do not answer to that name.
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's
Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.
Rowena's daughter.
Are you a friend of Luna's?
Yes.
And she thought you might be able to help me.
You seek my mother's diadem.
Yes.
That's right.
Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others.
But she was wrong. I cannot help you.
Wait. Please.
I want to destroy it.
VOLDEMORT: They never learn.
Such a pity.
But, my Lord...
...shouldn't we wait for...?
My Lord.
Begin.
That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena?
You want it destroyed.
Another swore to destroy it many years ago...
...a strange boy with a strange name.
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.
He's lied to many people.
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!
He defiled it with dark magic!
I can destroy it once and for all.
But only if you tell me where he hid it.
You do know where he hid it, don't you, Helena?
You just have to tell me.
Please.
Strange.
You remind me of him a bit.
It's here...
...in the castle, in the place where everything is hidden.
If you have to ask...
...you will never know.
If you know, you need only ask.
Thank you.
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Dean, on second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall...
...we might need one or two more wands this side.
It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success...
...not the number of followers.
Who said that?
Me.
You okay, Freddie?
Yeah.
Me too.
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?
No, of course not.
Yeah?
You and whose army?
- You do it.
- I can't.
Yes, you can.
GINNY: Neville!
That went well.
Get inside! This way, everyone. Take cover!
Stupefy!
Get your coat on!
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire. You haven't seen Luna, have you?
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!
I think it's about time I told her since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.
I know.
Bloody hell. We'll never find it on this.
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.
He just vanished. Just now. I saw it.
Maybe he's gone to the
Room of Requirement.
It doesn't show up on the map, does it? You said that last year.
That's right. I... I did.
Let's go.
Brilliant.
DRACO: Come on!
DRACO: Well, well.
What brings you here, Potter?
I could ask you the same.
You have something of mine.
I'd like it back.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- DRACO: It's my mother's.
It's powerful, but it's not the same.
Doesn't quite understand me.
Know what I mean?
Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix.
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.
Come on, Draco. Don't be a prat. Do him.
DRACO: Easy.
Expelliarmus.
Avada Kedavra!
Stupefy!
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!
Got it.
Run!
Run!
Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!
Come on!
This way!
We can't leave them.
He's joking, right?
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you.
Harry!
My Lord?
Avada Kedavra!
Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe.
It's the snake.
She's the last one. It's the last Horcrux.
Look inside him, Harry.
Find out where he is. If we find him, we can find the snake.
Then we can end this.
LUCIUS: My Lord?
Might it be less, uh...
Might it not be more prudent to call off this attack...
...and simply seek the boy yourself?
VOLDEMORT: I do not need to seek the boy.
Before the night is out, he will come to me. Do you understand?
Look at me.
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?
I don't know.
Go and find Severus.
Bring him to me.
I know where he is.
OLIVER: Come on!
BOY: Crucio!
No!
SNAPE: You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord...
...in the last few hours alone.
VOLDEMORT: No.
No, I am extraordinary...
...but the wand resists me.
SNAPE: There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.
Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you. I am sure of it.
It answers to you...
...and you only.
Does it?
My Lord?
The wand, does it truly answer to me?
You're a clever man, Severus.
Surely you must know.
Where does its true loyalty lie?
With you...
...of course, my Lord.
VOLDEMORT: The Elder Wand...
...cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master.
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus...
...but only I can live forever.
My Lord...
Nagini, kill.
Take them.
Take them.
Please.
Give me something.
Quickly. A flask, anything.
Take them to the Pensieve.
Look at me.
You have your mother's eyes.
VOLDEMORT: You have fought valiantly...
...but in vain.
I do not wish this.
Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste.
I therefore command my forces to retreat.
In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity.
Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.
On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you...
...rather than face me yourself.
There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden
Forest and confront your fate.
If you do not do this...
...I shall kill every last man, woman and child...
...who tries to conceal you from me.
Where is everybody?
Harry.
SPROUT: Oh, come on.
What's the matter with you?
TRELAWNEY: Oh, she's passed.
There, she's gone.
PETUNIA: Freak!
Come here.
I'm gonna tell Mummy. You're a freak.
You're a freak, Lily!
Come here.
SNAPE: She's jealous because she's ordinary and you're special.
LILY: That's mean, Severus.
SORTING HAT: Gryffindor!
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.
SNAPE: Just like your father. Lazy. Arrogant.
Don't say a word against my father.
TRELAWNEY: Blood shall be spilt...
...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
VOLDEMORT: Severus.
SNAPE: No. Don't kill me.
DUMBLEDORE: The prophecy did not refer to a woman.
It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.
He intends to hunt them down now, to kill them.
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.
DUMBLEDORE: What will you give me in exchange, Severus?
Anything.
LILY: Harry. Harry, you are so loved. So loved.
Harry, Mama loves you.
Dada loves you.
Harry, be safe.
Be strong.
VOLDEMORT: Avada Kedavra!
SNAPE: You said you would keep her safe.
DUMBLEDORE: Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.
Rather like you.
The boy survives.
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.
The Dark Lord will return.
And when he does, the boy will be in terrible danger.
He has her eyes.
If you truly loved her...
No one can know.
DUMBLEDORE: That I should never reveal the best of you, Severus?
SNAPE: Your word.
DUMBLEDORE: When you risk your life every day to protect the boy?
SNAPE: He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father...
...and he seems to relish his fame.
Don't say a word against my father.
SNAPE: James Potter?
Lazy, arrogant.
My father was a great man.
Your father was a swine!
SNAPE: Drink the rest.
It will contain the curse to your hand for the time being.
It will spread, Albus.
DUMBLEDORE: How long?
SNAPE: Maybe a year.
Don't ignore me, Severus.
DRACO: Harmonia Nectere Passus.
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.
But should he fail, one should presume the Dark Lord...
...will turn to you.
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.
It is the only way.
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.
SNAPE: Avada Kedavra.
DUMBLEDORE: There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something.
But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
Must be told what?
DUMBLEDORE: On the night Lord Voldemort...
...went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...
...and Lily Potter cast herself between them...
...the curse rebounded.
When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul...
...latched itself onto the only living thing it could find:
Harry himself.
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes.
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind.
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
So when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes. Yes.
He must die.
You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment.
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy?
SNAPE: Expecto Patronum.
Lily.
After all this time?
Always.
So when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes. He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.
That is essential.
Where've you been?
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.
Are you mad? No.
You can't give yourself up to him.
What is it, Harry?
What is it you know?
There's a reason I can hear them...
...the Horcruxes.
I think I've known for a while.
And I think you have too.
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.
Kill the snake and then it's just him.
I'm ready to die.
The Resurrection Stone.
You've been so brave, sweetheart.
Why are you here?
All of you?
We never left.
Does it...?
Does it hurt'?
Dying?
Quicker than falling asleep.
You're nearly there, son.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted any of you to die for me.
And, Remus, your son...
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for.
One day, he'll understand.
You'll stay with me?
Until the end.
And he won't be able to see you?
SIRIUS: No.
We're here, you see.
Stay close to me.
Always.
DEATH EATER: No sign of him, my Lord.
VOLDEMORT: I thought he would come.
Harry? No! What are you doing here?
Quiet!
Harry Potter.
The Boy Who Lived.
Come to die.
Avada Kedavra!
DUMBLEDORE: You can't help. Harry...
...you wonderful boy.
You brave, brave man.
Let us walk.
Professor, what is that?
Something beyond either of our help.
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.
And exactly where are we?
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?
Well...
...it looks like King's Cross station.
Only cleaner.
And without all the trains.
King's Cross, is that right?
This is, as they say, your party.
I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...
...have been connected by something other than fate...
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.
So it's true then, sir?
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?
Did.
It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
You were the Horcrux he never meant to make, Harry.
I have to go back, haven't I?
Oh. That's up to you.
I have a choice?
Oh, yes.
We're in King's Cross, you say?
I think, if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.
And where would it take me?
On.
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.
True.
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.
And I've nothing to kill it with.
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.
I've always prized myself on my ability to turn a phrase.
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...
...our most inexhaustible source of magic...
...capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it.
But I would, in this case, amend my original statement to this:
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who deserve it.
Do not pity the dead, Harry.
Pity the living.
And, above all, all those who live without love.
Professor, my mother's
Patronus was a doe, wasn't it?
That's the same as Professor Snape's.
It's curious, don't you think?
Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all.
I'll be going now, Harry.
Professor?
Is this all real?
Or is it just happening inside my head?
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.
Why should that mean that it's not real?
Professor? What should I do?
Professor?
BELLATRIX: My Lord?
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?
I don't need your help.
BELLATRIX: No. Come.
The boy.
Is he dead?
Is he alive?
Draco, is he alive?
Dead.
GINNY: Who is that Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is it?
VOLDEMORT: Harry Potter...
...is dead.
No! No!
VOLDEMORT: Silence.
Stupid girl.
Harry Potter is dead.
From this day forth, you put your faith...
...in me.
Harry Potter is dead!
And now is the time to declare yourself.
Come forward and join us.
Or die.
LUCIUS: Draco.
Draco.
NARCISSA: Draco...
...Come.
VOLDEMORT: Ah. Well done, Draco.
Well done.
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.
And who might you be, young man?
Neville Longbottom.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.
I'd like to say something.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.
People die every day.
Friends, family.
Yeah.
We lost Harry tonight.
But he's still with us, in here.
So's Fred...
...and Remus.
Tonks.
All of them.
They didn't die in vain.
But you will.
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us. This is not over!
Confringo!
BELLATRIX: No! No, come back!
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!
Come back!
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.
- You'll need this.
- ARTHUR: Neville!
Not my daughter, you bitch.
You were right...
...when you told Snape that wand was failing you.
It will always fail you.
VOLDEMORT: I killed Snape.
But what if the wand never belonged to Snape?
What if its allegiance was always to someone else?
Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it.
Together.
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.
I couldn't find my wand. I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.
It was lost in the folds of my gowns.
I managed to find it and I dispatched a few of them...
HAGRID: Harry.
Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?
It answered to somebody else.
When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his.
But the thing is, the wand never belonged to Snape.
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the astronomy tower.
From that moment on, the wand answered to him.
Until...
...the other night when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.
So that means... it's mine.
What should we do with it?
We?
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world.
With that, we'd be invincible.
Together.
FATHER: Look after each other.
- Bag?
- Yeah.
Jumper?
I'll miss you.
Here they come.
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?
Albus Severus Potter...
...you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts.
One of them was a Slytherin...
...and he was the bravest man I've ever known.
But just say that I am.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful young wizard.
But, listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor.
The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
- Really?
- Really.
- GIRL: Bye, Mum.
- CONDUCTOR: All aboard.
Ready?
Ready.
BOY: Come on, Jay, get a move on.
JAMES: Come on.

<u><b>Extracted from DVD by

My talons are upon you!
Your days of terrorizing the owl kingdoms are over!
Not so fast! You're no match for my army of Evil Ones.
Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.
- But I am Lyze of Kiel.
- Soren, but...
And I have assembled my own army, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!
But, Soren...
We've sworn an oath to make strong the weak, mend the broken, and vanquish evil!
Eglantine, what is it?
Soren, this time you said
I would be Lyze of Kiel.
Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?
Well, I hope you're not lying...
...to Metal Beak!
Got you!
My beak. Da.
Okay. Enough, young owlets.
Time for bed.
Yes, please.
Enough stories about the Guardians.
Now, Kludd, stories are part of our culture and our history.
We learn from them.
Even after the 7ooth time we hear them?
Yes, even then. Unless, son, you already know all there is of our history.
I know the Guardians win.
- Soren, iùs just a story.
- It is not!
Here we go again.
I mean, Da, have you ever seen a Guardian?
Kludd, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't real.
Iùs like feeling something with your gizzard.
You know, through our gizzards...
...the voices of the ages whisper to us and tell us whaùs right.
Now, thaùs enough for one night, dear.
Tomorrow's a big day.
Iùs first branching.
- Now, off to bed.
- Now, come along, children.
I've made the moss and down extra soft for you, Eglantine.
Soren, do you really think
Metal Beak is real?
You remember, it was the Battle of the Ice claws.
The Guardians were outnumbered.
Things looked dark.
But then Lyze of Kiel...
...struck down the leader of the evil owls.
The Guardians were victorious.
The owl kingdoms were free once more.
And then they returned home, to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.
Wow.
But some say the evil king still lives...
...and wears a metal mask to hide his missing beak.
Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.
But this is my favorite part.
I know. We've heard it a thousand times.
You have a soft head, Soren.
I think Da has filled it with stories and dreams.
There's nothing wrong with dreams.
Thaùs the difference between us.
I have mine when I'm asleep.
Now would you just go to sleep?
Soren...
...Da says our dreams are who we are.
- So as I was... Kludd, wait!
- No!
Look, Da!
I'm gonna be the best flier.
Thaùs because Tytos are best at everything.
Right, Da?
You have strength, Kludd. But owls make the best hunters for one reason alone.
Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.
By the time I have my claws out...
The mice will have run away. And you and your hatchlings will go hungry.
Da!
I'm ready.
Young Guardian...
...I don't think your first branching lesson will be that dangerous.
Now, don't worry how much noise you make in the beginning.
You just need to stretch your...
...wings.
Well done.
Beginner's luck.
You know, Kludd, it helps when
I picture where I'm gonna land.
Come on, I'll race you!
Okay. Go!
Yeah, you had a head start.
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.
Boys. No more fighting.
- Leùs get the boys inside. Iùs time to go.
- Can we come with you on the hunt?
Not tonight. But when the time comes, at least you'll have the helmet for it.
- Nice helmet.
- Get off!
Boys.
Do it again. Say it again.
Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.
Do you worry for him?
I worry for both of them.
Seems like yesterday they were hatchlings...
...and now, well, you know, they'll soon be grown and leaving the hollow.
I just want them to be prepared.
They'll be fine.
Come on.
Eglantine, are you all right?
Oh, iùs all right, dear.
If it wants to come out, let it.
Thaùs it, dear. Thaùs it. Keep going.
Oh, iùs going to be beautiful!
- There you go.
- Eg, hat is gross!
Quite an achievement.
- What is it?
- Iùs your first pellet.
First? You mean there'll be more?
Don't you recognize it, Eg?
It was the mouse you ate.
Its fur and bones, anyway.
Every owl yarps up pellets.
In fact, I think I might have your brothers' first pellets.
- No, no.
- Maybe you'd like to see them?
- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please.
- Oh, come on, dear.
Such a big night for this tree.
First branching, first pellet.
Excuse me.
Kludd, do you want to go out and try some more branching?
What? So you can go out there and show off again?
I don't think so.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just...
...I don't know, stay inside and play Battle of the Ice claws again.
Kludd? Could I just show you how?
Without you being so angry?
All right. Show me how.
Well, before I leap...
I picture myself standing on a great cliff with the Guardians, ready for battle.
We leap down, floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.
- The air's just carrying us as we...
- Thaùs enough!
Kludd, are you okay?
Oh, no.
We're on the ground.
We can't be here. Iùs... Iùs...
This is the worst place for an owl.
Yeah. No, no. Iùs weird down here.
No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.
You know, if we could just make it to that branch.
Then we could climb our way up.
Yeah, here, leùs see.
Shh! Quiet!
What was that?
Soren!
Kludd!
Kludd! Kludd!
Where are you taking us?
But our home's that way.
You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you.
- Whaùd you think, Jutt?
- The "I'll shut it for you" part?
No, not that. My evil stare.
Been working on it for weeks.
Oh. I missed it. Leùs see.
Lmpressive.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
You know, your evil stare reminds me a little of my "Intimidator."
Yeah?
I raise one eyebrow...
...tuck in my chin and...
- Who are you?
- Hey! No questions.
No "whos," no "whats," no "whys."
You'll see soon enough.
What do you think?
Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?
- Completely natural.
- Oh, thanks.
Let me go!
Kludd!
- Strong beak, that one.
- Yeah? Well, they'll put that to good use.
You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...
...and combine it with my raised-eyebrow look...
...I get this.
- What do you call that?
- "The Predator."
"The Predator"?
Iùs a bit silly, don't you think?
Hey, Jatt, look. Iùs Grimble.
Perfect. Hit him with the new look.
With or without raised eyebrow?
With raised eyebrow.
With raised eyebrow.
Greetings, Grimble.
Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.
Did you only get half an owl tonight,
Grimble?
No, Jatt. Iùs an elf owl.
They're very small, but hard workers.
Too old to carry a full-size one?
Yeah, hilarious.
Is there something wrong with your face, Jutt?
Huh? No!
You've upset him now.
Iùs a new look!
But you gotta work on your comebacks.
I'm Soren.
I'm Gylfie.
He said you were an elf owl.
From Kuneer. Thaùs in the desert.
Are you a Tyto?
Yeah, from Tyto Forest.
Who are these owls?
Do you have any idea where they're taking us?
Hey! Stop talking.
Quiet! Listen to the old man!
Kludd!
- Settle down.
- Silence!
- Kludd!
- Silence!
Your parents and families have abandoned you.
So from now, you'll be classified as orphans.
No, I'm not an orphan.
Horribly tragic, I know.
But by the mercy of Glaux...
...you've been rescued and brought here to St. Aegolius.
And, in time, you'll come to be grateful for the kindness shown to you.
You'll repay that kindness with labor.
Some of you will be pickers.
No, I don't want to be a picker!
- Some will be soldiers.
- Gylfie, stay with me.
In your ways, all will serve the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.
- Let us go!
- Silence.
We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.
- Who are the Pure Ones?
- Silence!
I am Nyra,
Ablah General of St. Aegolius...
...and mate to the Lord High Tyto.
I know right now you miss your families...
...but soon enough you will understand the Pure Ones are your new family.
The Pure Ones are not our family.
Let us go!
She's right. Let us go!
Whaùs this?
Tyto, don't waste your time.
Don't soil your feathers.
You leave her be.
Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.
You and your patch of felt will stay together, then.
As pickers.
Leùs go. Hurry up.
Perhaps when you remember your nobility,
Tyto, we can make a soldier of you.
- Come on.
- What about my brother?
- Oh? Where's he?
- Kludd!
Owlet, that one says you're his brother.
Would you like to join him?
I didn't think so.
Kludd?
Here we go. Move along. Move it along.
- Kludd!
- Now, there's a soldier.
Thank you.
Soren, you know, you don't have to be here with me. You should be with your brother.
No, Gylfie. I could never be with those Tytos.
I don't know why Kludd would even think...
Hey! Whaùs wrong with him?
He looks like he's been moon...
All right, you owlets, move it in, move it in. Come on!
Do exactly as he says or you'll never see the light of dawn.
- Nice one, Jutt.
- Felt a little forced.
- It was awesome.
- Thank you, Jatt.
So tonight, we want you to...
- What was it again, Jatt?
- To rest.
To rest.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon.
And sleep.
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.
I think they're trying to moon blink us.
Moon blink us?
Sometimes in the desert, owls would get exhausted and collapse under it.
When they woke up, they just weren't the same.
As if they'd forgotten who they were.
Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.
I know these stars.
I could get us away from here...
...but the only way out is to fly and we can't.
Not yet, we can't.
But we're gonna learn how.
Whenever they're not watching...
...every chance we get, we're gonna stretch out our wings...
Do you really think that we can make it, Soren?
Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.
I'm cold.
Together.
All right, my lovely little owlets.
Thaùs enough beauty rest.
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.
Iùs another glorious day...
- Oh, no.
- Soren.
Thaùs right. Here we go.
Move it along.
Soren.
Where are we going now?
Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.
Keep moving.
Lots of pellet picking ahead.
You may have noticed that we don't like dawdling.
Anything with W's in it, we don't trust.
Come on.
Shuffle those talons.
The sooner you get there, the sooner we start.
The sooner you start, the sooner we finish. Leùs go!
Keep moving, no dawdling.
And welcome to the Pelletorium.
Iùs a great place for the rest of your lives.
You mustn't feel sorry for them down there.
As lower species, they are fortunate to serve a higher cause.
As Tyto owls, their natural superiors...
...you too are part of that plan.
One that will soon bring order to all the owl kingdoms...
...when the Pure Ones will rule.
A new and noble era will dawn.
Now, prove your greatness...
...and rise.
Higher!
Higher!
Leùs get this party started!
Leùs get picking!
Start picking up those pellets right now.
Thaùs right. Think of the joy. Pellets.
We love them.
Ugh. Other owls' pellets.
You know, maybe it would have been better if we had been moon blinked.
Oh, here we go.
Eureka.
Great job, number 857... Whatever.
All right, everyone, gather around.
- Hey, you with the blank expression.
Thaùs all of them.
Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.
Now this is the kind of pellet you're picking for.
Mouse fur, mouse bones, thaùs all standard.
But the secret rare ingredient in this one is what Mr. Mouse ate:
- A metal fleck.
- Metal fleck.
Now, I'm very perceptive.
- He is.
- I am.
- And I'm detecting you...
Nicely done.
...want to volunteer to take this fleck to where all the flecks belong.
You all watching? Hm?
Come on.
Soren.
Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.
Back to work.
What happened?
Listen, Gylfie, those birds are doing something terribly wrong.
We have to find Kludd and we have to get out of here.
And exactly what do you two think you're doing?
Eh?
Once we have amassed enough flecks...
...we will set a trap.
Then it is up to you to lure our enemy to their rightful place:
Into our claws.
And then the Western Kingdoms and the Tree, those will be mine.
You have my word.
What do you plan on doing with us?
Quiet!
What is this place?
Get inside.
Stop asking questions.
The Pure Ones won't be too happy if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.
No.
And they won't be too happy when they find out what I'm gonna do to you either.
I'm gonna teach you to fly.
Fly?
You can breathe now.
Yeah, iùs been getting worse here.
I told myself if any came who were smart, and brave enough to resist...
...l'd help them.
I guess you two'll have to do.
But aren't you a...?
A Pure One? No, I hate them.
Almost as much as I hate what they've turned me into.
My feathers weren't always stained with these colors.
When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom,
I fought back.
Now, they thought they could use that...
...so they took my family.
And they promised me if I followed orders, no harm would come to them.
And I've been doing their dirty work ever since.
Now, have you flown at all before?
Well, I have been branching.
You don't have the luxury of gliding down from a nest anymore.
We need to work on your power skills, starting with what you already know.
Show me what you can do.
Come on.
Hey, good, good.
Now, try and feel every muscle, every feather in each stroke.
And push!
Ow!
All right, you two, thaùs enough. Come on.
Back to practice.
Now, the best of you...
...the fittest and the most brilliant...
...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.
So leùs see how much you've improved...
...as fliers, as fighters.
Well?
Well done. You've shown exceptional obedience and discipline.
My husband will be most pleased by your progress.
Hm. Tell me, does your brother have similar potential as a flier?
Who, Soren?
No. He fell out of the tree when he was still a hatchling. He's lame.
Oh, soldier, you mustn't confuse praise for license.
Never lie to me.
For the Lord High Tyto, we need as many strong fliers as we can find.
Come, leùs tell your brother what rewards there are...
...for those who recognize their true family.
No, more flap, deeper flap.
The still air has no shape to use.
You gotta compensate with your downstroke.
Make your wing tips almost meet, if you can, without stalling.
I can't curl my feathers enough, Grimble.
My wings are too short.
Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's wings were short.
And that didn't stop him.
And you're gonna need to fly a long way to get to the Guardians.
- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole?
- Yeah.
But how will we know where to go?
Well, you have to get to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...yeah, where the Tree is shrouded in ancient mists...
"Which keep it hidden from all but the strong of purpose and the true of heart."
Yeah, exactly.
I'd come with you...
...but I still hold out the hope of freeing my family.
Really?
- Kludd.
- Go!
Kludd, come with us!
Go, now!
Get them!
- Kludd!
- Your little owlets won't get away.
Soren! What do we do?
Soren, we have to go!
Wait. Kludd! Come on!
Now's our chance!
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
This is your chance to go home!
I am.
I am home.
- Eh?
- No.
Would you wound your queen, Grimble?
You're not my queen!
We need to jump now, Soren!
- Now! Aah!
Aah!
Come on, Gylfie! Flap!
Flap your wings!
No! Follow the owlets!
Follow the owlets!
Go, you fools!
Go! Go tell the Guardians!
Look! There! I see a way!
Where? Aah!
Gylfie, come on, follow me!
Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!
I can't, Soren, I just can't.
I have to rest.
No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!
Hey, wait. I think they're gone.
What? Are you sure?
I think so.
Hey, you know what?
What?
We're flying.
Does it feel the way you thought it would?
No.
It feels much better.
What are we gonna do now, Soren?
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Grimble's death was unfortunate.
But you...
You had a chance to follow your brother, yet you didn't.
I'm starting to think that you might actually deserve to stay.
To be one of us.
Oh, I want that.
We offer power and purpose.
What can you offer us?
What can you offer me?
I...
- I have a sister.
- Go on.
She's young, but she's got spirit...
...and will grow into a strong Tyto.
Perhaps you could bring her to me.
Here the young ones are our future.
Are you hungry?
Why?
Watch this.
Hey! Oh, nice hunting.
You should be really proud of yourself...
...catching a moth thaùs already caught.
Wait. You hadn't caught it.
Mm! I was very close.
One might even say I was this close:
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
- Perfect.
Ahem.
An ambush.
Well, I bet you didn't count on this.
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your moth.
- It wasn't his moth.
Yes, it was.
We were just looking for a place to hide and rest.
- In which order?
What do you mean?
Did you need to hide first or rest first?
What difference does it make?
Huge! If you need to hide first,
I'd say you were in big trouble.
But if resting was on your mind,
I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.
We're on our way to the Sea of Hoolemere.
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Really?
Two little owlets like you will never reach the sea.
There are some really scary beasts out that way.
Scary beasts?
If the hawks don't make a quick lunch of you, then the buzzards will.
And if the buzzards don't get you...
...the dingoes wait in the trees and as you fly by they...
Our request remains the same, owl.
Do you have a place to rest?
My frienÔs hurt.
Name's Digger.
The hollow's this way.
Going to the sea, huh?
Yeah.
You know what they call owls who fly towards the sea?
- Uh, no.
- Lost.
Iùs hilarious. I have another one for you.
What do you call an owl...?
Twilight! We've got company!
Put me down this instant! I mean it!
This is highly disrespectful!
Dinner is served.
And she will not stop talking.
Mrs. P! Iùs me, Soren!
Soren!
Oh, it can't be.
Every day, I've been looking for you and Kludd, and then this.
To be snatched up by this monstrosity.
Monstro...? The audacity!
Digger, who are these tiny owls and why are they talking to dinner?
My name is not "dinner."
Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?
Wait. She is not dinner.
She's my nursemaid.
I just hate being driven to hiss.
So unladylike.
Indeed.
Mrs. P, these are my new friends.
This is Gylfie and Digger.
And Twilight, is it?
Charmed to meet you, dinner.
Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.
These two are going to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...to find the Guardians.
- Really?
What?
No, Soren, we need to get you home.
Your parents are so worried.
No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.
Kludd and I were kidnapped.
- Mercy!
- He's still held captive.
I have to find the Guardians.
They're the only ones that can save him.
An adventure afoot!
Danger. Intrigue.
The stuff of songs.
Oh, no. Not the lute.
But such things have no effect on me...
...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.
If you will...
Though his nursemaid tels him no
The boy will not be tamed
He flies off into danger
To be battered, bruised and maimed
Just because iùs sung doesn't make it a song.
That poem just came to me, if you can believe it.
- I think they can believe it.
- Iùs a gift.
Right, well, sounds like we've got a long journey, so...
Mrs. P?
Look, you know iùs what
Da would want.
Thaùs just why I'm coming with you.
What? No! Please do not leave us here.
Yes, you're the first new souls we've seen in eight moons.
If I have to hear any more of his ridiculous owl jokes...
- They're a hoot!
- They are not.
Well, if I have to hear him play one more quote-unquote "song"...
...l'm gonna tear my gizzard out!
How dare you?!
Leùs get out.
Please. Please don't go!
Do you even know the way to the Sea of Hoolemere?
- Twilight knows the way.
- Of course I know the way.
We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.
- Iùs "Hoolemere."
- Hoolemere.
Hey, you know, Mrs. P, you might be the first snake ever to fly.
You know, I think I am.
And I quite like it too.
Oh, my!
Shove it.
- My lord.
Hm?
Our work at St. Aegolius is very nearly done.
The last of the flecks are on their way.
And I've brought you an offering with beating hearts.
Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.
One in particular shows exceptional promise.
I'll be the judge of that.
You. Soldier.
Step forward.
Yes, you're right to be afraid in my presence.
What is your name?
- Kludd.
Speak up.
Ahem. Kludd! My name is Kludd.
There. Thaùs better.
Remember, weakness is for the lower species...
...never for us.
Do you know why, Kludd?
Because we are Tytos.
Oh, I got another one.
- Knock, knock.
Please don't respond.
Who's there?
Don't encourage him.
Owls.
Owls who?
Here it comes.
Ha, thaùs right. Owls whoo!
I told you.
Because owls whoo. Funny.
Absolutely pathetic.
Iùs a very complex one, but iùs...
As the night falls, so do we
we fall asleep
we fall asleep
We continue to fall asleep
we fall asleep
For dreams, they come on highly
Shh! Shh!
We are now asleep
we are now asleep
You know,
I think that crow is following us.
Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.
Know what an owl says when he's pecked by a crow?
Really, Digger, must you?
Ow!
- Thaùs right, "Ow"!
Hey! Get out of here!
Oh, that is it.
Twilight! Your lute!
Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.
- Oh, wait. Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!
Mrs. P!
Come on!
Mrs. P! I'm coming!
Soren, look!
Help!
They're too fast.
I'll get you closer.
We're going to lock talons!
What?
- Trust me! I know what I'm doing!
Yeah, but have you done this before?
No, but I've always wanted to try it!
Hold on!
Mrs. P!
Get out of here! Begone!
Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?
Quite a ride.
Leùs do that again.
Owl, you surely can fly.
Thank you, Twilight.
Well, here we are.
The Sea of Hoolemere.
Iùs just so big.
Yes, iùs a right big puddle there.
I don't know.
You really think the Guardians are out there?
They have to be.
The band!
- Finally.
- Who's there?
Your arrival 'twas foretold.
'Twas foretold trespassers would land on my shore.
Look, we mean you no harm.
Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.
- We've flown a long way.
- Also foretold.
- And we're very tired.
- Foretold!
I know all.
Now, state your desire, owl.
- Well...
- Wait.
If you really know all, then how come you don't know that?
Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be one who doubts.
Is anyone else having trouble with this?
Yes, I kind of am.
Da said, "guided by the spines of the echidna."
Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!
I am the echidna.
And it was foretold you would need some help getting here.
Well, then, I should tell you, we seek the Guardians.
He should already know that.
I do, doubter. Go on.
Da said your spines can guide us.
And they will.
Now, to reach the Tree, keep between the Whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.
Never go outside those stars.
Now, go! All of you.
'Twas foretold that the band would hesitate.
But that in time would become a family.
And a family needs all of its members to play their parts.
The warrior.
Poet warrior, please. Thank you.
Fine, strong and noble.
The tracker, sturdy and faithful.
The navigator, who doubts.
The leader, whose gizzard is strong.
And finally, of course, the heart.
Wait. Are you a snake?
Yes, I am.
You've all come this far, each protecting the other.
So go. Look to the sky, and fly.
All right. Leùs go.
Remember, when your wings are weak...
...your spirits done...
...and you've flown as far as you can...
...you're halfway there!
What did he say?
We're halfway there! Oh, yeah.
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.
We're lost!
I can't find my bearings.
We have to find the island!
We're in the mist.
The Tree must be on the other side.
I can feel it in my gizzard!
Your gizzard?
Does anyone else have any more solid information about how much further it is?
Digger, why are you flying like that?
Like what? You know how I fly.
Iùs not that!
Digger! Your wings!
I think...
Goodbye.
- Digger.
- Digger!
Aah! Digger!
Digger? Digger.
Oh, no. No.
Can you fly with me?
There are...
There are five of us.
Yes. We know.
Can you see whaùs happening?
Out of my way, I can't see.
I can't hear a thing.
Shh!
I wanna see!
I'm concerned about this fleck material of which they speak.
It could be a weapon.
Could be a new shield or armor.
Having examined them, Your Majesty...
...they do show signs of the trials they described.
It beggars belief to think that these brave owlets would fly here by themselves...
...to spin a fairy tale.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?
Oh, good Glaux.
Boron, Your Majesty, if I understand this correctly...
...Metal Beak is not a myth...
...he's building a slave army of moon-blinked owlets...
...and is planning to conquer the world with magical pellet debris.
Without intending any disrespect...
...and particularly to my little friends, who have been through so much...
...such a story simply stretches plausibility too far.
Does that notion strike Ezylryb as amusing?
What cheek!
Whaùs amusing to me is that you would cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.
Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb wishes us to race back to war.
No, no.
Perhaps he'd write a poem about it from his hollow, while the rest of us...
Well, while the rest of us had our talons deformed too.
But I say caution...
...when the losses could be so many.
I would never counsel rushing blindly into war...
...but for a cause such as the one the boy described...
...for a violation of peace so blatant, so powerful...
...of course I'd fight!
What other course to take?
And if you think I'm a coward, or I'd simply urge others on, I'll fight you right now.
Order.
- Boron, you can judge the winner.
Mildly, owls.
We're trying to seek the truth.
The truth?
I told you the truth.
The Pure Ones exist.
They've kidnapped me and dozens of owlets from our hollows.
They want to enslave us all and rule our world without pity.
Yes, the only proof I have are my words.
But words were the only proof I ever had that you were real.
And still, I believed.
And you would argue with that?
I will not argue with it.
Your Majesty, my search and rescue chaw...
...is scheduled to leave on a routine survey during the next full moon.
No.
- Perhaps we could...
You shall leave immediately.
Take your best owls with you, Allomere.
And be thorough.
Wow.
Soren, we did it.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.
I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.
Oh, to be a young owl with a taste for adventure...
...arriving to the Tree for the first time.
Well done to hold your own in there.
Some more nice strong gizzards.
The Tree always needs them.
He is one strange owl.
I think he might be missing a few talons.
And a good bath.
Gross old owl.
You'll want to stay out of his chaw.
- Chaw?
- I'll tell you on the way to dinner.
You're already late.
Look out!
Now, Matron's instructed me to give you lot a rundown on the way we do things here.
During your basic training...
Wait, wait, wait. Basic training?
You don't just become a Guardian overnight. It takes years. Years.
- Hello.
Only our absolute best...
...are chosen to be...
- Wait. Who are you?
Are you going to keep interrupting me?
Now, if, however unlikely, you do have talent...
...you'll be tapped, or selected, for a specialized chaw, or squadron.
There's navigation, healing, search and rescue...
...blacksmithing, weather interpretation, colliering.
I expect to be placed in the navigation chaw myself.
Name's Otulissa, by the way.
I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.
I believe your friends are in there.
Digger! Hi!
How's the food, Digger?
He said "good," but he thinks iùll go better with a little music.
- What?
- And this looks like a decent crowd.
He's actually pretty good, you know.
Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.
Here at the Great Tree...
...every owl trains in different skills we call "chaws."
You'll study tracking...
...navigating, combat.
But maybe you're a blacksmith.
Here I come, here I come.
Digger!
Ow! Hey! Hold it!
Hang on, hang on. Ow!
Fire, boy. Iùs the lifeblood of the Tree.
There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?
Owls.
You must be joking.
Preposterous!
Come back here! I wasn't ready.
Feel the air!
Follow me.
My soldiers, my sons...
...many of you have heard of me in late-night whisperings...
...but I assure you, I am not a myth.
I am real.
And I stand before you with one simple truth:
The strong shall rule the weak.
Long ago, I was viciously attacked by the coward Lyze of Kiel...
...for defending that truth.
Now I wear this mask to conceal my scars.
But the metal is strong.
It is a symbol of the Pure Ones' strength and resolve.
It is time to set a fire that will consume the owl kingdoms...
...and take back what is rightfully ours!
Because we are Tytos!
We are Pure Ones!
And I am Metal Beak!
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
- Kludd?
- Metal Beak.
- Kludd.
- Metal Beak.
I miss Ma and Da.
I'm scared.
Don't be. You're with me now.
Eglantine, this is our home.
They really appreciate us here.
Kludd, please, could we just go find Soren?
Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.
Soren's weak. We're Tytos.
Pure Ones.
Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone what you're doing.
I just wanna go home.
All right, Eg.
So we could go? When?
Tomorrow.
But first, tonight...
...just sleep.
Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?
Yeah. Iùs the Battle of the Ice claws.
You know, this is my da's favorite story.
He used to tell it to us all the time.
Well, your da had good taste in authors.
You enjoying it?
Honestly, iùs not at all like my da told it.
No? How did he tell it?
Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.
You know? Like a great victory.
Well, in these chronicles, I mean, the battle just sounds like...
Like hell?
Come on, boy. Iùs almost first light.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I'm going to teach you how to really fly.
Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.
A scupper!
A swillage!
Baggywrinkles!
"Baggywrinkles"?
He could have at least given us a vocabulary list.
Now, this, this is the way to learn!
Oh, yes! This is exactly how
I want to learn.
In a monsoon!
The air currents warm in different ways, you see...
...from the sky to the ocean.
You can't fight them.
You have to feel them with your gizzards.
Aha! You see that one?
Soren, see it! Iùs there.
Go for it.
Thaùs it! Use your gizzard, boy.
Trust it!
Fly inside.
He sees it.
He sees it.
Hold it. Hold it.
Soren. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, careful, look out!
Soren!
Soren!
Owl, come to my hollow.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon...
...and sleep.
Lord Allomere, the boy was right.
Those owlets, we have to rescue them.
Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.
We don't know what we're up against.
Now, see those bats?
Follow them. I'll wager we'll discover the full extent of their plan.
Hold!
I'll take out that one, you get the two down on the platform.
What is this?
I don't even know what I did with it.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what I did. What did I do?
We flew a great way out here and it was nothing like that.
You've got no reason to worry, boy.
I confess, I guided you into that twister on purpose.
I wanted to test your gizzard.
You were exemplary.
"Exemplary"?
No, no, no.
I nearly had my wings ripped off.
You know, my head said to do one thing while my gizzard was saying to do another.
And you trusted your head.
Thaùs when you failed.
Wait. Is that your mark?
EzYLRYB:
What, this? Yes.
So you wrote the
Chronicle of the Battle of the ice Claws.
I think so.
Well, actually, yes. I did.
- Were you there?
- Yes.
What, as a scribe?
Well, no. As a soldier.
As the, I guess you could say, leader of all the soldiers.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Um... Yes.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Yes. Don't wear it out.
But...
That old thing?
Thaùs only good for gathering coals now.
Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?
All the owls of the Tree know who I am.
But you're...
My days as Lyze are well behind me.
And that battle is a distant memory.
Except, funnily enough, for young owlets like you.
Why didn't you tell me?
What difference does it make what I call myself?
Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.
Yes, well, fancy it must be hard meeting your hero...
...and seeing that he's real and not a myth.
You're just not...
What did you expect?
Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor and battle claws, the moon rising behind him?
Well, this is what it looks like when you've actually fought in battle.
Iùs not glorious, iùs not beautiful.
And iùs not even heroic.
Iùs merely doing whaùs right.
And doing it again and again, even if someday, you look like this.
Something's wrong.
Downed owlets, downed owlets!
- Come fast!
Allomere is back!
Quickly.
Make way.
Some help here.
These owlets need attention.
Fetch it, quick.
- Mommy?
- Iùs okay.
Hey. Hey. What happened?
Lord Allomere rescued two owlets in the Beaks.
It looks like he's hurt.
I think he ran into some of your Pure Ones.
You know, I didn't really believe you before.
Oh, well, thaùs okay. You know,
I wouldn't have believed me either.
Soren! Soren, come fast, iùs Eglantine.
Eglantine?
Let me through! Let me pass!
Been moon blinked.
No.
Do you think you can help her?
We will do our best, Soren.
Eglantine.
Eglantine.
The battle was ferocious.
We were greatly outnumbered.
I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.
But the others...
Can you estimate the number of enslaved owlets, Allomere?
Scores, that I witnessed.
There may well be many more.
And you believe this is part of a larger plan.
It is certain.
Your Majesty, this is no time for half measures.
Hmm.
Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.
To arms.
To arms.
Not a bad fit.
Ezylryb! Lyze.
Yes to both.
Look, I have to go.
You have to take me with you.
Oh, absolutely.
An untrained youth like you could last a whole minute in a real battle.
Here.
Come along.
We could use the talon fodder.
I'd love to throw some bodies at the enemy.
Yeah, but I'm...
Or you could stay here...
...tend to your sister...
...and do some real good.
But what do I know?
I'm just a tired old screech.
Move.
Oh, Eglantine.
I'd trade places with you if I could.
I really would.
You know, I wish it was me lying there instead of you.
Oh, Soren.
Because then you could see this place for yourself, Eg.
You know, Da's stories, they're true.
They're all true.
You know, the Guardians, and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...
Iùs all true
Even Lyze of Kiel. I mean, he's real, Eg.
He's real.
Soren, you promised.
Eg?
You promised I could be Lyze on the next go.
- Oh, Eglantine.
- Oh, Eglantine.
Eglantine.
Soren? Mrs. P?
We're... We're not at home, are we?
We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.
Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.
No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...
Kludd was wrong. Da was right.
He was right all along, Eg.
No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.
He did this to me, Soren.
He's one of them.
He what?
No. No, Eg.
Look, you must be confused.
That can't be.
Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.
I wasn't rescued.
Kludd gave me to the owl who brought me here.
No, Eg, no. Thaùs impossible.
I mean, that would mean that Allomere would have to be a...
Be a traitor.
No, iùs a trap.
Allomere!
Allomere!
We'll follow the Whale's Fin.
Iùs how they would have gone.
I see something.
There.
We should check out that smoke.
Soren, look.
Oh, Allomere.
Is it different when you see the consequences of your betrayal?
- Must it be bats that bleed them?
- Of course.
They have no gizzards to be impaired by the power of the flecks.
Now, my love?
It would be cruel to make them wait any longer.
Finish them.
Well, we can't just leave them down there, writhing in pain.
- Can we?
- No, you don't understand.
When we were at St. Aggie's, we saw what those things can do.
They do something terrible to your gizzard. Isn't that right, Soren?
Soren?
Uh, we've got bats inbound.
Not to worry. I can down a hundred of those bloodsuckers.
Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?
Well, we won't find out sitting on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!
Wait! Just wait.
- Of course.
- Soren, what is it?
The flames. Thaùs it.
I think I see a way to free the Guardians.
No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.
Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.
Twilight, can you take care of the bats?
Friend, I'll give you as much time as I can.
But hurry. And be careful.
Come on!
Twilight, I think if we're going into battle together...
...you'll have to sing your best battle song ever.
- What?
- No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.
Give us your bravest, most inspiring battle song ever!
Brilliant idea, Digger!
Into battle we do fly
Yeah, thaùs it!
No matter if we're going to die
What? Is that supposed to be inspiring?
- Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!
- Oh.
A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot
Even if our wlngs are ripped clean off
No. No!
You told us you'd bring all the Guardians.
But they're not Guardians.
Soren.
They have no chance against the flecks.
Still, I don't think we can trust you anymore, Allomere.
No.
No, no, you promised me.
You promised me I would be
King of the Tree!
You should know, Allomere...
...there is only room for one king.
Hey!
Fly away!
Use your glizzard, boy!
Fly inside.
Soren!
No!
Oh, Soren.
Come on, Soren.
That was exemplary.
But we're not finished yet, boy.
Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo!
Come on.
I bet you didn't count on this.
Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!
Pure Ones, attack!
Crush them!
Before they can recover!
Guardians, we must uphold our oath.
To battle!
I need you to stay here with your friends...
...and guard these owlets.
- Huh?
Unh! Ha, ha!
Come on!
Kludd?
No.
Soren!
Kludd!
Hello, brother.
Hmm?
Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.
Once again, iùs come down to just you and me.
And now I can take my vengeance for this.
You should thank me.
It appears to be an improvement.
Your precious Guardians are finished, Soren.
The Pure Ones will triumph...
...and Tytos will take their rightful place as rulers of the owl kingdoms.
Oh, iùs gonna be glorious!
"Glorious"?
No, the Pure Ones are monsters.
You saw what they were doing.
They were moon blinking other owls and turning them into slaves.
You're just weak, Soren.
Still living in your dreams.
No, my dreams are what make me strong, Kludd.
- They led me to the Guardians.
- Ha-ha-ha.
A pity there won't be any Guardians left after today.
I don't understand.
How could you join the Pure Ones after what they did to us?
"What they did to us"?
They believe in me like no one else ever has.
Metal Beak says the strong will triumph...
...the broken are put out of their misery.
And honor...
...honor is just another word for weakness!
No, Kludd!
I know you don't really think that.
Then you don't know me at all.
Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!
Soren, I'm your brother.
Kludd, no!
Metal Beak.
Be done with it, then.
No!
I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.
Oh, you're not letting me?
Oh, what a pity to waste...
...such a strong, young and confident Tyto.
No, Soren!
Oh. You know this sad old owl.
He's my teacher. My hero.
Well, your hero can teach you one last lesson about Pure Ones' strength...
Don't move.
...by letting you watch him die.
Hmm.
Unh!
Ha, ha.
Pure Ones! Fall back!
To me!
Soren, you did what was right.
And you did it well.
It seems we will have to amend the Chronicles. Huh?
As it was in the old ages...
...so it was in the new.
The Guardians upheld their oath that night.
I foretold you so!
They made strong the weak and mended the broken.
And when the sun shone again that morning...
...all could see that they had vanquished the evil.
Soren! Soren!
- Oh, Eg.
- Ha, ha!
Are there any casualties?
- We're so proud of you.
- Ha, ha!
- Da, the stories...
- Ha, ha.
...they're real.
You made them real, Soren.
With the peace restored...
...it was a time for celebration...
...and recognition that our small band of owls...
...who fate and a storm had blown into the Tree...
...now stood before its king and queen as young Guardians.
Eady finally, with all their hearts...
...to take that ancient oath:
To mend those who are broken...
...to make strong the weak...
...and, without hesitation...
...vanquish the evil.
For as we know...
...Nyra escaped.
And Kludd?
Well, Kiudd was never found.
Should I stop?
What? Please, don't stop.
I don't wanna give anyone daymares.
Oh, come on.
There must be more, there must be.
Ha, ha. Listen to them, Soren.
They want more stories.
Well, come on, you lot.
Leùs not disappoint them.
Ah. There's a good storm brewing.
And if we're lucky, iùll be chock full of baggywrinkles.

The Extraordinary Adventures
Of Adele Blanc-Sec
Ferdinand Choupard is a minor character in our story.
Nonetheless he is, where this adventure begins, as he wandered home after an evening spent playing cards and sipping a marvelous
12-year-old malt whisky.
It was November 4th, 1911, at 1 o'clock in the morning.
The streets were empty with a chilly nip in the air.
Yet, at the same time, exactly 953 meters from there, the city was jumping.
On stage, Nicole Gambert, or Nini-les-Gambettes, kicked up a storm.
The enthusiastic audience revelled in the show.
I love you.
Wonderful.
Great.
Every evening was a triumph.
From the gent over there.
And every evening for nearly a month,
Raymond Pointrenaud, a former Prefect, celebrated his promotion to Paris as
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
Meanwhile, Ferdinand had barely travelled the 280 meters that separate La Concorde from Place des Pyramides.
Don't be shy!
You've seen others!
Oh my God!
Ferdinand's visions were in fact an optical illusion.
The frenzied lights came from the home of Professor Marie-Joseph Esperandieu.
This eminent scientist and expert on Ancient Egypt had obtained a degree in physics aged only 16.
His research culminated
35 years later in a book with the evocative title,
Is There A Life After Death?
At the same moment, across the Seine, the question seemed to have been settled long ago.
Yet, on the first floor, a life form that contravened the laws of science was about to give the scientist his answer.
As the century's most amazing experiment took place before our eyes,
Inspector Albert Caponi had his tightly shut.
Of course, had he seen the pterodactyl fly by his window, our story would have been drastically different, but for now no one could blame the inspector for his somnolence.
His stoutness and perseverance had previously earned him a good many distinctions, including the Medal of Merit for solving the mystery of the missing persons of Dreux asylum.
He was decorated on August 28th, 1907, by the Prefect Raymond
Pointrenaud in person.
Raymond! What are you doing?
Let my little bird land on your branches.
You devil! Nothing arouses me more than poetry.
Really?
Yes!
As the night recedes, the dew in the branch prepares to fall
And the bird in the nest to open its eyes...
Drive normally, can't you?
Goodness me! Get out! Get out!
Hello!
Caponi speaking.
In the Seine?
In the Seine?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Help me find the words.
This young man's a scientist too, but a humble assistant, working at the Botanical Gardens.
His name's Zborowsky and he's 23.
Science isn't his only passion.
He has another, more voracious one.
Dear... Miss Adele...
What if she's married?
Or even worse, widowed?
Yes, his second passion is unconditional love for Miss Adele Blanc-Sec.
A passion she provoked with these few words...
Who's it for?
For Zbo... bo... bobo rowsky.
First name, perhaps?
Yes.
Which is?
Andrej, with a J, as in jaguar.
Oh, I'd love this one.
A jaguar.
Oh.
Thank you!
Andrej Zborowsky was definitively lost to science.
As for Adele Blanc-Sec and her sense of humour, they had set off on a new adventure, much less monstrous and much more exotic, since her publisher had sent her to Peru to unravel the mystery of the last Incas.
Something you should know about Adele, to really understand her...
She listens to her instincts, not her publisher.
Aziz, how many hours' ride to the rendezvous?
In this heat, at least six, Miss Adele.
Very well. Let's move out.
What's "move" in Arabic?
Yalla, Miss Adele.
Yalla
And "Move, you ass, or you're dead"?
Stop!
Is this it?
I think so.
Very well.
You need to drink a lot of water in this heat.
These are the two men
I told you about.
A cup of tea before the drop?
I look like I drink tea?
Is this the tomb room?
Not yet.
It's the embalming room, where the mummies were prepared.
The bodies were gutted on the altar and the entrails thrown in these pots.
Then, after a quick wash, they were powdered, made up and dressed.
What was this for?
Made-to-measure suits.
The body goes here and the machine wraps it in 200 layers of bandages.
Not to mention the oil, squirted between each layer.
What kind of oil is it?
No idea, but it worked a treat.
Found it!
Yes, this is it. Gents, let's see your treasure.
Death... is the only path... that leads... to birth.
Your journey ends here, darling.
To thank you for your cooperation, we'll spare your life.
Get lost!
Fine Egyptian hospitality!
Yes, but he's not Egyptian.
Great...
A peculiarly inflammable mix of oil and petroleum.
Enter with even a tiny match and there'll be fireworks.
Let me know when your gentlemen's club is open to women.
Excuse me.
Just as I thought.
Miss! After careful consideration, we accept your application.
Allow me to save my emotion for later.
That's that bit done.
Hold on a sec...
Where'd you learn all this?
There are only two ways.
Be Egyptian or learn to read.
Amazing!
Allah is great!
I make a fortune.
I make a fortune.
Here he is...
C'mon, they're down there!
Even without the stone, it's very heavy. How will we ever get it out?
In tombs like this, there's a way in and a way out.
Find it.
Yes, Miss Adele.
Open it.
Hey, wait.
Opening a pharaoh's tomb is sacrilege.
You can hang for that.
What punishment for taking his gold?
None.
Beware, you witch!
I won't leave without my gold.
I fear you're right.
Money can't buy happiness,
Aziz. Open it!
That's your pharaoh?
No, a doctor.
Don't move.
If it's for a consultation, miss, you may be a bit late.
However, I know a specialist institute in Cairo, where the doctors would be delighted to examine you.
I'm fine, thank you. Except for the nausea
I feel in your presence, Prof. Dieuleveult.
Still the same caustic sense of humour, my dear Adele. You'll need it.
Meanwhile, tell me why a great reporter like you is here looting tombs.
Not looting, borrowing.
Of course! You're taking him for a walk to get some fresh air.
Patmosis is a professor of medicine,
Ramses II's personal doctor.
The greatest medical expert in Ancient Egypt.
Fortunately, because...
I need his expertise.
Would that be to cure humankind?
No, just my sister. She's ill.
How very thoughtful and touching!
But has it crossed your mind that your professor is... dead?
I'd noticed, thank you.
How will you resuscitate him?
May I?
Is There A Life After Death?
That old fool, Esperandieu?
He's barely able to spin a chair round.
He'll be dead before he revives this old mummy!
Mind your language!
Mummies hear everything we say and detest disrespect.
You're scaring me!
After the Ice Monster, here comes the Sand Zombie!
Watch out, he's a real grouch!
My dear Adele,
I confess I'm one of your most avid readers, but this is by far the silliest story you've ever told.
Take her away!
Yes, sir!
Come along. Hurry!
The way out?
I checked every wall. Nothing.
It must be in the middle.
The tomb's in the middle.
See? You found it.
Hurry up. Let's go!
Damn rainwater!
You know the punishment for tomb raiders?
Hanging.
For locals only.
Foreigners are given more consideration and a swift death.
More protocol, but much less pain.
Miss! Miss!
A last wish perhaps?
It's not very good for my health, but I'd appreciate a cigarette.
Why not? One won't kill you!
Thank you.
It's magnificent.
Yes.
May I?
Yes.
A gift, I suppose?
A memento, actually.
My father. On his death.
Oh
It's better this way. Whenever
I use it, I think of him.
Oh
I'd like to give you a souvenir.
Really?
Whenever you use it, think of me.
Into my arms!
Forgive me the sudden intimacy.
Excuse me, my good man!
Cairo?
Thanks.
Put him on the table.
Calm down. Careful!
We'll take care of you.
Scissor.
Calm down, Professor. Oxygen!
We're nearly there.
I'll kill that woman!
Oxygen!
I'll kill her!
Oxygen!
I'll kill her! Breathe in!
I'll kill her! Breathe in!
Blow out! Blow out!
Fifty!
Mr. Choupard, how can I believe a man with
50% alcohol on his breath?
I swear it's true,
Commissioner.
Inspector.
Inspector, yes. The bird swooped onto the car and pecked it to pieces!
And Prefo Pectoral... was aboard.
Ex-Prefect.
And he had a scantily clad woman next to him.
A scantily clad woman?
With Pointrenaud, founder of
Christian Aid? Nonsense!
I know, but I saw her!
Like you saw Joan of
Arc ablaze once more.
Sir...
We've identified the dead.
There were three passengers in the vehicle.
Pointrenaud, his driver, and...
Good Lord!
What did I tell you?
To the drunk tank!
I'm innocent!
It's the big bird that did it!
I was just going home.
Gentlemen, until we find out more about this tragedy,
I'm relying on you to keep this case confidential.
Of course, sir.
Not a word to the press.
No, sir.
The Prefect and the Showgirl!
Their Dance with Death!
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!
Get The Little Parisian today!
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!
Monster Kills Prefect!
Police Clueless!
Read all about it!
There you are, sir.
Monster Kills Prefect!
Police Clueless!
A pterodactyl? How grotesque!
They'll do anything to sell their rag.
Even Le Gaulois has run it.
They'll panic people, that's all.
Probably. It's the talk of the town.
Send poor Pointrenaud's widow our condolences.
Yes, Mr. President.
A Prefect with a showgirl, perhaps.
But a pterodactyl? In the 20th century!
You sent for me, sir?
Yes. Call the Interior.
Good morning, sir.
This pterodactyl business sounds serious. It could be anarchists up to their tricks.
Look into it and keep me informed.
Leave it to me, sir.
Call the Prefect.
Hello!
Minister.
This pterodactyl business is dragging on.
The President wants results this week.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Call Police Headquarters.
Yes? Dugommier?
Who's on the pterodactyl case?
Captain Poissard.
Hardly surprising it's going nowhere!
We need more energy.
A sleuth!
Give him 72 hours to obtain results.
I'm on the job, sir.
Get me Cheval!
Hello!
We have to solve this fast.
You have 48 hours.
Consider it done, sir.
What a mess!
Caponi speaking.
Cheval here.
Good morning, Commissioner.
I've put you on the pterodactyl case.
Don't let me down.
Our reputation's at stake.
I'll do my best, sir.
You have 24 hours.
Thank you, sir.
Where'd an animal like that come from?
Look...
It wasn't like that.
Of course not, Andrej.
This egg's always been in my care.
What happened?
Yesterday, an attendant noticed broken glass.
He blamed it on a careless visitor and simply replaced the glass.
People are so clumsy!
It's more complicated than that.
Look at the remains of the shell.
Most are still connected to the amniotic membrane, as if the force that cracked the egg came from...
The inside?
Exactly.
But that would mean the egg...
Hatched, Zborowsky.
After 135 million years' gestation, it emerged from its shell and flew away.
Through there!
In that case, could it be related to the pterodactyl in the press?
You'd have made an excellent policeman.
Professor Menard?
Yes?
Inspector Caponi.
What can I do for you?
I'm in charge of the petrodactyl case.
Pterodactyl.
That's what I said.
Seeing the bone collection in your museum,
I thought maybe you could help.
I'm strictly a Cretaceous man.
I'd suggest you see a specialist in the Jurassic.
Look, I have 24 hours to solve this.
I can't go visiting Jura.
Let me find you a specialist in Paris in that case.
Most kind of you.
Say...
That egg... It'd make a heck of an omelette.
Please follow me.
Yes, of course.
I'll keep you informed of developments.
Please do.
Goodbye.
Come on...
Don't be scared. come on.
Look what I've got for you.
Smells good.
Come on...
This is it, sir. Up there.
Excellent!
Fetch me a black coffee and something to nibble on.
I can't think on an empty stomach.
You want more? Eat, my baby, eat!
That's good, my baby.
Yes? What do you want?
Inspector Caponi.
I have some questions for you about the ferodactyl.
Pterodactyl, sir.
I was told you're a specialist.
Yes, that's right. But this isn't a...
I was about to eat.
Perfect, that's our specialty.
Well, please come in then.
Goodness, it's dark in here.
I'm very sensitive to light.
Please, take a seat.
En.
Thanks, Jeannot. May I? I haven't eaten in 2 days. Go ahead.
So, how can I be of help?
Tell me about the animal.
What it eats, where it sleeps..
We know very little about its habits.
We do know it's a carnivore.
Quite right!
Nothing beats a rare rib of beef!
What's that?
It's the toucan.
Please go on, Professor.
It has a wingspan of about... six meters, and can fly for hours on end, looking for food... to take back to the nest.
There's a nest of them?
No, I mean... There's only one.
En
But at the time, when they had a mate, finding food and building a nest were their main activities.
Mating took place once a year and for reasons as yet unknown, they only laid one egg at a time.
Which explains their aggressive nature, especially... when it came to defending their one... and only offspring.
Amazing!
Sir, the toucan's...
Help! Help! Jesus!
It's because of the egg.
It was too much for him.
The man's deranged!
Take him away!
Sorry.
Need a porter?
I wouldn't say no.
Adele
Mr Xavier? How kind.
My only hope of seeing you, my dear, as you travel far and near, is if lie in wait for you here.
Very good!
Gently! It's fragile.
Yes, ma' am.
No 28, Rue du Four, please.
So? Peru?
Far! Very far.
And very high.
Indeed.
You made it up Machu Picchu?
Every morning.
Very morning!
Is it indiscreet to ask what treasure you bring us in that fine box?
A pipe. An Andean pipe.
A pipe?
The large model.
A sacred pipe
I wrenched from the tomb of the last Inca king.
No!
Yes! Fatal for the uninitiated player, so don't touch.
Definitely not.
Tell me, my good man, is this a cab or a B&B?
I'd love to get moving, lady, but these damn nags are blocking the road.
When will they ban horses from Paris?
This is the 200th century!
Move! you moron, or you are dad!
Oh, what happened?
Where we were just now?
What hocus-pocus have you brought back now?
Miranda, mind your language and help with the bags.
I just cleaned your room.
You bring back these old dirty relics again.
I'll take care of this one personally.
What's all this mail?
The young man from the Botanical Gardens.
A letter a day, and two Monday to make up for Sunday.
Reminds me of my youth in
Andalusia, in my mother's family.
There was a young picador, strong as his bulls...
How is Agathe?
Fine. She's been very good.
But she eats less and less.
Soon she'll be skin and bone.
We'll take good care of her.
Thank you, Miranda, for your patience, your time and your advice!
So, you refuse to eat?
Now you look so unhealthy.
You need some blusher.
You're as pretty as ever.
I hope Miranda didn't bore you with Andalusia.
I was in Egypt.
I have a surprise for you.
Look!
Meet Patmosis, personal physician of Ramses II, the great pharaoh.
Medically, they were so advanced.
Their preservation techniques prove it.
Nobody's ever done better.
I'm sure with all his secrets, he'll soon have you on your feet.
As son as I find the man who can revive him.
Sir?
I'm very sorry,
Miss Blanc-Sec.
I was about to slip you a note.
I'd no idea you were back.
I was about to go out.
I won't keep you.
I hope not.
Here...
Number them, so I know where to begin.
Forget the others. I mean, you can read them later.
That one's the most important.
Ok, I will read them in bath.
In bath?
I always do.
Um.
Beautiful.
What?
I mean, your room is beautifully decorated.
What's this pterodactyl?
Exactly. That's what my...
Which prison has a death row?
La Sante.
Can I do something to help?
Drink to my health!
Esperandieu, your lawyer to see you.
Your client, sir.
Miss Blanc-Sec?
What are you doing here?
Professor, I found Patmosis' mummy.
That's impossible.
True, but I did.
And don't ask me how.
Where is it now?
At home.
Waiting for you.
Oh.
But Adele...
I fear it will have to wait some more.
I don't see how I can get out of here.
Anyway, my mind is to busy controlling the bird.
The pterodactyl?
Yes. I wanted to refine my technique while you were in Egypt.
I brought to life an egg over 135 million years old.
Perfect! A 4,000000-year-old mummy will be child's play.
Perhaps, but the bird exhausts me.
Whenever I doze off, its killer instinct takes over. I must stop it
My sister first, then your giant insect.
That's fine by me, but how will you get me out?
Trust your lawyer.
Sir?
I'm here to see my client, Esperandieu.
Mr. Saint Hubert, can we have a comment?
Don't crowd.
Hold back the reporters!
Gentlemen, calm down!
Let him speak!
I cut short my African trip at the government's behest.
They have invited me as an expert to assist Mr Caponi to dispatch this pterodactyl.
It's a great honour to put my talent at the service of the nation.
Mr. Saint Hubert, what approach will you use?
First, we'll track it down, to study its behaviour and habits.
How will you find it?
Quite simply, by raising our sights.
Anything good today?
Pigeon.
You've saved my life.
Don't mention it.
Come out, wherever you are.
It's right here, Caponi.
I can sense it.
Wonderful.
It's pter... ptero... pterodactyl...
What is it exactly?
Mutton! That's what it is.
Really?
Categorically. Trust me,
I know my droppings.
It's the best way to track an animal.
We're making progress,
Caponi. Progress!
Wonderful.
In the bowl, there's a badge.
You're Armand
Petit-Blanchard, head cook.
Armand what?
Petit-Blanchard, I said!
Someone stole my badge from my locker.
Hands off me!
Get out! That's enough now!
Right... I need a better plan.
Sorry, no more pate.
Not to worry.
Hey! Caponi!
Yes?
Unless I'm mistaken, it could find sheep in 3 places.
Montmartre in the north, the colonial exhibition in the east, or the Botanical Gardens.
That's right.
Let's go!
By the grace of god!
Thank you, my son.
Wow! Sister is coming.
Don't touch!
Hurry up, let's go!
As Daddy would say, a battle that seems lost is the most exciting.
Up and at 'em!
Bang! Bang!
Bang!
The farmer's counted the herd twice. None missing.
Fine! Let's go!
My sheep!
I'm so sorry. It just went off.
Bertrand? Get a vet.
Cell 28. It's for his jab.
Ouch!
Sorry.
Professor? Wake up!
It's time to go.
Would you be so kind as to come back later?
I really am very tired.
That takes the biscuit!
Six Poitou goats, four Vanoise chamois, fifteen Larzac ewes and... nine, ten, twelve mountain sheep from Jura.
Jura?
All present and correct!
Good. On to the Botanical Gardens.
Get ready, Caponi!
We'll launch our assault at first light.
Thank you!
You're relieved!
Fine by me.
Good luck!
I hope you had a good sleep.
We have to go now.
What are you doing here?
It's not by choice.
Where's the Professor?
They transferred him last night.
Always do before the execution.
Execution?
The guillotine, tomorrow at dawn.
It can't be...
Unfortunately, it can, unless... he gets a pardon.
Pardon?
Yes.
Here... I pardon you.
Go on, fetch! good boy, Nelson!
Mr. President,
Miss Blanc-Sec's here.
She has nothing on her.
What? nothing on her?
We searched her.
She's unarmed.
Go on!
Come on, Nelson! Good boy!
My dear Miss Blanc-Sec!
Mr. President.
You know I have a fond memory of that interview...
When was it?
January 18th, 1906.
The day after you were elected.
It was my first interview.
And the last time I laughed so much.
Yes, I was appalling.
You were charming.
So, what can I do for you?
Well... As President, you often criticise the death penalty.
I've pardoned 17 condemned men in my first term.
Precisely.
Please, pardon one more.
Professor Esperandieu.
Due for execution tomorrow.
He's innocent.
I know his case.
We have 3 dead bodies, including a Prefect.
He didn't kill them.
It was a prehistoric beast!
Only the Professor can control it.
Without him, how many bodies will there be?
Miss, we have put our finest men on the case.
We even called in a big game hunter from Africa to dispatch the animal.
Nelson! Fetch your ball!
Esperandieu is a fine scholar.
His research keeps science going forward.
By taking his life, you condemn so many others.
I promise I'll think it over.
Thank you, sir.
What's wrong?
Your ball's over there!
Fetch it, Nelson!
Come on! Look!
What's up? Seen a ghost?
See? your ball's over here.
Come and fetch it!
Be a good boy! Hurry!
Come! Nelson! come!
Oh, no! Mr. President!
Good boy! Into my arms!
Get down!
President assaulted!
Sorry!
Don't move!
Get off him!
Take your paws off me! Let me go!
Are you hurt, sir?
I am fine, go away!
I'm warning you,
I do jiu-jitsu.
Nelson! Nelson!
Let me go or I'll press charges!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Find Nelson!
Eyes open, Caponi!
Both are wide open, honestly.
Vigilance and patience are the hunter's watchwords.
Tell me, Saint Hubert, could
I nip off for a minute for some food?
Out of the question!
We are at war, my friend.
One day I hunted a tiger lying low in a Bengali temple.
We went three days without food.
Three days!
Yes.
Incredible!
How did you do it?
I started by consulting all the books in the library, which confirmed the animal's sedentary nature.
So I got the idea to collect the fragments of its egg and put them in a quiet place.
Then I left out some choice cuts of beef, to keep them from hunger, so it wouldn't decimate our herd of Corsican sheep.
Zborowsky... You're a genius!
It's nothing really.
Just a little intuition.
With intuition like that, you must sweep the ladies off their feet, my young friend!
That depends on the lady.
Are there two L's in Addle?
No, two E's.
Two E's?
Adele. A-D-E-L-E. Blanc-Sec.
Like the wine. Dry white, you know.
Yes, I know dry whites.
Marvelous!
Go ahead.
From the beginning.
To cure my sister,
I went to Egypt, not Peru, to find a doctor, Patmosis, a charming but mummified fellow.
Prof. Esperandieu was supposed to wake him, not the damn pterodactyl he should've left alone, given its attack on the President and his pet.
The petero... no, the pet's the dog.
I summoned up all my courage and threw myself on the President.
A heroic but calculated gesture, intended to secure a pardon for the Professor to save my sister
I was arrested for attacking him.
Do I look like a terrorist?
No.
So the bird dunked on Nelson.
Dunked?
Clear? Can I go home now?
Yes. However... one tiny detail escapes me.
Which is?
Who is... Whose is...
Whose is the dog?
Right... do you have to speak in Morse, or we'll be all night?
I save the President and that's the thanks I get?
You louts!
Things didn't quite go to plan, little sis.
I need a bath to gather my wits.
Sorry for bothering you for nothing.
Truly. But aren't you happier here eyeing the girls than in your tomb?
My god!
Yes?
Into my arms!
I read your letter.
Which one?
About the pterodactyl.
You're a genius, Andrej.
Let's go. The taxi's waiting downstairs.
Right away.
This way.
See? I wasn't telling you lies.
Incredible!
Be careful, Miss Adele.
Don't worry, I've cracked tougher nuts.
Birdy, birdy...
It prefers meat.
Really?
Silly me.
Where are you from, my beauty?
I don't mean you!
In any case, you have beautiful plumage.
In truth, if your voice is the equal of your coat...
Fine. Clearly no ancestor of the nightingale.
Watch out, it might think you're a goat.
You smooth-talker.
No, I meant...
I'm usually called bird names.
Really?
My dove... My chickadee...
My feathery thing!
Actually...
You want my feathers, don't you?
My feathery thing...
Feathers of little birdies...
Incredible!
There you go, that's good. Now we're friends,
I have a favour to ask of you.
Surely you're not going to...
It'd be rude not to.
It's madness!
It can't be more complicated than a camel.
It can.
Watch out! The tree!
Stop!
There we are.
You're unbelievable,
Miss Blanc-Sec.
Now we've mastered the unbelievable, let's perform the impossible.
Here we are!
This way, my friends.
This is so exciting!
You haven't seen anything yet.
And don't blink, or you'll miss it.
I prepared some snacks for you.
Good thinking.
This is for you.
Thank you.
Champagne? I'll be tipsy again.
Which way?
At the window.
Thank you.
Look at the crowd.
We're just in time.
There he is!
An ugly little head he has.
I see why they'd chop it off.
Charlotte!
It was because of the egg.
It was too much for him.
They've put a bag on his head.
I don't understand. Why'd the executioner fly off with a bag on his head?
There! There it is!
There! I'm here!
It's snatched a man. Fetch an ambulance.
Leave the rest to me.
I'll go right away.
You keep it, buster.
Anyone there! Where are we?
Is this hell?
Here I am!
Adele?
Hello.
How can this be?
He saved your life. You brought him to life, so it's only fair.
Yes.
What's going on? Who are these...
Esperandieu?
Menard!
By the saints! A miracle!
Menard, you old blackguard!
Esperandieu, well I never!
How on earth did you get here?
That's a very long story.
You can tell it later.
This winter, over a hot chocolate.
We have a mummy to wake and sister to save.
Just joking!
Yes, she's just joking.
Well, I'm not joking.
Tired after your trip?
Indeed I am. Very tired.
Want to go home?
Yes. I should be going home.
I'll take you.
Yes, take us home.
Sure, take him home.
Goodbye, ducky!
What's that...
Saint Hubert?
Esperandieu!
Not now!
What's wrong?
Saint Hubert.
Get out!
Stupid hound!
You worthless nincompoop, who allowed you to shoot at science?
I am Justin de Saint Hubert, big game hunter...
Big game hunter?
I'm a hunter, too, but I only shoot black sheep.
You seem a fine specimen.
Stop that! you've no right!
One!
No!
Two!
No!
Three!
No!
Four! Five!
No! no! no!
Don't die now, please!
I'll do my best.
Let me help.
If you want to help, look after the pterodactyl.
But the Professor's bleeding.
They're connected!
Don't ask how or why.
If we lose one, we lose both.
Don't let it happen.
Yes, of course!
Leave it to me.
Twenty-eight, Rue du Four.
What do I do now?
Place antique objects in a circle around me.
The older the better.
Yes, that one.
I'm going to need to... put this bandage on you.
I'll be right back.
There! What now?
Now... I'll try to establish contact with the mummy to see if it agrees to entrust the keys to me.
Excellent!
What keys?
After death, the whole body shrinks and locks itself in the mind which never die.
I discovered the key to communicate with the mind.
Wonderful!
It's going to work.
Maybe... some procoagulants... in a nub... of butter?
Professor!
Please, stay with me. Please, just a little longer!
Bless you.
Thanks.
Sorry about the glass.
Forget it. I have to tidy up anyway.
What a shame he's gone. I'd have liked to get to know him.
What have we here? I detect a certain likeness.
She's my sister.
She doesn't look well.
Yes...
But...
Actually...
With the knowledge you possess, perhaps you could try to bring her back to life?
I have some modest talents, but not that one.
What? You're not a doctor?
Absolutely not.
I'm a nuclear physicist.
I deal in figures, signs and equations. nothing very extraordinary.
Doctors don't leave the pharaoh's side, and are buried next to them, right next door.
May I make some tea?
Be my guest.
Very kind of you.
Kindness is a highly prized quality in our dynasty.
I admit that throughout this adventure, you have been very hospitable towards me, and I'd like to thank you.
You could hear?
Everything.
And see? Like when I...
Everything.
Don't blush. With this body, you appreciate that of others more.
Thanks.
I suppose you want a doctor to cure this poor child.
Yes. not only is she my sister, but also my friend, my angel... My twin.
What happened to her?
A freak accident.
A camel?
Tennis.
Lend me your hatpin.
No way!
Thanks.
For nothing.
How do I look?
Like skewered kidneys.
Which I take to mean...
"Gracious!
Why did my parents give her beauty and leave me only bitterness and jealousy?" one game all. New balls.
We'd just turned twenty.
Agathe was so beautiful.
We'd discovered a new sport and played whenever we could.
In order too avoid any sense of rivalry, we never had an actual match.
Our games were strictly friendlies.
Then, in a moment of euphoria, a moment of shared happiness, tragedy struck.
Agathe!
Miss, are you okay?
Miss, wake up!
Move! Please!
Agathe! Move!
No, not that!
Sorry! Stay with me!
Go and fetch a doctor!
Agathe! Agathe!
Agathe! Agathe! Agathe!
She was born a few minutes after me but she departed well before me. It's the only race I'd have loved to lose.
Indeed, a most regrettable accident.
Believe me, I'm very sorry I can't help you.
The Professor did a remarkable job. His mental power must have woken the dead in a radius of 2 km.
But I'm not the right person.
Hold on a sec... 2 kilometers?
Yes, probably.
The waves ripple out like when you throw a stone into water.
And Ramses' doctors never left his side?
They never left the room, even when he was mating. The Mummies of Ramses II.
Patmosis, you're a genius.
Let's go!
Excuse me, I'm looking for the Ramses exhibition.
Yes, quite!
Stop importuning people.
You'll get us noticed.
After 5,000 years in a tomb, can't I have some fun?
I couldn't resist.
It was rather amusing.
First things first.
Then you can die.
Of laughing, if you wish.
Can you open it?
I'm no better locksmith than doctor.
Perhaps you could serve some kind of purpose, or I'll float you down the Seine.
The Nile, it ain't!
Don't get upset. Humour soothes the savage breast.
That's not humour!
Maybe it made the pharaohs laugh, but this is the 200th century!
That's better.
This way, Mistress.
Patmosis!
Yes, Mistress.
Coming, Mistress!
This way, Mistress.
Cut it out!
You're very tense. Relax.
I'll give you a massage later.
You're a chiropractor now?
No, but I studied molecular energy.
For now, stick to opening doors.
Beautiful, eh? Reminds me of when we painted.
All clear?
Look, what's that?
What?
Patmosis!
Leave it to me, Mistress.
Miss!
Waking people, no, but knocking them out, no problem.
Thank you, Mistress.
Oh my god!
They're all jumbled up.
If Ramses saw this...
Wake him, so he can rearrange them.
The faithful first, so they're there when the Pharaoh wakes.
Poor dear, don't want him feeling homesick.
And definitely not insulted, so
I suggest we respect protocol.
I'm in favour of protocol.
Sorry to bother you, are you a doctor?
Are you a surgeon?
I'm looking for a doctor.
No, you're not a doctor!
Doctor anyone?
Great nap. What is that ridiculous attire?
Native costume, your Highness.
Allow me to introduce
Miss Adele Blanc-Sec, a scribe.
Hi.
The natives employ women to write their texts?
Their civilization is still rough and ready, but she is very amicable and waking us was her good idea.
Good idea? I feel I've woken up a little early.
Sorry to wake you, your Highness, I had no choice. It's a matter of life or death.
Life or death?
It comes and it goes.
I'd like my sister's to come back.
Miss Adele woke me up in the belief that I was a doctor.
You? A doctor?
I wouldn't let you clip my nails.
She's looking for a doctor to treat her sister, and we thought that in your great kindness, you might let your personal physician take a look at the child.
You woke me up for such a trivial affair?
Hold on, Rammy! Five thousand years, you've been snoring away.
I've had 5 years of grieving, of suffering with my sister who can't see me.
I'm a poor earth-dweller with no divine protection.
I live everyday with the pain and guilt that never goes away.
Because it was all my fault!
It was my hatpin!
What's this about a hat?
Nothing, I'll tell you later.
Nosibis, my faithful doctor...
See if you can give the girl a little life back, so she can enjoy all this love for her.
Thank you... your Highness.
Serene Majesty?
The doctors said if we took it out, she'd most likely die.
You're insane!
I asked you to cure her, not kill her, you bag of bones!
Calm down, Adele.
Don't interfere.
What's that?
The Pharaoh's entrails.
Charming.
Is the kiss necessary?
Not really, more of a tradition.
It's better to do it now, before she wakes up.
No kidding.
Well... Let's go out and see the sights.
Agathe!
Agathe!
Agathe!
Are you mad, hitting the ball like that?
And I love you more than the whole world.
It was a privilege meeting you, Miss Adele.
Same here, Patmosis.
Apologize to your Pharaoh for me, for being so rude.
And thank him for me.
I will... Mistress.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody, darling. Don't move. Everything will be fine now, I promise.
This way, your Majesty.
What was that?
Sorry to importune you again.
Go ahead.
Which way to the Nile, please?
Why, of course!
They are very curious people.
Cruelly lacking in manners.
I agree, Your Highness.
But they have highly developed artistic talents.
This courtyard, for example, is magnificent.
Quite magnificent!
We should build a pyramid here.
I'm sure it would be a fine addition.
Meanwhile, Sire, perhaps we should rejoin the others?
You are right,
Patmosis. Let's go!
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!
Read all about it! Mummies
Vanish from the Louvre!
There you go, sir!
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!
What's this now about mummies?
It's another anarchist plot.
Call the Interior.
Tuck in, my little Caponi!
Who's it for?
It was for Miss Adele.
She's taken a few weeks' vacation.
Well.
Give them to someone else.
For me? That's so kind!
What's your name?
Zborowsky.
First name perhaps?
Yes. Andrej, with a J, as in...
As in jaguar.
Cup of tea?
Yes.
Enjoy the trip.
Thank you.
Hurry, miss, we're about to leave.
All right, keep your hair on.
Blanc-Sec, Adele.
Thank you.
The woman in the green hat?
Leave it to us.
Hurry up!
It is Miss Blanc-Sec's luggage.
Welcome on board.
Welcome on board.
Hurry. Move fast for the luggage!
Welcome on board.
Hurry up!
How are you? Welcome!
Take this.
Miss Blanc-Sec...
Yes?
These are yours?
Take good care of them.
Sorry!
Good start to the holiday.
Sorry, it was an accident.
That's my bag!
Take good care of it.
Have a good trip, Miss Blanc-Sec.
Saint Hubert!
Caponi! Caponi!
A fine zebra!
I've lost Saint Hubert!
I just lost him! Go and find him!
You put up a good fight.
Please, I'm begging you.
No!
Smile!
No!
Nobody move!
I'm out of ammunition.
Take him away!
You look like a fine specimen, too.
Sit tight.
I'll get reinforcements.
Fine, take your time.
Oh, no!
Wait for it.
-Can l turn on the radio?
-No.
Jane, you can't keep doing this.
The last 17 occurrences have been predictable to the second.
Jane, you're an astrophysicist, not some storm chaser. l'm telling you, there's a connection between these atmospheric disturbances and my research.
Erik, l wouldn't have asked you to fly out here if l wasn't absolutely sure.
Jane? l think you want to see this.
What is that? l thought you said it was a subtle aurora!
Go!
-Get closer.
-Right. Good one.
Go!
What are you doing? l am not dying for six college credits! l think that was legally your fault.
Get the first aid kit.
Do me a favour and don't be dead.
Please.
Where did he come from?
Once, mankind accepted a simple truth, that they were not alone in this universe.
Some worlds man believed to be home to their gods.
Others, they knew to fear.
From a realm of cold and darkness came the Frost Giants, threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age.
But humanity would not face this threat alone.
Our armies drove the Frost Giants back into the heart of their own world.
The cost was great. ln the end, their king fell.
And the source of their power was taken from them.
With the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home to the Realm Eternal,
Asgard.
Here we remain as a beacon of hope, shining out across the stars.
And though we have fallen into man's myths and legends, it was Asgard and its warriors that brought peace to the universe.
But the day will come when one of you will have to defend that peace.
Do the Frost Giants still live?
When l'm king, l'll hunt the monsters down and slay them all!
Just as you did, Father.
A wise king never seeks out war.
But he must always be ready for it.
-l'm ready, Father.
-So am l.
Only one of you can ascend to the throne.
But both of you were born to be kings.
Oh, please.
Thor Odinson, my heir, my firstborn.
So long entrusted with the mighty hammer Mjolnir, forged in the heart of a dying star, its power has no equal, as a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build.
'Tis a fit companion for a king. l have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms from the time of the great beginning.
Though the day has come...
Do you swear to guard the Nine Realms? l swear.
And do you swear to preserve the peace? l swear.
Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and to pledge yourself only to the good of the Realms? l swear!
Then, on this day, l, Odin Allfather, proclaim you...
The Frost Giants!
The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
They have paid, with their lives.
The Destroyer did its work, the Casket is safe, and all is well.
All is well?
They broke into the weapons vault! lf the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these relics...
-They didn't.
-Well, l want to know why! l have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!
What action would you take?
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.
Break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again.
You're thinking only as a warrior.
This was an act of war! lt was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.
Look how far they got!
We will find the breach in our defences and it will be sealed.
As King ofAsgard...
But you're not king!
Not yet. lt's unwise to be in my company right now, Brother.
This was to be my day of triumph. lt'll come. ln time.
What's this? lf it's any consolation, l think you're right.
About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything. lf they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defences once, who's to say they won't try again?
-Next time with an army.
-Exactly.
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.
No, no, no. l know that look.
That's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
Thor, it's madness.
Madness? What sort of madness?
We're going to Jotunheim.
What?
This isn't like a journey to Earth where you summon a little lightning and thunder, and the mortals worship you as a god.
This is Jotunheim.
My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies and took their Casket.
We would just be looking for answers. lt is forbidden!
My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together?
Fandral, Hogun.
Who led you into the most glorious of battles?
You did.
And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent, you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?
You did.
Yes!
And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this realm has ever known? l did.
True, but l supported you, Sif.
My friends, we're going to Jotunheim.
You leave this to me.
-Good Heimdall...
-You're not dressed warmly enough. l'm sorry?
Do you think that you can deceive me?
-You must be mistaken...
-Enough!
Heimdall, may we pass?
Never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day. l wish to know how that happened.
Then tell no one where we have gone until we've returned.
Understand?
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?
Be warned. l will honour my sworn oath to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper. lf your return threatens the safety ofAsgard,
Bifrost will remain closed to you and you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.
Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
To leave the bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it. l have no plans to die today.
None do.
We shouldn't be here.
Let's move.
Where are they?
Hiding, as cowards always do.
You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians. l am Thor Odinson!
We know who you are.
How did your people get into Asgard?
The House of Odin is full of traitors.
Do not dishonour my father's name with your lies!
Your father is a murderer and a thief!
And why have you come here?
To make peace?
You long for battle. You crave it.
You're nothing but a boy trying to prove himself a man.
Well, this "boy" has grown tired of your mockery.
Thor, stop and think.
Look around you, we're outnumbered.
Know your place, Brother.
You know not what your actions would unleash. l do.
Go now, while l still allow it.
We will accept your most gracious offer.
Come on, Brother.
Run back home, little princess.
Damn.
Next?
At least make it a challenge for me!
That's more like it.
Don't let them touch you!
Thor!
-We must go!
-Then go!
Run!
Thor!
Heimdall!
Open the bridge!
Father! We'll finish them together!
Silence!
Allfather.
You look weary.
Laufey, end this now.
Your boy sought this out.
You're right.
And these are the actions of a boy, treat them as such.
You and l can end this here and now, before there's further bloodshed.
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.
He'll get what he came for.
War and death.
So be it.
Why did you bring us back?
Do you realise what you've done?
What you've started?
-l was protecting my home.
-You cannot even protect your friends!
How can you hope to protect a kingdom?
Get him to the healing room! Now!
There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act.
The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you.
That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership.
You've forgotten everything l taught you about a warrior's patience.
While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us.
The old ways are done.
You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls.
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
And you are an old man and a fool!
Yes. l was a fool to think you were ready.
Father...
Thor Odinson, you have betrayed the express command of your king.
Through your arrogance and stupidity, you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war!
You are unworthy of these realms!
You're unworthy of your title!
You're unworthy of the loved ones you have betrayed. l now take from you your power! ln the name of my father and his father before, l, Odin Allfather, cast you out!
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. l think that was legally your fault.
Get the first aid kit.
Do me a favour and don't be dead.
Does he need CPR?
Because l totally know CPR.
Where did he come from?
You all right?
Hammer?
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. lt's pretty obvious.
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!
We have to move quickly before this all changes.
Jane, we have to take him to the hospital.
-Father!
-He's fine, look at him.
Heimdall! l know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!
Hospital. You go, l'll stay.
You. What realm is this?
Alfheim? Nornheim?
New Mexico?
You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon?
What? He was freaking me out!
Next time you decide to taser somebody, make sure he's already in the car, okay?
Jane! Come on.
Name?
He said it was Thor?
T-H-O-R.
-And your relationship to him?
-l've never met him before.
Until she hit him with a car. l grazed him, but she tasered him.
Yes, l did.
Hi.
Just taking a little blood.
How dare you attack the son of Odin? l need some help!
Call security!
Security to ER 3, stat!
You're no match for the Mighty...
You don't think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?
Look, the lensing around these edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
A what?
-l thought you were a science major?
-Political science.
She was the only applicant.
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection between two different points of space-time. lt's a wormhole.
-Erik, look. What do you see?
-Stars.
Yeah, but not our stars.
See, this is the star alignment for our quadrant this time of year, and unless Ursa Minor decided to take a day off, these are someone else's constellations.
Hey! Check this out.
No, it can't be. l think l left something at the hospital. lt's not possible!
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.
Oh, my God. l just lost my most important piece of evidence.
Typical.
-So now what?
-We find him.
Did you see what he did in there? l'm not sure finding him is the best idea.
Well, our data can't tell us what it was like to be inside that event, and he can. So, we're gonna find him.
Okay.
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico, right?
Exactly.
What? l'm so sorry. l swear l'm not doing this on purpose. l got it, l got it.
Come on, kick it in now!
Did it work?
Sir, we found it.
You know, for a crazy homeless person, he's pretty cut.
Hey, sorry l tased you!
Excuse me, excuse me!
What is this?
My ex.
Good with patients and bad with relationships.
They're the only clothes l had that would fit you.
They will suffice.
You're welcome.
This mortal form has grown weak. l need sustenance.
We should never have let him go.
There was no stopping him.
Well, at least he's only banished, not dead.
Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
How did the guard even know? l told him.
What? l told him to go to Odin after we'd left.
He should be flogged for taking so long.
We should never have reached Jotunheim.
You told the guard? l saved our lives.
And Thor's. l had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
Loki.
You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind.
And if l do, then what? l love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is.
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.
You saw how he was today. ls that what Asgard needs from its king?
He may speak of the good ofAsgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.
We should be grateful to him, he saved our lives.
Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin.
A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.
Stop!
Am l cursed?
No.
What am l?
You're my son.
What more than that?
The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?
No. ln the aftermath of the battle, l went into the temple and l found a baby.
Small for a giant's offspring.
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.
Laufey's son.
Yes.
Why?
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood, why would you take me?
You were an innocent child.
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?
Tell me! l thought we could unite our kingdoms one day.
Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace.
Through you.
What?
But those plans no longer matter.
So l am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.
Why do you twist my words?
You could have told me what l was from the beginning, why didn't you?
You're my son. l wanted only to protect you from the truth.
Because l'm the monster parents tell their children about at night?
-No, no.
-You know, it all makes sense now!
Why you favoured Thor all these years!
Because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the throne ofAsgard!
Guards!
Guards, please, help!
How'd you get inside that cloud?
Also, how could you eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry?
-This drink, l like it.
-l know. lt's great, right?
Another!
Sorry, lzzy. Little accident.
-What was that?
-lt was delicious. l want another.
-Well, you could have just said so.
-l just did.
-No, l mean, ask nicely.
-l meant no disrespect.
All right. Well, no more smashing.
Deal?
You have my word.
Good.
The usual, please, lzzy.
You missed all the excitement out at the crater.
They're saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert.
Yeah, we were having a good time with it until the Feds showed up.
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?
Yeah.
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.
What did it look like, the satellite? l don't know anything about satellites, but it was heavy. l mean, nobody could lift it.
They said it was radioactive. l had my hands all over it.
Which way?
Fifty miles west of here.
Well, l wouldn't waste my time!
Looked like the whole Army was coming when we left.
Dumbass!
Where are you going?
-Fifty miles west of here.
-Why?
-To get what belongs to me.
-So you own a satellite now? lt's not what they say it is.
Well, whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs.
So, you just intend to go in there and take it?
Yes. lf you take me there now, l'll tell you everything you wish to know.
-Everything?
-Yes.
All the answers you seek will be yours once l reclaim Mjolnir.
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?
Can l have a word, Jane?
Please don't do this.
You saw what l saw last night.
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.
But l'm not talking about the crater, l'm talking about him.
-But he's promising us the answers.
-He's delusional.
Listen to what he's saying.
He's talking about Mjolnir and Thor and Bifrost. lt's the stories l grew up with as a child. l'm just going to drive him. That's it.
He's dangerous, Jane. l'm sorry, but l can't take you.
Then this is where we say goodbye.
Thank you?
Jane Foster,
Erik Selvig,
Darcy, farewell.
All right.
Back to work.
That's my stuff!
What the hell is going on here?
Ms Foster, l'm Agent Coulson with S.H.l.E.L.D. ls that supposed to mean something to me?
-You can't do this!
-Jane!
Jane, this is a lot more serious than you realise. Let it go.
Let it go? This is my life.
We're investigating a security threat.
We need to appropriate your records and all your atmospheric data.
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?
Here, this should more than compensate you for your trouble. l can't just buy replacements at Radio Shack, l made most of this equipment myself!
Then l'm sure you can do it again.
And l'm sure l can sue you for violating my constitutional rights! l'm sorry, Ms Foster, but we're the good guys.
So are we! l'm on the verge of understanding something extraordinary.
And everything l know about this phenomenon is either in this lab or in this book.
And you can't just take this away... Hey!
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...
Thank you for your cooperation.
Years of research, gone.
They even took my iPod.
-What about the backups?
-They took our backups.
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough. l just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.
Could you please stop with your iPod?
Who are these people? l knew this scientist.
The pioneer in gamma radiation.
S.H.l.E.L.D. showed up and he wasn't heard from again.
They're not gonna do that to us. l'm gonna get everything back.
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.
He's had some dealings with these people before. l'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.
They took your laptop, too.
Allfather, we must speak with you urgently.
My friends.
Where's Odin?
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.
Mother fears he may never awaken again.
We would speak with her.
She has refused to leave my father's bedside.
You can bring your urgent matter to me.
Your king.
My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.
My first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.
We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.
Our people need a sense of continuity, in order to feel safe in these difficult times.
All of us must stand together for the good ofAsgard.
Yes, of course.
-Good. Then you will wait for my word.
-lf l may beg the indulgence of Your Majesty to perhaps reconsider...
We're done! l need a horse!
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...
Then give me one of those large enough to ride.
Hey, you still need a lift? l've never done anything like this before.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Many times.
But you're brave to do it.
Well, they just stole my entire life's work. l don't really have much left to lose.
Yeah, but you're clever.
Far more clever than anyone else in this realm.
"Realm"? "Realm"?
-You think me strange.
-Yeah, l do.
Good strange or bad strange? l'm not quite sure yet. l'm sorry.
But who are you?
Really?
You'll see soon enough.
You promised me answers.
What you seek, it's a bridge.
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
More like a Rainbow Bridge.
God, l hope you're not crazy. l never get used to seeing him like this.
He's put it off for so long now, that l fear...
How long will it last? l don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.
So why did he lie?
He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different.
You are our son, Loki, and we, your family.
We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us.
And your brother.
What hope is there for Thor?
There's always a purpose to everything your father does.
That's no satellite crash!
They would have hauled the wreckage away, they wouldn't have built a city around it.
-You're going to need this.
-What? Wait, why?
Now stay here.
Once l have Mjolnir, l will return the items they've stolen from you.
Deal?
No. Look what's down there.
You think you're just gonna walk in, grab our stuff and walk out?
No. l'm going to fly out.
Sir, feed from the keyhole can barely penetrate the cloud cover.
Tech's barely working as it is, with all the interference that thing's giving off.
And we've got a commercial aircraft coming right over us.
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.
Reroute it like all the others.
Hold a sec.
We've got something outside the fence, west side.
Delancey, Jackson.
West side perimeter. Go check it out.
There it is.
Delancey, Jackson. Report.
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.
You've reached Dr Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, l'm fine, but just in case you don't hear from me in the next hour, just come by the crater site and try and find me, okay? l did exactly what you told me not to. l'm sorry.
So sorry. Bye.
Bravo quadrant, move!
Entering south tunnel!
Negative, negative. l have no comms.
Target sighted, east tunnel! l need eyes up high, with a gun.
Moving north!
What have we got?
There's a massive electromagnetic surge coming off that thing.
Systems are barely coping.
Barton? Talk to me.
You want me to slow him down, sir?
Or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up? l'll let you know.
You're big.
Fought bigger.
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause l'm starting to root for this guy.
Last chance, sir.
Wait. I want to see this.
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.
He committed a crime. He's in jail!
-l can't just leave him there!
-Why?
You didn't see what l saw!
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.
Where'd you find this?
The children's section. l just wanted to show you how silly his story was.
But you're the one who's always pushing me to chase down every possibility, every alternative! l'm talking about science, not magic!
Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet.
-Arthur C. Clarke.
-Who wrote science fiction.
-A precursor to science fact!
-ln some cases, yeah.
Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, then there's something on the other side.
And advanced beings could have crossed it!
Jane.
A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.
You made my men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops.
That's hurtful. ln my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them.
Why don't you tell me where you received your training?
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.
Where was it? South Africa?
Certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you.
Who are you?
One way or another, we find out what we need to know.
We're good at that.
Don't go anywhere.
Loki! What are you doing here? l had to see you.
What's happened?
Tell me. ls it Jotunheim?
Let me explain to Father.
Father is dead.
What?
Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear.
You mustn't blame yourself. l know that you loved him. l tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. lt was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing that you could never lift it.
The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
Can l come home?
The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
-Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
-And Mother has forbidden your return.
This is goodbye, Brother. l'm so sorry.
No. l am sorry.
Thank you for coming here.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
Goodbye? l just got back.
Sir?
He's got a visitor.
His name is Donald Blake?
Dr Donald Blake.
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr Selvig.
He was distraught when he found out that you've taken all our research.
That was years of his life, gone!
You can understand how a man could go off like that.
A big, faceless organisation like yours coming in with their jackbooted thugs and...
That's how he put it.
That still doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security.
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.
Sir? lt says here that he's an M.D.
Well, he is! Or he was.
He switched careers and became a physicist.
A brilliant physicist.
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.
Donny, Donny, Donny!
There you are. You're gonna be all right. l'm taking you home now.
Dr Selvig!
Just keep him away from the bars. l will!
-Where are we going?
-To get a drink.
Follow them.
You know, l had it all backwards. l had it all wrong. lt's not a bad thing finding out that you don't have all the answers.
You start asking the right questions.
For the first time in my life, l have no idea what l'm supposed to do.
Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world has to start by admitting he doesn't know where the hell he is.
Thank you for what you've done.
No, don't thank me. l only did it for Jane.
Her father and l taught at university together.
He was a good man.
He never listened.
Neither did l.
My father was trying to teach me something, but l was too stupid to see it. l don't know if you're delusional or if you're pulling some kind of con, l don't care. l just care about her. l've seen the way she looks at you. l swear to you, l mean her no harm.
Good. ln that case, l'll buy you another round, and you leave town tonight.
Two boilermakers.
Kill him.
After all l've done for you?
So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.
That was just a bit of fun, really.
To ruin my brother's big day.
And to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer. l will hear you. l will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into Odin's chambers, and you can slay him where he lies.
Why not kill him yourself? l suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly to a king who had murdered his predecessor.
Once Odin is dead, l will return the Casket to you and you can return Jotunheim to all its...
Glory. l...
Accept.
What troubles you, Gatekeeper? l turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see you nor hear you.
You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants that entered this realm.
Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.
You have great power, Heimdall.
Did Odin ever fear you?
-No.
-And why is that?
Because he is my king and l am sworn to obey him.
He was your king and you're sworn to obey me now.
Yes?
Yes.
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until l have repaired the damage that my brother has done.
Oh, my God. ls he okay?
He's fine. Not injured at all. l'm sorry, my friend.
-What happened?
-We drank, we fought, he made his ancestors proud.
Put him on the bed. l still don't think you're the God of Thunder.
But you ought to be.
Are these your chambers? lt's more of a temporary living situation. l'm sorry. l don't usually have guests.
Actually, l never have guests.
That's not the right place for it. l'm sorry.
Can we go outside?
Yes, of course. l come up here sometimes when l can't sleep or l'm trying to reconcile particle data, or when Darcy's driving me crazy. l come up here a lot, actually, now that l think about it. l'm really glad you're safe.
You've been very kind to me, and l've been far less grateful than you deserve.
Well, l hit you with my car a couple times, so l think that kind of evens things out.
Perhaps l had it coming.
Oh, my God! l don't believe it! lt was all l could get back. l'm sorry it's not as much as l promised.
No, no, this is great! This is... l don't have to start from scratch now.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
S.H.l.E.L.D.
Whatever they are, they're gonna do everything in their power to make sure this research never sees the light of day.
No, Jane.
Listen to me. You must not give up.
-You must finish what you've started.
-Why?
Because you're right.
Here, look.
Your ancestors called it magic, and you call it science.
Well, l come from a place where they're one and the same thing.
What is that?
My father explained it to me like this, that your world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree.
Now you see it every day without realising.
The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?
This Hooble Telescope.
-Hubble.
-Hubble Telescope.
Tell me more.
So, the Nine Realms.
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.
This is Alfheim.
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.
And Asgard.
And that's where I come from.
Thank you, Jane.
Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,
Asgard on the brink of war, yet you've managed to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!
Stop it, both of you!
Stop.
-We all know what we have to do.
-We must go.
We must find Thor. lt's treason.
To hell with treason, it's suicide.
Thor would do the same for us.
Now shush.
Heimdall might be watching.
Heimdall demands your presence.
We're doomed.
You would defy the commands of Loki, our king, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back?
-Yes.
-Good.
So you'll help us? l am bound by honour to our king. l cannot open the bridge to you.
Complicated fellow, isn't he?
Now what do we do?
Look!
-What the hell was that?
-l don't know, sir.
We got massive energy readings out of nowhere and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.
Let's go take a look.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.
Base to Team 2, we've got activity outside the town.
Stay on your target.
Ensure my brother does not return.
Destroy everything.
Mom? ls there a Renaissance Fair in town?
Call it in.
Yeah.
Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan and Robin Hood. lt's a beautiful theory, Jane.
But you won't be able to convince the scientific community of any of it.
Not without hard evidence.
Found you!
My friends!
This is good! This is good. l don't believe it.
Excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
My friends, l've never been happier to see anyone.
But you should not have come.
We're here to take you home.
You know l can't go home.
My father is dead because of me.
And l must remain in exile.
Thor, your father still lives.
Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?
You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm?
There are secret paths between the worlds to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind.
But l have need of them no longer, now that l am king.
And l say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper, and no longer citizen ofAsgard.
Then l need no longer obey you.
Get somebody from Linguistics down here.
Was somebody else coming? ls that one of Stark's? l don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.
Hello.
You are using unregistered weapons technology.
Identify yourself.
Here we go. lncoming!
Jane, you have to leave.
-What are you gonna do?
-l'm staying here.
Thor's going to fight with us!
My friends, l'm just a man. l'll only be in the way, or worse, get one of you killed.
But l can help get these people to safety.
Well, if you're staying, then so am l.
-We'll need some time.
-You'll have it!
Okay, move it, people!
Everybody out! Use the back door.
Go, hurry! You can eat later.
Keep it distracted.
For Asgard!
Fall back!
Go. Now. Run!
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.
No. l will die a warrior's death.
Stories will be told of this day.
Live, and tell those stories yourself.
Now go.
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.
What about you?
Do not worry, my friends. l have a plan.
Come on.
We need to fall back. Come on.
Come on.
Wait!
What's he doing?
Brother, whatever l have done to wrong you, whatever l have done to lead you to do this, l am truly sorry.
But these people are innocent.
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.
So take mine and end this.
No. lt's over.
No. lt's not over. l mean, you're safe.
We're safe. lt's over.
No.
-We're spiking.
-Levels increase!
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
Jane!
-No. No. No!
-Come!
Oh. My. God.
So, is this how you normally look?
More or less. lt's a good look.
We must go to the Bifrost site. l would have words with my brother.
Excuse me!
Donald? l don't think you've been completely honest with me.
Know this, Son of Coul.
You and l, we fight for the same cause, the protection of this world.
From this day forward, you can count me as your ally if you return the items you have taken from Jane.
-Stolen.
-Borrowed.
Of course, you can have your equipment back.
You're gonna need it to continue your research.
Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?
Sure.
Wait, l need to debrief you!
Welcome to Asgard.
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.
Heimdall?
Heimdall!
He doesn't answer.
Then we are stranded.
Heimdall! lf you can hear me, we need you now!
Heimdall! We need you now!
Heimdall! l must go back to Asgard, but l give you my word, l will return for you.
Deal?
Deal.
Get him to the healing room!
Leave my brother to me. lt's said you can still hear and see what transpires around you. l hope it's true, so that you may know your death came at the hand of Laufey.
And your death came by the son of Odin.
Loki!
You saved him! l swear to you, Mother, that they will pay for what they've done today.
Loki.
Thor! l knew you'd return to us.
Why don't you tell her how you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me?
What?
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been. lt's good to have you back.
Now if you'll excuse me, l have to destroy Jotunheim.
You can't stop it.
The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.
Jane?
Why have you done this?
To prove to Father that l am the worthy son.
When he wakes, l will have saved his life. l will have destroyed that race of monsters.
And l will be true heir to the throne!
You can't kill an entire race!
Why not?
And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?
You could have killed them all with your bare hands.
-l've changed.
-So have l.
Now fight me. l never wanted the throne! l only ever wanted to be your equal. l will not fight you, Brother! l'm not your brother. l never was.
Loki, this is madness. ls it madness? ls it?
Come on. What happened to you on Earth that turned you so soft?
Don't tell me it was that woman. lt was!
Well, maybe, when we're finished here, l'll pay her a visit myself!
Thor!
Brother, please.
Enough!
Look at you, the Mighty Thor, with all your strength, and what good does it do you now?
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!
What are you doing? lf you destroy the bridge, you'll never see her again!
Forgive me, Jane. l could have done it, Father! l could have done it!
For you!
For all of us!
No, Loki.
Loki, no.
No!
No. lt's gone.
And then, with a mighty bellow, l flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low! ls that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass?
As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...
My Queen, l'm so sorry for your loss.
How is he?
He mourns for his brother.
And...
He misses her.
The mortal.
You'll be a wise king.
There will never be a wiser king than you.
Or a better father. l have much to learn. l know that now.
Someday, perhaps, l shall make you proud.
You've already made me proud.
So Earth is lost to us.
No.
There is always hope.
Can you see her?
Yes. l have the particle detectors!
Darcy, do you have the S.H.l.E.L.D. satellite codes?
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?
How is she? ln the car. Come on, Jane!
She searches for you.
Dr Selvig.
So you're the man behind all this? lt's quite a labyrinth. l was thinking they're taking me down here to kill me. l've been hearing about the New Mexico situation.
Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than l am. l have a lot to work with.
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension. lt's unprecedented. lsn't it?
Legend tells us one thing, history, another.
But every now and then, we find something that belongs to both.
What is it?
Power, Doctor. lf we can figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power.
Well, l guess that's worth a look.
On October 13, 2008, Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing
283 minutes of filmed material.
This film is a rough-cut version of that material.
Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated.
A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic.
They concluded that it was authentic.
Ready?
Turn on the radio.
- Johanna, do you have sound?
- Yes.
This isn't working.
Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda.
A hunting party arrived there today.
The leader of the hunting party had the following to say:
We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly.
Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us.
Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses.
I know every single bear hunter in Norway.
That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter.
If he's gunning for our bear, he's breaking the law.
- Have you ever seen him?
- We see him all over.
If I see him again, there'll be consequences.
He's nothing but a poacher.
- What would you like to tell him?
- To lay his cards on the table.
Drive!
- There's too much traffic.
- We're going to lose him!
Ready?
We know his name is Hans, but we have no last name.
Thomas, try being more serious.
But what is he doing in Volda?
Who is he?
- Do we have sound?
- You haven't plugged in the...
You won't get an interview with a poacher.
I don't like it when you ridicule him.
That's great!
Thank you. Bye.
Thomas, that poacher is staying at the campground!
I can't say I know him, but he is here.
He's staying right over here.
Want me to show you?
I don't know what that smell is, but his camper sure reeks!
- What are all those things?
- I have no idea.
Thyme?
He drives off and stays out all night.
He's never back before sunrise.
- He stays out all night?
- Yes. Every night.
- In good spirits?
- Sure.
We don't know when or if he'll show up.
- There he is!
- I'm filming. Just ask him directly.
Hi. My name's Thomas.
We're from Volda College.
Could we ask you a few questions?
Get lost.
Maybe we could come back...
- Did it work?
- Quiet, I hear something.
Yes, I'm on my way out now.
I expect to find it tonight.
Okay, fine. Bye.
- He isn't here.
- He was right in front of us!
Sure, but...
- Shit!
- Nice work, Thomas.
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.
Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling.
And there's a shotgun.
We're on our way to where a bear was just found shot.
Could he have been the shooter?
Lord knows where this one came from.
I've checked with every registered bear hunter I know.
None of them shot this one.
The bear population is managed by the state.
So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss.
Look at this.
These tracks don't match the way a bear normally walks.
I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here.
- That's weird.
- I agree. Very weird.
You're from the Wildlife Board.
Finn Haugan, right?
These hunters say those aren't bear tracks.
That's ridiculous.
What else would they be?
There is a bear right there, with tracks all around it.
- But why are they in doubt?
- Ask them! It's crazy.
We have waited for Hans for hours, but now he's finally moving.
We think he's heading somewhere, and we are going to follow him.
Go!
It looks like he's heading for the ferry.
How long are we going to keep following him?
Can you see what he's carrying?
It's a car tire.
- What's he doing?
- I can't tell.
Three, two, one, and...
Sogn og Fjordane county!
Okay, he's over there.
Just hide here.
We met a little while back.
- Really?
- Thomas, from Volda College.
- Is that...
- Are you following me?
We just want to ask you a couple of questions.
No.
Are you...
What were you doing in Volda?
Did you shoot that bear?
Stay the hell away from me.
Turn that off.
Leave me alone!
Once we get what we need, we can go back.
It would be so awesome to get him to talk.
We have tried, plenty of times.
Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try?
Left arm or right foot?
The one you kick with?
We have been here all afternoon.
I think he's sleeping in his trailer.
So now we wait until something happens.
Are you serious?
Okay.
I have to get my sound gear.
What is this?
"No trespassing. Blasting area."
Did you see that?
Was that a road?
Did you?
This road is horrible.
If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers, your ass is first...
- I'm not...
- Stop whining.
- I'm just being honest.
- Want to go back?
- Fine by me.
- That's not what I meant.
Hey, wait for me!
Look here.
I don't think he's in his car.
- So we know he's here...
- But what is he up to?
Here's a trail.
- I hear something in the distance.
- What?
Troll!!!
Thomas!
Hurry!
My car is right over here!
- What?
- Something bit me!
- Are you all right?
- It stings.
- You heard him yell "troll," right?
- Shut up.
You need some more.
- Can I help?
- There's gauze in the first-aid kit.
- Ow! Don't...
- We have to get this out.
You look like hell, Thomas.
- What the hell was that?
- Tetanus shot.
You yelled something back there in the woods.
- You heard him, Johanna.
- What's this slime?
What did he say?
- More?
- Yes.
Can you give us a ride to our car?
It isn't very smart to follow me.
Did you yell "troll" out there?
- Is that your car?
- What the hell?
- What happened?
- That's our car!
Someone crushed our car.
It's completely demolished.
Look at this, Thomas.
- Hans, do you understand this?
- I have an idea.
Okay, what...
A bear didn't do this.
What do you think happened?
- What...
- Ask him if a troll did it.
Hey, if you know what happened to my car, you should say so!
- You yelled "troll".
- Forget about that!
What the hell do you want?
You want me to say trolls exist, on film?
- You find that funny?
- No, but you don't actually believe...
If you want a ride, you'd better come right now.
- What should we do?
- I think I'll walk.
You have our bags?
Just so we get this straight: you actually believe trolls exist?
Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you?
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping?
Thanks for giving us a ride.
We'd love to join you, and film what you do.
We'd be very interested.
I'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you, on one condition:
You do exactly as I say, no matter what I say. Okay?
Yes.
I feel like I'm bleeding everywhere.
- Are you admiring your wound?
- Yuck! Don't film that!
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.
- Why call them?
- To tell them where we are.
He isn't dangerous, just weird.
Remember, he runs the show.
We do exactly as he says.
Then we'll get our footage.
No one here believes in God or Jesus?
Nope. None of us.
Don't look at me.
Serious? Because they can smell
"the blood of a Christian man"?
Is that alright?
Close the gate and hang up that sign.
NO TRESPASSING.
BLASTING AREA.
- Is this a land mine?
- Yes. But it isn't armed.
I'm sitting on a land mine?
Are you nuts?
Anyone who doesn't want to join me?
Who's changed their mind?
Who's afraid of trolls?
- No.
- No? Good.
Go down to that creek, take off all your clothes, and scrub yourselves.
- Especially your armpits and groin.
- No way!
- Why?
- To remove any body odor.
Then rub this all over yourselves and your clothes.
- What is that?
- Troll stench.
- Rub it all over your bodies.
- It reeks! No way. Forget about it.
You have to smell like a troll, or they'll smell us and run away.
Christ!
- No. No way!
- I'm not doing this, Thomas.
Forget about it!
You agreed to do exactly as I said.
If you don't do it,
I'll go up there alone and leave you here.
Is that understood?
Are you ready?
You're all greased up?
You look cute.
Here, flashlights for you.
- What is that?
- A big flash bulb, basically.
Hans? That weapon.
How do you use it?
It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam.
UVB rays. The same as the sun, or a tanning lamp.
Don't you know sunlight turns them to stone, Thomas?
- Right. Or they explode.
- Haven't you read anything?
I read fairy tales when I was a kid, but... Did you know that, Kalle?
So, what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you?
Eating contest?
Fairy tales usually don't match reality.
They seem to in this case.
- Troll piss.
- Christ!
You can smell it all the way over here.
Listen, I'm hunting a Ringlefinch.
There's piss everywhere.
He's marking. Looks like he's been chased from his territory.
He seems sick. I'd like to find out what's wrong with him.
A blood sample from the troll?
I don't have the right equipment.
You too. Bye.
I need help to find out what's wrong.
But a blood sample...
That won't be easy.
Who were you talking to?
A veterinarian.
A vet!
If you wait here,
I'll try to chase the troll out.
Is this what you imagined?
I bet it's going to take him some time to find a troll out there.
I feel sorry for him if he really believes in trolls.
Maybe he's filming us.
- That's probably what he's doing.
- He's somewhere laughing at us.
While we sit here like idiots.
Lingonberry?
- In the woods?
- Yes, with no food or water.
- Cool!
- What?
It's a night-vision camera.
Listen!
That's just him.
One week, or being bitten by a bear.
- It makes for a good story.
- You would look ridiculous!
- So I think I'll choose that.
- Being bitten by a bear?
Do you feel that?
I'm picking up some strange sounds.
What is that?
Seriously.
What's going on?
What is this?
This is one real bad joke.
It's a Tosserlad!
Get the hell out of here!
Run, dammit!
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Where did it go?
Do you see it?
Get behind my car!
No!
- Give me the camera!
- No!
Where is Johanna?
Thomas! Kalle!
- Johanna!
- It's real!
I told you so!
I knew it!
They are real!
- Say something.
- It's been turned to stone!
We ran through the woods...
Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian?
The way that troll sniffed around...
Obviously one of you believes in God.
I don't believe in God.
I sang in a church teen choir...
But that's because my parents forced me to.
I don't believe in God.
I'm serious.
- I can tell it's not her.
- What? How?
Knock it off. That was some genetically-engineered monster.
- That's a troll.
- Nonsense!
Question!
Why doesn't anybody know about this?
Because someone doesn't want people to know.
The government?
Is the government behind this?
Do you work for them?
- Why show it to us now?
- Because I'm tired of this shitty job.
I have no rights whatsoever.
I get no night bonus.
No overtime.
No nuisance compensation.
Maybe it's time for a change in troll management.
- So if you could get this on TV...
- That shouldn't be a problem.
Come on.
You want to see more of these, learn what's really going on?
You might want to step back.
Holy shit!
Anyone need some gravel?
Who the hell is that?
- Who is that?
- I don't know.
Hi there.
It's that guy we filmed...
What is this, Hans?
A film crew?
They wanted to see some trolls.
Aren't you that guy from the Wildlife Board?
This is an exceptionally bad idea.
Turn off that camera.
I have enough problems.
The valley is full of dead cattle.
I can't talk about this on film.
Turn off that camera.
- Put it down.
- We're allowed to film here.
- Sure you're on top of this?
- Totally.
As soon as the scapegoat arrives,
I will take care of the rest.
PIOTER'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE
The Ringlefinch is still out there.
Then find it!
Two German tourists disappeared last night.
- We expect to lose a few more.
- That isn't my problem.
If you think I'll let you keep those recordings, you're wrong!
It says "Pioter's Polish Paint Service".
What exactly is your job description?
My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory
- and comes near people.
- How often do they break out?
Rarely. This is a special situation.
Too many trolls are out and about.
Finn is a... bureaucrat.
He works for TSS.
His primary job is to prevent...
To keep people from knowing that trolls exist.
In one sense, you are a true Norwegian hero.
No, you're wrong about that.
There's nothing heroic about what I do.
It's dirty work.
How can no one know about this?
Let's take these recordings, drive to Oslo, and sell them for a fortune.
We can't do that yet.
We have to keep following him.
Finn is pissed off.
- Now what?
- Breakfast.
- You should eat something too.
- I'm not hungry.
I feel a little... nauseous.
How many types of troll are there?
You have two main groups: mountain trolls and woodland trolls.
The subgroups include
Ringlefinch, Tosserlad, Rimetosser.
Mountain Kings.
The Harding, out west.
But that troll we saw...
Do they all have three heads?
No, there are many variations.
The heads develop as they age.
They aren't born with three.
They are usually born with one.
The others appear later.
They only have an eye in the middle, the original, head.
The other heads aren't really heads.
They're a sort of protuberance.
Their function is to scare other trolls.
Or impress the females.
What is that form?
- What does TSS stand for?
- Troll Security Service.
We have to fill out this form after each kill.
Location, gender, whether it blew up or turned to stone...
SLAYED TROLL FORM
In fairy tales, trolls wear clothes and talk like people.
- They're just like people.
- Fairy tales are for kids.
Trolls are animals.
Predators.
They eat, shit and mate.
Eat anything they can.
- How old can trolls get?
- 1000, 1200 years.
- And their intelligence level?
- In the pits. They are not bright.
They manage to eat.
But how hard is it to survive on rocks?
I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail.
His head between his legs, he tried to suck down his own tail.
He started gagging on it, tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel.
- I was a Navy Ranger.
- And that led you to troll hunting?
No, they were looking for someone who could...
- So you're the only one in Norway?
- Yes.
Are we leaving?
- They eat all sorts of crap.
- Do they eat people?
- You want to offer yourself?
- No. But have they eaten people?
- Are those troll tails?
- Yes. Some skinned, some whole.
- Why?
- So it smells like troll in here.
Why do you want a troll smell?
So I can approach the trolls without them noticing.
- Tanning lamps?
- Yes.
- You can get skin cancer.
- I use sunscreen.
I have trouble sleeping in the dark.
- Is that what we rubbed on ourselves?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Concentrated troll stench.
A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll.
Let's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county.
Two German tourists were found killed by a bear.
Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy.
Do you know where the troll might be?
No.
What are you looking for?
Rock slides, toppled trees, things like that.
See anything?
- Do I look like that famous painting?
- Yeah.
Maybe you should see a doctor?
- Do you really feel sick?
- It comes and goes.
- Are we safe here?
- They only come out at night.
Kalle, can't we...
It hasn't been triggered.
Some small trolls have taken the bait.
Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination.
- Do it now!
- Now?
Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch...
Hans thinks he has found tracks.
Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby.
Hans thinks there's a link between the two.
Hurry up!
Global warming has led to changes...
in our flora and fauna.
These tracks you see around here... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden.
The bear stores its food here under the bridge.
- Isn't that strange behavior?
- Not for Russian bears.
Due to the long, hard winters, they store their food. Just like squirrels.
Aren't these tracks a little strange?
That's the left foot.
And the right foot is over here.
Has the bear walked cross-legged?
I assume you have seen bear tracks before.
Hey, what about those tracks?
He's gnawed at the bark.
Typical Ringlefinch behavior.
He'll be back tonight.
I have something to lure him with.
- And then you'll kill him?
- Yes.
But first, I need to get that blood sample.
Is this the syringe?
This is horrible!
It's cruelty to animals.
Cruelty?
He's just using them as bait.
You're too far away.
Move closer.
No, I'll just zoom.
We can see fine from here.
What working hours...
We've been here forever.
Maybe no troll will show up?
- We can see fine from here.
- But we can see better from there!
Come on.
It's here.
Hear that?
Run!
God, I hate this crap!
Keep your distance.
I'm about to toss out some Christian man's blood.
Move back!
Shit!
Kalle! Thomas!
Move! Move over!
Are you alright?
Hey...
Are you alright?
Help him up.
- Come on, Hans.
- Are you alright?
Careful with that red button.
Give me the syringe.
Stay up there.
Now we know that trolls also explode.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
Could've been worse.
Just a little sore.
A little sore?
This is crazy!
At least I got the blood sample.
I'll be there in a half hour.
Thanks. Bye.
You look like a newborn!
It's just a film team.
They have some questions.
ARDAL PET CLINIC
- Is that the blood?
- Yes.
- It was quite a struggle.
- I can tell.
You're a mess!
- Thanks.
- There's a bathroom in there.
- What do you see?
- There aren't enough red blood cells.
This will take me a couple of days.
Could we have a short interview?
If you could just stand... or maybe sit over there.
- What should I tell them?
- Everything.
- We aren't allowed.
- I take full responsibility.
The trolls' main problem is that they can't convert vitamin D from the sunlight, into calcium.
So when they are exposed to bright sunlight, their bodies overreact.
Their stomachs expand.
Gases are forced into their intestines and veins.
This becomes unbearable.
- And they explode?
- They explode.
- But some trolls turn to stone.
- Yes, the older ones.
Their veins are too constricted, so the expansion occurs in their bones.
In a matter of seconds, everything calcifies and they turn to stone.
I wish they didn't have to experience such pain.
It is traumatic for them, even though it only takes a few seconds.
We would have preferred to give them an injection.
- I'll have the results in a few days.
- And you'll call me?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ready to go?
- Sure.
- Why all these local newspapers?
- To collect information.
- About what?
- Trolls.
Accidents and things that have happened, that trolls are behind.
- I have files back there.
- Can I take a look?
- "Road disappeared."
- People want natural explanations.
But if you know what to look for, you'll see what's caused by trolls.
This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head.
Are there trolls that big?
Yes, the Jotnar.
I'm the only person to have seen one.
There's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau.
And one on the Hardanger plateau.
Three in Jotunheimen, one in Dovre.
We have to find out where the problem lies.
Jotunheimen is closest.
We are on our way to the first territory
Hans wants to check.
At the moment, we are circling around the territory.
The territory ends up here, and because this tire is intact...
Hans says no trolls have left this territory.
If they had left, they would have gnawed on this tire.
Smile!
Film over there.
Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires.
One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here, but failed.
- How many trolls are there?
- Impossible to say.
You must have some idea?
The gestation period is 10 to 15 years.
And they only have one kid.
- Are they mammals?
- Yes.
Let's see...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
This looks fine. All the stones are in the same position.
This is apparently a battle area.
Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here.
They throw stones at each other.
But there has been little activity here lately.
The guy behind us is paying.
Isn't that what they say?
Remember that big Jotnar?
They live here in Jotunheimen.
- Where?
- Inside the mountains.
- What are we doing?
- Just wait here.
I ate an entire loaf of bread.
Finn refuses to give in.
He claims all the runaways are from Dovre.
Because he doesn't see any in this satellite photo.
But you can't see trolls in satellite photos!
Let's get to the bottom of this.
We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently.
Hans thinks it's troll related.
Wow, look at that!
Did you get that?
- What happened here?
- A tornado.
- Did you see it happen?
- No.
Look at the position of those trees.
They should all point in the same direction.
Who showed you that map?
They didn't say who they were.
But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images.
And we saw what looked like a tornado.
At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward.
How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this?
We'll come back tonight.
Head into the woods.
I'm tired.
- I don't like this.
- Let's stick together.
Seriously, Kalle.
We have to follow him.
What do you think we should do?
There are tracks further in.
Here's their trail.
They've passed through here.
- We can't stay here alone.
- This way!
An abandoned mine.
- They've been here.
- I'm not going in there!
There aren't any trolls there now.
Come on.
- Are you sure?
- Sure.
No, there's nobody home.
I need the troll stench.
- Here.
- I can take the camera.
Everything okay?
A whole pack of trolls lives here.
This is a lair.
- We can leave.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go.
Come on!
I'm coming!
Closer to the wall!
Head back inside!
Quick, in here!
Turn off your flashlights!
I have to get out of here.
- Do you have any more troll stench?
- No, not here.
Just relax. Breathe easy.
Calm down.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm Christian!
- We're going to die!
- Damn!
You'd better not start sweating!
Dear Lord...
Shut up!
Run!
Sunlight!
It still works.
There are more in there.
I'll have to get them later.
Mountain Kings.
Why didn't he just say he was Christian?
I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away.
I can give you a ride down, if you want to quit.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for those tapes.
In my trailer?
- Are you filming?
- No.
- It's out of control.
- Why aren't you up there?
I refuse to go into their territory.
There's no way.
- Turn off that camera.
- It's off.
But don't people have a right to know?
- What is your job?
- That's confidential information.
Why don't we have a right to know?
People are dying!
Why is this so secret?
- People have a right to know.
- No.
- Hands off the camera.
- This is none of your business.
Yes, this happens to be my business!
- Get lost!
- This isn't over.
I'm going to check it out.
Do you want to join me?
- Yes.
- Are you ready for that?
- Yes.
- Okay, let's keep on filming.
Let's find a new camera and continue.
Here comes our new camerawoman.
Malica.
- Malica.
- Thomas.
You are not Christian.
- You don't believe in Jesus or God?
- I'm a Muslim.
Excellent.
Muslim is okay, right?
I honestly don't know.
We'll see what happens.
- It must be okay.
- We're filming musk oxen, right?
No, not exactly.
- Let's go.
- Yes, we might as well.
We'll explain on the way.
- Where have you worked?
- Norwegian TV, BBC...
- I just filmed some lions in Tanzania.
- Lions. Good.
I've never seen anything like this.
Holy shit.
They've broken every single tree over several acres.
I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here.
A giant, over 200 feet tall, has chased the Dovre trolls down here.
We don't want Jotnars running around.
Give me a break.
Do you all actually believe in trolls?
You think a squirrel rampaged through here?
If only the trolls were happy.
But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything.
Those may look like normal power lines, but they're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay.
I don't know how they broke through.
I'll have to check.
Let's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid.
- Do they know about the trolls?
- No way.
Have you had any problems up in Dovre?
Yes, you could say that.
You can hang your coats here.
Over here.
Several hundred meters of power line, knocked to the ground. 300,000 volts.
- When did this happen?
- Three weeks ago.
- Do you know how it happened?
- No. No one does.
Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes. We have no clue.
- Is this a school project?
- Yes. Volda College.
- Are you a teacher?
- No.
Where does that line go?
It runs from here... then north, in a loop, and back to here.
- So it runs in a circle?
- Yes, exactly.
You don't find that strange?
Maybe a little.
- Yes, it is strange.
- The power leads to nowhere.
Well, it does lead in a circle.
And in a beautiful landscape.
If a Jotnar runs through a power line, something is seriously wrong.
I'd better get up there and try to find it.
The territory starts there.
It's hell to put up new pylons.
Activists and farmers always complain.
I think they're pretty.
Those were placed out here as food for trolls.
This is the territory.
We have been here.
And here.
And no sign of trolls.
I think we should try this area next.
There's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait.
Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena, while others...
... more than 1000 quakes registered...
We are in a troll territory now.
You don't seem to like entering these territories.
Is there some particular reason?
There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell.
Back in the '70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area.
Both the TSS and I tried to object, but to no avail.
I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls.
Every last one.
Pregnant females. Kids.
Newborns that hadn't even learned to walk.
It was a massacre.
Hans' entire life has revolved around trolls.
Every day has been a struggle with and for trolls.
In many ways, he is a superhero here in Norway.
What would we have done without him?
That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie.
My shoulder.
Are you alright?
The sun will be up in an hour.
Should we go too?
He sounds a bit big, but I'll give it a shot.
It sounds like he's snapped completely.
This could be problematic.
Your phone is ringing, Hans.
- Where is it?
- On my seat.
Thomas speaking.
He's a little busy right now.
Can I...
Rabies?
- That Ringlefinch had rabies.
- Let me talk to Hilde.
Hi Hilde.
Are you sure?
That makes sense.
Okay.
You take care too.
Bye.
I'll bet all the trolls we've met had rabies.
This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings.
- And even to you, Thomas.
- Me?
I don't have rabies.
Hello!
Dogs have rabies.
If you have rabies, you have to get to a hospital.
If you think he has rabies, he needs medical attention!
I don't have rabies.
You can't just say I have rabies!
If so, we need a hospital now!
- That beast is on its way. Get inside!
- I couldn't care less!
- We can't stay in here.
- Look!
Is it coming this way?
Go outside?
Are you crazy?
He's leaving!
Don't move!
I'll try to lure him this way.
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What is he doing?
What's happening?
The flash ran out of power.
Definitely rabies.
Can we go to the hospital now?
- No, he needs a few more doses.
- What are you talking about?
But first I have to wear him out.
He's closing in on us!
- Now we're getting away!
- Good.
- There's somebody up ahead!
- Stop, Hans!
- Get in!
- Hurry, dammit!
Go! Go!
- Where are you going?
- Stay here!
- Hans!
- Get back inside!
Oh my God!
Get back in the car!
- Who are you?
- A seismologist.
I have to get in front of him.
Look out!
Is it on?
Hans, what are you doing?
I have to give him the finishing blow!
- With that?
- Yes.
I hope you have all the footage you need.
This road will lead you to the highway.
There's no more roaring!
Malica...
Stop fooling around.
That's troll on tape.
Here is the footage.
Am I bleeding?
What did you say?
- Are you okay?
- Sure, I'm fine.
Look!
Over there!
Isn't that Finn and the others?
Shit, it's Finn.
Give me the camera!
Thomas, what are you doing?
The recordings end here.
No body was ever found in the mine and the teenagers behind the recordings have vanished without a trace.
We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station.
It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service.
However, an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25, 2010.
The press didn't get the point.
We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can.
Few people find power grids attractive.
I certainly don't.
Norwegians are pro electricity, but against power lines.
That won't work in the long run.
Norway has trolls, so more power lines are needed.
- That's just the way it is.
- That's a wrap!

Twenty-seven patents your father has.
It means ownership.
Ownership of ideas.
You gotta sew 'em up.
Get 'em by the nuts...

We'll be rich.
You make yourself what you are.

You promise you'll do it without having to ask what it is?
Just have the confidence that what your father asks of you is right?
Yes, sir.
For the next half hour, will you not speak unless you have something important to say?
What'd you do today, my fine feathered friend?
Sit on the front two inches of your chair.
Better for your posture.
I read that in the paper.
Did you actually buy this from Mr. Ledbetter?
Don't explain.
Just nod... yes or no.
- Hmm?
- No.
Be quiet.
What did you say?
Please.

It was an experiment!

Liar.
Never do it again.
Promise?

- Did this morning.
- No, I was just pretending.
- Gonna call me a liar?
- No.
I don't want to fight.
Afraid to?
No, I just don't wanna.
If I was to say you're scared, would you call me a liar?
No.
[Jack]
Then you're scared, aren't you?
[Grunting, Laughing]
Aha!
Quit it.
Come here.
[Footsteps]

Come here!
No!
I'm not gonna do everything you tell me to.
I'm gonna do what I want.
What do you know?
You let him run all over you.
[Young Jack]
How do I get back... where they are?
[Horn Honks]
- How are you, Son?
- Good.
This one's heavy.
You're gonna need two hands for that one.
Whoa.
Careful now.
You know what that...
- Chinese?
- Know what that...That's Chinese.
That's very good.
Yes, it is.
Your father went all around the world, all the way to China.
That's Pan Am airlines.
That's what your father flew on.
The entire bathrooms are stainless steel, even the washbasin.
[Giggles] I feel confident the deal's going through.
If not, they can forget it.
I'll tell them all to go to hell.
- That's from Germany.
- How do you use them?
[Father]
See that?
Put that down, Son.
Can Cayler come over?
Is your family not good enough for you?
[Door Closes]
- [Patrons Chattering] - Hope it's not gonna take as long as last time.
Al dente.
[Father] Subjective point of view.
You know the difference?
"Subjective" means it comes from your mind.
Can't be proven by other people.
- Mwah.
- [Laughs]
So... Here you go.
Mm, mm, oop, oop, oop.
[Laughs]
- Good to see you again.
- Okay.
Let's go, boys.
Come on.
There are things you can't do?
Well, there are things
I can't do either.
You are not to call me "Dad."
You will call me "Father."
- But...
- But... Don't interrupt!
- But you do.
- Don't interrupt!
It's your house.
You can kick me out whenever you want to.

What was it you showed me?
I didn't know how to name you then.
But I see it was you.
Always you were calling me.
[Father] I wanted to be loved because I was great.
A big man.
I'm nothin'.
Look... at the glory around us.
Trees and birds.
I lived in shame.
I dishonored it all and didn't notice the glory.
I'm a foolish man.
They're closing the plant.
They gave me a choice.
No job... or a transfer to a job nobody wants.

Always you wrestle inside me.
Always you will.
You know, Jack, all I ever wanted for you was... to make you strong and... and grow up and be your own boss.
Maybe I've been tough on you.
I'm not proud of that.
I'm as bad as you are.
I'm more like you than her.
You boys are about all I've done in life.

I don't know, feels like a grave.
Their queen is here.
And we have our orders.
It's a trap.
This is what is known.
There has always been man.
And there have always been vampires.
Since the beginning, the two have been locked in conflict.
The vampire's were quicker, stronger.
But man had the sun.
It was not enough.
And so it went like this over many years.
The two races destroying not only each other ... but the world itself.
Facing extinction, mankind withdrew behind walled cities under the protection of the Church.
And then the ultimate weapon was found, the priests.
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained by the Church in the art of vampire combat.
They alone turned the tide to man.
The remaining vampires were placed on reservations.
And fearing the power of the weapon they created ... the ruling clergy ordered the priests disbanded.
The former warriors to be integrated back into a society that no longer needed them.
And as the years passed, the few surviving priests faded into obscurity...
...like the vampire menace before them.
Residual radiation is still spotty, but the soil contamination is close to zero.
With a little luck, we can finally start planting.
I'm proud of you, Owen.
Great, stew again.
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?
Wearing the nicest dress, where else would you have been all day, but church?
I was in town.
I figure someone here needs a life outside this outpost.
I thought I said I didn't want you to spending so much time out there.
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.
I know it's hard, but we all have to make sacrifices.
Sacrifices?!
You mean living out here like a prisoner?!
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!
Just that someday you might be able to grow something in these godforsaken lands?
Enough!
Bow your heads and say grace.
Dear Lord, we thank you for what we are about to receive...
- Daddy?
- Shush!
- Owen?
- Tear down below!
What's going on?!
Hurry child!
Hurry!
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.
Oh, my god!
Get behind me!
Shannon!
God protects you, the
Church protects you.
The city protects you.
Absolution is the only way.
Absolution is the only way.
Remember, to against the Church, means to go against God.
Confession room 5 is free.
Move forward.
Initiate confessional sequence.
Please speak at the tone.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again
- about the war.
- Tell me more.
We were in the hives, like always.
Each fell, and I wasn't strong enough.
Tell me more.
I have questions, doubts.
The Devil comes in many shapes.
The best way to combat him, is through personnel sacrifice... and a long day's labor.
Yes, Father.
Now say three Hail Mary's and four Our Father's.
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?
It's a tattoo.
Did it hurt?
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.
They took Lucy. Your brother is hurt bad.
He told me where to find you.
- And Shannon?
- No.
Lucy talked about you.
Said you were a hero during the war.
Said that when it came to killing vampires, you were the best.
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.
Just thought I should let you know in case you wanted to come along.
Figure I could use someone like you by my side.
Okay.
Thank you for meeting me in such short notice, Monsignors.
Monsignor Chamberlain has informed us of the situation.
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.
I come before you because I need my authority reinstated.
On what grounds?
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?
Nonsense, we've had no reports of any escapes from the reservations.
This is obviously the work of wasteland bandits.
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands are heavens for the lawless and the immoral...
To send a priest out there after such a lot would be both ridiculous and futile.
This is best left to the local authority.
Monsignor Orelas, this man has been of great service to the Church.
If it weren't for the priest we would have been overrun by the...
We are well aware of his accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.
Thank you, you may sit.
I am begging you.
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.
And the citizens from the cities have complete faith in the Church's ability to keep them safe.
- You will not shake that faith.
- How good is that faith, when it's a lie?
Questioning the authority of the clergy is absolutely forbidden.
If you take any action to leave the cities... it will be seem as an act of aggression against the Church.
You will be stripped from the order and excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?
I said, do I make myself clear, father?
Yes, Monsignor.
Try to remember your vow. To go against the Church, is to go against God.
Come on now. Don't be shy.
Give us a kiss.
That's no way to treat a friend.
Please, let me go...
You're in here for your own protection.
If I let you out, you'll be torn apart, piece by piece.
My uncle's a priest, he'll come after me.
Really?
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.
He'll come after you!
Well that's something
I'm absolutely counting on.
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.
I sacrificed everything to serve them.
- And they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.
You and the other priests did your jobs.
It's not over, not for me.
You can't break your covenant on a small ... group of savages, it would be sacrilege.
I have to.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!
If you go out there right now, you risk stirring things up again.
You have to look at the bigger picture, it's for the greater good.
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.
But it's the only world we have left.
I'm begging you, don't do anything foolish.
Remember your vow. To go against the Church, is to go against God.
Then I go against God.
God help us.
Dear Father, forgive me.
It was never my intention to offend you.
I would like to firmly resolve with the help of your grace... to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
But I can't.
Looting's not such a good idea mister.
Well, I'll be damned.
Vampires are a vicious lie!
I have seen a vampire bite a man clean in half.
Salvation is right here in my very hands.
Authenticated by the clergy themselves...
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...
I'm tired of you comin' around here, scaring people, selling your superstition.
The show is over, and it's time for you to go.
Give me one good reason why I should.
That's one... two...
Alright. Alright, alright!
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You all listen up!
This stuff is good for nothin'... but lining for that man's pockets for your hard earned cash!
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.
Move out of the way!
I don't blame any of you for being scared, but the vampires are gone and they're not coming back.
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't to common out here.
Is it true what they say about priests?
You wield the hand of God?
How is he?
He's awake.
Your clergy took away a boy... and returned an old man.
After the war was over...
Shannon figured you'd come back.
I wanted to.
Didn't seem right any more.
I couldn't save her.
I tried, but I've never had your gift.
You gave her a life
I no longer could.
I will always be grateful to you for that.
You know there ain't one day that went by, where I wished she'd forget about you.
You find Lucy, you bring her home safe.
And you promise me something brother.
Kill 'em all.
Most people out there know that the clergy thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.
And that's how we like it. It means that they tend to keep their noses out of our business.
So you can imagine how surprised I was when they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.
Saying that anyone going after Lucy is to be arrested immediately.
Said she's in God's hands now.
Problem is, we both now outside a week Lucy will be dead... or worse, infected.
So with all due respect to god...
You're wasting your time.
No, no! You're not cutting me out of this!
I'm the one that came and got you!
People in this town don't think you can keep them safe here.
What makes you think you'll do any good out there?
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.
We leave at dawn.
What's with all the bullets anyway?
I thought priests didn't use firearms.
We don't.
They're for you.
You have been called to serve once more.
One of your own has broken his sacred vow.
His actions are a threat to the entire order.
You will find him and bring him back to me.
Dead or alive.
Then I will teach transgressed your ways and return them back to you.
Save me from blood guilt... and god who saves me and my tongue... will sing of your righteousness... in my mouth declare your prays...
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random... in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a time, but these are two by two.
Must have been some of the familiars.
Vampires don't bring familiars in the hunt, they slow them down.
All this... this was something else.
Tracks head north.
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.
Mangshane Reservation.
Nothing but red-outs and rejects.
They're a fallen tribe.
Either way, we don't have much time to get in and out.
No guards.
I thought familiars were illegal.
Nobody really enforces it, as long as it's voluntary.
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.
Drifters that want to get infected.
I mean becoming a vampire so they may live among them.
These people get all sorts of strange ideas.
As long as they keep to themselves... it makes no difference to me.
You're not welcome here, Priest.
These lands are protected.
No! I got this.
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.
It's the way we like it. Nice... and quiet.
Good, we're sure we won't have any trouble.
They excrete it, use it to build the hives.
I guess now we know what happened to the guards.
No. No, no, you must not...
The Master will be angry...
Where's the girl?
I don't know what you're talking about. Please! Please!
The Master doesn't feed humans anymore.
Yeah, tell that to the guards.
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...
Where is she?
Shit!
Priest! Priest!
Save your bullets.
Now, we can do this the easy way or...
God. I always preferred the hard way.
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.
They once ruled this land, they were warriors, they were Gods.
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.
Then 10 seconds is all I need.
You're too late, Priest.
It is their time now.
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?
You're gonna need it.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
- I will fear no evil,
- Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.
For thou art with me.
Focus!
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.
No more masters, just you and me.
Tell me where they took the girl.
- West. They took her west.
- Why?
You have no idea what's coming, Priest.
The familiar said they travel west from here.
- Solar mirror.
- A hive?
One of the largest.
But I thought all of the hives were liquidated after the war.
They were.
That's why we need to go look.
There are more than 50 creeps in this reservation.
But only 6 vampires left. The weak.
They left behind.
We find the missing one, we find Lucy.
I may not have seen the war... but I know the look a man gets when he likes killing.
It comes easy to you.
It just comes.
Easy's got nothing to do with it.
Give me your gun.
- What?
- Give me your gun.
Vampires don't move like humans.
Their body weight pulls them in concentric patterns.
You need to anticipate their trajectory to get a kill shot.
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.
There are always two points.
A and B.
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.
A man came aboard.
Says he got something for you.
You told me to come.
I have information, but I... before I tell you, I hate to bring this up.
But there is this small little matter of compensation.
Now, you've been really good for business.
So I am more than willing to cut you a deal.
I can smell the blood running through you veins?
Smells like dinner.
Okay. Alright.
After you snatched the girl, a couple of nights later, a priest showed up.
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff, real hard case. He run me out of town before I could make a single sell.
- You've done well.
- Thank you.
There's your compensation.
Put him to work.
I used to ride out a lot here when I was little.
Stared at all this stuff.
Wondered what it used to be.
After a while, it just made my eyes ache.
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?
No, no.
She wanted to tell him, but...
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.
Besides, he was so focused on his work there wasn't much room for anything else.
Do you love her?
You know if she's infected...
I'll kill her.
You'll try... but you won't be able to.
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.
This is a waste of time, there's nothing here.
Stay here, if anything comes up that isn't me, shoot it.
Great.
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.
They sent four of us to track you.
We split up at Nightshade.
I rode out here and hoped they didn't have you.
The others went up to Jericho.
I didn't believe it when they told me you broke your vow.
They left me no choice.
Hicks!
What the hell is that thing?
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!
It's too big to get down here.
Which is the only reason you're still alive.
Who the hell is that?
Are you ready?
Hey!
Not bad.
Point A, meet point fucking B.
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?
Does the lawman know what you'll do if she's infected?
He knows.
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.
It's been hard all these years... not seeing the others, not talking.
Sector 7 was the only place I could find work.
Waste management.
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."
I heard that, too.
I didn't come here to bring you back.
I came here to warn you.
There are nights when I wake up...
I think I'm back on the red mines.
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched like, like I'm ready for something.
Nights like that,
I don't go back to sleep.
I have bad dreams.
Me, too.
There are other nights, the good nights...
I dream about other things.
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.
My God.
They bread a new army.
Where did they all go?
Only one way to find out.
Are priests allowed to have relations?
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...
I was a young girl when the Clergy found me.
What about him?
His talents developed later.
He was nearly you're age when the Clergy came for him.
That made his sacrifice greater than most.
The air is changing.
Well, there's your answer.
They dug right through the mountain and... made a hole big enough to fit an army through.
What town is that?
It's Jericho.
Where'd you say the others went?
What the hell?
Hello?!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
Let's begin.
I don't see anything.
Brothers, you have a choice.
You can follow in my footsteps or you can follow in his.
We're too late.
We separate. Go through each building, and see what we find.
There's nobody left. Not a soul.
Too many mouths to feed.
Killing three priests? What kind of vampire could do something like that?
Nothing we've ever seen before.
How could they take an entire town over night, and vanish by sunrise?
There are no other hives around here, no reservations.
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.
It starts in the Dunkirk mine above Augustine.
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.
Heading back to the cities would be suicide, right?
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.
Not anymore.
Without us, they're defenseless.
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.
Whoever took Lucy knew that you'd come for her... and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.
They must have been picking up different factions along the way, moving during the day and feeding at night.
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.
Train carrying an army of vampires?
What chance do we have stopping something like that?
I'll overtake the train and blow the rail-line.
You two get aboard and find Lucy.
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have to stop that train before it reaches the cities.
You must be starving.
You haven't eaten in days.
Have you ever had a real roast duck?
It's very rare, very exotic.
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.
I want to be free from a life of suffering and sacrifice.
To no longer be told that your every desire is a sin.
And after all, if you're not committing sin, you're no longer having fun.
What are you?
The Church teaches us that the eyes are the window to the soul... and since the vampire evolved without eyes, it is a soulless creature... to be eradicated.
And I have seen the soul of the vampire.
And let me tell you... it is far more pure than that of any man.
Now you ask me what I am?
I am the bringer of the tide...
I am the wave to wash clean this unclean world.
And you and your priest... will help me do it.
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?
If she's infected?
She talked about him.
Said she never got to known him.
She wanted to.
What kind of man would kill his own flesh and blood?
If she becomes a familiar, she's no ones flesh and blood.
Not anymore.
I've held on to it all these years... to remind me of everything they've stripped away from us.
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...
Today when we ride,
I want you to remember our power doesn't come from the Church... it comes from God.
With or without the Clergy, we're still priests.
I can't.
When I heard what happened to Shannon...
I prayed for her salvation.
And then I prayed for mine.
Because in the darkness of my heart...
I hoped her death would free you at last.
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.
Tell me, or I will shoot you where you stand.
It would be easier to face you bullet here than face what may lie up ahead.
Why do you even care?
She is nothing but a stranger to you.
She's his daughter.
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.
The child needed a father.
We all made sacrifices.
Hicks.
If you do this, it won't matter if you find Lucy.
It won't stop the train, and you won't be able to save her.
You won't save her.
We ride out and meet this together.
When the time comes, you blow the tracks and then you get out of there!
What if you're still on the train?
Good-luck.
Focus!
Holy shit.
Hello, my friend.
- You fell!
- You let go!
In the depths of that hive, I crossed the threshold between life and death.
And do you know what I found?
The queen we had come to kill, my angel of mercy.
She turned me into something that had never existed in this world.
A human vampire.
Join me.
Accept the blood of the queen.
And together we can return to the cities... as brothers.
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.
You can't win.
I'm stronger now than you ever were.
This is your last chance, Priest.
The queens hands have not been idle.
Mankind will find no quarter from what's coming.
Join me, and your life of sacrifice will be over.
Never.
Hicks!
Lucy!
- Fuck.
- Did you find her?
I couldn't get close.
They took her to the front.
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.
Don't let it go to your head.
- Hicks!
- Lucy!
No!
Stop it!
No, Lucy!
Very good!
Fast.
Just like your father.
He never told you?
Oh, god!
Burn.
At this time of need, strengthen me.
You are my refuge and strength...
I do not fear, for you are with me.
I won't let you go!
Your faith has failed you!
No!
For the life of the flesh is in the blood.
And I have given it to you upon the altar... to make atonement for your souls.
How dare you come back to this holy place?
A man who would defy the Church, for his own selfish crusade!
Look inside the burning train just behind these cities walls... you'll find hundreds more like it.
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!
This man is a charlatan.
A risk to the security of the cities.
There is no vampire menace!
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.
It's just beginning.
I've notified the others. We'll meet you at the rendezvous at City 7.
Godspeed!

The monks were trying to find God, so they made magic...
Magic seeds. Aye.
I remember now.
"With seeds they pulled from a magical pod...
...the monks grew a pathway to seek out their God.

...was heaven's gate...
...they met with a terrible, grisly fate.

Keep reading, Mother. It's just a story.
Is it?
"King Erik...
...bade the monks return to dark arts...
...to find some way...
...to rule giant hearts.
So they melted one down...
...mixed in magic and more...
...and they crafted a crown unlike any before."

They won't, son.

Well, I guess the king's Guardians...
- ...will have to cut them down to size.
- I wanna be a Guardian.
You have the spirit.
No doubt about that.

...of noble blood. There's not much in ours but dirt and sweat.

Giants aren't real.
<font color="#808080">ISABELLE:</font> But King Erik was real.
He was.
In some ways, he still is.
- You're of his blood.
- I've seen where he's buried.

Sounds like you've been having...
...some adventures of your own.
- Am I in trouble?
- Not at all.
I want you to have adventures.
- It'll make you a better queen.
- How?
Because you'll get to see how the world works.
And when you're queen, you'll have the power to make the world a better place.

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, a baby girl was born.
Her skin was pure as snow.
Her hair was dark as night.
- (BABY CRYING)
- They called her Snow White.
Probably because that was
the most pretentious name
they could come up with.
As fate would have it,
Snow White's mother died in childbirth.
Left on his own...
- (GIRL GIGGLING)
- ... her father spoiled the young girl.
He could afford to, of course.
He was the king.
The king loved his daughter,
- and all his subjects loved him.
- (CROWD CHEERING)
The kingdom was a happy place,
where people danced
and sang day and night.
Apparently,
no one had a job back then.
Just singing and dancing
all day and all night.
But I digress.
The king raised
the little girl by himself,
grooming her to one day lead.
But over time, he realized
there were some things
he couldn't teach her.
So he sought out a new queen.
This queen was
the most beautiful woman in the world.
She was intelligent and strong.
And just to clarify, she was me.
And this is my story. Not hers.
Bewitched by my beauty,
the king begged me to marry him.
I was everything to him:
The stars, the moon.
But a dark magic invaded the land.
The brave king bid farewell
to Snow White,
leaving her his favorite dagger.
An interesting gift,
but more on that later.
He rode off into the dark woods
and, sadly, was never seen again.
Snow White searched and searched
for her father,
and when she realized
he was truly gone,
she was devastated.
The girl was now left under the care
of the beautiful queen.
Ten years passed, and Snow White
grew older and blossomed.
But the kingdom fell into an icy despair
as the queen realized,
if she wanted to remain
the most beautiful woman in all the land,
well, Snow would have to do
what snow does best.
Snow would have to fall.
Well, hello there.

- that I've been hearing.
- Rumors?
Well, there have been rumblings that the kingdom is close to destitute.

- (SCOFFS)
...I feel the gentry would be reassured that the kingdom was stable once again.
Brighton, a word, please.
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Loose lips sink ships.
Yes, indeed,
Your Majesty, exactly.
Which ship would you like sunk?
It's an expression, Brighton.
A royal decree. Take it down.
- Ah, marvelous.
- Any busybodies...
...caught rumoring, gossiping, whispering, or even thinking shall be put to death.
- How does that sound?
- It's decisive.
Snow White.
Is there a fire?
I'm sorry?
Is your bedroom on fire?
Because I'm searching for an explanation as to why you would be out of your bedroom and in here, and my first guess was fire.
I thought maybe I could come to the gala, you know, because today is my 18th birthday.
Is it, now? Oh, my, oh, my.
E to F-3, please.
Snow White, maybe it is time I ease up on you. Hmm?
After all, you've done nothing to me, caused no problems.
And yet...
...there is something about you that's just so incredibly...
...irritating.
I don't know what it is.
The slumped shoulders.
The hair, that voice... Mm!
I know what it is.
- I think it is the hair.
- (GASPS)

Your Highness think we're going home?

- The village idiot used to call us that.
- (ALL MUTTERING)
Take you the whole day to come up with that?
It doesn't matter!
You're short, and it's funny.
Funny? Not as funny as my blade against your throat.
Ease back.
All we want is his gold.
- I've got his saddlebag.
- Now we're talking!
Let's look in there.
Come on, get it open.
- That is not your property!
- Eh, whatever.
- Get your hands off of that immediately!
- Give them what they want, sire.
Nonsense. Apparently somebody has to teach a lesson to these children!
No one is to know the details, Renbock.
Understood?
- Say it!
- (GRUNTS)
No one needs to know the details,
Your Royal Highness.
ALL: Happy birthday, Snow!
- You remembered.
- Of course we remembered.
A girl's 18th birthday is the most important birthday of them all.
Do you want to know what I wish for your birthday, Snow White?
You can't make a wish for me.
Do you know why I continue to work for that wretched queen year after year?
I do it because I know that one day you are going to take back your kingdom, and I want to be here when that happens.
- It is not my kingdom.
- Oh, but it is.
Your father meant for you to inerit his crown.
And that woman has the entire kingdom convinced that you're a pathetic shut-in, incapable of leaving the castle.
And the worst is, she has you thinking it.
Your father's dagger.
I had it cleaned up and polished.
What would I do with this?
Perhaps you need to see for yourself what goes on in your kingdom.
WOMAN: The people don't
sing and dance anymore.
They need to see who you really are.
And you need to believe.
- I'm going out.
- Is she allowed to go out?
I don't know. Is she?
- OK...
- She's going out!
I won't say anything if you don't.
- Pinky swear?
- Pinky swear.
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall.
Can you believe that baron?
I mean, honestly, did he really think
I would consider marrying him?
A woman has standards, after all, and an exalted woman like myself has very high standards.
- Interesting.
- What is?
Your response to his proposal.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Consider the options.
Well, this option has a receding hairline, smells like rotten eggs, and I wouldn't be caught dead with him.
You've spent so much supporting your vanity, you can't afford to say no.
Then why don't you snap your fingers and make me a chest of gold, hm?
Everyone has magic within them, but very few discover it and learn to spend it wisely.
Trust me. I am, after all, merely a reflection of you.
Well, not an exact reflection.
(WHISPERS) I have no wrinkles.
They're not wrinkles, just crinkles.
As you wish.
What do you suggest I do?
I suggest you marry someone rich. Quickly.
Because one day soon, you will ask me who the fairest of them all is,
- and you won't like the answer.
- (HUFFS)
RENBOCK: Hello?
Is anybody out there?
MAN: Shut up, Renbock.
Nobody can hear you in the woods.
- RENBOCK: On the off chance...
- MAN: That there's somebody else
- in these miserable woods?
- RENBOCK: Well, there could be.
- Is that tone?
- RENBOCK: No, it's not tone.
- I was repeating...
- MAN: You did it in a very smart way.
I did not! I don't like being this close to you. I've told you before.
I was warned what I might find in these woods, but...
MAN: I picked the worst traveling companion.
...I never imagined this!
- (LAUGHS)
- Who laughs at us?
We are in dire need of your help, ma'am.
- We were ambushed by seven dwarfs...
- Bloodthirsty giants.
- Giants?
- We were outnumbered, we fought bravely, but they cheated.
Young lady, if you would be so kind as to help myself and the honorable Prince...
- (GRUNTING, COUGHING)
- Prince of Embarrassment.
Fool! I'm but a humble commoner.
- Now, we order you to release us.
- Order me?
If you refuse, you shall suffer dire consequences.
Only if you say please.
Given the circumstances, sir,
I think a please is in order.
You're right.
Where are my manners?
- Please.
- That's all you had to say.
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you so much!
No, no, no! Wait! No!
- (GRUNTING)
- Oh!
- Are you all right? Can I help at all?
- (BOTH GRUNTING)
- Oh, yes, please.
- Yes. That's it.
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, oh! Oh.
Um... Do you want some help with the rope?
Yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry you had to see us in such a compromising position.
We're going north.
Oh, I'm... I'm traveling south.
- It's a shame.
- Yes, it is.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- (GIGGLES)
Uh...
Then I guess we must bid you adieu.
Hm.
She turned around. Did you see that?
No. I don't think she's interested, sir.
- BRIGHTON: Your Highness?
- Yes.
Pardon, Your Majesty, but... you have a visitor.
I'm not in the mood, Brighton.
He's young, handsome...
...and semi-nude.
Your Highness, may I present to you the esteemed
Prince Alcott of Valencia.
Your Majesty.
Please pardon our dress.
I'm afraid my valet and I were robbed by bandits as we entered your kingdom.
Bandits? How awful.
How absolutely terrifying and smooth and hairy.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Nothing.
Could I trouble you for a covering?
Perhaps a shirt?
If you must.
Um...
- Um...
- (WHISPERS) Brighton.
- Brighton.
- Your Majesty.
The prince is bashful and requires, sadly, a covering.
- BRIGHTON: Of course, milady.
- I'm not bashful.
Sir, is there any particular style of shirt you'd like?
Brighton.
A simple covering.
A simple covering it is.
Valencia, you say.
I've never heard of it.
Is it a wee hamlet?
No, quite the contrary.
It's a bountiful province.
We have many natural resources.
Gold, silver, bustling silk trade.
You don't say.
Send out the invites.
Alert the caterer.
I want you to organize a ball like this kingdom has never seen before.
We are gonna sweep this kid right off his feet.
Uh... Forgive me, Your Majesty, but I don't understand.
Brighton, the prince is rich.
He's built like an ox.
I'm going to marry him, and then my financial problems will be... solved.
No, I understand that part.
What I don't understand is how you intend to pay for the party.
It pains me to say this, but you're broke, my Queen.
Then go collect more taxes.
Your Majesty, I don't know the last time you were in the town, but the people are starving.
Do you have no imagination?
Go tell the villagers that bread is meat, less is more, blah, blah, blah.
Commoners love a good metaphor.
Just go sell it.
"Bread is meat."
- (WHISPERS) OK, go.
- Excuse me.
Do you have anything to eat?
What happened here?
I visited once with my father.
It was a wonderful place.
People always seemed to be singing and dancing.
That must have been many years ago.
- BRIGHTON: Yah! Yah!
- (HORSE NEIGHS)
Whoa!
- More taxes?
- Good, you can read.
Make sure they are collected in a timely fashion.
What's she doing with all our money?
- Protecting you.
- From what?
Must I remind you of the brutal attacks we have suffered?
- He speaks of...
- The beast!
Yes. Evil lurks in the dark woods, more hideous than you could ever imagine.
The only reason it hasn't gorged itself on all of you...
...is because your tax dollars are hard at work.
I'll be back tomorrow for the money.
You will return as quickly as possible and you will bring with you a platoon of castle guards.
Just look how she's dressed me, sire.
Like a pink profiterole.
That reminds me. We need clothes.
And gold. An army.
Clothes? Why? Do you not like the queers taste in mers fashion?
Have you been listening to anything I've said?
Yes. Soldiers, gold, clothes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Good.
- Only if you say please.
Please, Renbock.
Sire, I implore you to come back with me now. This queen radiates crazy.
You know these women always get crazy when there's a prince around.
No. There's
"I'm in the same room as a prince" crazy, and then there's just good old-fashioned, plain, traditional psycho crazy.
I fear she's the latter.
Safe travels, Renbock. And when you return, I pray you're wearing your pants.
Well, I will pray the same for you, sire. I bid you adieu.
SNOW WHITE: Baker Margaret!
Baker Margaret!
Margaret, it's worse than you could ever imagine!
- You saw the town?
- Yes. It's awful.
The queen has destroyed everything my father believed in.
Oh... (WHISPERS) Go on.
She's taxing them more as we speak, even though they have nothing.
That's to pay for all her lavish parties.
She's throwing another one tonight.
For a prince.
- A prince is here?
- And, Snow, it's said he has an army.
Well, maybe he could help us.
If he truly has an army, maybe he could help us take back the kingdom.
My goodness.
Someone's had quite a day.
You're gonna have an even bigger night.
You're gonna crash that ball.
BRIGHTON: You look fabulous,
Your Majesty.
"Fabulous"? Brighton,
I haven't even begun to get ready yet.
Well, then, one can only imagine how fabulous...
- Shut up, Brighton.
- With pleasure.
The treatment is ready.
Treatment?
Isn't that a trifle excessive?
There's no such thing.
- (BIRD SQUAWKING)
- (FLATULENT SOUNDS)
Try not to enjoy this, baker lady.
I'll do my best.
(WHISPERS) Tightening, brightening.
Tightening and brightening.
Ahh.
- Happy place, happy place.
- (BUZZING)
Oh, that's always the worst part.
Hm.
I can feel you smiling.
MAN: Her Majesty the Queen!
His Royal Highness,
- the Prince of Valencia!
- (SCATTERED GASPS)
In folklore, the rabbit is known to use cunning and trickery to outwit his enemies.
Or perhaps you prefer your guests feel out of control and slightly uncomfortable.
Handsome and smart.
How confusing.
- Hey, kid. Scram.
- (WALTZ PLAYING)
- You.
- You!
- You're here.
- (STAMMERING) I am. I'm here.
But... you're the prince?
I'm sorry. Seeing you in this dress has caused me to lose my words.
Well, at least it doesn't cause you to lose your pants.
(SIGHS) I mean, when I met you first, you werert wearing pants.
Yes.
Well, at least now you're dressed... up...
...like a bunny.
- MAN: Sorry.
Apparently it's a rabbit.
Something about trickery and enemies and cunning.
Oh, OK.
- I look like an idiot.
- Yes, a little bit.
- So, what are you...
- Doing in the palace? Um...
I live here.
I have for a while, actually.
- I'm kind of the princess.
- What? You didn't tell me that.
- You never told me you're a prince.
- (MAN GASPING)
I feared I looked ridiculous.
- Said the prince in the bunny hat.
- (GIGGLES)
- Arert we supposed to be changing?
- Yes, I believe so.
- Oh! Sorry!
- (EXCLAIMING)
- I'm so sorry!
- No, no, no, it's OK.
- Forgive me.
- No, forgive me.
The truth is, I didn't just come here to dance tonight.
- I need your help.
- Anything. I'm at your disposal.
SNOW WHITE: It's the queen.
Ever since my father died, she's terrorized the people and ruined the land.
And I would hope that a good-hearted prince like yourself would...
I have to go.
- Brighton.
- Right away.
MAN: Sir...
- (MUSIC STOPS)
- (APPLAUSE)
You sneaky little tart.
What were you doing, talking to my prince?
- Your prince?
- And where did you get such a dress?
Do you want to talk about my dress or what you did to the village?
Good for you, Snow White!
Someone's been taking their confidence pills, hmm?
Do it again.
Say it again. Come on.
Oh, you're no fun!
Brighton, you do it.
Do you want to talk about my dress or about what you did to the village?
Not irritating enough.
Come on. Say it again.
Be more irritating, more infuriating. Hmm?
(HIGH VOICE) Do you want to talk about my dress or about what you did to the village?
Actually, you're both irritating.
I've been there.
I've seen what you did to the people.
You left the castle grounds?
Wow. Snow White breaking all the rules today, hmm?
- That's a punishable offense, you know.
- By whose law?
You have no right to rule the way you do.
- Hm.
- And technically,
I'm the rightful leader of this kingdom.
Mmm.
Probably not the best thing you could have said just there.
I want her killed.
Killed? Your Majesty, isn't that a bit rash?
She is a threat to everything.
Take her to the woods and feed her to the beast.
Is this about the dress?
- BRIGHTON: Keep moving.
- SNOW WHITE: Just let me go.
I swear you'll never see me again.
You think I want to be here?
You brought this on yourself.
You never should have upstaged the queen, and now we're both paying the price.
Stop.
- Brighton, please.
- Turn around.
- (RUSTLING)
- (GASPS)
Please. Brighton, I'm afraid.
I don't want to die like my father did.
Your father was a good man.
He was always very kind to me.
In return, I shall give you one small piece of advice.
Run. Run as fast as you can and as far away from here as possible.
- Just run.
- (BRANCHES CRACKLING)
Like this. Run!
- Brighton!
- Run!
(MUTTERS) What am I going to do?
I've got to figure some way out.
- She'll never believe me.
- QUEEN: Brighton.
- Brighton!
- Coming! Coming.
- Your Majesty?
- Is it done?
Oh! Just as you instructed.
That's her liver, her kidneys, her spleen...
- That's disgusting.
...and a few other assorted parts.
I'll admit... I'm impressed.
You're not as pathetic and wimpy as I have always believed.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Wow, I feel amazing!
Positively lightheaded.
I'm just glad to see you in such a good mood.
Yes! We must release the news of the tragedy, right?
The usual stuff. You know,
"struck down in her youth," "terrible loss."
We'll fly the flags at half-mast.
Flags throughout the kingdom, or just within the palace grounds?
That's too much trouble.
Forget the flags.
Her parts! Your dagger.
- Night-night.
- Night-night.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
Glory!
She's awake.
Who are you?
We ask the questions here.
Who are you?
My name is Snow White.
ALL: Snow White?
- That's not possible.
- Snow White's a defective troll.
Yeah. They keep her locked up in the tower.
Maybe this is a different Snow White.
- Huh?
- It's not such an uncommon name.
If you're Snow White, then...
...who's your father?
- The king.
- She is Snow White, see?
- Eh.
I say never trust anyone over four feet.
Yeah. Let's drag her back out to the woods and pretend like we didn't see nothing!
No, you fools! She's a princess.
- That means she's valuable.
- We should hold her for ransom.
- She's won'th gold.
- Maybe we should get to know her first.
You won't get any gold for me.
They want me dead.
The queen sent me out here to be killed by the beast.
Why would the queen want you dead?
Because she's wicked.
- She's evil.
- (MURMURS OF ASSENT)
- She's a witch.
- Do you remember that time?
Sorry, but we have an appointment to keep.
So it's time for girlie to shuffle along.
Oh, wait! You can't just kick me out.
I have nowhere else to go.
Look. If the queen finds you here, she'll kill us, too.
Mm-hmm.
All I'm asking is to spend one night. Please.
Huddle!
All right, you guys, let me hear it.
All those in favor of letting the girl stay, say "aye."
Aye.
- Opposed?
- Nay.
Tough luck, Your Highness.
Sorry, Snow White.
All votes need to be unanimous.
- One night.
- Thank you.
Come on, guys. Duty calls.
Wait! I don't even know your names.
I'm Butcher.
Will Grimm.
Half Pint.
Napoleon.
Grub.
Chuck.
But you can call him Chuckles.
Stay focused, and no more arguing.
Maybe I should stay back with her.
I think she might be uncomfortable.
- No.
- And I'm Wolf.
Boys...
...I like her.
- Yeah, me, too.
She'll bring a feminine touch.
If you ask me, she's just gonna bring the queers guards.
- You think she has a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Me.
Snow White is dead.
One of God's great mysteries is His plan for each and every one of us.
(MUTTERS) Speed it up.
Snow White lived, she died,
God rest her soul. Amen.
There will be a buffet lunch served at 2:00.
Magistrate, I've come for the taxes.
The people cannot bear this much longer.
Are you seriously going to argue about money on this day of grieving?
That's odd.
What do we have here?
Looks like a royal to me.
Are you a royal?
No, no. Not a royal, just a humble servant.
You're riding in the queers sled.
No. This is a rental.
Well, you're wearing royal garments.
These tired old rags?
You boys have got to get out of the woods more often.
What's in that pretty sack?
My lunch.
Good, I'm famished.
What are we eating?
Boys! The mother Iode!
Give me that!
That money belongs to the queen!
Don't spend it all in one place.
Nothing like an honest day's work.
Beats working down a mine.
Welcome home.
Lamb. Carrots. Gravy.
- I say she's a keeper.
- Sure she is.
Oh, man!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Why do you have palace guard uniforms?
- We got them at work.
- What kind of job do you have?
We're... renegades.
- Rebels.
- Thieves!
That's true.
We stole the queers gold!
You broke into the palace?
No, we nabbed it outside the village.
So you actually stole the people's gold.
- Not exactly.
- Yes, exactly!
That's the people's money!
Why, that's terrible. They need it.
- You must return it.
- We worked hard for that money.
Stealing isn't work.
- Sure it's work!
- It's hard!
I tore my shirt, had to sew it.
That's work.
I'm sorry you got a few scrapes, but the townspeople need that money.
They hate us.
- Well, that can't be true.
- It is. They despise us.
Years ago, when the queen expelled all the "undesirables"...
...no one stood up for us.
She said...
"Banish all the Uglies."
You've been mistreated by the queen.
No one understands that better than me.
It's unfair, but so is stealing from innocent families.
We werert always thieves.
- We were legitimate.
- With real trades.
- I was a teacher.
- I was a butcher.
And I ran the pub.
A good, honest job.
- Honest?
- It was almost honest.
- I stole a little.
- A little?
- It's a cash business!
- That's your excuse?
Hey, everybody does it, all right?
- I didn't.
- Neither did I.
Uh, you put your thumb on the scale!
- I did not!
- Did too! And you cheat at poker!
- I win at poker.
- You cheat at poker?
- (YELLS)
- (CHATTER STOPS)
Where's the gold?
- Whoa!
- Move it!
- Come on, let's get the stilts.
- Forget the stilts! Come on!
Good thing she's in that dress, otherwise we'd never catch her!
My friends, our money has been returned!
It was brought back to us by...
Come up here, young lady, and tell us your name.
- I'm...
- BUTCHER: That belongs to us!
Hold on a second!
- Those men there!
- Move!
SNOW WHITE: Those men...
They're the ones that brought back the gold.
The queen told you that they were undesirables, but she lied.
Huh?
These brave men are the true heroes.
They fearlessly raided the queers caravan and...
...and retrieved your gold.
They're the ones that really deserve your thanks.
- Yay!
- (APPLAUSE)
Yay!
- Yeah!
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
Are you enjoying the quail?
Mm. It looks delicious,
Your Highness. Thank you.
I could barely hear you all the way down there. (CHUCKLES)
You know, everyone has remarked what a wonderful dancer you were last night.
Thank you, Your Highness.
I do have one question about the evening.
There was a girl there.
She had black hair and was very beautiful.
Beautiful?
Yes, I'd say she was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Ever is a very long time.
No, no, no, I know this in my heart.
I think she's the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Agree to disagree.
Let's leave it at that.
But do you know her?
Ivory skin, black hair...
Her hair is not black, it's raven, and she's 18 years old, and her skin has never seen the sun, so of course it's good.
Meaning to say, the girl you refer to is called Snow White.
Snow White.
I admit, she's very suited to the name.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
Most unfortunate case, really.
The child...
(WHISPERING)... wasrt all there.
I'm sorry, Highness, you're speaking about her in past tense?
Oh, I am.
How indelicate of me. She's dead.
- Dead?
- Mm.
- How?
- Last night, in the woods.
Oh. Treacherous place, the woods.
- This is terrible.
- Do you need a second?
Yes, thank you,
I just need to process.
Prince Alcott,
I have a proposition for you.
We're both single adults, roughly the same age.
- I don't think we're the same...
- I said roughly.
The point is, the clock is ticking for both of us.
We are people of means.
Would you do me the honor and be my...
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- A moment, please!
What?
Pardon my appearance, Your Majesty, but there's been a development.
- The royal taxes have been stolen.
- Stolen? By whom?
- Bandits.
- Bandits.
Uh-huh, bandits.
- Very intimidating.
- I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore.
Enough of these cowardly muggers!
Justice must prevail.
Wait. Wait!
Well, thank you, Brighton.
(WHISPERS) This close!
- (WHISTLES) Huddle!
- The deal's off. She stole our money.
ALL: You can stay.
- (SIGHS)
- But we've got conditions.
If you're going to live with us, you have to be one of us.
I have to be a dwarf?
No. You have to be a thief.
I feel I've been clear about my thoughts on stealing.
What if you were stealing from the queen?
You said yourself she's wicked.
- Somebody has to stop her.
- Why not you?
Why not us?
I mean us.
But this time I have conditions.
Whatever we steal goes back to the people.
- Minus a small commission.
- Butcher!
Fine. But she doesn't know the first thing about thieving!
Then we'll teach her.
We'll teach her to believe.
People think you can't be tall if you're short.
That you can't be strong if you're not.
A weakness is only a weakness
if you think of it that way.
Never, under any circumstances, give up the high ground.
That one?
Before you even draw your sword, you must make an impression on your enemy.
If he is deceived by the way you look,
- the battle's half won.
- (GRUNTING)
People think of you as sweet.
They don't expect you to fight dirty.
- Use that to your advantage.
- Whoo! Yes!
Concentrate.
GRIMM: Your weapon
isn't your only friend.
Sorry.
The environment can be an ally, too.
Deception on the battlefield
isn't just an option.
You're so cute when you're mad.
Oftentimes it's the difference between victory and defeat.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Ow!
- (YELLING)
- (GRUNTS)
SNOW WHITE: I'm sorry.
But you deserved it.
This is where we were ambushed last time.
Keep your eyes open.
Oh! Oh, dear! (GASPING)
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
I'll be out of your way in a moment.
Oh, dear!
Ma'am, may I offer you any assistance?
Oh, no! Sorry, sir!
Everything's all right. I'll just be...
- It's you.
- It's you.
- I thought you were dead.
- I almost was.
- Give us your valuables!
- Stay behind me. You'll be safe.

I like the hat.
I just picked it up.
Did you remember your revolver?
Knew I forgot something.
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.
I think that's quite enough.
You are a doctor, after all.
Always nice to see you. Watson.
Where's the inspector?
He's getting his troops lined up.
HOLMES:
That could be all day.

Sherlock Holmes.
And his loyal dog.
Tell me, doctor...
...as a medical man.
Have you enjoyed my work?
Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.

Watson. Don't.
Observe.
How did you see that?
Because I was looking for it.

Lord Blackwood.
You seem surprised.
I'd say the girl deserves your attention more than he.
Indeed.
Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boy-o.
Good lad.

We've one for the doctor...
...and one for the rope.
- Clarkie?

Put her in the back of the Moriah.

Right, lads. That's it.
POLICEMAN 2: Right. Pick him up, lads.
POLICEMAN 3: Yes, sir.
If you don't mind.
Get him out of my sight.
And you were supposed to wait for my orders.
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor.
Besides, the girl's parents hired me.
Not the Yard.
Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me.
Well. London will breathe a sigh of relief.
Indeed. Congratulations. Lestrade.
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

MAN 1: Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.
WATSON:
156 over 80. Very good.
MAN 2: My nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you.
Tell me something.
Your new premises...
...when are you moving in?
I should be in within the week.
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.
[GUNSHOTS]
Good God.
- That was gunfire.
- No.
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?
My colleague's probably just putting up a painting.
I'll... I'll go and check.
- Your colleague...
- Yes?
Won't be moving with you, will he?
No, he won't.
Mrs. Hudson.
I won't go in.
Not while he's got a gun in his hand.
You don't have to. Give me the paper.
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.
He just needs another case. That's all.
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know.
Not in a domestic environment.
[GUNSHOT]
Thank you. Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?
- Same time next week.
HUDSON: Come along, captain.
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.
Permission to enter the armory?
HOLMES:
Granted.
Watson. I am in the process of inventing a device...
...that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.
[HOLMES YELLS]
WATSON:
It's not working.
Can I see that?
[FIRE WHISTLING]
You know, it's been three months...
...since your last case.
HOLMES: Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...
[HOLMES YELLS]
Don't you think it's time you found another one?
I can't but agree.
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.
The sooner, the better.
Paper.
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.
Is it November?
Yes. Holmes. All right.
Lady Radford reports...
Oh, her emerald bracelet has disappeared.
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies.
Oh. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
Yes.
It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
[DOOR OPENS]
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...
There's only one case that intrigues me at present:
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson.
The absentee landlady.
I've been studying her comings and goings.
They appear most sinister.
Tea. Mr. Holmes?
Is it poisoned, nanny?
There's enough of that in you already.
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...
...as per usual, nanny.
He's killed the dog. Again.
WATSON:
What have you done to Gladstone now?
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.
He doesn't mind.
Holmes, as your doctor...
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.
There's nothing of interest for me out there, on earth, at all.
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.
Mary's coming.
- Not available.
- You're meeting her. Holmes.
Have you proposed yet?
- No. I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.
It's happening, whether you like it or not.
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.
You wear a jacket.
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
A man? Outside my house?
Straighten your tie.
[WATCH TICKING]
WATSON: Holmes.
- Mm.
You're early.
Fashionably.
Miss Mary Morstan.
My goodness. What a pleasure.
I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly.
Pleasure is mine.
It really is quite a thrill to meet you.
Mr. Holmes.
I've heard so much about you.
I have a pile of detective novels at home.
- Wilkie Collins. Poe.
- It's true.
It can seem a little far-fetched though sometimes...
...making grand assumptions out of tiny details.
That's not quite right, is it?
In fact, the little details are by far the most important.
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.
A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war...
...so I can assume he's a decorated soldier.
Strong, brave.
Born to be a man of action.
And neat, like all military men.
Now. I check his pockets.
Ah. A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.
He's cost us the rent more than once.
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes.
You know John very well.
What about a complete stranger?
- What can you tell about me?
- You?
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.
- I insist.
- You insist?
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.
- You're a governess.
- Well done.
Yes, well done. Shall we...?
- Waiter?
- Your student...
...is a boy of 8.
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- HOLMES: Charlie, huh?
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.
Is there ink on my face?
There's nothing wrong with your face.
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.
India blue's nearly impossible to wash off.
A very impetuous act by the boy.
But you're too experienced to react rashly...
...which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that.
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.
The jewels you are not wearing tell us more.
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.
The ring is gone.
But the lighter skin suggests...
...that you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly...
...until you were informed of its true, modest worth.
You broke off the engagement...
...and returned to England for better prospects.
A doctor, perhaps.
Right on all counts. Mr. Holmes.
Apart from one.
I didn't leave him.
He died.
Well done, old boy.
[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.
McMURDO:
Get up and fight.
Fight.
- Finish it.
McMURDO: Come on.
Get up and fight, come on.
Come on.
Get up.
MAN 1:
Get up and fight.
That's it, big man, we're done.
You won, congratulations.
We ain't done yet.
[McMURDO SPITS]
HOLMES: This mustn't register
on an emotional level.
First, distract target.
Then block his blind jab.
Counter with cross to left cheek.
Siscombobulate.
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block, and body shot.
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.
Now fracture.
Break cracked ribs.
Traumatize solar plexus.
Dislocate jaw entirely.
Heel kick to diaphragm.
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...
...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...
...full psychological recovery,
six months...
...capacity to spit at back of head...
...neutralized.
[YELLING STOPS]
MAN 2:
Where did that come from?
[MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN:
What the hell's going on here. Charlie?
Lord Blackwood's put him under some kind of spell, sir.
It's like he's burning from the inside out.
You lot, shut up!
Charlie. Charlie!
Take this man to the infirmary, now.
What's this all about, then. Blackwood?
There's someone I want to see.
[STRUMMING VIOLIN]
- Watson?
WATSON: Right.
Let's go.
What started merely as an experiment...
...has brought me to the threshold of a monumental discovery.
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...
...there's no measurable response.
You do know what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery?
But, now...
...and this is remarkable...
...if I change to atonal clusters...
...voila, they fly in counterclockwise.
Synchronized concentric circles...
...as though a regimented flock.
Watson, this is exceptional.
I, using musical theory.
Have created order out of chaos.
How did you lure them in?
Excellent question.
Individually. I've been at it for six hours.
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.
You are Blackwood's last request.
Look at those towering structures.
It's the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge ever attempted.
Most innovative.
What an industrious empire.
Hm?
Oh. I have your winnings from last night.
You weren't there.
So I made your customary bet.
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook.
Locked safely away in my drawer.
Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni?
I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.
[SIGHS]
You have the grand gift of silence.
Watson.
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
[GROANS]
I knew she'd been engaged.
She had told me.
So that's no to the opera, then?
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.
I want it back.
[CHATTERING]
This way. Mr. Holmes.
Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.
Which I'm certain will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching.
Care to come along?
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.
Suit yourself, mother hen.
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.
As though...
...he can get inside their heads.
I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform.
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.
BLACKWOOD:
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up...
...having seven heads and 10 horns.
Upon his heads were the name of blasphemy.
They worshiped the dragon.
Which gave power.
They worshiped, saying.
"Who is like unto the beast?"
The beast which I saw was like a leopard.
His feet were of a bear.
His mouth was of a lion...
...and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority.
I love what you've done with the place.
So glad you could accept my invitation.
I just have a small point of concern.
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.
While my heart went out to the families of the victims...
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush.
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...
...your work in the crypt was more akin to a finger painting.
So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot.
Either that or, um...
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company.
Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly's led to this moment.
Your error of judgment is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all.
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.
You see.
Five lives might have been spared.
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.
Hm.
Sacrifice.
Five meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain.
After you're hanged, of course.
I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant.
Then you, too.
Could serve a greater purpose.
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.
I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.
You and I are bound together on a journey...
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.
But beneath your mask of logic.
I sense a fragility.
That worries me.
Steel your mind. Holmes.
I need you.
You've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.
Pay attention.
Three more will die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.
You must accept that this is beyond your control...
...or, by the time you realize you made all of this possible...
...it'll be the last sane thought in your head.
What did he want?
Not sure.
But I don't think you're needed. Father.
Not for this one.
MAN:
Lord Henry Blackwood...
...you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic...
...the unholy murder of five innocent young women...
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.
Do you have any final words?
Death...
...is only the beginning.
PRIEST:
...Forever and ever. Amen.
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.
ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.
I much prefer to travel in the winter.
Here. I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...
...and your favorite...
...olives from the Cyclades.
Thought we might have a little tea party.
And while I was setting the table.
I found this:
A file with my name on it.
"Theft of Velazquez portrait from king of Spain."
"Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...
...Hapsburg prince to Romanov princess."
I was simply studying your methods...
...should the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
Ah.
But I don't see my name in any of these articles.
But your signature was clear.
Is that the maharajah's missing diamond?
Or just another souvenir?
Let's not dwell on the past.
Shall we?
By the looks of things.
You're between jobs.
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?
He was boring and jealous.
And he snored.
I'm Irene Adler again.
[FARTING]
Thank you.
[SNIFFING]
I need your help.
I need you to find someone.
Why are you always so suspicious?
Shall I answer chronologically or alphabetically?
Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope.
I think you'll find all the information you need inside.
Who are you working for?
So I'll have to find out the hard way?
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.
Well, consider it a wager that you will.
Do you remember The Grand?
They gave me our old room.
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.
Ma'am.
- He'll do it.
MAN 1: Well done. Miss Adler.
That's precisely why I hired you.
I wager he'll have our man within the next 24 hours.
MAN 1:
He'd better.
Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing.
He's essential to my plan.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
MAN 3: What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.
A little rifle range would go a long way, sir...
...rubbing the calluses off these German bands.
God save the queen.
God save the queen, sir.
MAN 2:
Get off out of it.
Look at you.
Why is the only woman you've cared about a criminal?
Are you a masochist?
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.
She's the only adversary who ever outsmarted you. Twice.
Made a proper idiot out of you.
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?
It doesn't matter.
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.
She could sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
That's of no consequence to you, is it?
We've done our last case together.
WATSON:
I've already read it.
Missing person:
Luke Reordan. 4 foot 10.
Red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.
- Midget.
- Do you agree?
No. I don't agree.
It's more than technicality, you see.
You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples.
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No. I am simply stating that one has...
What were you doing?
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.
[YELLS]
WATSON:
Holmes. Where are you going?
[CRASHING AND GLASS SHATTERING]
HOLMES:
Watson.
Watson.
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.
Oh. My lucky day.
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?
Don't move.
Now, what have we got here?
[ADLER GASPS]
It's...
Thank you.
That's the Irene I know.
WOMAN:
Good boy.
This man intrigues me. Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.
She's scared of him.
Yet she works for him.
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...
...but I advise you leave the case alone.
Well. I may not have a choice.
After all. I may be paying the rent on my own soon, thanks to you.
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.
Get what's in your hand out of my face.
CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me at once.
What's he done now.
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."
No, "you" means you.
CLARK:
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...
Well...
...it appears he's come back from the grave, sir.
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.
I pronounced the man dead myself.
What are the facts?
Groundskeeper saw him walking through the graveyard this morning.
I'll leave this in your capable hands.
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.
Don't try that.
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.
Certainly.
What's the major concern?
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?
Yes, as you should.
It's a matter of professional integrity.
No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
Who do you think won the match.
Clarkie?
- Sir?
- The rugby match.
Your boys have done a magnificent job obliterating any potential evidence.
Yes. But at least they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
LESTRADE:
You took your time. Holmes.
HOLMES:
"And on the third day"...
These slabs are half a ton each if they're a pound...
...and they're smashed open from the inside.
Lestrade, what of the coffin?
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?
Anyhow, where's our witness?
He's over there.
And apparently, he is cata...
Cat...
Catatonic, sir.
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.
Now, you get down there and you bring that coffin up now.
Good day, sir.
Hello.
It's all right.
I'm a doctor.
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.
Well?
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.
He had no pulse.
MAN:
Ready.
Down.
Good Lord.
That's not Blackwood.
Well, now we have a firm grasp of the obvious.
Time of death?
Diptera is...
...approximately...
...two thirds of an inch which would put the time of death...
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.
May I borrow your pen?
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.
GROUNDSKEEPER:
I know what I saw.
It was Blackwood.
As clear as I see you.
And when the dead walk...
...the living will fill these coffins.
Well, um...
[CLEARS THROAT]
LESTRADE: Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.
WATSON:
You really believe he was resurrected?
HOLMES:
The question is not if, but how.
- The game's afoot.
WATSON: Follow your spirit...
HOLMES & WATSON:
And upon this charge, cry:
"God for Harry. England and St. George."
There you are.
Why that certain chips stall.
I don't understand.
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.
WATSON: You know. Holmes.
I've seen things in war I don't understand.
I once met a man who predicted his own death...
...right down to the number and the placement...
...of the bullets that killed him.
You have to admit. Holmes...
...that a supernatural explanation to this case...
...is theoretically possible.
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data.
Inevitably one begins to twist facts to suit theories...
...instead of theories to suit facts.
That said. I believe Adler's midget is the key to this.
WATSON:
Hm.
HOLMES: Right. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch was wound.
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.
Every time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.
Very good. Watson.
You've developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Hm.
Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored...
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H, is for?
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.
They should be able to give us an address.
What a coincidence.
There's one thing you've failed to deduce from the watch.
HOLMES:
Really? I think not.
WATSON:
The time. I have to get back. Holmes.
Taking tea with the in-laws.
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.
WATSON: No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.
We have no need of your lucky heather.
Gypsy woman.
Even if it's to do with Mary?
Oh. Oh.
I see two men. Brothers.
Not in blood, but in bond.
What of Mary?
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.
Go on.
I see patterned tablecloths...
...and, oh, china figurines...
...and, oh, lace doilies.
Doilies.
Lace doilies? Holmes.
Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...
...and, oh, she has a beard and...
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?
Please, enough.
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.
And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring.
Do you have my money?
You are terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre.
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!
HOLMES:
I see.
Thank you.
HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.
And I have some change in my pocket.
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.
- Don't give it away here.
- No.
I have to go see Mary.
Give her my best.
And her family, as well.
It does make a considerable difference to me...
...having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes.
He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
HOLMES:
Something did.
Irene Adler was here.
Either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.
[INHALES]
Ah. Putrefaction.
[SNIFFING]
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.
[FLIES BUZZING]
Phosphorous.
Formaldehyde.
It looks like...
...he was attempting to combine...
...some kind of sorcery and scientific formula.
HOLMES:
More importantly...
...let's see what he was trying to dispose of.
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink as long as it's not too burnt.
Peculiar.
Hydrated rhododendron.
[SNIFFS]
- Holmes.
- Hm?
Look at the crest.
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
Of course he was.
The question is, to what end.
Whatever he was working on.
He clearly succeeded.
How so?
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.
Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him.
HOLMES:
Yes.
HOLMES:
Yes.
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.
- Mm?
- Is it candy floss? Molasses?
Maple syrup?
Barley sugar.
Toffee apple.
Let me guess.
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...
...you're here to burn down the building and extinguish all evidence therein.
Just one minute, boys.
Oh. Dredger.
[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
Meat...
...or potatoes?
My 10 minutes are up.

HOLMES:

WATSON:
Holmes!
[IN ENGLISH] Watson...
...what have you done?
WATSON:
I haven't slept all night.
Not a wink.
Why I ever believed...
...that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents is beyond me...
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.
I've been reviewing my notes on our exploits over the last seven months.
Would you like to know my conclusion?
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?
Why else would I continually be led into situations...
...where you deliberately withhold your plans from me? Why else?
You've never complained about my methods before.
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?
How am I complaining? I never complain.
Do I complain about you practicing the violin in the morning...
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene.
Or the fact that you steal my clothes?
We have a barter system.
Do I complain about you setting fire to my rooms?
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.
When do I complain that you experiment on my dog?
- Our dog.
- On the dog.
Gladstone is our dog.
Where I do take issue is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
I understand.
- Do you?
- I do.
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.
I'm not sensitive.
What you need is a rest.
My brother. Mycroft.
Has a small estate near Chichester.
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country.
It would be with my future wife.
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.
- You are not...
- What, invited?
Why would I not be invited to my brother's country home?
Now you're not making any sense.
You're not human.
MAN:
John Watson?
Yes.
Your bail's been posted.
WATSON:
Mary.
Just Watson.
I hope you get bail by breakfast.
Because the boys are getting hungry.
[CHATTERING]
LESTRADE:
Step lively.
Back off. Back off.
To which the barman says.
"May I push in your stool?"

Right, you, you're out.
Until next time. Big Joe.
Always a pleasure. Mr. Holmes.
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.
In another life.
You'd have made an excellent criminal.
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.
Now, please tell me you have answers.
All in good time. Lestrade.
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game where we guess what you're thinking?
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.
Now, clean up and make yourself presentable.
For whom?
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.
[BLOWING NOSE]
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir...
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.
Mr. Holmes.
Apologies for summoning you like this.
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am.
As to where I am...
...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.
But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill...
...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...
...a Brittany sage.
The carriage forked left, then right.
A telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.
And as to who you are, that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.
The letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram.
Lord Chief Justice.
That'd be your official title.
Who you really are is, of course.
Another matter entirely.
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...
...you're the head of the Temple of the Four Orders...
...in whose headquarters we now sit...
...on the northwest corner of St. James's Square. I think.
As to the mystery, the only mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me at all.
Yes, well, standard procedure.
I suppose.
[DOOR OPENS]
I daresay we have the right man.
Gentlemen.
Sherlock Holmes.
Ambassador Standish from America...
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.
I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order.
HOLMES:
Yes. Um...
They're practically interesting.
Be as skeptical as you like.
But our secret systems have steered the world towards good for centuries.
The danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes.
What some call the dark arts.
Or practical magic.
STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic. Mr. Holmes.
We don't expect you to share our faith...
...merely our fears.
Fear is the more infectious condition.
In this instance...
...fear of your own child.
Blackwood is your son.
You have the same irises.
A rare dark green...
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...
...together with identical outer ears, which are only passed down through bloodline...
...which makes you either brothers...
...or, in this case, more likely.
Father and son.
Very few people are privy to that information...
...and we want to keep it that way.
He was conceived during one of our rituals.
His mother wasn't my wife...
...but she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner...
...though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
Death followed him wherever he went.
Those five girls were not the first to be butchered.
He killed many more.
Using them to enhance his powers.
No one could prove anything.
Of course, but we all knew.
The boy was a curse.
We've done our best to stop him.
But it's not enough.
His power grows daily.
His resurrection is evidence of that.
But what he does next will be more dangerous.
ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. This is the source of his power.
He's gonna raise a force that will alter the course of world.
We want you to find him and stop him before he does.
COWARD: We'll give you any assistance that we can.
As home secretary. I have considerable influence over the police.
HOLMES:
Hm, yes.
COWARD:
So...
...name your price.
The benefit of being a consulting detective...
...is that I can pick and choose my clients.
So consider it done. I'll stop him.
But not for you.
And certainly not for a price.
- I do have a parting query. Sir Thomas.
- What is that?
If the rest of his family's dead.
How long do you expect to survive?
Food for thought.
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck opening that.
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.
How fascinating that an astronomical event can affect the quality...
How is it going with our case you refuse to take?
...of the wine.
Oh. I've hit a dead end, literally.
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.
If you still need him.
Oh, dear.
Hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund.
He's a professor, isn't he?
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.
I've never known a professor to carry a gun.
And on such a clever contraption.
Eye patch, nice touch.
So case closed...
...which makes this a social visit.
No, it's a "you're in over your head.
Irene" visit.
Whoever killed Reordan was covering their tracks...
...which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.
[CORK POPS]
Let it breathe.
I've never been in over my head.
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.
Or stay and volunteer for protective custody.
If I'm in danger, so are you.
Come with me.
What if we trusted each other?
Hm?
You're not listening.
I'm taking you to either the railway station or the police station.
[SIGHS]
So...
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.
You decide.
- Which will it be?
- What...?
I told you to let it breathe.
Can you taste the comet?
Why couldn't you just come away with me?
Never.
[CAWS]
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[GASPS]
[SCREAMS]
Madam. I need you to remain calm and trust me. I'm a professional.
But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release.
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
CLARK: Naturally, sir.
That's why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling.
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.
Indeed. And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended.
Or we may never have found you.
The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning, sir.
- Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Oh.
CLARK:
We've checked everything, sir.
No sign of a break-in and the butler didn't hear a thing.
So body in the bathtub...
...his eyes were wide open.
And the only thing missing was...
...his ring, sir.
Why did you drain the water?
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer.
Not provide comfort for the corpse.
What is that?
[SNIFFS]
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...
...high up where it's warm and dry.
Or in a linen cupboard with a vent.
Constable, you could do worse...
...than to check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints.
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
[HUMMING]
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?
It was in the pantry, sir.
I don't know what to make of this.
Excellent work.
Adieu.
[BELL TOLLING]
What's the meaning of this. Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?
Sir Thomas is dead.
I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the order.
[CHUCKLES]
Have you lost your mind?
You know damn well what he's capable of.
BLACKWOOD:
Of course he does.
That's why we're here.
That's why we're all here.
My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose.
A magnificent but simple purpose.
To create a new future.
A future ruled...
...by us.
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history.
Magic will lead the way.
Once the people of England see our newfound power...
...they'll bow down in fear.
Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours.
It will be again.
The Civil War has made them weak.
Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours...
...so we'll take it back.
We will remake the world...
...create the future.
These men are with me. Standish...
...but...
...are you?
No, sir. I am not.
These powers that you're playing with...
...no man can control.
Well, gentlemen...
...someone has to stop him.
Even if you won't.
Oh. I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[YELLING]
STANDISH:
Save me!
Gentlemen...
...don't be afraid.
As you can see...
...we are protected.
Come, drink your allegiance here.
You control the police, now use them.
Didn't know you were here.
Since this room is no longer yours.
Do you mind if I utilize it?
Be my guest.
- In here, chaps.
MAN: Where would you like me...
- ...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.
WATSON: Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.
His neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him.
Yes.
Thanks for that, by the way.
There is consolation in the knowledge that he could be of service to his fellow man.
Elbows and arms stained with blood.
But it's older than his own injuries.
None of it human.
He's not a butcher, let me see.
Yellow flame, green bursts.
An industrial worker.
[SNIFFING]
Pff. Coal.
River silt.
The slag on his trousers should put him squarely in...
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry. What?
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.
I wondered.
Do you remember where I put the Lords Register of members' interests?
It's on the stepladder.
Well. Blackwood's had his hand in just about everything that's corrosive to the spirit.
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.
It'll probably be a factory by the river.
What's that?
Never mind.
You don't know where my rugby ball went, do you?
No, not a clue.
Queenshi the Slaughterhouse.
Nine Elms.
A factory by the river.
Well done. That should lead us to Blackwood, dead or alive.
Not us.
You.
Yes.
Just a figure of speech, old boy.
He's left it there on purpose.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
[MEN LAUGHING]
More coal, doctor.
That's a good one. He's such a tit.
Oh. God. Yeah.
WATSON: Glad to see you two are working hard.
And I thought we were trying to be discreet.
You would not last one day in the navy.
Are you sure there isn't an alternative means of water transportation than that?
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.
If only just a sense.
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.
Come on, come on.
WATSON: Look familiar?
HOLMES: Yep.
All that's missing is a ginger midget.
They cleared something away from here not minutes ago.
Like what?
Not sure. Something mechanical.
Holmes.
Look at this.
- Chapter and verse.
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."
BLACKWOOD:
"And behold. I'm alive for evermore."
I warned you. Holmes, to accept that this was beyond your control...
...beyond what your rational mind could comprehend.
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
BLACKWOOD: I want you to bear witness.
Tomorrow, at midday.
The world as you know it will end.
Show me your face.
It'll be the end of your world.
Save your bullets. Watson.
A gift for you.
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
What was that about saving bullets?
[GRUNTING]
BLACKWOOD:
She followed you here. Holmes.
You led your lamb to slaughter.
Holmes.
This game was designed to hurt.
Watson!
It's warm in here. Watson.
In over your head yet, darling?
WATSON: Hold on there.
ADLER: I can't.
Let me take your weight.
HOLMES:
Give us a leg up, old boy.
[GROANS]
These German locks always give me trouble.
[METAL CREAKING]
It's a band saw.
No matter, we have plenty of time.
Holmes.
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.
Holmes, hurry up.
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.
And we'll bounce in three, two...
...one.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.
Thank you.
We should help the doctor.
Holmes!
CLARK [IN SLOW MOTION]:
Mr. Holmes.
Sir.
Mr. Holmes.
Mr. Holmes, we have an order for your arrest, sir.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Sir!
Lord Coward has issued a warrant for your arrest, sir.
Now. Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Will the train be departing on time?
The train's been delayed, madam.
Shouldn't be long now, though.
MAN:
The train will depart when I tell it to.
And you will leave my employment when I allow you to.
I fulfilled my contract.
I found Reordan.
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
So that's me. Finished.
MAN: Your job was to manipulate Holmes' feelings for you...
...not succumb to them.
You have fulfilled nothing.
I want what Reordan was making for Blackwood.
Finish the job or the next dead body...
...will be Sherlock Holmes.
DOCTOR:
The surgeon should be along shortly.
He should be able to rest now.
Excuse me.
Is that the best you can do?
Yes, for now.
I must attend to my other patients.
MARY:
Doctor.
Doctor.
Please.
I know that you care for him as much as I do.
This is not your responsibility.
It was his choice.
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.
[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Solve this.
Whatever it takes.
[VOICES CHATTERING]
BLACKWOOD:
This is beyond your control.
CLARK:
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
ADLER: I've never been in over my head.
WATSON: it's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.
MARY: Solve this.
WATSON: Are you, Holmes?
BLACKWOOD:
Accept that this was beyond your control.
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
LESTRADE: I've got a public in frenzy.
WATSON:
Holmes!
BLACKWOOD:
Widen your gaze.
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.
ROTHERAM: He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.
COWARD: His power grows daily.
ROTHERAM: This is the source of his power.
BLACKWOOD:
I need you.
ROTHERAM:
His secret lies in the book of spells.
BLACKWOOD:
Three more will die...
...and there is nothing you can do to save them.
STANDISH:
We know you don't believe in magic.
WATSON:
Reordan was working with Blackwood.
ADLER:
Is that better?
WATSON: He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.
His eyes were wide open and the only thing missing was his ring.
BLACKWOOD:
Give up, Holmes.
This is a riddle you cannot solve.
ADLER:
Good morning.
Now, you need to work.
Familiar artwork.
You look gorgeous.
HOLMES:
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.
You made the front page.
Only a name and no picture.
So it looks like you'll be needing to work outside the law now...
...and that's my area of expertise.
I feel safer already.
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.
Yes.
Took the shrapnel out myself.
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
Well. I'm...
I'm just so...
...very glad that you're...
...well...
...with us.
[BOTH CLEAR THROATS]
Now that you're sitting comfortably.
I shall begin.
My initial approach was far too narrow.
When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville Prison...
...he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum. I have done just that.
In fact. I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity.
But that's for another time.
Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system...
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.
To fully understand the system.
To get inside it...
...I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt...
...with a few enhancements of my own.
My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended...
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail.
I have emerged enlightened.
The fraternity who silently control the empire...
...share the belief with the kings.
Pharaohs and emperors of old...
...that the sphinx was a door to another dimension...
...a gateway to immeasurable power.
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...
...the wings of an eagle.
And the head of a man.
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...
...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and hair of a man.
Map.
The points of the star represent the five murdered girls...
...but the cross is what we're now interested in.
It's a widely held belief...
...that within the architecture of the great cities...
...are coded references to this system.
Since he rose from the grave.
Blackwood has killed three men...
...each committed at a location that has a connection with the temple...
...therefore the system.
Reordan, the ginger midget, represents man.
We found his body here.
Sir Thomas. Master of the temple.
Wore the ox ring.
He died here.
Standish, ambassador to America...
...where the eagle has been the national emblem for over 100 years.
The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Orders where he died...
...is here.
Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act.
So we have man. The ox. Eagle.
Only the lion remaining.
Right here.
Parliament.
Right.
You four stay here and the rest of you come with me.
LESTRADE: Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.
Ladies first.
LESTRADE:
Now.
HOLMES:
Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you...?
HOLMES: Go.
Hello, hello, hello.
Did the devil turn up?
Well...
...never mind.
You got the next best thing.
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...
...but Mr. Holmes here...
...he's been making some serious accusations about you...
...and the order.
I see.
Well, at least that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.
[BOTH GRUNT]
[HOLMES COUGHS]
Excuse me, my Lord...
...but I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
Well, inspector. I have five minutes before my next engagement...
...so why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy?
Thank you. Lestrade.
My Lord.
I'm curious. Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...
...or just the one I prevented?
Very distinctive.
Those handmade shoes of yours.
But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave.
Nonetheless. I confess to being completely outmatched.
I could deduce very little from my investigation.
Fortunately.
There's nothing more stimulating...
...than a case where everything goes against you.
How many members of Parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?
Very clever.
But it's not murder. Mr. Holmes.
It's mercy.
We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd.
Don't you see that it's for their own...?
HOLMES:
No, but I don't care much what you think.
I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's ceremony...
...and you've given it to me.
I've told you nothing.
HOLMES: But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope.
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.
You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony...
...in the sewers beneath Parliament less than an hour ago.
Both houses meet today.
The whole government will be present.
COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood. Holmes.
You would have made a valuable ally.
How terrible is wisdom...
...when it brings no profit to the wise.
We take power at noon.
There isn't any time to waste then.
Is there?
TANNER: I told you he'd be coming out the top window.
There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace.
Technically, that isn't the top window.
Is it, sailor boy?
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.
Anyway.
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.
In fact. I think he enjoyed it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Here's the key.
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes. I smoked him out with relative ease.
- Tanner?
- Sir?
If you would, captain...
...take us under the bridge.
Port side. 100 yards.
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers.
Right away, sir.
[HORN BLOWS]
[CHATTERING]
The end is nigh.
Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land.
He walks in every shadow and every puff of smoke.
Behold, he cometh with clouds...
...and every eye shall see him...
...and every soul shall wail because of him.
You cannot stop him!
No one can!
[WHISPERING]
Behold. Blackwood's magic revealed.
ADLER [WHISPERING]: What does it do?
HOLMES: It's a chemical weapon.
The first of its kind.
You deduced that how?
From my pocket.
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse.
Note the blue discoloration.
The faint smell of bitter almonds.
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
ADLER: Cyanide.
WATSON:
Shh.
HOLMES: Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
It'll revolutionize warfare.
[WHISPERING] Yes, killing a lot of people.
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?
Right. How many men did you count on the...?
[GUNSHOTS]
She loves an entrance, your muse.
HOLMES [IN NORMAL TONE]:
Woman!
Shoot him. Now, please.
My lords.
My lords.
My lords.
The time has come...
...for only those who believe to remain.
Behold...
...Lord Blackwood.
[MURMURING]
You seem surprised.
I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfill England's destiny...
...and extend the boundaries of this great empire.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING
IN DISTANCE]
Listen to the rabble outside.
Listen...
...to the fear.
I will use that as a weapon...
...to control them...
...and then the world.
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.
Specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it.
These appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort.
Electromagnetic waves?
HOLMES:
When triggered, the electrodes...
...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...
...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...
...the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.
Blackwood must have some transmitter that he can activate remotely.
Three minutes. 10 seconds.
I will create an empire that will endure for millennia...
...indestructible...
...and eternal.
Move it. Move it.
We don't actually have to disarm the device...
...we just have to remove the cylinders.
Yes, except that they're welded in.
What we need is a controlled explosion.
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.
[GRUNTS]
[GUN CLICKING EMPTY]
[IN FRENCH]
I rather wish you hadn't done that.
Irene.
[BELL CHIMING]
On the 12th chime.
I will summon the dark powers.
All those of you who are with me shall be protected.
All others...
...will perish.
I need your pipe.
Nut him!
- Right.
- What?
- Coat.
- Got it.
The new order...
...begins now.
Woman.
What are you waiting for?
[POPS]
[GROANS]
That.
MAN:
Apprehend Lord Coward.
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.
Relax...
...I'm a doctor.
[SCREAMS]
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?
We're safe now.
Interesting assessment.
Run off.
I won't be chasing you anymore.
Fare thee well.
I don't want to run anymore.
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.
No!
There was never any magic.
Only conjuring tricks.
The simplest involved paying people off...
...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.
Your reputation and the inmates' fear did the rest.
Others required more elaborate preparations...
...like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb.
You had it broken before your burial.
Then put back together using an adhesive.
An ancient Egyptian recipe. I believe...
...a mixture of egg and honey...
...designed to be washed away by the rain.
Holmes!
Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub...
...required more modern science.
Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic...
...that was activated by the combination of copper and water...
...and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
That might've been a challenge for me...
...had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.
The death of Standish was a real mystery...
...until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf.
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...
...yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue.
Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple?
All it took was a spark.
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
Ingenious.
Like all great performers, you saved your piece de resistance for the end:
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.
Had it worked...
...your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed...
...as their colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know you'd given them the antidote.
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...
...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.
And the world would've followed.
Fear being the most powerful weapon of all.
[CREAKING]
You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition...
...as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.
For God's sake. Holmes, cut me loose.
[METAL CREAKING]
HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. A fraud.
Then you'll be hanged.
Properly, this time.
It's a long journey from here to the rope.
[YELLING]
[GRUNTS]
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.
I have.
Naked.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
ADLER:
Storm's coming.
HOLMES:
Well, we've still got a moment.
Moriarty.
What?
That's his name.
And he is a professor.
Everyone has a weak spot...
...and he found mine.
Where was it, precisely?
- Please don't underestimate him.
- Mm.
He's just as brilliant as you are...
...and infinitely more devious.
We'll see about that.
You'll miss me. Sherlock.
Sadly...
...yes.
WATSON:
Just keep it under your hat.
DRIVER: Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.
WATSON: Thank you.
- What's in these. John?
Scribbles.
- Scribbles?
- Notes.
MARY: They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.
[WATSON CHUCKLES]
Come on, what's wrong?
Do you think he's come to terms with you leaving?
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.
Now, five minutes here and we'll go home.
Our home.
Get up those stairs.
[KNOCKING]
Don't worry, dear.
Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far too fond of himself for that.
Holmes.
Oh. Good afternoon.
I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it were.
But it had a surprisingly soporific effect...
...and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.
WATSON:
Get on with it. Holmes.
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook.
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.
John, shouldn't we help him down?
No, no, no.
I hate to cut him off midstream.
Carry on.
Well, the executioner attached it to a harness...
...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...
...and the neck to remain intact.
My Lord. I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?
How did you manage it. Holmes?
I managed it with braces.
Belts and a coat hook.
Please, my tongue is going.
I'll be of no use to you at all.
- Worse things could happen.
- John.
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.
HOLMES:
Right.
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.
There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...
...for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis.
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as well-trained as your own.
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?
HOLMES:
...Mad honey disease.
Oh, he's demonstrating the very effect I've just described.
He doesn't mind.
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.
CLARK:
Mr. Holmes?
Doctor. Miss Mary.
Sir. Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me right away.
- What is it is this time. Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.
He went missing the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.
We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene.
Can I help you, officer?
Shot in the head.
Was it a small caliber bullet?
Yes.
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
Indeed, sir.
Point blank range?
Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty.
MARY:
Oh, there's a good boy.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Where is Blackwood's device now?
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.
I'd wager there's a piece missing.
So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine...
...not the poison.
There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact.
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.
And Adler was just the diversion.
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.
Imagine being able to control any device...
...simply by sending a command via radio waves.
It's the future. Watson.
[KNOCKING]
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
- Well...
- Well...
[GLADSTONE GROANS]
MARY: Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.
HOLMES:
Clarkie.
Case reopened.
Mr. Blackwood?
Sir?
Mr...
Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry.
You did ring, sir?
Come down.
♪ I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
♪ The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie
I'm so...
So very sorry.
I didn't see the steps.
They made me do it.
I didn't...
If I want to see my child again,
I must comply.
Mr. Blackwood.
Please understand.
♪ Are gone, Maggie
When you and I...
Precious teeth.
Beautiful teeth.
Ransom for my boy.
Yes.
♪ They say I'm feeble with age, Maggie
Daddy.
♪ My face is a well written page, Maggie ♪
I... brought you something more to eat.
Not children's teeth like you wanted, but please accept them... in exchange for him.
CREATURES: Children's teeth.
Oh, no, that's the best I could do.
And they're my own.
You see?
My own.
Please.
Give me back my son!
CREATURES: Yes, your son is down here.
Reach for him.
Son? Son!
Son!
Grab my hand!
We've now begun our descent into T. F. Green Airport.
Please return to your seat, make sure it is in...
She's landed.
What do you think?
Too much?
No, it's perfect.
Just like you.
There's my girl.
Sally?
Wow! Look how tall you are!
What are you,
17 now?
Dad, you know how old I am.
I know.
I'm being silly.
Hey.
Good morning, sir.
Thank you.
Come on.
Sally, this is Kim.
Kim, Sally.
Hi, Sally.
It's nice to meet you.
I love you.
I love you.
Thanks.
What about a picture?
You got your camera?
It's good to see you.
Good morning,
Rhode Island!
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
We've got fog this morning and a slight chance of a shower later on.
Smell that fresh air, kiddo?
Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?
I have to call
Mom now.
Just press one and the green.
Hi, you've called Joanne and the magical Sally! Leave us a message.
L.C. delivered the flooring.
If it rains,
I'm afraid it's gonna warp.
Well, just put it in the garage.
Sally, say hello to Mr. Harris.
Nice to meet you.
Come, take a look at the house.
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris, would you give me a hand...
- How's it going?
- Good.
- When do you think you'll be finished?
- No problem.
Good, huh?
- It smells funny.
- You should've smelled it before.
They had moldy newspapers everywhere, and dead pigeons all over the floor and poop.
Lots of it.
It's Jacoby's office.
Mr. Jacoby.
Oh, hey, Michelle.
Sorry.
Uh, I don't know.
Hold on. I'll check.
You got the photographs?
I like to draw, too.
You work here?
No, Sally,
I live here.
I'm the interior designer.
Do you know what that is?
Of course you do.
You see all the animal paintings and friezes?
They're by Emerson Blackwood, a man who once lived here.
He was a very famous wildlife painter.
Hey, Sally, look.
You want to try?
What do you have there?
- I found it.
- That's mine.
It was my grandmother's.
When I was little, my mother gave it to me.
My mom gave me to my dad.
Sally?
You wanna see your room?
What do you think?
Kim and I worked really hard to get it ready.
Check this out.
It's pretty great, huh?
It looks better at night.
How long am I staying here?
What did your mother tell you?
She told me
I was coming to visit.
But then she packed all my clothes.
She didn't explain anything to you?
- No.
- Sally.
Your mother and I are worried about you.
She thinks that maybe you're, uh... feeling sad... and she thought that...
Well, we thought that... perhaps a... a change might... might be good for you and that you could come and live here with... with Kim and me... until we finish the work on the house and... and sell it.
And then, uh... we could move somewhere else and...
Sally? Come on.
Open the door.
Come on.
Let me in.
Are you going to marry her?
Uh... that's between
Kim and me.
Mom said you only liked her because she was young.
But she isn't.
She is old.
Sally.
Open the door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the door.
Sally, please, let's talk about this.
Look, I know...
I know it must be tough.
You had a long flight, and it's... it's strange being in a new house.
I wanna go to bed now.
Okay.
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
You'd be a terrible poker player.
You've been ironing that shirt for like, half-an-hour.
She sure didn't take to me.
I wouldn't take it personally.
She's like that with everybody.
Those pills she takes, what are they?
Adderall, I think.
Jesus.
That's her mother for you.
That woman medicated our dogs.
So, what about Jacoby?
Well, his assistant said he still hasn't looked at the new photographs yet.
- He's had them for a week.
- I know.
But we're still in the running, and he's still coming to the dinner.
- He should just give us the cover.
- Yes, he should.
He gave it to the Spencer restoration two years ago... and you have done miracles here.
We have done miracles here.
It's not all about me.
Thank you.
These are new?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Well, if we get the cover of Architectural Digest, we won't need to take out another bank loan, will we?
You know what your daughter told me today?
What?
She said your wife gave her to you.
Kids say all kinds of things they don't mean.
It couldn't have gone any worse today.
I feel like the evil stepmother.
The evil and very old stepmother.
Let's not forget the old part.
'Cause I was kinda thinking you were looking a little ancient.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
The stuffed bear?
What was I thinking?
Oh, come on. It's great.
She likes it. I saw it in her room.
On her bed?
Well, above the bed.
Hanging by a noose.
That's okay. Nice sign of affection, I think.
Sally.
Her name is Sally.
Sally!
What do you think?
Yeah. Looks great.
Have you seen Sally?
Yeah, she's on the bench.
Sally!
It is not safe for you back here.
Hey. What's going on?
Everything okay?
Keep her out from the back of the house.
She could fall in.
We'd be in a hell of a mess.
I didn't do anything.
There's pits.
Old wells.
It's dangerous for a child.
Mr. Harris is right,
Sally. He knows.
His grandfather worked at the house.
- You shouldn't be back here.
- But I found a basement.
There is no basement.
Easy, Harris.
I'll take her. It's okay.
It's there!
It's right there!
You know there's a reason this house is called Fallen Mill.
The English had a mill here, and it fell into a sinkhole.
That's why most of the houses around here don't have basements.
This one does.
You may wanna check this out.
It's unsafe for a child.
Pull on that.
Look!
I told you it was here!
Can you believe this?
This is definitely hollow.
I'm gonna get some tools.
You sure you wanna do this now?
Of course!
You kidding?
We can fix this easy if we have to.
You may wanna step back.
Mr. Hurst, I...
There's a door in here.
Where did you put the old house keys?
They're in your junk drawer in the office.
Okay.
Have a look.
Oh, wow.
You be careful, Sally.
Okay?
Okay.
How the hell did we miss this?
That must be the garden window.
It's all of his paints and old colored pencils.
This is amazing.
Wow.
Alex, look at this.
Harris, did you know about this?
This place isn't safe.
Especially for kids.
It's okay.
I'll keep an eye on her.
This must be where Blackwood worked.
I found another door.
Look at these sketches.
It's an ash pit,
I think.
Yeah.
It's bolted shut.
These are incredible.
Okay.
Let's go, Sally.
Come on, Sally.
Let's go.
Sally, come on.
This must be like
King Tut's tomb for you.
Which is excatly why we shouldn't be touching anything.
This stuff must be valuable.
She's gone.
No, no, she will come back.
They always do.
Yes, they always do.
I don't think that's important, Alan.
No, I just need to make sure I get the paintings and furniture back in time for the dinner.
You told me you could.
Come on. How long have we known each other?
I'll write you a post-dated check.
Hold on.
It's either walnut or mahogany,
I think. Yeah.
Hey, there you are.
I thought maybe we could bake scones.
I promised Mrs. Underhill we wouldn't make too much of a mess.
No. That's all right.
What've you got there?
My doll.
And my drawing stuff.
Looks like it's just you and I baking scones today.
I made sandwiches for everyone.
Sally.
Open the grates!
Yes, yes, open the grates.
Set us free!
Set us free!
Who are you?
What do you look like?
We've been locked up for so long.
Set us free!
Come down. You'll see what it's like down here.
Wait a minute, will ya?
There's other children down here.
They're just like you.
Sally?
Sally.
What're you doing down here?
- I heard something.
- Rats, probably.
Come on, it's time for dinner.
It was a voice.
Really smart rats, then.
No! Listen.
Nothing.
Come on, let's go, kiddo.
I forgot my bag.
Well, hurry up.
Sally, now!
We can get this tomorrow.
We can't get the rest of these for two weeks.
What about the burnt umber?
It's much warmer, and we can get it for half he price.
You not hungry?
Sally?
Don't you like rice?
Mrs. Underhill made apple pie for dessert.
Apple pie has gluten, and Mommy says gluten is bad for my concentration.
Oh, come on.
You love apple pie.
We can worry about your concentration tomorrow.
Mommy says no gluten.
What's your mother filling your head with?
- How about some chocolate milk?
- No, no, no.
- I'll make something else.
- No. Hold on, hold on.
Sally, you need to eat this, or you can go to your room.
Okay?
Good night, Dad.
What?
Did that work on you when you were a kid?
She's testing us, Kim.
That's what kids do.
Who's the parent here?
Certainly not me.
I didn't... mean that.
No... You're right.
I'm not a parent.
- We talked about this, remember?
- No, you told me about this, Alex.
I'm not sure I'm ready to be anybody's mother.
- Oh, come on.
- I had a hard enough time... getting over my own childhood... to have to... deal with somebody else's.
Listen, will you help me out with this, please?
I realize this is terrible timing, but I don't have a choice.
I can't...
I can't just send her back.
You know, that's not what I'm asking you to do.
Apple pie.
Thanks.
- Hello?
- Hi, Alex, it's Joanne.
- Hi, Joanne.
- Can I speak to Sally?
- No, you can't.
- Why not?
Because she's asleep.
We're 3 hours ahead, remember?
What were you thinking not telling her... she was gonna be living here?
You and I had a conversation.
I asked you if you wanted me to tell her.
Don't do this every time I have...
You're the one who wanted her here.
I love you. I love you.
Did... did you just speak to me?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
The light, it hurts us.
Yeah. Turn out the light.
I love you.
Turn out the light.
We want to be friends.
Where's my doll?
With us. With us.
Sally's doll is with us.
Who are you?
We're your friends.
Friends?
Where?
Come down to the basement...
- and play with us.
- Where are you?
What are you?
Hungry.
Hungry.
Very hungry.
I have food.
Let me see you.
I won't hurt you,
I promise.
Sally?
- What you doing under there?
- I'm looking for my doll.
Looking for what?
I'm looking for my doll.
Oh.
Well, uh...
Oh.
How about, the...
Teddy instead?
- No.
- I love you.
That's all right.
- Did you lose a tooth?
- That's not mine.
- I found it.
- You found it?
What?
Here in the house?
Yeah.
Come on.
Can I call Mommy now?
No, it's too late.
She's probably asleep.
I don't think you should keep this.
It's not very sanitary.
What about this light?
Should I...
Leave it on, please.
All right, well, sleep well.
Oh, Sally, would you do me a favor?
Would you try to, maybe, be friends with Kim?
- Yes.
- Thanks, kiddo.
Kim, have you seen my razor?
We have to leave in five minutes.
- Yeah. You seen my razor?
- Here, take mine.
Five minutes.
My dress.
Sally. I wanna talk to you downstairs right now.
I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes.
- I didn't do it.
- Sally...
- I didn't do anything.
- Sally...
- I swear.
- Stop lying.
It was a horrible thing to do.
And it was dangerous.
You could've cut yourself.
What did you use, my razor?
Let me see your hands.
- It's mine.
- What is this?
Where'd you get this?
- Let me go home.
- You can't go home.
Just let me go home.
I'm sorry about this.
She's never done anything like this before.
She's obviously very angry about something.
Alex, that is not anger.
That is fear.
We need to go.
Mrs. Underhill,
Kim and I have an appointment at the historical society.
We'll be back this afternoon.
Sally, we're going out.
You listen to Mrs. Underhill and do what she says.
And you think about what you need to say to Kim, okay?
Are you there?
Did you cut
Kim's clothes?
Do you have my dad's razor?
You have to tell me the truth.
If you wanna be friends.
I won't be angry.
Sally's not angry.
They're angry.
No, I'm not angry.
They don't want to...
But we do.
Come down here, Sally.
Come down and play.
You said you were hungry.
Do you like raisins?
We said we liked them.
See? Delicious.
Delicious. Yeah.
So delicious.
Did you do something bad?
You have to answer if you wanna be friends.
Yes, friend.
Sally?
What're you doing down here in the dark?
Were you talking to someone?
Is there someone here with you?
No. I'm all alone.
There's nobody here.
Why don't you go help
Mrs. Underhill make lunch?
Go on.
Off you go now.
That's right. Up those steps!
Quick as you can, now!
Harris. You old fool.
I swear.
I didn't tell them anything!
No.
No, please!
Get away!
I had an accident!
Call for help!
Oh.
Don't look.
I could hear screams down there.
- Noises.
- Did you see anything?
He asked me to leave the cellar.
It was so dark in there, he must have stumbled.
- Oh, Mr. Hurst, thank God!
- What happened?
- Are you William Harris' employer?
- Yeah.
There's been an accident.
Are you okay?
Where is Sally?
I'm sorry.
She saw him.
I tried to cover her eyes, and I was too late.
- Where is she?
- She's in the garden.
Oh, I am sorry!
Sally?
Hi.
Are you scared?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Is Mr. Harris gonna die?
No, Sally.
He is going to be okay.
Can I show you something?
This is my favorite part of the house.
Blackwood loved nature.
He imported these fish from Japan.
And so did we.
They're called Koi.
They're considered magical.
Badgers can spot them against the mud at the bottom... because of their bright colors.
So what makes them special... is also what makes them vulnerable.
They have to be tough.
And you, too, Sally.
I didn't touch your clothes.
I swear to God,
I never touched them!
- I didn't touch them.
- Sally.
I didn't!
Didn't cut them, I promise.
I don't care about my clothes.
I can't really tell.
1804, I think.
It's hard to see.
The coin's pretty worn down.
She probably found it in Blackwood's studio.
I don't want her going down there anymore.
I'm worried about her, Kim.
It's not safe.
- Hey. This is Joanne.
- Mommy?
Oh, sweetie, it's you!
How are you?
Can I come home?
- You wanna come home...
- The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.
- I don't like it here.
- You what?
Honey, don't fret.
It's so beautiful there.
You just need to get used to it.
But it's cold.
- Huh, Honey, what?
- My bed is too big.
- Sweetheart.
- And I think I'm getting sick.
You're not getting sick.
Honey, it will take a little tiny bit of getting used to, but you are gonna be so happy there.
Okay? I promise.
You'll get used to it.
I gotta go, honey.
Mommy's gotta go.
I'll see you soon. Bye!
Kim?
- Don't leave.
- What's wrong?
Even when I'm asleep.
And don't turn off the lights.
I'll be right here.
Come on.
Kim?
I love you.
I love you.
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, please!
Daddy!
Sally, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
I don't want them to come anymore.
Who, Sally?
The little things.
They live in the basement.
They gave me the silver dollar.
They said they wanted to be my friend.
But they're horrible and mean.
Oh, Sally.
- You just had a nightmare.
- No, don't say that!
It's okay.
My bear.
Look what they did to my bear.
Your dad tells me art is your favorite subject.
I wish I could draw.
Drawing is easy.
The other kids can't do feet and hands.
When you say "the other kids", do you feel they're different from you?
My doctor back home asked me that.
What was your answer?
Okay. Let's start with something easier.
What's your favorite color?
What is that?
Purple?
Black.
How about these little things you saw?
What do you think they are?
Fairies.
Or gnomes.
But scary ones?
And you say they know your name?
They talk to you?
Yes.
What do they say?
They want to play with me.
Is that all?
They say my parents don't love me.
Can I go now?
Just a few more questions, okay?
There is a lot of anxiety in that little girl... and a deep belief, that she's not wanted.
I believe that's what's triggering these fantastic episodes.
She told me she found a little tray... filled with teeth right inside that fireplace.
Yeah. She found a tooth, but that doesn't mean anything, does it?
She's constructing this elaborate fantasy... about wrinkles, claws, fangs.
Now she's individuated each one of those things, her imaginary world, its inhabitants.
It's as detailed as any
I've ever encountered.
What do we do?
I'd like to try her on a stronger medication, for a start.
I'll ask her doctor in L.A. to send me a copy of her charts.
You call my office, make another appointment.
Okay, great.
Meanwhile, I'll give you something to help her sleep.
I'm going to be late.
I can't believe it.
If we don't get the extension on this loan, we're not gonna get the paintings or the furniture... back on time.
We forgot the invitations for the historical society.
Maybe we should just postpone the dinner.
Kim, it's Architectural Digest.
We have to get the house on the cover.
- I know.
- If we don't,
I'm never gonna get my career back, and we're not gonna sell the place.
- How often we've talked about this?
- What about whats... been happening?
What, Harris?
That was an accident.
I'm talking about Sally.
These things...
- It's all in her head!
- Yeah, but it's real to her.
It doesn't matter if we see it.
Come on!
Calm down!
I'm gonna walk. It'll be faster.
I'll see you back at home.
I'm not sure how lucid he'll be.
He's pretty heavily sedated.
Mr. Harris,
I know this is difficult, but I need to understand something.
I need to know what Sally saw so that I can help her.
Is she out of the house?
No.
Out.
She needs to be out of there.
Why?
Why was that room sealed up?
Grandfather.
Your grandfather closed it up?
Yes.
Why?
After...
After...
After what?
Blackwood.
What about Blackwood?
Lot 1134.
Public library.
Get her out of our house.
The library will be closing in 15 minutes.
The library will be closing in 15 minutes. Thank you.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for the librarian.
Lot 1134.
Emerson Blackwood,
Special Collections. One sec.
Right this way.
Can't remember the last time anyone requested these.
- They're beautiful.
- I'm a designer.
I've been working at Fallen Mill.
Wow.
Now, that's a privilege.
Personally, I think
Emerson Blackwood rivaled Audubon.
Come across his mural?
A mural?
Where?
There in the house, supposedly.
If you do,
I'd love to see it.
Hello?
Now, it's pretty ironic, really.
For a committed realist, someone who insisted on drawing only from nature, to do these at the end of his life.
I've looked at everything by Blackwood, and I've never seen any of these.
Oh, you wouldn't. The family made it a restricted donation.
These may never be published.
Is it possible to get copies?
I'll see what I can do.
"Wrinkles, claws, teeth?"
Have you ever read Machen?
Arthur Machen. Welsh.
He believed in fairy folk, these ancient entities from the netherworld, predating mankind.
Blackwood quotes him extensively.
Here, uh... that line.
There.
"One life must be taken".
These creatures had to take one human life... every time they emerged to replenish their ranks.
Many of these creatures fed on the bones, the teeth of young children.
And then there's a... a truce, a pact of sorts, between Pope Sylvester the 2nd and these ancient beings... in the year 9 hundred and 99.
In exchange for human teeth, they start leaving silver pieces under the pillow.
Now, this... is the last known drawing by Emerson Blackwood, made shortly before his disappearance and the loss of his child.
His child?
Blackwood's only son vanished, lost.
Not long after,
Blackwood himself disappeared... without a trace.
No!
No!
No! Please!
No!
Sally!
Sally, what's wrong?
Sally, open the door!
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh.
Shh.
Dear, thank goodness you're home.
Where is she?
I put her to bed.
She wouldn't stop screaming.
Sally?
Kim!
She's not down here.
I think she's run away.
She's done it before.
You know, once she tried to walk all the way back to L.A... from our family home in Boston.
I wouldn't be surprised if that's what she's doing.
I went and visited
Harris today.
Blackwood had a son.
Did you know that?
And when he was eight, he disappeared.
And Blackwood vanished a few days later.
Why are you telling me this?
A lot of what Blackwood wrote at the end of his life, it's awfully close to Sally's story, gnomes, creatures, all of it.
Kim, don't tell me you believe this.
Something terrible happened in that basement.
We need to leave.
- Put a million miles between...
- What're you talking about?
- us and that house.
- Every cent I have... is in that house. Okay?
And you're saying... that we just walk away?
Look, I... I accept that my daughter has problems, okay?
Thank you.
We all know that.
But they do not involve monsters in the basement.
There she is.
Come on, Sally.
Get in the car.
Sally, please, just tonight, after the party we'll talk, okay?
Four, three, two and one.
There.
After the party,
I will get you outta here.
No matter what.
I promise.
- Sally!
- No.
I took it from them.
- You can't have this.
- They stoled it.
You don't understand.
I need it to fight back.
- Absolutely not.
- Please!
Nobody believes me.
Sally, I trust you, and you can tell me anything, anything at all.
They don't like bright lights either.
These things.
They don't?
Then I have a good idea.
Mr. Jacoby, I am so glad you could make it.
- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.
- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.
It's a pleasure.
Come on in.
The house looks absolutely fantastic.
You done a remarkable job.
Well, thank you.
We'd love the nickel tour.
Of course.
That's the whole point.
The foyer, obviously.
The, uh, the mahogany, we shipped from the very same vendor... that Blackwood used in London.
It's been in business since 1865.
You know Bill from the... heritage board.
Easy, Sally. Not everybody wants to have their photograph taken, okay?
So, Alex, where's Kim?
Uh... I think she's still upstairs.
Why don't you step into the library, grab a drink, and I'll, uh...
I join you there in a moment.
Kim, hey, what's going on?
Her drawings. They're exactly
Blackwood's sketches.
Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw your photographs and copied them.
No, she didn't.
Kim, please,
Jacoby's here.
- Alex, this is your daughter!
- I know.
This is serious!
Just because you keep denying it does not mean...
- it's not happening.
- Kim, I can't do...
Excuse me, Mr. Hurst.
- When should we serve dinner?
- Ten minutes, please.
Kim, everybody is waiting.
Will you come downstairs?
- We can talk about this later.
- No.
- I have proof, Dad. Look!
- Not now, honey.
- Please!
- Not now. Come on!
Welcome, everybody.
Please, have a seat.
Uh... if I could just say a few words... to all of you friends of Fallen Mill, both big and small.
Um... thank you for joining us this evening.
It means a great deal to us.
Every aspect of this restoration, um... has followed the exact specifications... and materials used in the original construction of the house, um... including the wood assembling techniques, the layout in the kitchen, even the, uh... lacquering process for all the timber.
It's something Kim and I are very proud of, I'm sure all of you, with your vast array of expertise, will, uh... appreciate the attention to detail.
Um... the art you see on the walls, the friezes, even the furniture that you're sitting on, uh, has all been meticulously chosen, reassembled or restored, depending on its condition, uh, to, I think, truly represent the essence of the Blackwood collection.
Uh... so, thank you to the heritage board... for their assistance, and to the historical society too.
Um... and of course, to our guest of honor,
Charles Jacoby.
Your, uh... your interest in our projects, um... is nothing short of inspirational.
So, thank you.
And, uh... finally, to the house itself.
May its newly restored life be long and happy.
I guess not everybody is a fan of tonight's menu.
Poor Sally.
No one believes you.
Sally.
What do you want?
Please just tell me what you want!
We want you!
Daddy!
Daddy, please!
Daddy!
Sally?
- Daddy!
- Sally?
Daddy!
Daddy, they're in here!
Open the door!
Sally!
Charles.
What's going on in there?
No! Get off of me!
Stop it!
Sally!
Sally. Sally.
Look at me.
Sally, look at me. Look at me.
Picture,
I took a picture.
I think we better call it a night.
I think we should.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Alex, can I talk to you?
I feel like I have no idea what to do.
I love my daughter, Kim, and I love you.
I love you, too.
We should go, right?
- I'll get Sally ready.
- I'll get the car.
- Will you put this in the car?
- Yeah.
Kim?
Hi.
Where are we going?
We're gonna go to a hotel downtown.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Alex?
Alex?
Alex?
It's okay, it's okay.
A life will be taken.
One life must be taken.
A life will be taken.
One life must be taken.
Sally.
Sally!
Child's teeth!
Kim?
Kim?
Kim?
Daddy?
Kim?
Kim?
Kim!
Kim! Please.
Kim.
Wake up, please!
Wake up, Kim. Wake up, Kim.
Wake up Kim.
Wake up Kim.
Wake up, Kim.
The key. The key.
Kim, please!
Daddy! No!
Kim!
Kim, please!
Sally?
Ah.
Ah!
Sally? Sally!
Kim!
Let go of me!
Don't make me go in there!
Kim! Please!
Kim?
Kim?
- Please, Kim!
- I'm here, Sally!
No, please!
Sally!
Kim?
No! Go away!
Hold on!
Hold on! I got you.
Keep them away, Sally.
Use the light. Use the light.
Kim!
Get him.
No! Please!
Get away from me!
Get off of me!
When I cut this rope, Sally, you run!
Please!
You run!
You got that?
No, what about you?
No! Please!
Be strong.
Kim!
No!
Sally?
Sally?
Sally, are you okay?
Sally.
Alex?
Kim!
Kim!
Kim!
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy.
Please!
That's far enough, Sally.
I love you, Kim.
They will find us.
They will find us and hurt us.
We must fight.
No, we will go deeper, and we will wait.
They will forget, and others will come.
When will they come?
When will we get them?
Soon, soon.
- We have all the time in the world.
- Yes.
All the time in the world.
All the time in the world.
Based on the tragedy by
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
You've told us so much about the composition of the human body...
...but not a word about the soul.
I haven't found it.
Where does one look for the soul?
The skin is thin, perforated...
Large and long...
The soul. And life...
Where are they hidden, then?
In the head?
There's only rubbish in there!
Or in the heart?
Sometimes I have the feeling that...
...both reside in the feet.
- How do you mean?
- If one is startled...
Up, up, up, up!
...then one suddenly feels...
...so much life in the startled feet.
Nonsense!
You clean up here!
The rag is dirty. Look!
- That rag is clean.
Smell for yourself!
I made a mistake.
It's the formalin!
Do you think that
I'm already dead?
- That was an accident.
- Like the berries with carbolic acid...
...you served me last night?
Carbolic acid dulls the pain.
The pain of the world.
And the pain of the soul.
What the soul is and where it resides...
...only God knows.
And the Foe of all mankind.
Quit babbling.
Carbolic acid, carbolic acid...
And one of them has finally flown!
So, where will I find...
...these two gentlemen?
- God is everywhere.
- Thus He is nowhere.
- And the Devils they say...
...where there is money, there you find the Devil.
- I have no money.
- Then you're not the Devil.
Thank you. That's very reassuring.
- Who is he then?
No one knows for sure.
Word has it, the fat guy in the square might be something of the sort.
Really?
- What would you wish for?
- From the Devil?
Two things. Firstly, I'd wish to rid myself of the entire world.
Secondly, I'd wish to see you more often.
How could you see me more often...
...if the world were gone?
Simple.
The world goes away, except for you and me.
Try someone else.
I'll stick with humanity.
For the common good.
The corpse can go. Be quick...
...it is starting to stink.
- How shall I pay...
...the gravediggers?
They must wait until tomorrow
Then I will pay them.
- Come in. Von can take him.
- What about our money?
- Tomorrow.
- Always the same.
So cold. That's that.
Excuse me.
Everything comes and goes according to law...
...only man's life is overcast by faltering fortune.
The God who dwells within my breast...
...who can shake my soul in its depths...
...who sits enthroned over all my powers...
...outside me He is powerless.
Professor, when shall the two of them come by tomorrow?
I don't want to hear about it.
I am starving.
- I'm off!
Where to?
Where, where? There!
Hold him tight.
Why are you standing there stock still?
- But he is kicking!
Old fool! Why are you kicking?!
Nothing has changed.
Your son, Doctor.
I see. I'll he done shortly.
Why does this place always stink so terribly?
My father. An honorable man, lost in the dark.
What use is all this to him?
What are you up to?! Get out!
Thief!
Go and see what the Professor is doing over there!
Tell him people are trying to work over here!
You're wanted.
You are breaking his spine!
What do you want?
Nothing. To see you.
To see what? I'm not a painting.
It's too tight.
And you're charging money for this?
And whom exactly would I be charging?
Those people over there.
My patients don't have anything.
Untie him, please.
Good method.
Tested on many a patient.
- And haw many have survived?
- I've never counted.
As usual.
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.
- Steady on your legs?
- Yes.
- Then get out of here!
- What the heck?
Tomorrow you will be hopping around like a rabbit.
Are you sleeping poorly?
I don't sleep at all.
Someone has survived the rack.
- At last!
You love your rack.
One can't work on an empty stomach.
True.
These are Gad's gifts.
Come, brothers. The flesh is calling.
Nothing has been cleaned!
I always have to do everything myself!
That George!
- Smells nice! What is it?
- Here I am!
Out!
Mine!
It is my due!
Who is the meat from?
From Frau Weber, whose appendix you snipped.
- Didn't earn much.
- I don't have such huge needs...
...as our dear professor.
- Needs...
...I don't even have enough money for ink.
I'm willing to forsake everything... the house...
- Sit down.
...food. Anything.
- To do without is good for one.
- If only I were certain...
- Of what?
- That what I'm doing has meaning.
No. I'm not giving you any.
No!
What? What do you mean?
Surely you want money?
He who limits himself...
...creates his own small fortune.
His own small fortune.
Heard that a thousand times.
One must work and never beg.
- You again!
- I've been waiting for two hours.
I'm sick.
What is it now? Let's have a look.
You are like an onion!
There is no getting close to you!
Lie down!
Help me.
I don't understand... what is this?
Pass me the vaginal speculum.
Hold her legs down.
I work day and night.
I love no one, I have no family...
...I never sleep.
I find your reproaches unjust.
I'm doing my best.
What good is it to me if my soul is empty? I feel no happiness...
...no anger, no compassion.
- The soul...
...one can do without It.
Why complicate things?
Matter. Black.
Hollow.
My hammer strikes the knee and the leg twitches.
That's it.
- That is not enough for me.
- Then leave.
I have no money for you.
Nor the meaning of life.
Let's look at what we have here.
That's a pity.
Venus. Venus.
What are you doing?!
He is a good man, your father.
A good man.
A good man, in his darkest yearning...
...still knows the one...
...true way.
Must do without.
You must do without.
That's the eternal song.
The eternal song.
The eternal song.
The eternal song.
- Let me through!
Don't be so greedy!
- No! This has been ordered!
- Enough!
Shut up!
Would the gentleman have a few pennies to spare?
- No. I'm sorry.
- Just a few coins.
- We are starving!
- So am I.
Such a line gentleman and no money.
Nothing in the pockets?
Noblemen are so forgetful, aren't they?
- Snotty brat!
Me? A brat? I'll smash your face in!
Watch your jewels!
- I'll knock the stuffing out of you!
- Swine!
- Bastards!
- Dirt bag!
- Cunny!
Bonehead!
- Get lost!
Let me. I'll show him!
I'll let you fly.
Who is this?
Good day, dear sir.
Who is this?
Black. Like Death himself.
Good day, sir.
Or is Death grey?
Father Philipp. You're here already.
I thought I'd be late.
Debt after debt I have amended!
Yes, the affair is settled as far as you're concerned.
- There is my coach.
- A remarkable pair.
Death and a priest.
And I. A starving man.
You're hungry, too?
Everybody is starving...
Who is this from?
From Lent, the poet.
A strangely unhappy man...
No need lo return it.
The unhappy are dangerous!
Good day, sir.
My name is Faust, Doctor Faust.
I salute the learned gentleman!
I'm the owner of this firm.
My name is Muller, Mauritius.
I am Mauricius Muller...
Who are you, please?
A part of the power...
...that always does what's good.
Where does the second voice come from? Does he have two tongues?
Do come in! I'm all ears.
Please be careful.
This is all pawned property?
A pledge of security, as the law calls it.
- This is my midwife’s.
- Really?
- I know her. Frau Menzel.
- It's a small world.
And with these, you weigh money?
No, souls.
- Are they heavy!
- No heavier than a coin.
- I thought so.
- Most of them...
...but not yours.
The man has no sense of humour.
Take a seal.
Thank you.
A starving man never has a sense of humour.
- This here.
- If I may.
I'd like to pawn this.
This is no ordinary ring!
The philosopher's stone!
It explains the nature of things.
- Then it must be worth something.
- On the contrary.
It's worth nothing.
Life has declined in value...
...not to mention death
I don't understand.
What's worth anything then?
Time... Art...
Who is rustling there?
Who is creeping around?
I need money.
- Anything else you desire?
- I am still ton young...
...to be without desire.
- I have a desire, ton.
I collect autographs.
"The Foundations of Human Physiology."
- Did you write this?
- Even if I did...
...I couldn't sign it for you.
I have no money for ink.
Soon I'll have to write in blond.
No need. I have ink.
Your knowledge is impressive.
Here you are.
This work will outlive you.
The word dies...
...before it leaves the pen.
- Over here, yes...
...but there is also the world beyond.
I'm so tired. Man's wretched ways exhaust me.
And my heart aches.
- Now, give me the money!
- No.
- What would you accept in pawn?
- Anything.
- Even rubbish?
- It depends.
An old tract about the meaning of life?
- No, no.
- A perpetuum mobile?
Spare me!
The relics of Saint Sebastian?
The relics? That's a good one.
- Where would you find those?
- Seek and you shall find.
Did this Sebastian ever exist?
Maybe.
- Maybe not.
- What are you saying?
I'm saying, there won't be any money.
- Do you see this hole?
- Nu.
I wanted to pluck a rose blossom...
...for a maiden.
- You should mend it.
Mend It! Where does one find the right cloth?
And time? And money?
No money! No time!
Spent it all!
That's how it is then.
He shall eat dust, and eat eagerly.
I will see what I can do for you. Doctor.
Never mind.
Ferdinand! My registry!
Ferdinando!
It's not under my pillow!
I have hidden it somewhere else.
I'm thirsty! Pour me some wine!
Certainly, madam.
Law, medicine, philosophy...
...and sadly even theology...
.I've studied with passionate resolution.
And stand here now...
...a fool for sure, no wiser than I was before.
Excuse me.
[Everything fleeting is only a stench]
- Calm down!
We can't get through with the coffin!
Everyone over here!
I'm here! I'm with you!
Patience, patience! Don't move!
Let the pigs through!
There we go. Come on.
Ida. I need hot water.
What's this I need?!
I have to cook now.
In the beginning was the Word...
...the Word... in the beginning was the Word...
...the Word...
You again! Come in!
In the beginning was the Word...
And the Word was with God.
Do you understand how this is meant?
- No.
- Neither do I.
"in the beginning was the Word..."
Already I'm stuck.
Impossible for me to rate the word...
...so highly.
- You must translate it some other way.
Maybe "the thought"?
In the beginning was... in the beginning was the thought that acts...
...and creates everything.
- In the beginning was the I.
- Whose "I"?
- Mine.
- Von were in the beginning?
- Why not?
- Then we're all doomed.
- I don't believe so.
- Ida!
That was on purpose!
There you have your water!
Furniture wrecker!
Little termite!
- in the beginning was the Word.
- Such manners! In our home!
- No, you're mistaken.
In the beginning was the thought...
...that acts and creates everything in the beginning was an I.
Listen lo...
...wise little Wagner...
...who nearly bursts with love for his master.
In the beginning was the thought...
...wise little Wagner...
Yes, wise little Wagner.
Or the great...
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Slop it.
But It's the latest fashion in France!
I look like a corpse in this colour.
Did you bring what I asked for?
Yes.
Give it to me! There it is.
Thank you.
I hope your brawn liquid is good.
- it all depends on the dose.
- As long as it works.
Will you miss me?
Begin the procedure.
Wagner! Will you miss me?
Miss you?
I can't say whether I'll miss you.
Yes or no?
Or would you join me in death?
- What's that! Stinging nettle?
- It stimulates the vital organs.
- And spells the appetite.
- Nu. I won't miss you.
- Why not!
I can tell you...
...why I won't miss you.
- Alright.
What are the gentlemen doing?!
An abominable stench throughout the house!
Like a witches kitchen!
As a consolation I'll drink it, too!
No, you won't.
I'll drink it all myself.
- Where is my towel?
Don't walk barefoot!
What are you doing here? I'm not receiving today. I have to go.
A decent gentleman!
Extremely decent!
You forgo! Your ring.
As an honest man...
...I felt obliged to return it.
How did you get in here?
Who let you in?
Iduberga! Did you let him in?
- Are you running an open house?
- Thank you, Iduberga.
Decent people must keep...
...each others company, and not mingle with riffraff.
- Thanks, Iduberga.
- Wagner. Why are you shivering?
Get out!
Why not money instead?
- I'd prefer money.
- The Gospel according to John.
- Do you know Greek?
- Nu.
But I'd always recognise the Holy Scripture.
How so?
My faith helps.
You hope to find what you're lacking in this hunk?
- What am I lacking!
- I know. A healthy diet.
- For you.
- That won't be necessary.
- Trying.
- If you say so.
I baked it myself.
What is that smell?
- Such a sweet smell!
- Where are you going?
Eat! You'll need it.
How do you know what I'll need?
Eat, eat.
Hemlock!
- From the apothecary next door?
- None of your business.
That was mine!
This is impossible.
You cannot die here!
What is more, I wanted to go.
You are alive? Interesting...
But the poison... How the devil?!
The devil?
Stupid wenches call me that...
...but it's not who I am.
- Who are you then?
If I knew...
What use would it be to you?
I have a certain interest.
In what?
The eternal dilemma.
Oh, no, no!
Out of the question...
...the waiting list is too long.
Too many interested parties...
Who else is on the list?
Tell me. It'll remain between us.
Or are you deceiving me again?
I speak only the naked truth
Our theatre director...
I thought so.
- Your rector.
An idiot! Who else?
The local coffin maker.
Don't touch!
A monkey!
A monkey!
You're lying!
A monkey on the moon!
Then, the butcher, the music teacher.
- Pfeiffer?!
Yes, exactly. A freemason.
- That's plenty.
- Exactly.
I told you.
What are you looking for?
You stink like a corpse!
What a stench!
I don't smell anything, but if you say so.
What shall we do?
Should we air the room?
- But how exactly shall we go about It?
- We'll just walk out.
A stroll with you, Doctor, is an honour and a reward.
By way of saying thanks
I'd like to show you something.
I know everything you could show me in this town.
And what we do know is of no use to us.
Ergos what we don't know will be of use to us.
Give me that! Now explain...
...how It's possible after such a lethal dose... that you should still be alive?
Incredible!
Oh, now it starts! I'm dying!
The spirit of denial will survive this world.
- This is the way out.
Not an ounce of sympathy...
- What?
...for your companion!
Your hemlock was too strong for my weak stomach.
Thank you.
Thanks for what?
- When will you be back?
- Le! Me do ill.
- Why must we lock it all the time?
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Iduberga.
- Ida!
Turn the key to the right!
- To the left!
- What has got into you?
You seem to cause turmoil.
First Wagner, then Ida.
What is going on?
The gate is broken.
Godforsaken corner!
Someone is always getting stuck!
- Your timber is here.
- Put it there.
- You must pay for It.
- How do we get out?
- Patience! God was also patient.
- Is the world loo cramped for you?
What are you all doing here?
You have no business here!
Where is your compassion?
Everyone must live somehow.
And survive. But I'm no saviour.
What do you know how to do?
- Chatter.
- A good remedy.
Maybe, but remedies are not my speciality.
But there is one simple remedy.
It helps one to live and to survive.
- That way, damn it!
- No, you have to go that way I.
So you know... a remedy that needs no gold no magic.
- What is it?
Work your plot...
- Dig, though...
- Rise early!
- Rise early! Milk the cows...
- Feed the cattle...
Feed yourself on the purest fare...
Muck out the stables.
No fear of dirt, or manure.
My stomach! I have to go to...
So narrow a life would never suit me.
I can't hold it any longer.
Not here! We're not alone!
I can't hold it any longer.
It's your hemlock's fault. Cover me!
Not next to the church!
True.
Better inside the church.
Wait here. I'll be back shortly.
Excuse me, I'm afraid
I don't know you.
Soon we will let you in on the deal.
He has such a weak stomach.
What are you doing here?
Tell me, then, what is the matter?
I know him. You have made the right decision.
What do you mean?
Reputable men an reputably...
...contract, signature, as is proper.
Excuse me, can I be of service?
And...
...is he really the...?
- He is.
And how about you?
I'm number 150 on the waiting list.
Good. What number am I?
I could give you mine.
No, thanks.
- Surely you don't believe in God?
- Vanity of vanities, boredom...
...the entire world is a failure.
But why do you believe...
...in Satan?
Where is the logic here?
If good doesn't exist...
...then neither can evil. Right?
No, wrong. Good doesn't exist...
...but evil does!
- He has answered you.
What are you talking about!
Your turn. Professor.
Good does not exist, hut evil does.
- Doctor!
- Do you know what you just said?
I'm here!
You're not alone.
Let us leave this place!
In the beginning was the deed!
Let's go home, Agathe!
In the beginning was the deed?
This woman has been following me for years.
She claims lo be my wife.
- in the beginning was the deed.
- Yes, the deed!
- The deed!
- An interesting solution...
I assumed it was meaning.
Or power.
No, meaning results from action...
But... Where are we going?
I just wanted to get rid of that woman.
- What is this here?
- I don't know myself.
Seems like a good spot for our philosophical discussion.
This rings a bell.
I was here as a child.
This is what I call real human life!
Here I'm a man, here I dare to be a man!
- Looks more like a slave market!
- No.
They're made free by work.
Industrious folk.
All very good, but I want to leave!
You are free. Sweet young blood!
Who wouldn't fall in love with girls like you?
- Von see these women here?
- Yes.
- Only women. And the two of us.
- They're busy.
Yes, and satisfied and carefree.
- Completely and utterly busy.
- Yes. Perhaps.
- Do you see their fingers?
- No.
They're all...
...crooked like this.
That people everywhere are miserable,
I've read in a thousand books.
You've read it!
But man wants to be happy.
Day and night.
With such crooked fingers you could never open your vial of poison!
What do you mean by that?
It is you who worries me, not these women.
Although they have nothing, just ice cold water and work.
There you are!
Oh. My hail.
Aren't you bored?
Nothing but washing...
- Come over here, Gudrun!
- What am I doing here?
Hands off! It's all mine! Go away!
Work, work.
While you're still young.
Wade right in! Don't be stupid!
Get busy, Doctor!
He is a madman! A freak!
My God!
What is that?
- Don't look!
He has nothing in front!
We must pair him off with old Martha.
She'll be delighted.
Do you like him?
That's me!
What are you staring at? Shameless...
He has nothing in front.
What a tiny little winkle!
When It's that small it doesn't matter whether it's in front or in back.
There she is, my sweet! Come...
...we'll go for a swim!
- Help!
I don't know how to swim!
My nightgown is floating there.
Next to Gretchen!
- You must give yourself a proper scrub!
- Margarete! Where is your basket?
It's over there.
And these towels?
- Out of the way!
What is the matter?
- Baboon!
What impudence!
- Doctor! Help me please!
- What are you yelling about?
- Can't you be quiet for five minutes?
- My waistcoat.
- I'm not your servant.
- Yes...
...not yet.
- The waistcoat...
...is too tight for your flabby belly.
What do you have against my body?
You're no Apollo yourself.
As for your body, I have a few questions...
...but not now.
- We have the time.
- I don't.
Time is on the wane. My hat!
Excellent linen.
- Could you move a bit faster?
- Why?
- I have to find her.
- The two ladies have already left.
- I see that. And I want to find them!
- Not a chance.
But I will find them!
Professor. What's the hurry?
- He's following you.
I like that funny old fart.
- There they are.
- I don't.
A professor, and he still dashes around like a little boy!
There she is.
I'm an old man and can't run that fast.
You're free...
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.
May I presume, my lovely lady...
...lo offer you my arm and escort?
I'm neither lovely nor a lady...
...and I can get home by myself.
Margarete! Come on!
We must hurry up.
So impudent!
This is not a rose garden!
- Let's go that way.
Not across the square?...
...it would be much faster.
- Come on.
He's already dead.
What are you waiting for?
We need the room. Take him away!
- is he dead?
- Yes.
- Why was he screaming like that?
- Another one cured to death.
Because the Lord God took His time.
What do we have here? Interesting...
- Where does this wonder come from?
- From Schierke.
Schierke. I'm familiar with the place. Near Bracken.
That's that. Poor fellow.
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing. Come on.
I already did everything I could!
You were cured.
There is no cure for leprosy,
Father.
Who is this you've dragged here with you?
- We didn't mean to disturb you.
Who are you running around with?
Does your father mean me?
- Hey, you! You old goat!
- Father, stop it!
Father, father, catch me!
Have you tucked in your tail?
- Stop it!
You old goat!
- Where is your tall?
- Do you know him. Father?
- I know you!
- What has he done to you?
Mauricius! We have to go! Follow me!
- Monkey ass! Son of a bitch!
- Again, again...
Mauricius! Come on!
Get out of here! Stinky old goat!
- Likewise!
- Piss off!
- Riffraff!
You stinky old goat!
Mauricius!
Where is your tail? Stinky old goat...
- What is that?
- My wings.
Why are you whining like a wet poodle?
This way.
- People, peace has come!
No fighting tonight!
We have won!
Let me show you now a jolly company...
...so that you see how easy life can be.
Why does everyone wish to be young?
No thanks!
Esteemed students!
No more free drinks!
- But the war is over!
- Everyone wants to celebrate!
- These fellows will shatter my eardrums!
Splendid!
- A nasty song.
Better than your father's shouting.
What a pigsty this Is!
Anna! Clean up!
What's the matter?
- First you send everybody away.
- What you waiting for. Wench?
- All you're concerned with is courting your trollops!
Such a good and honest woman.
Do you have anything decent on offer?
Or are you serving only donkey piss today?
We have fine wine from Burgundy.
There are plenty of donkeys in Burgundy. Loo.
What you call Burgundy is probably in fact Courland.
- Behave yourself!
- Look...
...over there is the Doctor.
He has lost the meaning of life.
- He needs some wine!
- Yes! Here!
Anna! Two glasses of wine!
Doctor, sorry to bother you.
You're a master of astrology, aren't you?
You're familiar with the stars?
Everybody's talking about...
- Can we order some more wine?
- Bugger off!
Everybody's talking about the comet...
- But we'd like to order more wine!
- Get lost, student scum!
So, about the comet.
What does it mean?
Nothing.
Nothing?
A ball of gas.
A ball of gas?
The comet?
A fart?!
But... of course... it figures...
...that when the sky farts, a comet appears.
Thank you, Doctor.
Anna! Where are you, silly cow?
Emmerich! Valentin!
I've written a poem for your beautiful sister.
Professor You're leaving?
- Let me out.
- And who's paying?
He's paying for me, the man in the hack.
That's what everybody says.
I can bring you the money tomorrow.
- My friend is paying.
- Really?
What the hell!
Such impudence!
What so offends the defender of the Fatherland?
This swill?
Or my presence here?
He didn't mean to offend you.
Then he must apologise.
Alright, enough!
If he is so tender. Then...
...excuse me.
Although there is no reason to apologise.
You must admit this is donkey piss.
- Enough!
- Pure donkey piss.
- He is drunk. And a soldier!
- A drunken soldier.
He should apologise properly!
Then he'd better keep silent.
Wine is the blood of the earth.
I'll show him what this blond looks like.
I'm going to see Margarete.
Let's have one more drink then we'll go.
Be quiet, friendly element.
How did he do that?
It's all a hoax all tricks, all lies.
Here is a miracle, so just believe.
That's wine? Holy Mary!
We drink to your sister, to beautiful Margarete!
Swill!
Someone said something interesting there.
Donkey piss!
The young man is again offended!
So fussy!
Leave It! The old man is too fat for your short blade!
Doctor, stand your ground!
Stay close to me!
What are you doing?
He has fallen onto my fork!
How clumsy!
It's time for us to disappear.
But we cannot...
...just disappear!
We must!
- He needs help!
- He's not the first.
It's you who needs help.
It's good bread, fresh baked.
Yes, I see.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm just looking.
Congratulations on your new life!
What have you clone?!
I didn't mean to.
It just happened.
As if the Devil himself put the fork in my ha rid!
It is a mortal sin!
If you must be careless with your own soul, then please think of mine.
One doesn't die of such wounds!
So you say, poor boy.
He has likely already died.
While you are so cold blooded.
Enough! Who started the whole thing? You or me?
You just said it yourself... the Devil.
So the question remains open.
You're a clown!
A clown?! This way I.
Why didn't you take...
...my ring?
- The things you worry about.
- You're laughing?!
- Shall I renounce all laughter...
...for your sake?
Just tell me how I can make this right.
- Can you heal his wound?
- No.
Comfort his kin?
No. How big is the family?
Only two people. His mother and sister.
A miserable clan.
They've pawned everything.
No doubt in your shop.
There is no one up there!
It's draughty here.
His sister!
Margarete! What a flower!
I still can't believe that...
...she will wither with grief...
...without tasting the pleasures of life.
Oh, what have you done?!
We must help them somehow, give them money...
But there is no money to be had.
Can't you help?
- What can I...
- Oh, come on!
...give to them? The things I have do not belong to me.
They could be redeemed at any moment.
What can be dune?
- Come!
- Where are you taking me?
Camel.
Hang the tablecloth over there.
It'll dry more quickly.
There they are.
There she is! Unbelievable!
What you can't count on, you can't believe is true.
You gave me only the light things.
Make sure to hang the dress properly.
Or your mother will tell us both off!
She is so strict in everything she does.
- What are you doing here?
- The wound was fatal after all.
- Your brother.
- What do you mean, "my brother"?
This is my brother?
But he is dead... Mama!
This is Valentin?
I don't recognise him at all!
They any it's my brother.
Yes, this is your brother.
Take him inside.
- We have to do something.
- To procure the pretty thing for you?
Stop joking! I'm not in the mood.
It's indeed narrow... My God...
Put it in an angle, fool!
Find some money for them!
Or I'll inform on you.
Alright. I can't watch you suffer!
You're forcing me to use my nest egg.
That's that.
You'll find me at home.
You know the way.
I'll be in the cellar.
- Doctor!
- Where are you?
Here!
- What's that smell?
- The smell of misery.
What a heap? Is this your nest egg?
Help yourself!
So what dues gold smell like?
Gold?
Like sweet cream.
Like a cake with whipped cream.
- Are you hungry again?
- Yes!
Careful! My wings!
I have lo get a closer look at you...
...at your wings, your arse.
Why not just cut me up?
Wagner would be delighted.
A magnificent autopsy specimen!
- Mr. Faust, this Isn't like you.
- No, it isn't like me.
There should he a box up there somewhere.
You keep all this to yourself, but we need money.
My old friend Tacitus.
- I've found something!
- Pardon me?
Keep looking, keep looking!
You want to make the whole world happy!
- Some kind of bones!
- Coins!
- A shower of gold!
- Where is the box?
Come to me, my Zeus!
I'll be your Danae!
- Von gabber! Have you found something?
- My aunt's brown purse... fallen as if from heaven!
- You're tricking me!
- The Devil doesn't have aunts!
- For the Lord, all things are possible.
Let me out of here!
No, I have to change my clothes!
Me, too! Hurry up!
I wan! To gel this over with.
- Then you go ahead.
- No...
...you go, my dear friend, and I'll wait outside.
Today we bid farewell to our beloved Valentin.
The Lord summons not only the old...
...but sometimes the young as well.
His earthly life was brief.
But he will be remembered as a loyal son...
...a caring brother, and a reliable friend.
- Where are you going?
- I need to see your mistress.
- Do you need help?
- Go, go!
It's highly confidential.
What are you sniffing around here for?
Frau Emmerich!
You have a visitor.
- Good day, Frau Emmerich!
- I do not wish to see anyone.
It will be of the greatest Interest to you, dear madam.
Have you taken lemon balm?
It won't help.
I have something hatter for you.
- What?
- A sedative you know well.
When your husband passed, he left a tidy sum.
You were comforted rather quickly.
- I have children.
You have survived...
...even the unborn child you killed in your womb.
A true friend gave you a ring...
...and you immediately forgot your grief.
Caressing gold is a good cure.
I have no gold, as you well know.
Now once again you do.
I was asked to give this to you.
- By whom?
- A good person...
...with a big heart. An angel.
Or perhaps a villain, a scoundrel.
What are you saying?
Just take what your patron saint has given.
Only the Lord God sends patron saints.
- Not necessarily.
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh.
Man has two hands. One taketh, the other one giveth.
What about you?
It has nothing to do with me.
What's wrong?!
He struggles along like a decrepit old horse!
What, what, what?!
Tell me already!
Did she accept it?
She did. But personally,
I wouldn't have given it to her.
Why not?
I don't like any of this.
You are moved...
...by pure lust.
Although it is hidden behind a mask of nobleness.
What nobleness! There they are already!
I'm ridden with guilt.
That's also quite noble.
What's the hurry?
One is rushed. Even to the grave.
Time is on the wane.
Death is never a welcome guest.
One always hurries to be rid of him.
This is taking it too far, Doctor!
- What are you doing here?
- Listen...
...this is not my crime, but yours.
Oh dear, you've been offended!
Attention! Close ranks!
But we have no money.
Now we do. Now everything will be different.
We won't let our heroes be disgraced!
Stop it! End this nonsense!
There are no heroes here!
This is a private affair!
Onwards! I'll lead the way!
Go get 'em!
Splendid!
Hands off! She's not yours!
What is the Professor doing here?
He's not a member of the family.
Boring!
I barely knew him.
He was always fighting in some war or other.
I rarely saw him.
From the earth we came...
...and so we shall return.
Earth to earth...
...ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
My sympathies. Frau Emmerich.
Be careful with the cross!
- Are you going to the wake?
- No.
A peculiar girl.
May I accompany you,
Frau Emmerich?
- is that him?
- No.
So who is it then?
An eternal wanderer...
...who roams the hills and vales of life.
Altmayer!
Where are you? Let's go together!
- All of them are buried here...
...my entire family.
- The graves seem somewhat neglected.
Everything will he different now.
What a naughty old man!
Could you introduce me to him?
- Absolutely nut.
- Why not?
My companion is a scholar.
A misanthrope.
He lacks the lightness of being that we naturally possess.
- What is he doing here?
- He is suffering.
Everything revolves in its little circle.
I don't like any of this
I'll see you home.
Wolves roam these parts.
For everyone knows exactly what will lead him lo hell.
- What about my mother?
- She's having a conversation.
What?
You don't know what leads a man to hell?
I'm so tired.
We're nearly there.
But nobody wants to go to hell.
Everyone presumes hell is only for the bad, not the good.
And that is a mistake.
What plant might I gladden you with?
Celery? Parsley?
Perhaps mandrake root?
There is no mandrake root round here.
- You should be glad! Oh, a burdock!
- Thank you.
Can you not walk faster?
I have to get to my guests.
Do you know where mandrake root grows?
- No.
- We'd better take the little path.
- Why?
This path is better.
It is a steep path but it is quite pretty.
- Yes, it truly is.
- Professor!
- I'm over here!
- I can hear that.
It grows below gallows or near bonfire pits...
Blueberries!
Bonfires in which witches were burned.
- I'm tired.
We can have a rest.
No, let's keep going.
Women are weatherproofs one may only admire them.
Why are you so frightened?
You're not a witch.
- Where are the two of them going?
- They cannot run away.
All roads lead to town.
And what is this here?
Verbena.
Or a lily.
Are you really a professor?
And a baccalaureate, and a doctor, and so on.
But you're not well versed in botany.
Quite so.
Autumn is coming.
So in what things are you well versed?
The order of the universe...
...the trajectories of the planets...
...the transmutation of metal into gold.
What plan! Is this?
I think.
...It's chickweed.
- The things you know.
Why are only women sent to the stake?
I know that my chatter can never entertain a man like you.
- But not men?
- You'll be the first man to burn.
You should trust yourself more.
Fine by me!
I dream of the day...
...when I'm finally burned.
The day that everybody is burned...
...regardless of sex...
...age, rank or merit.
That's what I call equality.
I had a dream about my brother today.
He seemed different
We talked...
...for a long time.
You know so much.
What does death do to a person?
Does he die completely?
Science argues that death exists.
- But life gives the same answer.
- Yes, that's true.
So what do we need your science for?
It's something to do to fill the void.
You, say, probably enjoy knitting in your free time?
Yes, I do.
Science is something like knitting.
I'm driven by great things.
This earthly round is too cramped for me
I can neither better nor convert my fellow men.
- Wherever are they?
They're just talking and talking.
- What about?
- About life and death.
Death is death.
Yes, death still exists.
But soon it will disappear.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm speaking of the future.
But some people are already on the right path.
And there won't be any unhappy people there?
No. The unhappy are dangerous.
Quite dangerous.
Doctor! I'm over here!
Margarete! It is late!
Come! What are you doing sitting there?
Is this a pleasure garden or what?
We must go home!
- I'm coming, Mother!
- Quickly, quickly!
Why are you running round with your skirt raised?
What an innocent child!
- Don't touch her!
- No groping!
Thank you. Goodbye, my guardian angel.
- I'll be thinking of you.
- You're shameless!
Up here it's safer, isn't it?
Why are you roaming about?
Think of your brother!
He lies in his grave, and what are you doing?
- I think only of him!
I know what you're thinking about!
You little whore!
It's a disgrace! A disgrace!
What will people say?
One should never joke with women.
Mama, wait!
That wasn't exactly timely.
Who is he anyway?
Why did you bring the mother here?
It was lime.
You begin in secret, with just one.
And then another.
And soon the whole town will have you!
You know where this will lead you?
What are you doing here?
Come with us!
No, I don't know!
What binds a woman to a man?
Don't you know?
No, I have no idea.
Three things...
...money...
...lust, and a shared household.
That has a cynical ring.
Cynical?
It's strange to hear that from you.
Yet another moralizer.
I have the right to accuse others of being cynical...
...because I myself am different.
Clean.
Pure.
You're clean, pure?
Who told you that?
Ever since Eve was tempted, the world has not been pure it wasn't I who tempted her, but a distant ancestor.
A snake just like you.
Good clay!
- Are we headed the right way?
- Where are you going?
- To Paris.
To Paris? Paris is that way.
Get in!
- Would you like to go to Paris?
- That's the last thing I need.
- Show me the way.
- I'm tired.
Let's ride with him for a bit.
Someone is lying in here, snoring.
Doctor! Climb in...
...or the best seats will be taken, as so often happens in life.
Get in, get in!
Come on!
Hey, careful!
Lousy Krauts!
Let's be off! Straight ahead!
I want to get out it smells here!
- The man stinks terribly.
- Maybe it's a woman.
You'd know hatter than I.
Your little doll quickly took the bait.
How I'd love to spit in your impudent face!
But I skill have need of you...
...perhaps.
- Together we're strong.
We accomplished a lot today. We made the family of the murdered men happy.
- Indeed! We made them happy.
You talked lo Margarete rate in private.
- Mind you, thanks to me.
- It was too brief.
Too brief?!
Do you wan! To be with her for longer?
Then it's called seduction.
Good morning!
Selifan, give me my jacket! And teal.
And so it is.
But I want to all the same!
How boring!
I was sleeping.
Selifan, where is my jacket?
We have guests.
- is he a madman?
- No, he's Russian.
- How do I approach her?
You'll have to impress the girl!
But how?
Show her that you can read her secret thoughts.
- Girls like that sort of thing.
- Stop it!
Even you won't be able to find out her secret thoughts.
Selifan, kick them out!
Stop! We've arrived!
It's mass you need to stay the masses.
Come on, Doctor!
You're not yet man enough to deal with those devils.
- What do you mean not yet?
- You must learn to trust yourself.
- Nonsense!
- Your desire to live is great...
...but your strength is small.
- Were you serious...
...a bout reading her thoughts?
- Even you can't do that.
I can't. But her confessor can
I'm not a confessor.
- You could become one.
- Me? Her confessor?
- I feel you have strength.
- You're mocking me!
I'm not mocking you.
I have a plan.
When was the last time you went to church?
Last year.
Margarete goes a little more regularly.
Nearly every day.
Nearly every day?
So what?
- How is that going to help me?
- You're hungry.
Everyone here is starving.
Continue fighting. The world is big.
And our priest...
...is he also one of your clients?
Well, then.
See you later.
Rather tasty.
I did my best. As always.
Such pretty things.
Where did you get the money for them?
Your student...
Your student pawned off some of your lectures on somebody.
Although I have no Idea why anyone would want them.
One doesn't have to know everything, Ida.
One more thing. Professor.
There was someone here for you, a professor.
He wanted to invite you to his lecture.
"I asked him, Who are you?
What do you want?"
He said: I want to see
Professor Faust.
- Thanks, Ida.
- You're welcome.
I said: "You have no business here.
Go to the unisity."
"University"!
That's what I said, "Unisity".
- "He's there day and night". I said.
- Yes, It's all so terribly horrible.
- Decent gentlemen sleep at home...
...in their own beds.
Katharina!
I'm busy!
I'll save her.
What do you want, Frau Hagemann?
I want some bread.
- Where were you?
- Everybody has been waiting.
What did she tell you. Adelhelma?
Where is your mother, Gretchen?
There she is.
Where have you been?
They're going to eat everything up!
Margarete, where are you going?
I'm going outside.
There he is.
Where can I make a donation?
It's you! I haven't seen you in a long while.
How large is the donation?
It's not small.
How hard the uphill road would be...
...in silence. Sweat. And effort...
...if every now and then we did not meet a rose upon our way...
...that nodded to us.
Look, I'm in bloom!
Please. Come with me.
What would we do without...
...the generous hands of our benefactors.
He who has no hand makes no list.
Elsa! I forgot my basket in your house!
I'll bring it by later!
There she is. What a coincidence!
No, it's no coincidence!
I must speak with you. Don't be afraid!
I despise everything coarse.
I know how you feel.
I was there at the cemetery.
- Didn't you see me?
- Let me pass!
I was there.
I'm so happy today!
It's such a happy, important day!
Do you think he is Faust?
He isn't Faust! I am Faust!
He stole all his ideas from me!
- He is a usurper!
- What did he say?
Yes, I'm little Wagner.
I am the great Wagner!
- We believe you.
The very great Wagner!
- Shall I take your measurements?
- I am the great Wagner!
The very great Wagner. I am Faust.
I am Faust.
The great Wagner.
- The very great Wagner.
- Yes.
- I am Faust.
- Yes...
...I believe you.
Yes, of course.
I believe you.
I can prove it to you.
I have...
I can prove it if you don't believe me.
I've done it!
I mixed the essential oils...
...of asparagus and dandelion...
...with a hyena's liver.
And thus I created...
...a homunculus.
I mixed...
...the essential oils of asparagus...
...and dandelion...
...with a hyena's liver.
...mixed it with a hyena's...
...liver.
I mixed the essential oils of asparagus and dandelion.
What are you doing?
A homunculus! An Ubermensch!
A manmade man!
Show her what you can do!
Look, Margarete!
Look! Say something to her!
Let me go!
Help! Help!
My peace is gone...
...my heart is sore...
...I'll never find it...
...Oh, nevermore.
Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?
Yes, please enter.
Dear Lord, forgive me my tainted thoughts.
Heel so alone.
And I do not love my mother.
But she doesn't love me, either
I know I'm a had daughter.
And God will punish me.
But her makeup...
...the powder on her forehead...
...her bad breath.
Dear Lord, forgive me and help me.
Forgive me my sins.
You?
- I met your assistant.
- Did you really?
He is somewhat nervous. Your student.
Yes, he is a philosopher.
May I tell you something?
You needn't reproach yourself.
Take me, for example.
I didn't love my mother.
I found everything about her nauseating.
Her red painted cheeks.
The powder on her forehead.
Her foul breath.
But that is a sin.
One must love one's mother.
No...
One day she died suddenly.
She choked one piece of cake.
And died instantly.
Can you imagine?
To die from a piece of cake!
With whipped cream.
If you asked me today whether...
...I'd wanted her dead then...
...I'd have to admit...
...that yes, I did.
- Do you believe in God?
Who today has the right to say,
"I believe in God"?
Me.
God is love.
But love knows no obligations.
You don't have to love your mother.
Are you a mind reader?
You're able to read the book of life.
Not the book of life...
...but, perhaps, the book of one particular person.
There is a custom...
...to pray for the deceased for forty days...
...while holding something in your hand...
...that was his
I've never heard of that.
No, there is such a custom.
Doctor, I'm leaving.
Everyone can do it...
...except for murderers.
Would you like to pray for my brother?
He gave this to me.
What a likeness!
Farewell.
I saw it with my own eyes.
It was the one who kept hiding behind the fat man.
It couldn't have been anyone else,
Frau Emmerich!
Come here!
I know who killed your brother.
Do you want to know?
It was Faust who did it.
Katharina! Please bring me my cape!
MY sympathies.
Take a right at the south gate
I'll show you the way.
You?
Do come in.
Do come in.
Have a seal.
Have a seal.
Sit down.
I moved the bed next to the window.
For the light... I'm reading.
- I have to ask you something.
- Yes, go ahead.
- Something peculiar.
- You can ask me anything.
- Please excuse me.
- Go on, ask me.
What is this?
A bellows.
Yes.
- And this?
- A retort...
...for distilling mercury.
Is that all you wanted to ask me?
Word has it...
- No... You know...
- What do I know?
Good bye!
Good bye!
Was it you who killed my brother?
Yes, I killed him.
What do you want?
But on the list it says "two rugs."
What rugs?
Where are my Persian rugs?
It seems you picked them up yesterday.
The lady would like to redeem her
Dutch chest.
But it is full of fleas!
Out of the way! Three rugs...
...and 22 % in interest.
- What 22 % interest?
- What about my flute clock?
With the Handel sarabande?
The beautiful clock goes back.
I love Handel.
Wait! We have to...
Where is my flute clock?
Oh, Ferdinand! Tick it off!
- One Christ.
- One chest?
- One Christ. It goes over there.
- Somebody stole the clock.
- How many were there?
- Five vases.
- We're doomed.
- I know.
- We've been found out!
- By who?
The girl told me I was the murderer.
You have been found out, not me.
Does this mean she came to see you?
I hope you used the opportunity?
It is not my nature to use such opportunities.
Stupid! You won't get another such chance.
You only wasted time if you denied it all.
How do you know that
I denied it all!
You are the incessant liar.
I always tell the truth.
Is that 507 Well, never mind.
It must have been the mother who found out.
Take it easy.
So far you haven't been arrested.
Don't worry.
We'll find a way to silence the mother.
See what a swamp you've driven me into?
When you're sitting in prison...
...then you'll know what a swamp is.
- Go! Away!
- Stop!
- Don't go!
Move it, I said!
No, stop! This is all rubbish!
Where is my mirror?
- You won't be needing a mirror anymore!
- My clock!
You've run out of time!
Rubbish! This is all rubbish!
- Rubbish? These are your treasures! Go!
- Leave him alone!
Devil!
- Crook!
Move it!
It's an outrage!
Enough, I said!
I want only one night
That's all I want!
One night.
- Only one night. Alone with her.
- All alone?
One whole night.
The things you want!
She shares a room with her mother!
One night.
Please. Just one night.
Why such complications?
You could just Invite the little doll to your place.
She already knows the way.
After what I've confessed?
What happened to your intellect?
Where is your imagination?
I have no imagination.
I have something better.
You sign here. And Margarete is yours.
What is this?
- This is full of mistakes!
- Oh really?
"With this signature"...
With this, my personal signature...
"I bequeath"... There's something wrong here.
I. Heinrich Faust, bequeath...
"to the bearer of the letter"...
..."this letter...
..."my sol...
Soul is spelled with a "u"!
- With a "u"! How nice.
- ... "after its natural"...
... "separation from my body". Yes.
Now it's correct.
I've run out of ink!
What a shame!
Perhaps you could use blood?
You were prepared to write in blond.
Behave yourself!
You're a guest here!
Lousy dog!
What a hideous language, your German.
All the same.
- So what now?
- Now? You'll get your Margarete.
I'll see lo my side of the bargain.
I know where she is.
- Let's go then.
- So impatient!
Fulfil your obligation!
Thank you. Where are we going?
I'll take you to your dearest by the quickest way.
There is a secret path!
And where is it?
I'll show you.
There is no chimney on my lamp!
This path is underground!
Underground!
- Here it is! Which way?
- This way!
My secret tunnel!
I'll lead the way.
This is my way.
I've never shown it to anyone.
What a devilish tunnel!
But somehow it's easy to breathe here.
A deep well.
My storeroom for cowardly souls.
I'll lead the way. Le! Me through.
Do you still want to do it?
This is all sedimentary cover rock.
As far as I can tell.
You'd better think about good cover for yourself.
The little one will do you no harm.
But the old hag...
I know how to pacify her.
- Do you want to decapitate her?
- Dear Doctor!
- Rip out her tongue?
- A good herbal tea...
...and she'll fall asleep forever.
Fall asleep forever?
Yes, nice and quiet.
We'll leave them here.
For the way back.
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
The poor girl. The dear child.
There she is.
I just knew it.
This is where all young souls go when they're suffering.
Go!
Go!
You wanted to save her.
You can save her now.
My peace is gone, my hear! Is sore... is there anyone here?
How cold it is here.
Cold.
Why are all these things scattered here?
I don't understand.
Who did this?
This is his herbal tea.
It's your flask, Doctor.
I have to go.
I have to go.
Now you may enter. No pushing!
Behave in an orderly manner!
Come on.
I'll help you.
There's someone here.
The clock has stopped.
The hands have fallen down.
It's draughty in here.
You're cold.
I have to go.
Those cats again.
I hate cats.
I don't want to...
I don't want to...
Where are my things? What is this?
A straitjacket.
God help me... God save me
I don't want to...
- Well, finally!
I don't want to.
- What is this?
- Your armour.
What are you doing?!
- Where did you get such strength?
- I want to save you.
It's the best armour I have!
A good man needs good armour!
I'm not good! Don't touch me!
I cannot stand violence!
Come to me!
One step and then you're free.
- Where to?
Forward, march!
Your loitering draws Death closer!
Not every murderer is forgiven his guilt.
It has to be earned.
What sense is there in fleeing?
I must stay.
You must live.
We're people destined for great things.
I wish that I had never been born it would be best not to be born at all, my friend!
Much better than finally to die, fortunate as that might seem.
- What do you mean?
Finally you're awake!
Then go saddle up!
I'm a poor horseman.
But a good man.
Where are you going?
Where, where? There.
You'll like it there. I know it.
- I'm dizzy.
- It's ever the same...
...man wants to fly, yet he can't cope with dizziness.
You're a man. A soldier.
What? What am I?
In the end. You are what you are.
I don't recognise anything here.
The forester's house was here.
And over there, the mill.
The mill? It's gone.
What do you mean. Gone?
- Very simple.
But the mill can't just...
I don't understand.
Armour becomes you.
Very noble, powerful.
It befits your name: Heinrich.
Which means...
..."mighty wall.
Or just Heinrich the Mighty.
What about your name, Mauricius?
What does it mean?
- The dark one.
- It's a rare name.
Yes, It's a martyr's name.
And a publisher's.
Come! Send the horses home!
They'll find their way!
It is getting tight here!
Why do we have do go through there?
This is the stairway to heaven.
But it might lead us in an entirely different direction.
Why have you stopped?
What are you mourning?
I'll show you something better.
Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise.
So help me God!
Be careful with my beautiful armour!
Don't scratch It!
It's borrowed.
- From who?
How inquisitive you are!
Must be our theatre director.
And now I'm supposed to amuse the world like a fool?
You can amuse only me.
There is no one else here.
- Where are we?
Far away and high up!
Very, very high up!
It's so easy to breathe here!
I should think so.
- What is this here?
- Nothing.
- We're not alone here.
Who could be haunting this place?
Maybe the Greeks?
I have some here.
Move!
- I have to get through, too!
- Thank you! I can see...
...you're slowly recovering.
I've had enough of this masquerade.
It's a pity, but alright in for a penny. In for a pound.
- The greaves, please.
- I'm not your servant.
- Not a servant. Atypical human being!
- I'm going ahead.
- Where to?
- To the left.
Damned boots!
Tell me now, where are we?
I told you, far away and very high up.
- And what is this here?
- Nothing.
Go look for yourself.
I know...
...you hope to discover the all in my nothingness.
Let the living go on hoping.
We were forgotten here.
- We are forsaken.
- What are you doing here?
It's your old acquaintance!
- Thank you.
- Let me go!
What do you want from me?
Let go of my hand!
Help!
- Stay here with us.
- I want to leave!
It is freezing here.
Take charge of us.
- You're so warm.
- Lead us into battle.
The war is over.
I don't save you once again.
I don't understand what they see in you!
Without armour you're not a general!
- This way?
- Yes. This way.
Let me go first!
What did he thank me for?
Death, of course.
Because life was even harder for him than death.
I don't understand.
What's there to understand?
Eternal poverty.
Dependency on his mother.
And on his sister's whims.
He was a proud man...
...and all that wounded him.
What a pity...
...that you didn't kill him in battle.
That would have been nobler.
Never mind.
One must know how to laugh all such things.
What will become of the girl?
She might be imprisoned.
But are we going to save Margarete?
If the old hag wakes up, we won't have to save her.
- Are we going to save Margarete?
- Of course not.
In any case...
...we'd first have to ask her whether she wants to be saved by us.
It's different with you.
We are partners.
We have a contract.
So that's how it is.
Where is that smoke coming from?
Wait!
I did everything I promised to do.
- But you...
- It's not enough for me.
- I'm worth more.
- What else do you want?
Another sun? Another homunculus?
Two, perhaps?
It's not enough for me!
- What a spectacle!
- It's a fantasy.
No! You're lying!
This isn't a fantasy!
- How does it work?
- My fountain isn't so harmless.
It's hot!
- Are you happy now?
- How does it work?
I don't need to know.
The Lord God knows.
Come on now. It's dangerous here
God doesn't know.
But I do.
The heat rises upwards...
"...the cold sinks towards the interior"
...of the earth.
Yes, very interesting
I could recreate this in a snap.
Come on! We're leaving!
No! I'm staying!
He wants to recreate my fountain
You want to achieve glory?
The deed is everything. Not the glory.
Let me see your deed at last!
Friends don't treat each other this way I
- it really hurts!
- Crying is good for one.
Even someone like you must suffer at some point.
What do you know about suffering?
What can be so special about your suffering?
Soon you'll know for yourself.
Eternal solitude, and no hope of salvation.
Quiet! Enough!
I already know everything about you.
You're only disturbing me.
Quiet now!
Pointless hole!
I decide everything here!
It is not yours to decide anything here
Walt! Von can stay longer if you wish.
Even without a soul.
Leave me alone.
I don't need you anymore!
What is it you want?
Why did you show me those madmen...
...who even in the sleep of death cannot forget their war?
What have you given me?
Not even money for my ring!
Power, influence...
...one can only seize such goods oneself!
Nature and spirit...
...that is all one needs...
...to create here, on this free land, a free people.
But. Seriously now, I have a contract.
A contract?
You signed it!
I have to concentrate!
Leave me alone.
Wait! The soul! Your soul.
- I'm entitled to it.
- The soul?
You signed the contract with your blood!
Feel free to submit it on
Judgement Day.
No! What are you doing?
That's that then.
Is this for Margarete?
And that is for the mother?
Stay thee a while! This isn't pretty!
Again, again, again, again.
Bad shot!
Bad shot!
Who will feed you?
Who will guide you out of here?
Over now.
Over as if it never was.
Overs what a stupid word!
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Over there!
Farther and farther!
And do, you know, and wait it out like the rest of the world?
You know what I mean?
I mean, the streets look like any normal holiday.
People are pretty calm, at least for now.
Okay, so the green is the voltage.
Do back-l liked it the way it was a moment ago.
Yeah, I hope I'm not boring you, my dear friend.
- Cisco?
- Why even bother?
- What?
- Cisco!
No, I'm talking to Skye.
For you.
I do it for you.
I know you like it smooth.
Son of a bitch.
Is that a meter maid giving someone a ticket today?
Well, what do you expect?
It's Beverly Hills, right?
All I can say is, you better put that fine in an envelope lickety-split before the post office closes tonight.
You know what I'm saying?
We're now 14 hours and 44 minutes away from the end of the Earth.
Our live coverage continues with our crews in New York and our colleagues around the world.
As much as I would like to give you the news otherwise, there has been no information to suggest any reprieve in the rapid decline of the Earth's ozone layer.
The top scientists still predicting the lethal...
Will occur at 4:44 a.m. eastern time.
When that moment comes tomorrow morning, the end Will be sudden and global.
In Rome, the pope is at the Vatican preparing to deliver a final blessing to an estimated
3 million people who have converged on St. Peter's Square.
In the holy cities of Mecca and Jerusalem spontaneous pilgrimages are under way.
Millions are on the move there, hoping their religions...
Guess what, man.
I just caught the owner as he was leaving.
Said he couldn't let down his customers.
Oh, shit.
Wanted to say good-bye to the regulars.
Anyway, he's leaving the door open with a sign saying,
"Just take what you need.
Think of the others."
I love this guy.
He's a total mensch.
But then the pilot came on.
"So there's an emergency light on.
"We don't know if the landing gear went down.
"Then we're gonna buzz the control tower, and they're gonna try to see if our landing gear is down."
You think they're right?
Yes.
I know they're right.
I know they're right.
I know.
"Take your shoes off, because they might melt.
"All jewelry off, because it Will burn through your fingers."
And then someone started to cry.
And then someone got up from the other side and came over and hugged them, you know?
And then somebody else started to cry, and then somebody else got up and went over and hugged them.
And then everybody, it was, either you were breaking down or you were hugging.
And everybody on the plane was loving everybody else on the plane, unconditionally, you know?
"I could die in ten minutes with you.
And let's spend the last ten minutes, with a hug."
You know, and it was just... everybody just wanted to hug everybody.
It was really beautiful.
Oh, yes.
Oh.
What do you got?
Oh, yes.
Can you see the whole pen without looking at the bottom?
Well, this is the continuation of a process that actually began in '92 in Rio de Janeiro at the so-called Earth Summit.
The Kyoto Protocol was the first iteration of how to get those commitments into a binding form.
No, you have to look at the top.
And then you have look at the bottom, and then you say,
"There's a whole pen there," okay?
But by the time you get to the bottom, you don't know if there's still a top there.
But in your mind, you think there is.
You say,
"Geshla, it's a whole pen.
Geshla, it's a whole pen."
That's a proof.
That's a tiny little proof.
You ain't looking at a pen.
You're looking at a tiny image in your own mind, okay?
You are looking at a tiny image in your own mind.
Now, immediately, we have to call you back from the precipice.
Hey.
We have to pull you back from the edge of this thing.
You let me sleep.
Are you crazy?
Don't think you're living in your head.
Well, what time is it?
Okay, don't get confused.
How long have I been sleeping?
It hasn't been that long.
We really don't have too many years to begin reducing the global warming pollution that is driving the Earth's ecological system towards catastrophe.
Okay, stay with that.
They say ten years, don't you?
The window, they say, is ten years, essentially?
Yeah, and I actually said that three years ago, yeah.
And "catastrophe" means what?
There are certain elements in the Earth's ecological system that could be pushed beyond a kind of tipping point.
The phrase is controversial.
But if the Greenland ice pack, for example...
Turn it off already, Cisco.
I'm tired of hearing their bullshit.
And him, I'm sick of him.
How many times can you watch the same shit over and over again?
Just turn it off, please.
Would produce a six-to seven-meter increase.
The disappearance of the North Polar ice cap the size of the continental
United States:
It's been there for 3 million years, a key element in the Earth's ability to cool itself.
If it disappears, it would not come back on a timescale that would be comfortable...
- Yes!
- How you doing, man?
I don't see you.
Hey, I don't see you.
What's on-hey, there you go.
How you doing, man?
Yeah, we're celebrating, man.
You know, party.
What can I say?
What else can we do?
That's a strategy.
Yeah, well, I don't know about strategy.
I'm just letting my feelings go; that's all.
What's Skye up to?
She working?
She's working.
You know.
Yeah.
Well, man, I Wish you were here to party with us.
I wish I was with you too, but just keep doing what you're doing.
Hey.
Lola, girl.
Having a good day?
Getting your good-byes in?
"At 4:44 a.m. EST tomorrow morning,
"give or take a few seconds,
"the world Will come to an end.
"It Will be the result
"of the ever... weakening ozone layer
"that has now thinned and dissipated
"far more rapidly than even the worst doomsayer
"could have ever imagined.
"So the final explosion:
"meltdown Will come with fair warning
"but no possible means of escape.
There Will be no survivors."
"The world Will end."
A little, tiny clock is popping up in the back of your head.
Why?
'Cause you have a seed in your mind for that, right?
How did that seed get there?
Who put it there?
You did. How?
That's karma.
Okay? That's karma.
What does karma mean?
Karma means doing something, saying something, or thinking something which puts an image in your mind.
Something happens under the influence of kindness, under the influence of your teacher's blessing.
Why are we talking about pot?
Why are we talking about clock?
Why are we talking about pen?
Because the world is not coming from the outside.
The world is coming from the images you plant in your mind, and you can plant whatever world you want, you see?
You can plant whatever world you want.
You don't need a body to die in,
'cause it doesn't exist down here.
It's an image in your mind.
Plant a different image in your mind, and you stop death.
You see?
'Cause this pot's not a pot, and the pen's not a pen, and the clock's not a clock, and the arm is not an arm.
It's all the same, okay?
If it existed out there, if there was pots, and if there was clocks, and if there was pens, and if they were out there, then, then shoot yourself.
My brother killed himself.
He got it, and he shot himself, you know.
He said, "What's the use?"
Why should I waste my time?" you know?
Kill yourself.
There's no point.
You can't change anything.
If a pot is a pot and a pen is a pen, it... you can't change.
Give it up.
What, you're just gonna get older?
Oh!
We were talking a lot here in the newsroom about how to deal with these final minutes.
I've been in this chair bringing you the news literally thousands of times.
Honestly, I don't want to spend my final minute on Earth here.
We want the people who work here to be with their loved ones.
There was a spirit in New York after the September 11th terrorist attacks that was about caring and giving.
We have seen that again today under these unimaginably tragic circumstances.
Al Gore was right.
By the time we realized what we'd done, we had already ruined the planet.
And today it doesn't matter where you live or how much money you have.
We are all about to face the same fate at the same moment.
My family is waiting for me now.
There's nothing more for us to say here but to repeat what we have told you:
We don't have much time left.
You don't need me to sit here and tell you how tragic this is, so this is the end of our commentary.
We are going to fill the screen with live camera views from all over the city, and we Will leave those pictures up until the end.
How can you not think about the end?
How do you not plan for the future?
How do these guys not think about what the hell is gonna happen next?
You know, whether you're... whether you're cutting down a tree or building the Trade Towers or the atomic bomb-fuck that.
I'm sick of it.
Where are the experts?
Where are the fucking experts?
These guys, they're just talking, talking, don't even have the fucking slightest clue.
Never mind doubt.
I mean, we don't know what the fuck is going on.
We're all gonna die, guys!
We're already dead!
Damn.
He looked right at me.
He was thinking straight.
Why let someone dictate when you're gonna die?
Fucking motherfuckers.
Hey, don't put that coat on him!
Leave that man alone!
If you want to help him, light a candle.
No!
Is that my fuckin' landlord?
Hey! Hey, Wally!
How's that 2.5% a year feel now?
No, no, I'm not saying him.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
It's not his fault.
It's not anybody's fault.
We're all in the same boat.
We're all doomed.
I don't want to leave you.
These guys chopped down every fucking tree on the island to make a statue.
Fuck.
And they don't have anything to build a boat to get the fish.
At least they were doing... worshipping God-the fucking...
I shouldn't be saying that.
Fuck that book!
What is wrong with you people?
Leave that man alone!
What is wrong with you?
Baby.
Come on.
Come on.
What are we waiting for?
I'm waiting for you to come down.
Come on.
What are we waiting for?
- A couple hours' difference?
- Get down, Cisco.
Come on.
Get down.
Thump!
Stop it.
Stop!
Hey.
What?
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.
You're so sweet.
It's gonna be okay.
I don't know what to do.
Just be with me.
I know.
I am.
You want to fly?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes?
You'd like that?
Shoes off!
Now, that I can do.
Grab my wrists.
Must have been the gaff tape.
What happened to your legs?
- Okay.
- Spaghetti legs.
Okay.
Okay.
Fly on home, fly on home.
Where you goin', girl?
She be a pink butterfly.
Oh, yeah.
Where you goin', girl?
Where you goin'?
We're going together up.
Where are we going?
Isn't it beautiful up here?
Too beautiful.
I pissed my pants.
Your turn.
Who's that?
Yeah? Yeah?
Delivery.
Yeah, come on up.
Yeah, I was wrong.
You're kidding me.
No.
Come on.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Not again!
Hi. Come on in.
Thank you very much.
What's your name?
You've been here, like, a thousand times, but I don't even know your name.
Chung.
How are you doing?
You know what's going on, or don't you give a shit?
Hey, kid.
Hey, you want some food?
Oh, I doubt it?
You've probably had plenty of this stuff.
Oh.
Keep the change.
Take it.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Can I get you anything?
Skypey.
Skypey.
Oh, yeah, Skype.
Yeah, I can do that for you.
I just got to get my computer.
Okay.
Okay, you just go ahead.
It's just...
You know how to do it, right?
Just... yeah, there you go.
Skye.
Come and get it.
Is it ready?
Well, yeah.
That's Vietnam.
That's Vietnam he's calling.
Chung?
Thank you.
I'm so glad I've known you.
Chung.
Thank you.
We human beings are the... almost like a creator of the world or the controller of the world.
Through technology, through science, we can do anything, everything.
We do not run nature.
I think we human beings something above nature.
I think that's wrong.
After all, we are part of the nature.
So through that way, it become clear, you see, we have the responsibility to take care of the environment, of the nature, because ultimately, we are part of the nature.
So the nature balance dramatically change, we will suffer, the entire humanity.
Then, this will, what-what were instinct will disappear.
So that's either one, one force.
Then another, I think, I think, every human... requirement or meaningful life, we need to seek internal, sort of inner spiritual development.
Now, here, when I say it's a spiritual-spirituality, not necessarily religious faith.
But even without religious faith, still there are such... a sense of caring one another, sense of sharing one another.
There's a sense of community.
These are the basic human good qualities.
These are our fabled spirituality.
Without that, you can't be happy person.
One says that money is the source of all evil.
Is that true?
Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
Of course, if we just become slave to money...
Then all our energy or mind, this is... concentrate on money.
And then the greed, that kind of thing, extreme greed...
Then in order to get more money, then no hesitation to adopt various different method.
Scandals or corruptions or exploitation, forcing these things.
Then, of course, money, it then becomes evil.
But for sustain, for life, without money, you can't.
You're a medical man.
What do you think happens after bodily death?
After bodily death, then they all get wings, and they all start flying up toward heaven.
Yeah?
And do you think you'll be a good flyer?
I think I'll fly up there eventually.
Yeah?
And then once you gets there, what happens?
A big party?
Big party up there.
Oh, yeah.
And then you fly around some more?
Now that's the whole idea behind it.
It's a big party.
And you're getting with your old friends, and even, even those that aren't too friendly with you.
The people that are responsible for the end of the world:
How do you feel about them?
Well, the people that are responsible...
Hopefully it'll backtrack on them, and they'll get the same treatment that they gave to the ones that they subjected to that fate.
Hey.
Hi.
Hang on.
I just got to open this up.
There we go.
Oh, baby.
I'm not very technological.
There we go.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Yeah?
And your mother?
You know her.
She's acting like nothing's gonna happen tonight.
She's acting like everybody's stupid.
What's with her?
She thinks I'm stupid.
She's-she's in denial.
Well, listen.
She's your mother, so that's just the way it is, okay?
Okay.
How's Skye?
She's all right.
What are you gonna do tonight?
Oh, Lena's coming over to stay.
And her mom?
She can't stand her.
Besides, her boyfriend's over.
It'll be better for her over here.
I don't know.
We'll play some video games.
You say hi to her for me, okay?
I've always liked her.
She's doing all right?
She says she doesn't want to die a virgin.
Guess it's too late for that.
Dad, don't cry.
I'm sorry.
Because you're gonna make me cry, and I did my makeup perfect.
I'm sorry. I miss you.
I miss you too, Dad.
J.J.
J.J., you have to let your friend in downstairs.
Here comes Morticia Addams.
Yeah.
Hurry up, J.J.
Hi.
She's locked out downstairs, honey.
The doorman's not there.
You're gonna have to hurry up before something happens to her.
Go on.
She's downstairs.
See ya, hon.
Hon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look, you should not be upsetting her like that.
How can you be so selfish?
Seriously.
You gonna be angry still?
Now?
I didn't leave.
It was you that didn't stay.
II didn't stay?
Who ran off with the teenager?
I didn't run off.
It was you.
It was your pride.
If you would've just hung in there, everything would have been different.
Yeah, different.
I'll tell you different.
Yeah, tell me.
Your daughter would have had a father instead of some guy who didn't even really care about her.
I cared!
Never.
- I-
- When?
I cared.
I didn't want to leave.
I'm a guy that sticks.
It was you that didn't want me.
I... I was...
I was so, so confused.
And you just had to be a little more patient with me, but you were too scared.
You were-you were too anxious.
Anxious?
What-what-you know what?
You need to just to grow the fuck up.
Grow up!
You think...
You think I love her more than I love you?
You think I love my family...
Calm down!
Calm the fuck down!
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay, stay, stay, stay.
No!
Don't go.
How could you?
How could you?
Skye.
I need to speak to my mother!
Okay, but you don't understand.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Hi, Mom.
What's the matter?
I'm so glad you called.
He's such a jerk.
He was just telling her that he loves her.
Doesn't he know how much it hurts me?
And that bitch, she was just looking at me.
She was just laughing at me.
Well, was she at your house?
No, it was on the phone.
It was on Skype.
She's so ugly.
How can he be with such a woman?
It's all right.
He's with you now.
That's what matters.
I can't take him sometimes, Mom.
I can't help it.
The whole system.
I don't believe in anything that's going on.
And honestly,
I just can't stand all this, and I don't want to believe all what's going on.
I'm still gonna be hanging on, you know, the fact that, that you know, I mean...
I know that the world, that the Chinese had an atomic explosion 5,000 years ago.
I know that the world will stay.
If we perish, okay, we perish.
But then we live on as well, so we live on.
But I'm just so angry at all of this, and I can just barely, barely talk about it.
I want to scream at those fuckers,
All those politicians and all those rules and the PC world.
And, you know, I mean, look at this smoking.
I can't even smoke any more.
What's the matter with me?
You know, you can't smoke.
You can't smoke in your own house.
You know, people denounce you.
If you throw a butt on the ground, you have to pay 50 quid.
It's outrageous.
I mean, what the fuck has the world come to, you know?
I'm just, you know,
I'm just so upset.
Don't get upset now, Mom.
Really, please.
Deep down, you're at peace in your heart.
I know, it's...
You've done the right things.
You've done your art.
You've done everything that you can possibly do to have... to have a faith in this world that they've destroyed.
And I'm proud of you.
And I don't want to see you sad.
I don't want to see you upset.
I don't want to see you... you know,
I want to remember you happy.
I want to remember you with a big smile on your face and your little green eyes and your little grin.
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you.
I love you so much, Mom.
Yes, I love you.
- Good-bye.
- I love you.
Thank you for being my mom.
Just transcend that.
Just go to another sphere.
Yeah.
And we'll be all right.
Yeah, a better sphere.
Thank you for being my mom.
I love you.
Hey, Javi.
Javi.
Yo, it's Cisco.
Oh, God.
Oh, right.
You scared me for a second.
Cisco!
What are you doing here?
Hey.
Hey, brother.
Good to see you.
Yeah, good to see you.
Come here.
Why didn't you use the front door?
You're gonna get yourself killed doing that.
Oh, shit.
I don't believe it.
No, I can't either, man.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Yeah, man. Get him a chair.
Here. Have a seat.
Thanks.
Tempting fate tonight.
What a surprise.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
You want something?
You want a-we've got brandy.
Some water.
Yeah, please.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Sticking with it?
Guess we're all here.
Want to look death in the eyes.
Looking good, buddy.
Good, good.
- Salud.
- Salud.
- To end times.
- To old friends.
How much time you got?
2 years, 22 days.
23 days.
Awesome.
That's awesome.
And you?
Well, if things weren't the way they are,
I'd have 20 years end of next month.
- 20 years.
- Yeah.
If things weren't the way they are.
Yeah, well, you know, if we ain't gonna get high now, we're never getting high.
Why not?
Why?
Have you got a good enough reason to get high?
Tell me.
I'll get high with you.
How about... how about, like, the ending of the world?
No.
Not good enough.
The world's been ending ever since it started, man.
You know, we've been ending ever since we were born.
Don't take that shit too seriously.
- I don't.
- Good.
I'm not sure I can take this rap right now, man.
What rap?
I don't know.
I just feel you winding up a little bit.
Who, me?
I'm not winding up.
I'm sitting here with a fucking choice, man.
You know, the choice is for me,
I mean, I don't care.
You can get high right there.
You know, I won't judge.
I don't give a shit, you know.
I would prefer you didn't, but, for me, I feel like,
I just feel like
I got a choice, you know?
I could shoot some dope, go out nodding, or go out eyes wide open.
You know, see the fucking light show.
I mean, what the fuck is that gonna look like, you know?
The end of the world, the end of the dream.
The end of-I want to see it.
I want to see it.
I want to fucking be wide awake.
So that's the choice.
Yeah, I'm not sure I want to.
What's going on changes everything.
It does, and it doesn't.
Tell me.
For me, I just think it changes a lot, but I got to stay true to... for me, I just feel like
I got to stay true to who I've been.
The good stuff.
Oh, shit, you guys are getting heavy.
I just want to get laid, you know?
You just want to get laid?
Yeah.
You just want to get laid?
Come here.
You're gonna get your wish.
Get it while you can, right?
Good to know what you want.
Got to get off some way tonight.
And may I... this is not a rap.
- It's a suggestion.
- Okay.
If I may humbly offer this suggestion to you, my junkie brother, right, who I've been through everything with?
Yes.
I'm listening.
Don't pick up a minute before the end of the world.
Seems like as good time as any...
That's the choice, though.
That's the-you know?
I know.
That's the choice.
Yeah, I know.
Let's watch the light show, man.
We were walking home from this meeting, and we walked by here, and I see the light on, right?
And I'm like, "I wonder if these guys are still here."
Haven't thought of them in fucking years, man.
This used to be my family.
This was like, you know, my brother, my sisters, like my family.
I saw the lights on.
So I ring the buzzer, and Javi answers the fucking door, and they're right in the chairs where I fucking left them, you know?
And so come to be of service over there, be of service here, whatever.
I don't know.
If some idiot comes in and needs another idiot,
I figured I'd be here.
And who walks in?
You're that idiot.
It's a miracle.
It's a fucking miracle.
It's not a miracle.
No, there's something going on.
Why are you here?
Why did you come through the fucking window?
Just, you know...
I haven't seen you in how long?
- A long time.
- Long time.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Long time.
You know,
I just think, you know... it's not...
I just been thinking about, you know, the past and friends, and I just felt the need to drop by?
And so I'm not, you know...
I don't know.
I got to go, though.
You got to?
Yeah, no, I can't, because Skye's... no, Skye's at home.
You know, she's by herself.
You gonna go right home, though?
Yeah, I got to go.
I mean, go right home.
Just... it's dangerous out there.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, it feels-
I don't know.
It's weird out there.
But no. I got to go, okay?
I'll walk you out.
Listen. I love you, buddy.
I love you too.
Use the front door like a normal person.
Glad we saw you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Yeah.
All right. Thanks, man.
Hey, Cisco.
Yeah?
What if they're wrong?
Think about it.
Okay, I'm thinking.
All right, buddy.
Love you.
Take care. Thanks.
Hey Javi?
Yeah?
He didn't...
No, no, no.
He didn't get nothing.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
He better not.
He's better just the way he is.
Right, right.
No, I'm sure. I'm honest.
You wouldn't lie, what... being a drug dealer and everything.
I would not.
- All right.
- He didn't.
What'd I say?
Go easy.

Cisco.
Where were you?
I just went out on the streets to see what was going on.
I forgot my keys.
I didn't mean what I said.
I was just trying to get her to understand.
She's a hard case.
You're not like her.
That's one of the reasons
I love you.
Forgive me.
Come inside me.
How could you?
Let me have it.
It's mine.
No.
Give it to me.
No!
I want it.
How could you?
Come on.
Give it to me.
All right.
Come on, we'll... we'll throw it out together.
You're hurting me!
This is fantastic.
Also the serpent... which represents the dynamic of life... the serpent can shed its skin to be born again, and so represents the power of life to throw off death and represents the bondage of life to time.
It's the dynamic of life and consciousness in the field of temporal pairs of opposites... birth, death and all that.
And life goes on through it.
It's been turned into the negative principle in our tradition, as though our tradition were against life.
And so, since... since our tradition is against life, well, the deity himself is against life.
And you have a deity who's talking about supernatural grace and virtue and all, but life is something to be, as it were, despised instead of celebrated and a body as something awful rather than awesome.
Cisco!
Cisco, come to me, please!
What's happening?
What's that?
I'm here.
Hold on to me.
Stay with me.
Stay with me!
I am.
Don't be scared.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
Who makes this whole tub run?
Ain't it us, guys?
Yeah!
Well, then, we belong, don't we?
We belong and they don't, that's all.
As far as this being hell, aw, nuts, you lost your nerve.
That's what.
This is a man's job, get me?
It belongs.
It runs this tub.
No stiffs need apply.
We aren't stiffs, see?
What comes down to a ultra feeling,
I mean, the ultra feeling that love, family is important.
Hey, have you ever heard of this?
What are we gonna do when it's 4:44?
But I can see that deep down you're at peace in your heart.
You've done the right things.
You've done your art.
You've done everything that you can possibly do to have a faith in this world that they've destroyed.
And this is very difficult to explain, okay?
In those few minutes, you see the face of every living creature in this world, okay?
In the minute.
At the same time, you see the whole face of billions of creatures.
And I'm not talking just people:
Animals, insects, birds, worms, snails, you know, all of them.
You can see.
We're together.
I'm-I'm here.
I'm here. Don't be afraid.
We're here together.
I'm gonna smoke my cigarette, and I'm gonna die.
There's gonna be a really big light, Cisco.
But don't be afraid of it.
I'm not afraid.
It's our love.
I'm not afraid.
It's our wisdom.
We're going together towards this big light.
We're going together towards the big light, Cisco.
My heart against your heart, and together, we're taking all beings with us.
And we're protecting them, and we're loving them, and we're taking them with us.
And we have each other.
And we surrender completely to God.
And you're protected.
And we're together, and we're going together.
And all we have is right now.
All we have is each other.
All we have is each other.
I love you.
And we're angels already.

So, where is this renowned father? will father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps he cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
Very quick.
Move.
Some other dog beat us to the treasure.
Hear that?
No, please.
Mercy.
I will serve you.
Abelar, does it still exist?
Abelar?
Ah, yes.
Ruled by a queen, Eldoria.
She has passed on.
Her eldest... eldest child Ma'at is queen now.
Really?
I won't harm the queen, but I will make you do with her seed.
Not that it matters now.
I... I was wondering...
- how... how your enemies...
- To dust.
That will sting.
And now?
And now, say, "I won't feel anything except a little sting."
Tanis.
Tanis.
Are you listening to me?
- Sister.
- It is upon us, your dream.
It's happening.
After all of these years, the Sorceress has somehow returned from the dead.
Levana.
Please don't go.
Go, Lenor.
Please, find safety.
All of you leave at once.
I will alert the General,
Your Highness.
And we must find he who saved us before.
The Mercenary?
Your father.
But, our father is dead.
He died saving Abelar from the Sorceress.
Your father is not mine.
I was sired by the king but... you...
...you were by this mercenary.
Mother said you were the king's child to protect you.
You must leave the past behind.
Our kingdom needs us now.
Kingdom Bush is not my father?
No, but he who is lives.
If we so be separated mother said this will lead you to him. with this token, he will know you and you shall know him.
And this will help you to understand the sorcery.
My Queen.
They are within the palace,
Your Majesty.
You must come now.
You have to go.
No, come with us.
My Queen, you both have a long time to struggle.
I've trained you well,
Your Highness.
You are ready for what comes.
Stand. we can make sure of your safety if you follow this hall.
It will lead you out of the palace.
But what about you?
My duty is to remain here, Kara.
No.
If you stay, then so will I.
You can do nothing more here,
Dernier.
The Royals will scheme to save their skins. we will be left to fend for ourselves and not always with the truth.
They have no regard for us.
But I am sworn to...
You have sworn to love me, Dernier or was that just to weaken my will.
I love you.
Then save us my love.
- I must kill the infected.
- Leave her. She's a friend.
It's your wish.
There, it leads to a quay where our boat waits.
- It will take you to Durris.
- Durris?
An outlaw city?
If he still lives the people there will know his whereabouts.
Tanis,
I'm find remember what I said.
If we so be separated, you must find him. we've run out of time.
Run, Tanis.
- But sister.
- Hush.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
They count on us, Tanis.
- I can't do this alone.
- You must.
Go. Now.
I command you.
Do not look back...
...or rest.
It's been what, 20 years? where's your mother's lover? what was his name again?
It seems to have slipped my mind.
He has not slipped mine. why, of course.
He sent your father to the Abyss.
I must have thought of a million different ways to make you and your mother suffer, but nothing was ever terrible enough.
I mean, how do you repay someone who buried you alive for 20 years?
Nothing smelled like life,
Your Highness.
You must be wondering how is it she is back looking so wonderfully restored.
Clearly, we watched your destruction.
Clearly, you shouldn't have given the final rights to a high priest with designs on your throat.
A pity he perished with some mysterious plague upon his return. who knows what lives in dust?
And who are you?
Go, go.
- where is my seat, Your Highness?
- I'm not sure.
Kill her.
Get the girl.
The palace is lost.
- The Queen is dead?
- Or worse. what are they?
Vampires.
But we will not die tonight.
I could fight harder.
You leave the killing to me. what is to become of us now or the kingdom?
My master is the son of a priest.
But, there is always a need for a pretty servant, and there is one against me as well.
- what is it?
- Hush, hush. why the guards they are so daunting?
They're trying to kill us. what?
Your blood.
It is read.
- It's my fault.
- No.
On your life run.
I have always loved you.
And who dies first.
I will.
And now, a ladder across the Abyss that I might free my father.
In my stead, you will awaken my seed.
She is the true daughter of my race, and though half human, she will be human no more.
Ah, Denier.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You used me. what?
No, I loved you.
Really?
Yes, right,
I was using you, Dernier.
You are evil.
Becoming a vampire isn't even the worst of me.
That and more.
Are you going to kill me now?
Bite my throat, drain me of my blood?
I want you.
I could soothe you, Dernier.
You could use someone like me for a slave.
I have too much over the past.
I will bring victims to you to fulfill whatever dark fantasies you have.
I will do whatever
I have to do for you?
You are a monster.
I will bow to you, Kara.
Kara, bow to her.
Life takes many forms in many worlds and she's in her final metamorphosis, her chrysalis. why me?
You are special.
But you've always known that.
Special in a way that no one else could see until it was too late.
And even as a child, you have always been cunning, intelligent, depraved.
You have tried to blend in or be a human, safe, but even as a child you knew you were different, filled with dark corruptness.
Are you ready to be free?
You're free now but not yet fully transformed.
I have pity for those who can walk in the curse of light and among these creatures. we have much more work to do before we can be safe.
I sent the princess to the reefs.
If she's dust, find her.
Know what she's plotting, and most importantly with whom. why me?
Because she will know and trust you when she's most vulnerable.
And if I refuse?
You've hungered for this day when you could be who you are and what you are to let those dark urges free.
Mother said this will lead you to him. with this token he will know you and you shall know him, and this will help you to understand the sorcery.
You're not a child but a Princess of Abelar, a leader with responsibilities.
Act it.
Find your father.
Save our people.
My princess.
You shouldn't have been wearing this?
Please.
- You cheated Dog.
- what?
Go weep to the gods.
You will die.
I shall cleave your thick ugly faces.
No dog cheats me and lives.
Thankfully, I'm not a dog but I do like to cheat.
Now, I'm gonna have to kill you like a bitch pup.
Holy shit.
I want this man.
She wants me.
I'll tell you what, wench, let me kill this dog and then I will bed you so hard...
Somebody you want me. wench, you've diminished my reputation.
It could be diminished, sir? why bog me, did I do your mother, huh, or, uh, sister perhaps?
The last of it, the late great Abelar and how it came to be overcome.
- Sir.
- I mean no disrespect, lady.
I noticed your cloak.
It came from the palace guard.
So, it is.
Like yourself, I barely escaped these foul creatures.
I'm here to spread the word of what these eyes have seen.
- You've seen much.
- Aye.
In this one world.
That's why you're here.
You've seen far too much sir.
Brother and sister?
Different mothers but a common father.
And you say we were meant to find our father?
Exactly. And together we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia and return Abelar to the people.
Uh-huh.
So, Princess, you speak for the Royal House?
That is correct.
How much am I to be paid to save your precious Abelar?
Paid?
I didn't mention anything about a bounty. we do this because it's right
- and just and it's what we should...
- This sword will not be drawn until it received proper compensation.
You disappoint again.
Oh, my lady, one night in bed with me and...
I'm your sister.
Half.
How could I expect any nobility from a pig like you. wait.
Look, your tail holds a certain fancy, but I am in need of coin and I'm willing to take your word that there will be a bounty. what do you know about him? well, not much.
Nothing at all.
Nor a trickster?
Aye, but this trickster knows where our sister may be, and to her our dear father.
A sister? where?
About that bounty?
If your word proves true, then you shall have it.
I gave you my word.
That should be sufficient.
I am called Aedan.
And what are you doing here? what?
Can't a brother help his sister?
After five years?
No.
This comes with some terrible price.
You're not a woman with many an option.
There's a foul tempered undertaker and eventual traitor wanting to see you skinned at dawn.
And what is this act of brotherly love going to cost me?
It's more privilege than the price. we get to save Abelar.
I don't think I'm dressed appropriately.
Plus, of course, there is a bounty.
And where would you get real bounty?
From Abelar.
She's your sister.
But maybe a...
...little more. well, what is your name.
You would like to sit down and have a drink with me, huh?
Tell us the tale, sister.
A fortnight ago the Sorceress Xia captured Abelar.
My sister, the Queen, was murdered.
Xia?
Didn't father put that Devil wench down or is that another tall tale? well, clearly he didn't put her permanently down, thus creating an opportunity.
She's back and she's taking Abelar with sorcery. which is to say she's infested Abelar.
Don't you have any conversation for me?
You are so beautiful.
It's all Greek to me.
She will continue to feed, to spread her darkness until the next full moon rises.
- And then?
- Oh, this part is good.
Xia will open the doorway to the Nether worlds.
You were saying?
Thus ending our very existence.
It's all so dire.
You see, sister, there's no bounty too great for saving this world.
Say we fancy the idea for a moment.
And that there is this massive bounty in gold, of course.
Aye, what makes you think us three here can stop this Vampire Queen?
I told her we're lovers not fighters. when need to have a plan, something less daunting, more rewarding.
- I am at a loss.
- we should take the traditional action, and hire mercenaries, like our dear father.
Yes, yes, but we're under time constraints.
In only a fortnight the moon will be full.
- I have a thought.
- It was only a matter of time.
Malia, you will find father and see if he has any ideas on the matter, and I with what funds to princess has on her presently will arrange for a dozen armed men.
Not just any men, no, no, no, but the type with honor and courage enough to win back Abelar.
By the gods I've heard that there are experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria, precisely the type of warriors that we needs. So, the Princess... she can wait here at Durris for our return, you know, holding down the fortress
- sort of thing.
- Or let us split the funds you possess, give us both a chance to hire the best warriors we can find on our way.
Aye, that could work as well. well, sister?
You take me as a fool at your own peril.
You are both much less than I'd hoped.
At the prison I spoke to the magistrate and he gave me your recent histories,
- theft, assault, cheating, embezzling...
- Right.
- Pick pocket and street whore?
- I have never picked a pocket.
You're both are the lowest of character, but my sister was firm and we must find our father and you are my only hope. we'll need horses.
I can acquire them.
- Are there other brothers and sisters?
- Ah, yeah, yeah, she's a day's ride away in a village called Chiba
Agreed then to Chiba Village.
Our father still lives?
I suppose. Last summer he was carousing in the secret of Nobu.
That was years ago.
The dog is likely dead as a cock, though, rotting in some dungeon.
50,000 gold pieces.
50 and that's my final word.
And I suggest we seal this fast. what's going on, sir?
Having an adventure, sister?
- A bitch dog.
- Come to lose again?
It isn't long now.
An entire new world.
I use Xia's body as a conduct.
It's a doorway. what have you learned?
The princess seeks one like her father.
The warrior who helped with Mitadonia.
He can see us fall into the Abyss.
Reduce her to dust.
Should I kill them now, the Princess and these two fools?
Learn the whereabouts of this father.
As you wish.
I tried to find father once right here.
- what was it like?
- Ah, it was like this... except for people trying to kill me.
- It's early yet.
- Maybe they'll remember you.
Oh, Malia, they would if they were still alive.
I meant what was it like to see him?
I didn't see father.
I found Rajan, our half sister.
Stay put. what does Rajan do here as a trade?
You mean when she's not drunk or passed out?
Hello sister.
I have a wonderful opportunity for you.
No thank you.
It did not work out last time.
It's only because you lack a sense of humor. what do you think they seek?
This drink.
Sister told me great stories about father... although I thought she spoke of a hired mercenary sent to save Abelar.
That was before I knew he was my father.
The man who I thought was my father, the King, well he was killed by Xia.
You really want to know who father is, God's truth?
Yes.
Our father is the lowest form of cowardly dog, a man who takes advantage of wives or widows, sells out his cohorts for coin and runs from a real fight.
That's who father is. what's the matter?
You don't like the truth?
You married, have sons?
Luckily no.
They're not so bad to look at.
Your whores?
Rajan, say hello to your sisters.
- More family?
- And with your help, we four... will save Abelar before the full moon.
The full moon is six nights away.
Time is short.
Ho, an adventure.
Alana.
Alana?
I'd forgotten her.
She's all grown and ready to leave this stink hole.
Alana, your favorite uncle has returned.
Don't you remember me?
I remember.
As formidable as she is, the girl is but a girl.
I meant no offense, niece.
I taught her a few things in my days as emperor's assassin.
Yes, I can see.
Sir, this is the most serious and most dangerous mission.
It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy.
The Vampire Queen.
- Yes, and it is not suitable for a child.
- You think I'd be afraid.
Look, it's time my Alana saw the world, had a few wild, bloody adventures.
And vampires and sorcery are all a part of that.
The truth is, she will love many and leave many more choking on their entrails.
A sister, heh?
And a princess no less.
Do you plan to rob her?
Give me a little credit.
This comes at a good time.
I was worried.
How so? with my adventuring and killing days were behind,
I wouldn't be able to give her proper parenting.
Oh, betting brutes, horrible wars, ghastly death, and it's all still ahead of you.
I am sure it's all with my daughter.
The gods must choose to smile upon me.
You would really cut my throat back there?
Of course, uncle.
Yours particularly.
Sweet girl. what of grandfather?
Might he want to go as well?
Grandfather?
Our father?
Aye. He might crave one last good battle before setting down the sword?
- He's still killing?
- Oh, that rascal, his sword is always poised. want to meet the old dog?
Oh, let's be off.
There are kingdoms to save and men to bed.
I prefer wenches.
Then he lives? why not use your sorcery to destroy them all?
Sorcery hasn't been needed until the full moon, but it's now needed instead of your cold steel, Kara.
Her father was a great sorcerer callously taken by gods let alone by human yet this one day.
But how is that possible against their power?
Because there exists a breed of creatures who fears nothing.
So they can accomplish anything.
You describe a distinct human trait. we cannot chance these five meeting up with one called father.
They would alert him.
Aye.
So what do you suggest?
I think an early strike as they arrive in Nobu Village should do it.
I would need two of those like myself, day walkers.
And the father should be found.
See who wants their blood.
After I manage this task. what do you wish, to be made queen?
No,
I want my soul back.
After all the power you have felt in your veins?
I want to be who I am, what I am, not one of you.
Should I fear you, Kara?
You know what lies within me and I am what you need me to be.
Should I fear you?
You already do. we will wait 'till there is some separation.
Then take them one by one.
I don't expect much resistance except by the princess.
All in all, they are a pathetic group.
He comes here every evening to sell his catch.
Catch?
He's a fisherman now.
Now, now, ladies, you'll have to accept my apology.
I must leave.
There's an adventure in the offing.
Now, mark my words, if I didn't have to go off and save Emperor Micah's kingdom,
I would surely have you all to bed... again.
Can I see that spear right there, please?
Never mind.
There, why the long face, huh?
It is for the grand adventure that we live.
And it's not just the adventure itself.
It's the willingness to risk everything for it.
Something chased you off the street. what is your trouble, girl?
Something very terrible.
And what was that?
A vampire.
I know it's dead, but still I saw the things.
You see, I beleve you, girl.
This day there are vampires in Nobu.
So, I'm off. my, could you send an old rogue off with a proper farew
I believe we have an adventurer here.
I can taste it.
May the gods smile on your adventure, child.
The next time a warning would be nice. where can I find her?
Come now.
Levana,
- Kara?
- Your Highness.
You know what do with them.
This is your life now?
I have no life just the sins.
Bleak and bleaker.
That princess and they that hold it are under the sword.
Mind your own business, sir.
Nobu has always been a refuge where marriages are by and large human.
Now changes come to Nobu.
The world evolves.
Aye, mostly for the bad.
Do we have a quarrel, sir?
Have we met?
In the days before
I sought the peace of the sea,
I knew your kind. well, maybe I am sick but I was pleasured by the killing.
They deserved to die.
I loved hearing their suffering, seeing their terror, and the begging and screaming.
There was real pleasure in that.
Sometimes life does not unfold as it should, and I do not have to explain myself to you.
I ask again, do we have a quarrel, sir?
I am presently engaged.
Did I do your mother, huh?
So, where is this renowned father? will our father show his face to you, sir?
A shallow womanizer who fashions himself a dashing wit.
Perhaps we cannot hear your whimpering, sir.
Pathetic palter.
I know you'll have my head for that, but not if I have yours first. what is this?
I would appreciate that back.
Come and take it.
I ask you once if we had a quarrel.
I knew the princess.
Now we have a quarrel.
Joy that's not marred by love. we have much to celebrate now that the full moon is seen.
You, me, the great love affair we shared.
The love by which you destroyed my father, and had me with your stick to dust.
But I harbor no grudge. well, perhaps just a bit of heartbreak and spite.
And bring that ridiculous rebate of a weapon of yours. what does that make him?
Is he an active vampire or is he a quarter vampire? I mean, what... what is it?
Do you kill everyone you see?
You know, next time a warning would be nice.
The war between sorcerers was fought in the shadows of history and the fate of mankind rested with the just and powerful Merlin.
He taught his secrets to three trusted apprentices,
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.
He should have trusted only two.
Veronica and Balthazar witnessed the savagery of a sorcerer beyond evil,
Morgana Le Fay,
Merlin's most deadly enemy.
We are but servants.
- Merlin.
- Horvath!
You betray me?
I am no one's servant.
Well done. Now get the spell.
And so it was. Morgana gained sorcery's most dangerous spell known as "The Rising," giving Morgana the power to raise an army of the dead and enslave mankind.
Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar by drawing Morgana 's soul into her own body.
But Morgana began to kill her from the inside.
To save Veronica 's life and to capture Morgana,
Balthazar trapped them both in the Grimhold, an inescapable prison.
Over time,
Balthazar fought many sorcerers who tried to free Morgana, trapping them in layer upon layer of the doll.
Eventually, he captured
Horvath as well.
As Merlin lay dying, he gave Balthazar his dragon ring, saying it would guide him to the child who would one day grow to be Merlin's successor, the Prime Merlinean.
The Prime Merlinean is the only one who can kill Morgana.
Balthazar would search for centuries.
And never, it is said, will Balthazar waver from his quest, for mankind will never be safe until Morgana is destroyed by the Prime Merlinean.
Hey, Tank.
How did you even get up here?
David? Field trip today.
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.
She means me, not you.
You're not supposed to be doing that, Dave.
Now!
David.
That's cool.
...which means that before Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty were built...
Pass it to Becky.
- Pass it on.
- Pass it on.
- Pass it to Becky.
- Here.
Let's go.
Get on the ferry. Get your bags.
Stay close. Here we go.
Hey, stop!
Excuse me, excuse me.
No!
No, lady, don't!
No way.
The second emperor of the Han dynasty locked his least-favorite wife in this urn for 10 years to the day.
They say you open it up, the same thing will happen to you.
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.
Have you seen it?
It kind of just blew into your store.
A note?
It blew into your store.
It was just a...
Coincidence.
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.
I have something
I'd like to show you, Dave.
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- 'Cause I can read minds!
It's on your backpack.
Come over here.
This is very special and if it likes you, you can keep it.
I better not. My teacher said
I couldn't be gone for long.
She knows I'm here.
You're a bad liar, Dave.
That's good.
Oh, boy.
No way.
I have been searching a very long time.
Magically, here you are.
That ring on your finger means something, Dave.
It means you're going to be a very important sorcerer one day.
And your first lesson begins right now with your very own Encantus.
Do not move, do not touch anything.
No way.
When am I?
New York City.
Not where. The year.
You are wasting my time.
What happened to "don't touch anything"?
That's not very sporting of you,
Balthazar.
Be quiet.
It's not you. He's been like this for 1,000 years. I'll explain later.
I need the Grimhold. Where's that doll?
I'll have that doll.
I want that doll.
Leave, Dave! Leave now!
David Stutler! Don't ever leave your...
There's these crazy wizard guys in there!
They're made of roaches!
No! Don't go in there!
The store's on fire! Don't go in!
Those guys are crazy.
You really shouldn't tell stories. Let's go.
Ew! He peed his pants!
A jar broke. It's just water!
There was a fire!
Yeah, Stutler had a leak.
He's such a geek.
Good morning. What is that? Oh, right.
Good morning, beautiful.
Hey, heads up.
Oh.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, Bennet.
You're up early.
Professor Heiderman wants me to give a presentation to his Physics 101 class.
What? Teaching long division to English majors?
I know. It's like the Peace Corps, but it's Heiderman's class.
Hey, Bio nerds are getting drunk tonight.
And we invited cheerleaders from Princeton.
Oh. So there's smart cheerleaders.
So, seriously, you're saying you don't want to go out on your birthday?
I got to finish my Tesla coil project if I want to graduate.
Dave, are you familiar with the gray wolf?
Oh, no, please, Bennet. Not this again with the gray wolf. I can't...
The gray wolf is a pack animal.
He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.
He must participate.
You're going to get booted out of the pack!
Alone. Eaten by a hungry bear.
That's a real pick-me-up pep talk, and I'm ready to go get the day.
No, no.
Oh, man.
Everything okay down there?
I should just leave, right?
Right.
Wait. I'm sorry. Becky?
Becky Barnes.
Dave!
We were in fourth grade together.
I do know you. Dave Stutler.
- Right?
- That's me.
Yeah. You're that kid.
What was that place called?
- Arcana...
- Arcana Cabana?
Yeah.
- So, did you transfer?
- Yeah, I did.
And got some help. Treatment.
Yes, that was weird.
You know what? It turns out it's just a glucose imbalance.
Hallucinations?
- Not uncommon in young subjects.
- Ah...
Right.
It's a great anecdote.
Hey, Becky.
Becky? Hey, Becky?
So how are you enjoying Physics 101?
My brain just does not think physics.
So, what does it think, then?
Music, mostly.
So, this is me.
You work at the radio station?
Yeah, I do an afternoon show.
Are you kidding me? That's so cool!
It's just college radio.
Like, seven people listen to it.
I'll be listening. That's one more.
You can round it up to eight.
I think that's our antenna!
- What's going on?
- Hey, gorgeous.
The whole mixer is toast, and Freddy called in sick.
Sorry to bother you.
Where does your engineer keep his equipment?
Who's this guy?
So, the good news is you're still transmitting.
The bad news is your return loss, way too high.
All right, if I know what I'm doing, we should be good!
Yes!
- Thank you.
- No, please, it was my pleasure.
I could tell this is all pretty important for you.
My show is the one thing that...
Well, you know.
Mmm-hmm.
Physics. That's my thing.
I'll see you around.
You didn't ask her out!
You just fixed her antenna and you left.
That's not the point.
She will remember me.
"She will remember me"?
Who are you? Braveheart?
Bennet, I blew my shot at getting this girl 10 years ago.
I can't do it again.
Now get out of here before you get electrocuted.
...and it's a miracle we made it on the air tonight.
This show may not matter, but the music does.
This is Becky Barnes, WNYU Radio, hoping there's music all around you.
I don't understand. Why did you have to buy this piece of junk?
Junk? It's an antique!
Antique? It's a piece of junk from a flea market!
Am I the first one out?
That's a yes.
Our 10 years are up, Balthazar.
When I get the Grimhold from young David,
I'll tell him you said hello.
Cheerio, Balthazar!
I thought B- was generous.
I've recently been released from a 1 0-year sentence, during which the only reading material available to me was your so-called report on Napoleon Bonaparte from your school bag.
Your analysis was obvious, your prose was weak.
- I was nine.
- Irrelevant.
Where's the Grimhold?
That doll you took from the shop.
The doll held something very powerful.
Something very important to me.
You had it last.
I want it back.
Listen, I'm...
- I threw it in the street.
- Where's the Grimhold?
It's been a long time.
I don't actually know where it is.
I'll cut the truth out of you.
Sweet.
Get him.
Wolves? No, no, no, no.
Oh!
Thank you.
Wolves.
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
No, no, no.
Oh, no!
Kill him.
No!
Puppies?
Oh, my.
No way.
Where's the doll, Dave?
Him, him.
All right, get up here.
Now! Now! Hurry!
Oh, no!
This is not happening.
This is not happening.
I taste sour in my mouth.
Take it easy, Dave. Deep breaths.
What?
Now that is not happening!
What's wrong?
What is it?
No, no, no, no!
You are not doing this to me again!
Do you have any idea what my life has been like for the last 10 years?
I've been stuck in an urn for the last 10 years.
So have I! A figurative urn of ridicule.
Do you know that in certain parts of the tri-state area, they still refer to having a nervous breakdown as "pulling a David Stutler"?
Did you know that?
Try to be a good listener, Dave.
That doll is called the Grimhold.
It is a prison for the most dangerous
Morganians in history, each one locked up in a layer of the doll.
Horvath wants to free his fellow
Morganians and destroy the world.
This must not happen.
Yeah. For sure.
The truth is, you have a very special gift.
You need to see that.
I just want to be normal.
Normal life. I want to forget about that day at Arcana Cabana.
I want to forget about magic.
I want to forget everything.
- You should duck.
- What?
You want to forget magic?
Then why did you keep the ring?
I was going to sell that on eBay.
You're still a bad liar, Dave.
I like that about you. It's a good sign.
You have the gift.
No, I have a life.
You're the last person Horvath saw with the Grimhold.
That puts you on his list.
So unless you want him to turn you into a pig who just loves physics, then you better help me find that doll before he does.
This is crazy.
You see how crazy this is, right?
All right. All right.
You help me get it back, you're done.
- Really?
- You can walk away.
Can you please put my dresser back?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you... Oh, no.
Please don't do that.
What are you doing?
What?
- Whoa. What is that?
- It's my Grimhold tracking device.
Biometric pressure spell displaces the atmosphere above the doll.
Looks like downtown.
If we can track the Grimhold, so can Horvath.
- So why don't we just take the eagle?
- Too high-profile for a trip downtown.
- I'll have to call you a tow.
- Won't be necessary.
Yeah, but this car's been impounded for 10 years.
This is low-profile.
She missed me.
I'm going to give you the basics.
Strictly Sorcery 101. Put on the ring.
Nothing's going to happen.
Yeah?
Kidding. You've heard how people use only 10% of their brains?
Sorcerers can manipulate matter because they're born with the capability to use the entire power of their brains.
Which also explains why molecular physics comes so easily to you.
So, wait. Is sorcery science or magic?
Yes and yes.
For now, all you need is a basic combat spell.
Making fire.
What causes molecules to heat up?
They vibrate.
Everything we see is in a constant state of vibration, thus the illusion of solidity.
But how do we take that which appears solid and have it burst into flames?
We will the vibrations to go faster.
Step one, clear your mind.
Step two, see the molecules.
Step three, make them shake.
- Got it?
- No! I definitely don't "got it."
Trust the ring, Dave.
And keep it subtle.
Civilians mustn't know magic exists.
That would be complicated.
Says the guy in the 350-year-old rawhide trench coat.
I threw it in the street.
It's been a long time.
I don't actually know where it is.
I threw it in the street.
Don't go in there!
Ew! He peed his pants!
The store's on fire! Don't go in!
Those guys are...
It's just water! There was a fire!
I threw it in the street.
But where?
Get out of the way, freak!
I need to pull in there!
Are you addressing me?
Hey, don't mess with me.
Where was I?
Chinatown.
This is it. I'll get the Grimhold.
Keep an eye out for Horvath.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I'm looking for a...
Well, it's rather strange.
It's a nesting doll. It's about this big.
Angry-looking Chinese gentleman on the front.
- Nesting doll?
- Yes.
It's possible. I collect so many objects.
Ah!
You speak Mandarin.
Ah.
That was Cantonese, Horvath.
The Grimhold. Where is it?
An old associate of mine speaks impeccable Cantonese.
He lived about 200 years ago.
Know him? Sun Lok.
Of course you do.
You locked him inside the Grimhold.
Whoops.
Opened it.
Whoa!
Are you all right?
Looks like...
What the...
Yay!
I'm like one of them.
Dave?
You should run.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
Be still.
Balthazar!
Oh, God. Come on.
You skipped the first step!
- Clear your mind!
- Skipped the first step.
Clear my mind? Are you insane?
Little bit.
Oh, man.
This is it.
Clear your mind. Believe.
Yeah!
Go Team Magical Stuff!
Did you see that?
Did you see what I just did?
I did it.
It can't be.
Unbelievable.
Hey, what do you got?
Did you see what happened here?
You know what? Bottle rocket meets paper dragon in this Asian festival.
Lit it up like a birthday cake.
We got swamped with calls saying there was a real dragon.
Between you and me, Cap,
I think some of these folks were hitting the sake pretty hard.
Sake's Japanese, actually.
Carry on.
- "Sake's Japanese"?
- Well, it is.
- I was in character.
- Oh, right.
You may now return the ring to me.
I'm a man of my word.
You helped me, we're done.
Right. Right.
I'd like to learn some more.
We'll need a place to work.
Somewhere under Horvath's radar.
I think I can help with that.
This was originally a subway turnaround.
They let me work down here because some of my experiments skew a bit dangerous.
Oh, my professor has a hookup, so nobody knows we're down here.
Oh.
I didn't have a chance to give you this before.
Your Encantus.
I remember it being bigger.
Pocket edition.
The Encantus is our textbook.
The art and science and history of sorcery.
Including our recent history as well.
Come on.
See? There you are.
Oh.
Before we can put Horvath back inside the Grimhold, we must first turn you into a sorcerer, which begins now.
Step back.
- I really was doing stuff.
- Eyes open.
Mouth closed.
This is the Merlin Circle.
It focuses your energy.
Helps you master new spells.
It is where you will learn the Art.
Step inside, you leave everything else behind.
Once you enter, there is no going back.
So, I should probably pee first?
Better safe than...
I can hold it.
I am Balthazar Blake, sorcerer of the 777th degree, and you are my apprentice.
Sweet.
Your ring is not a piece of jewelry.
It projects the electrical energy of your nervous system into the physical world.
Without his ring, a sorcerer is powerless.
The only other thing a sorcerer needs is a nice pair of pointy shoes.
Your rubber soles block the current.
Plus it helps to look classy.
These are old man shoes.
Excuse me?
I love them.
A lot.
I haven't seen that cane since I saw a picture of it when I was a boy.
You've been locked up a long time.
And now I'm out.
And I need soldiers.
I got one kid.
He ain't old school.
One will do.
Your ingenuity and your heart will give you an advantage over Morganians.
They rely only on the power of their magic.
But if you're up against the wall, there's only one weapon of choice, the plasma bolt.
Nothing. There's nothing.
I got it! I got one! I got one!
That's underwhelming.
God.
Again.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
...and invite my soul...
And again.
See? That's what padding is for. Oh!
So, out of a bath full of jewels,
I'm going to emerge, right?
And everyone's going to think I'm me.
I reach into the big top hat and I pull myself out, but I'm a woman.
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.
If I could get, like, a tiger jumping out of a leopard.
But not out of its mouth, that's been done, I'm sure, somewhere.
Gorgeous. Just perfect, darling.
Yeah. Yeah, now, keep it straight up sinister.
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.
Sorry, are you lost?
So, you're what passes for a Morganian these days.
Maxim Horvath!
You are one smoking man of...
Will you excuse us, ladies?
Yes, excuse us, ladies.
Bob.
Bob.
Sorry.
So, they tell me you're some kind of entertainer.
Five sold-out shows at the Garden, plus back end on the pay-per-view.
Did you ever see Morgana pull a rabbit out of a hat?
Look, my master disappeared when I was 15, vanished!
Left me with nothing but an Encantus and some prescription-grade abandonment issues.
So I improvised.
Well, the time for improvisation is over.
Balthazar Blake may have found the Prime Merlinean.
He wears the ring?
Mmm.
The best way to defend against fire, vacuum sphere.
Your turn.
I did it! I did it!
Excellent. Excellent.
- Excellent.
- I just did that.
What's wrong with your Tesla coil?
It seems to be firing on its own.
Really, really funny.
This will be hilarious, then.
Oh, my God!
Dude!
Beg your pardon.
I haven't eaten in 10 years.
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.
You mind if I ask what's so special about this bench?
- No, no, no.
- What?
There's no time for that, and too much at stake.
That girl, she's the one, man.
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.
Aren't you supposed to help me to achieve my personal goals?
Yes! Yes! Except I'm not your mentor.
I'm your master.
And your master says if Horvath catches you out on the street, you'll die.
Is she worth that?
Think about it, Dave.
And don't eat my sandwich.
Becky! What a coincidence.
Oh, hey, Dave.
- Going uptown or...
- Are you stalking me?
Not in a threatening way.
Why was I even concerned?
So I listened to your show last night.
- What did you think?
- It was amazing.
I've never actually heard of any of those bands, which I think is a good indicator that they're cool.
I'm glad someone was listening.
This may come as a surprise to you,
I don't get up to much.
Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.
- Give me the bracelet.
- Okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
That was my grandmother's bracelet.
No! Dave, don't!
You just give me that bracelet back, please.
You better run back to your girlfriend.
Believe me, I wish she was...
You thought she was my girlfriend?
Really? Is that the kind of vibe you got?
You talk too much. Shut up.
What are you doing?
I have no idea what you're referring to.
I honestly...
Whoa!
- You seeing this?
- Heads up.
Up the stairs!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Here you go.
Your grandmother's bracelet.
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.
I've been doing a lot of cardio boxing lately.
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.
Something about you seems different.
I'm wearing new shoes.
- Nice.
- Thank you. This your train?
Yes. Thank you.
I just want to tell you that if you want me to help you with your midterms, come by my lab.
- I'll text you the address.
- Yes, yes, that would be great.
- Yeah?
- Tomorrow?
It's a date.
No, no, no. It's not a date!
It's a date like an appointment.
No. A date like an appointment!
Love is a distraction.
Sorcery requires complete focus.
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.
This is perfect.
The Rising will happen here.
We'll use their satellite dishes on the rooftops.
There, and there, and there.
- Get it done.
- My "Best of" DVD drops next month.
Here we go. All right. Move.
Sorry about that. It's just nice for them to see a genuine icon like me.
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.
And before that, we need to find the boy.
Well, how do we do that?
We'll wait until he's alone.
Now, focus on control.
Set me down slow and steady.
Dave? It's Becky.
I'll be back shortly.
Could you please hide?
Hide now. Please.
Dave, get back here.
We have important work to do.
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We should go. A library, anyplace...
Dave?
Is that company I hear?
Yeah. Okay. Fine. Becky, this is my...
Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.
Hey, Dave, I'm confused.
I thought you and I were staying in together.
If this is a bad time,
- I can come back.
- Yes, actually.
No. No.
Uncle, you and I have plans for later on.
Becky, let's just get out of here.
You know what? It's all right, because I just remembered
I have to go into town to pick up your anti-itch cream.
So, you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.
Okay, enough with the studying.
There's something I want to show you.
- What are these things?
- Tesla coils.
I was using them to generate something called plasma.
The thing is, I got so fixated on the technical aspects of it that I almost didn't notice something kind of beautiful.
I think you'd better step into my cage.
Okay, it's definitely the first time anyone has said that to me.
I'm not surprised.
Just hold on to this bar, please.
Both hands. Yep.
Okay.
Okay, hold on tight and enjoy the show.
Oh, my gosh.
How is this possible?
The coils are firing at such a high frequency that the sparks literally create soundwaves as they fly through the air.
Which is nerdy.
I think it's our tradition.
It comes out of a particularly painful part of our history.
Yes, yes.
But it's been the way we've been able to heal.
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.
But I think it has grown from that.
I think it's something that knits us all together.
This is your third year as Gamemaker.
What defines your personal signature?
No! No!
It's okay.
You were just dreaming.
You were dreaming.
It was me.
I know. I know. But it's not.
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.
They're not gonna pick you.
Try to go to sleep.
I can't.
Just try. Just try.
Deep in the meadow
Under the willow
- A bed of grass
- A bed of grass
- A soft green pillow
- A soft green pillow
You remember that song? Okay.
You finish it. I've got to go.
Where?
I've just got to go.
But I'll be back. I love you.
I'll still cook you.
What are you gonna do with that when you kill it?
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!
What are you gonna do with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.
Of course you were.
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.
No. Not today.
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.
Okay.
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?
Won't happen.
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.
- It's sick.
- Gale.
If no one watches, then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.
We could do it, you know?
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.
They'd catch us.
Well, maybe not.
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.
I have Prim, and you have your brothers.
They can come, too.
Prim in the woods?
Or maybe not.
I'm never having kids.
I might, if I didn't live here.
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.
I forgot.
Here.
Oh, my God! Is this real?
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.
Happy Hunger Games.
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."
How many times is your name in today?
Forty-two.
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.
Thank you, girl.
What's this?
That's a Mockingjay.
How much?
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.
Mom.
Look at you!
You look beautiful.
But you better tuck in that tail, little duck.
I laid something out for you, too.
Okay.
Now you look beautiful, too.
Wish I looked like you.
No. I wish I looked like you, little duck.
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.
And as long as you have it, nothing bad will happen to you.
Okay? I promise.
Prim, it's okay. It's okay.
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?
They're gonna prick your finger just to take a little bit of blood.
- You didn't say...
- I know.
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?
Next.
Go ahead. Next.
Next.
It's okay.
Welcome! Welcome, welcome.
Happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
Now, before we begin, we have a very special film.
Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.
War. Terrible war.
War.
Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.
This was the uprising that rocked our land.
Thirteen districts rebelled against the country that fed them, loved them, protected them.
Brother turned on brother until nothing remained.
And then came the peace, hard fought, sorely won.
A people rose up from the ashes, and a new era was born.
But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.
We swore as a nation we would never know this treason again.
And so it was decreed that each year the various districts of Panem would offer up, in tribute, one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage, and sacrifice.
The lone victor, bathed in riches, would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness.
This is how we remember our past.
This is how we safeguard our future.
I just love that!
Now, the time has come for us to select one courageous young man and woman for the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
As usual, ladies first.
Primrose Everdeen.
Where are you, dear?
Come on up.
Well, come on up.
Prim! Prim!
No. No!
I volunteer! I volunteer!
I volunteer as Tribute!
I believe we have a volunteer, Mr. Mayor.
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.
- No! No!
- Go find Mom!
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No! No! No!
- No! No! No!
- Come on.
A dramatic turn of events here in District 12.
Yes, well.
District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.
Come on, dear.
What's your name?
Katniss Everdeen.
Well, I bet my hat that was your sister, wasn't it?
Yes.
Let's have a big hand for our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.
And now for the boys.
Peeta Mellark.
Here we are.
Our Tributes from District 12.
Well, go on, you two, shake hands.
Happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
You have three minutes.
It's okay.
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.
It isn't worth putting your name in more times. Okay?
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.
Just try to win. Maybe you can.
Of course.
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.
To protect you.
Thank you.
You can't tune out again.
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.
I won't be there anymore.
You're all she has.
No matter what you feel, you have to be there for her. Do you understand?
Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No! No! No!
I promise, Prim.
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.
I am.
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...
They will if you show them how good you are.
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.
If they don't have a bow, then you make one, okay?
You know how to hunt.
Animals.
It's no different, Katniss.
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.
Okay.
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?
You two are in for a treat.
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs, and it flies.
We'll be at The Capitol in less than two days.
Now, before you do anything else...
200 miles per hour, and you can barely feel a thing.
I think it's one of the wonderful things about this opportunity, that even though you're here and even though it's just for a little while, you get to enjoy all of this.
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.
Have you ever met him?
Haymitch?
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.
Look, you know, if you don't want to talk, I understand, but I just don't think there's anything wrong with getting a little bit of help.
Congratulations.
Where's the ice?
I don't know.
May I?
Okay, so... So when do we start?
So eager.
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?
Yeah, our mentor.
You're supposed to tell us how to get sponsors and give us advice.
Okay.
Embrace the probability of your imminent death.
And know, in your heart, that there's nothing I can do to save you.
So why are you here then?
The refreshments.
Okay, I think that's enough of that.
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.
You know, I think I'll go finish this in my room.
He's gonna come around.
It's no use.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
We have two very fit 16-year-olds.
Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.
Yes, yes, they do.
- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.
One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.
The use of the rubble in the ruined city...
Very exciting.
And this moment here, this moment is a moment that you never forget.
Yes.
The moment when a Tribute becomes a victor.
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.
That's a good way to get killed.
What's a good way to get killed?
Joy. Why don't you join us?
I was just giving some life-saving advice.
Like what?
I was just asking about how to find shelter.
Which would come in handy if, in fact, you were still alive.
How do you find shelter?
Pass the jam.
How do you find shelter?
Give me a chance to wake up, sweetheart.
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.
Can you pass the marmalade?
That is mahogany!
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.
You really want to know how to stay alive?
You get people to like you.
Not what you were expecting?
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife, or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death.
And those things only come from sponsors.
And to get sponsors, you have to make people like you.
And right now, sweetheart, you're not off to a real good start.
There it is.
It's huge!
That's incredible.
Peeta, I love you.
Come on. Come on.
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.
So now that you've seen them, what do you think about this year's crop of recruits?
Are there any surprises that we can expect this year?
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,
- but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.
And whenever you have a volunteer from an outlying district, that's something you can't ignore.
What's that?
We're just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna.
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.
I'm sorry that this happened to you, and I'm here to help you in any way that I can.
Most people just congratulate me.
Well, I don't see the point in that.
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.
I'm gonna take you out and show you off to the world.
So you're here to make me look pretty?
I'm here to help you make an impression.
Now, usually they dress people in the clothes from their district.
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.
I wanna do something that they're gonna remember.
Did they explain about trying to get sponsors?
Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends.
We'll see.
I just think somebody that brave shouldn't be dressed up in some stupid costume, now should they?
I hope not.
Okay, this is safe. I promise.
It's not real fire. These suits are built so you won't feel a thing.
Looks pretty real to me.
Well, that's the idea.
You ready?
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
Over 100,000 people craning to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.
And the sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time.
The importance of this moment cannot be overstated.
Very nice.
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.
It's the most exciting part.
It just gives you goose bumps.
And don't you love how the stylists, they so clearly are able to reflect the character of each district?
- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.
- Fishing.
- I get it.
- I like it.
- That's very good.
And behind them, we have two power plant workers. Right?
And then...
What is that in the background?
Come on. They'll love it.
Yeah!
Now see that? I love that.
Two young people holding their hands up, saying,
"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."
- Nope.
- I love that!
People are sure gonna be paying attention to them right now.
And we're ready.
President Snow, you're live.
Welcome.
Tributes, we welcome you.
We salute your courage and your sacrifice.
And we wish you
Happy Hunger Games.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
That was amazing.
We are all anybody's going to be talking about.
So brave.
Are you sure you should be near an open flame?
Fake flame? Are you sure you...
Let's go upstairs.
So, each of the districts get their own floor.
And because you're from 12, you get the penthouse.
Come on.
So this is the living room.
I know, I know.
Now, your rooms are right over here.
Why don't you go clean yourselves up a little before dinner?
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.
One of you will be alive.
Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days, particularly to what I'm about to say.
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.
You'll have plenty of time for that in the Arena.
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.
Everybody wants to grab a sword, but most of you will die from natural causes.
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!
You little punk! He took my knife!
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.
I'll finish you right now, kid!
Actually, better yet,
I'll wait for the Arena.
You're the first one I get, so watch your back.
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!
He's a Career. You know what that is?
- From District 1.
- And 2.
They train in a special academy until they're 18. Then they volunteer.
By that point, they're pretty lethal.
But they don't receive any special treatment.
In fact, they stay in the exact same apartment as you do.
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.
So how good are they?
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...
Almost.
...they can be arrogant.
And arrogance can be a big problem.
I hear you can shoot.
I'm all right.
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.
He says she hits them right in the eye every time.
- Peeta's strong.
- What?
He can throw a 100-pound sack of flour right over his head. I've seen it.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill anybody with a sack of flour.
No, but you might have a better chance of winning if somebody comes after you with a knife.
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?
It's true. Everybody knows it.
You know what my mother said?
She said District 12 might finally have a winner.
But she wasn't talking about me.
She was talking about you.
I'm not very hungry.
I'm done, too.
Throw that metal thing over there.
What?
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed to show our skills.
I don't care what Haymitch said.
Those guys are looking at you like you're a meal.
Throw it.
Hi.
Hey.
How did you do that?
I used to decorate the cakes down at the bakery.
I'll show you.
See?
Yeah.
Hey, I think you have a shadow.
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one and evaluate you.
This is important, because higher ratings will mean sponsors.
This is the time to show them everything.
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.
They'll start with District 1, so the two of you will go last.
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.
Katniss Everdeen.
Hey, Katniss?
Shoot straight.
Katniss Everdeen.
District 12.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!
Did you get some pig yet?
Thank you for your consideration.
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.
Mad?
You realize that your actions reflect badly on all of us. Not just you.
They just want a good show. It's fine.
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?
Well, finally! I hope you noticed we have a serious situation.
Nice shooting, sweetheart.
What did they do when you shot the apple?
Well, they looked pretty startled.
Yeah.
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."
- Thanks for your consideration.
- "... your consideration."
Genius! Genius.
I don't think we're gonna find this funny if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...
On who? On her?
On him?
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.
I would have given anything to see it.
As you know, the Tributes were rated on a scale of 1 to 12 after three days of careful evaluation.
The Gamekeepers would like to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...
From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine.
From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10.
Clove, with a score of 10.
From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...
From District 7...
From District 8...
And Rue with a score of seven.
Now our final district.
From District 12. Peeta Mellark.
A score of eight.
- Excellent.
- Peeta!
Bravo.
- We can work with that.
- Good job.
And finally, from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen.
With a score of...
Eleven.
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!
- Yes!
- Eleven?
Congratulations.
I thought they hated me.
They must have liked your guts.
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!
Goodness. We are.
An 11 ?
She earned it.
She shot an arrow at your head.
Well, at an apple.
Near your head.
Sit down.
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?
What do you mean?
I mean, why do we have a winner?
I mean, if we just wanted to intimidate the districts, why not round up 24 of them at random and execute them all at once?
Be a lot faster.
Hope.
Hope?
Hope.
It is the only thing stronger than fear.
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.
So...
So contain it.
Right.
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.
Haymitch, you should join us.
We're having some of your favorite for dinner.
Lovely.
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.
And they let us work with our own Tributes right before The Games, so you and I will be going down at 9:00.
What about him?
He says he wants to be trained on his own from now on.
What?
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?
We should have some chocolate-covered strawberries.
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, your master of ceremonies,
Caesar Flickerman!
Thank you! Thank you!
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!
Now, in about five minutes, they're all going to be out here.
All of the Tributes that you've heard about.
Are you excited?
Let me hear it!
Amazing.
I don't feel amazing.
Don't you know how beautiful you look?
No. And I don't know how to make people like me.
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.
That's different. I wasn't trying.
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.
And just pretend that you're talking to me. Okay?
Okay.
Let's see if she does indeed shine.
Let's have a warm round of applause for Glimmer!
Glimmer, are you prepared?
Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.
I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.
- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...
...I'm wearing one of our own creations.
A big round of applause!
Marvel!
Welcome, Clove.
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.
Cato!
I find that if I can apply myself to the situation present,
I will be able to figure it out.
Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.
Good. So you can climb trees.
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?
A gatherer?
From District 12, District 12...
You know her as The Girl on Fire!
Well, we know her as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!
Welcome! Welcome.
Welcome.
Well, that was quite an entrance you made the other day.
What?
I think someone's a little nervous.
I said that was quite an entrance that you made at the Tribute Parade the other day.
Do you want to tell us about it?
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.
When you came out of that chariot,
I have to say, my heart stopped.
Did any of you experience this as well?
My heart stopped.
So did mine.
Now, tell me about the flames.
Are they real?
Yes.
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?
Yes.
What do you think, folks?
I think that's a yes.
Steady. Steady.
Lovely. Thank you.
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.
That was something. Thank you for that.
I have one more question for you.
It's about your sister.
We were all very moved, I think, when you volunteered for her at the Reaping.
Did she come and say goodbye to you?
Yes.
- She did.
- She did.
And what did you say to her in the end?
I told her that I would try to win.
That I would try to win for her.
Of course you did.
And try you will.
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!
You did it, darling. That was incredible.
Thank you.
Nice job, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Nice dress, too.
- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!
Peeta, welcome.
How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map."
It's different.
It's very different than back home.
Different. In what way? Give us an example.
Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.
- The showers?
- Yes.
We have different showers.
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?
- Take a whiff?
- All right.
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.
That makes sense.
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me, is there a special girl back home?
No. No. Not really.
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.
Well, there...
There is this one girl that I've had a crush on forever.
But I don't think she actually recognized me until the Reaping.
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.
You go out there and you win this thing, and when you get home, she'll have to go out with you.
Right, folks?
Thanks, but I don't think winning's gonna help me at all.
And why not?
Because she came here with me.
Well, that's bad luck.
Yeah, it is.
- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.
Peeta Mellark.
District 12!
What the hell was that?
You don't talk to me, and then you say you have a crush on me?
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?
Stop it! Stop it!
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.
He made you look desirable, which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.
He's right, Katniss.
Of course I'm right.
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers from District 12...
We are not star-crossed lovers.
It's a television show!
And being in love with that boy might just get you sponsors, which could save your damn life.
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?
Maybe I can deliver you both in one piece tomorrow.
Manners!
You, too?
Hey.
Can't sleep?
No. Of course not.
I'm sorry I went after you.
You know, I meant that as a compliment.
I know.
Listen to them.
Yeah.
I just don't want them to change me.
How would they change you?
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.
I just don't want to be another piece in their game, you know?
You mean you won't kill anyone?
No.
I mean, I'm sure I would, just like anybody else when the time came, but I just keep wishing that I could think of a way to show them that they don't own me.
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
I just can't afford to think like that.
I have my sister.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front, right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.
Why not?
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.
That's not your game.
You turn, run, find high ground, look for water.
Water's your new best friend.
Don't step off that pedestal early or they'll blow you sky high.
I won't.
Katniss, you can do this.
Thanks.
Give me your arm.
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?
Your tracker.
We're up.
We're up!
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.
There are 15 out. They are flying.
Here.
Thank you.
Thirty seconds.
I'm not allowed to bet, but if I could, I'd bet on you.
Twenty seconds.
Ten seconds.
Okay, they're in the tubes.
And, of course, there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon, which marks the end of another fallen Tribute.
...eight...
...nine...
Twenty-five? Got it.
He's moving now.
Well, that makes 13 gone in the first eight hours.
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"
That's actually a good impression.
Hey, lover boy!
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
You better be.
Yeah, that was her snare we found back there.
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.
Let's go.
Sir?
She is almost at the edge.
Two kilometers away from the nearest Tribute.
Let's turn her around.
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...
She's heading towards the left flank.
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?
Sure. Cueing tree.
She's almost there.
Lucia, get a cannon ready.
There she is! There she is!
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.
- There she is!
- Yeah!
Here we go!
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!
Where do you think you're going?
Where you going, baby?
Three o'clock.
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.
Where are you going?
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.
Just get her, Cato!
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.
Right up there.
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!
You got this.
Go! He's got this.
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!
I'm coming for you!
Come on, Cato!
I'll do it myself.
Give me that before...
- Get her.
- Come on. Come on, come on!
Maybe you should throw the sword!
Let's just wait her out.
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.
We'll just kill her then.
Okay.
Somebody make a fire.
- Let's make camp over here!
- Hurry up with the fire.
Boys.
Thank you.
Claudius, I think those are trackerjackers.
Am I wrong?
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.
For those of you who don't know, trackerjackers are genetically engineered wasps whose venom causes searing pain, powerful hallucinations, and in extreme cases, death.
Run!
Katniss, go!
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!
Not only is it lethal, but the venom of a trackerjacker sting can produce powerful hallucinations.
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!
Katniss, go!
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!
Rue?
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
You want mine, too?
No, that's okay.
Here.
Thanks.
How long was I asleep?
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.
Thank you.
So what happened while I was out?
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.
And the boy from my district?
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.
Is all of that true?
What?
You and him?
So where are Cato and the others?
They got all their supplies down by the lake.
It's piled up in this great big pyramid.
That sounds tempting.
Now, this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy, so as soon as you light it, move on to the next fire.
Light this one last, and I'll meet you back over there.
Right.
And then I'll destroy their stuff while they're chasing us.
We need a signal in case one of us gets held up.
Okay. Like what?
Here. Watch this.
Mockingjays. That's great.
Back home, we use them to signal all the time.
You try.
Okay, so if we hear that, it means we're okay and we'll be back real soon.
We're gonna be okay.
Hey, I'll see you for supper.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!
Let's go.
You stay guard and don't move until we can get back.
I want to see if she's gonna figure out this booby trap.
Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines around that big pile of goodies.
She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?
I don't know what happened.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!
Our stuff!
Katniss!
Katniss, help!
Katniss!
Katniss! Help!
Katniss!
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay. You're fine. See?
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.
Did you blow up the food?
Every bit of it.
Good.
You have to win.
Can you sing?
Okay.
Deep in the meadow
Under the willows
A bed of grass
A soft green pillow
Lay down your head and close your eyes
And when they open, the sun...
I'm sorry.
Don't kill her. You'll just create a martyr.
Well, it seems we've already got one.
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.
What do you want?
You have a lot of anger out there.
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.
If you can't scare them, give them something to root for.
Such as?
Young love.
So you like an underdog?
Everyone likes an underdog.
I don't.
Have you been out there?
Not personally. No.
Well, I have.
There are lots of underdogs.
Lots of coal, too.
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.
There are lots of underdogs.
And I think if you could see them, you would not root for them either.
I like you.
Be careful.
Attention, Tributes. Attention.
The regulations requiring a single victor have been suspended.
From now on, two victors may be crowned, if both originate from the same district.
This will be the only announcement.
Peeta.
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!
Hi.
It's okay.
What was it?
A sword.
It's bad, huh?
It's gonna be fine.
Katniss.
- Katniss.
- No!
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
Nobody's gonna find you in here.
They already found me.
We'll just get you some medicine.
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.
We'll figure something out.
Like what?
Something.
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.
I'll do it.
That's nice.
You fed me once.
I think about that all the time.
How I tossed you that bread.
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.
I should have just gone out in the rain and...
You feel hot.
I remember the first time I saw you.
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.
And I remember when you sang in the music assembly.
The teacher said,
"Who knows The Valley Song?"
And your hand shot straight up.
Stop.
After that,
I watched you going home every day.
Every day.
Well, say something.
I'm not good at saying something.
Then come here.
Please.
Even if I don't make it...
Stop it.
Attention, Tributes. Attention.
Commencing at sunrise, there will be a feast tomorrow at the Cornucopia.
This will be no ordinary occasion.
Each of you needs something desperately.
And we plan to be generous hosts.
Your medicine.
You're not going alone.
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.
Katniss, you're not gonna risk your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?
Why are you doing this?
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.
Peeta...
Please.
Stay.
Okay.
I'll stay.
Oh, God!
Where's lover boy?
I see. You were gonna help him, right?
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad that you couldn't help your little friend.
That little girl? What was her name again?
Rue?
Yeah, well, we killed her.
And now we're gonna kill you.
You kill her?
- No!
- I heard you!
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!
You said her name!
Just this time, 12.
For Rue.
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.
No, you're not. What happened?
The girl from 2, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.
You got worse.
I'm sorry.
You need some of that, too.
I'm okay.
That feels better.
Okay. Now you.
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.
Come on.
All right.
Hi.
You're so much better.
Oh, my God, Peeta.
I hardly feel anything.
We could go home.
We could. We're the only team left.
We could go home.
We know Thresh took off.
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.
He's not gonna go someplace he doesn't know.
Foxface, she could be anywhere.
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.
Okay, I'll take the bow.
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.
Peeta?
Peeta!
Are you okay?
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!
I didn't know.
You scared me to death. Damn you.
I'm sorry.
I never even knew she was following me.
She's clever.
Too clever.
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.
What time is it?
A little after noon.
Why is it getting so dark?
Must be in a hurry to end it.
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.
Well, that's great.
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.
That's it. That's excellent.
Did you hear that?
What was that?
It's the finale.
Let's go.
Go.
Katniss!
Here!
Go on. Shoot.
Then we both go down and you'd win.
Go on. I'm dead anyway.
I always was, right?
I didn't know that till now.
How is that? Is that what they want?
- No.
- No, no.
I could still do this.
One more kill.
It's the only thing I know how to do.
Bring pride to my district.
Not that it matters.
Please!
No!
Please!
Attention. Attention, Tributes.
There has been a slight rule change.
The previous revision, allowing for two victors from the same district, has been revoked.
Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.
And may the odds be ever in your favor.
Go ahead.
One of us should go home.
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.
No.
They don't.
Why should they?
- No!
- Trust me.
Trust me.
Together?
Together.
Okay.
One...
Two...
Three.
Stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
They're not happy with you.
Why? Because I didn't die?
Because you showed them up.
Well, I'm sorry it didn't go the way they planned.
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!
This is serious. Not just for you.
They don't take these things lightly.
When they ask, you say you couldn't help yourself.
You were so in love with this boy that the thought of not being with him was unthinkable.
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?
How did you feel when you found him by that river?
I felt like the happiest person in the world.
I couldn't imagine life without him.
And what about you, Peeta?
She saved my life.
We saved each other.
Ladies and gentlemen, the star-crossed lovers from District 12, this year's victors of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What a lovely pin.
Thank you. It's from my district.
They must be very proud of you.
So what happens when we get back?
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.
I don't want to forget.
"Childhood is not from birth to a certain age.
"And at a certain age, the child is grown and puts away childish things.
"Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies."
Jake! Jacob!
Phil!
It's happening.
You just have to break them in.
I've been breaking them in. For three days.
Can l just go barefoot?
No, absolutely not.
Just thinking it's a little much, you know?
The dress and the shoes, and all of this.
No, it's exactly enough.
Tomorrow will be perfect.
Where do you want them, boss?
On either side of the aisle.
-What aisle?
-Does no one have vision?
You, go home and get lots of beauty sleep.
That's an order.
Okay. l was just checking for cold feet.
Well, mine are toasty warm.
It's not too late to change your mind.
What? Now you're having second thoughts?
You are.
No, I've been waiting a century to marry you, Miss Swan.
But? l haven't told you everything about myself.
What? You're not a virgin?
Look, you can't scare me away now.
Look, a few years after Carlisle created me, l rebelled against him. l resented him for curbing my appetite.
And so for a while, l went off on my own. l wanted to know how it felt to hunt.
To taste human blood.
All the men I killed were monsters.
And so was I.
Edward, they were all murderers.
You probably saved more lives than you took.
Bella, that's what l told myself.
But they were all human beings. l looked into their eyes as they died and l saw who l was, and what l was capable of.
And what I'll be capable of.
Why are you telling me this tonight?
Did you really think this was gonna change my mind about you? l just wondered if it would change your mind about yourself, and who you wanna see when you look in the mirror a year from now. l know l can do this.
Let me tell you why.
Because you did.
You should give yourself some credit for that.
Now, hopefully, a year from now,
I'm gonna look in the mirror and see someone like you. l mean, someone capable of courage and sacrifice and love.
--What is that?
- Come on! Let's go!
- I'm late for my bachelor party.
Send him out, Bella, or we're coming in after him.
So, this party.
Will there be strippers?
No, just a couple of mountain lions.
Maybe a few bears.
Don't worry, Bella, we'll give him back in plenty of time.
Okay, go, before they break my house.
Let's go! Let's go!
I'll meet you at the altar.
I'll be the one in white.
That was very convincing.
What did l say about beauty sleep?
Sorry, bad dream. lt was wedding jitters.
Do you need some help? l could do her hair.
Really?
Please.
I'm not offended by your choice of groom.
Just my blatant lack of respect for mortality.
Essentially.
Weddings. They bring everyone together.
Hey, so, did you find our daughter?
Are those graduation caps?
How creative!
Or weird.
Alice? Bella?
In here, Mom.
Oh, my gosh!
You're so beautiful.
Oh, honey.
Crap! My mascara.
Mom!
Thanks.
Charlie, get in here.
You sure? l don't wanna... l know. l look hot.
We thought you needed something blue.
And something old.
- Besides your mother.
- Nice.
-lt was Grandma Swan's.
-But we added the sapphires.
It's beautiful, you guys.
Wow. Thank you so much.
It's your first family heirloom.
Pass on to your daughter, and her daughter.
Mom, l love it.
Nope. No smudging my masterpiece.
She's right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Time for the dress!
Do you wanna see it? l want to see it!
They have got to be related.
What a gene pool.
Seriously.
You've got some... The drool.
So, you think Bella's gonna be showing?
Jess, she is not pregnant.
Okay. Who else gets married at 1 8?
You ready?
Yeah.
Just don't let me fall, Dad.
Never.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here on this glorious day to witness the union of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan.
Please repeat after me. l, Edward Cullen.
Take you, Bella Swan.
-Take you, Bella Swan.
-To have and to hold.
To have and to hold.
For better or for worse.
For richer, for poorer.
In sickness and in health.
To love.
To cherish.
As long as we both shall live. l do. l love you.
Have I found you
Flightless bird
Jealous
Weeping or lost you
American mouth
Big pill looming
Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Just thought it'd be bigger.
Yeah.
-Hi!
-Hi, guys.
We were just saying how pretty everything is, you know, just saying.
Well, thanks so much.
You don't think it's too much?
-No.
-Not at all.
-No.
-No.
Hey, man. Nice to see you.
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you. l hope you'll be happy, Bella.
Thank you, Billy.
Have you heard from him?
I'm sure Jake wishes you the best.
Well, l plan on getting drunk.
They're serving up some pretty fancy champagne.
Sue, can l get you a glass?
Sparkling fire water.
Sounds great.
Bella.
-Congratulations, Edward.
-Thank you.
Bella.
Eleazar and Carmen, right?
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hola.
Yes, and these are our cousins from Alaska.
-Tanya, Kate.
-We've heard so much about you.
-Welcome to the family.
-Bienvenida.
Thank you.
Irina.
Come meet Bella.
-l can't do this.
-You promised.
They invited one.
Irina, he's our friend.
They killed Laurent.
He tried to kill Bella. l don't believe that.
He wanted to be like us.
To live in peace with humans.
With me.
I'm sorry.
- Irina!
- Well.
Let's not monopolize the bride.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Well, what's a wedding without some family drama?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.
Is this on?
Hello?
Umm, I'd like to propose a toast.
To my new sister.
Bella, I hope you've gotten enough sleep these last 18 years.
'Cause you won't be getting any more for a while.
Well, Bella was just like everybody else, totally mesmerized by Edward.
Or "The Hair," as l call him.
And then, suddenly,
Edward is all about Bella.
Even though she's not the captain of the volleyball team.
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
Or the president of the student council.
Edward will be a good husband.
I know this because I'm a cop.
I know things.
Like how to hunt somebody to the ends of the Earth.
Now that you're my sister, you'll have to get over your aversion to fashion.
And I know how to use a gun.
Skirts, heels, handbags.
Go to sleep, my love
Go to sleep
When you wake
You'll see me
I'd like to thank Renée and Charlie for bringing such a wonderful person into the world and into our lives.
We will cherish and protect her forever.
It's an extraordinary thing to meet someone who you can bare your soul to.
And who will accept you for what you are.
I've been waiting, what seems like a very long time, to get beyond what I am.
And with Bella,
I feel like I can finally begin.
So I'd like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride.
No measure of time with you will be long enough.
But let's start with forever.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Another one of your gifts just arrived.
What?
Yeah, come on.
What's a wedding present doing out here?
Just a little more private.
The best man didn't have time to get a tux.
Jacob!
Jacob.
--Hey.
-Hey, Bella.
-Hey.
This is kind of you.
Kind is my middle name.
I'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Doesn't matter.
Everything's perfect now.
Will you dance with me?
Where have you been?
We were gonna put your face on a milk carton.
Mostly northern Canada. l think.
It's weird to be back on two legs again, in clothes.
Gotten out of practice with the whole human thing.
Are you okay?
Being here?
Why? Afraid I'll trash your party?
You're not the only one.
You'd think I'd be used to telling you goodbye by now.
Come on, you're not supposed to be the one crying, Bella.
Everyone cries at weddings.
This is how I'm gonna remember you.
Pink cheeks.
Two left feet.
Heartbeat.
'Cause what, soon I'm gonna be dead to you?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to appreciate your last night as a human.
Well, it's not my last night. l thought you... l didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.
What's the point?
It's not like you're gonna have a real honeymoon with him, anyway.
It's gonna be as real as anyone else's.
That's a sick joke.
You are joking?
What? While you're still human?
You can't be serious, Bella.
Tell me you're not that stupid. l mean, it's really none of your business.
-No! You can't do this!
-Jake.
-Listen to me, Bella.
-Jake, let me go!
Jacob, calm down, all right?
Are you out of your mind? Huh?
You'll kill her!
Walk away, Jake.
Enough, Jacob!
Stay out of this, Sam.
You're not gonna start something that we'll have to finish.
She'll die.
She's not our concern anymore.
Let's go, Seth!
I'm really, really, really stupid.
No, it's all right.
Come on, people are probably missing us.
Let's go back.
So, he really won't tell you where he's taking you?
No, it's a surprise.
Well, wear a hat.
Sunscreen.
Take care of yourself. l will.
Okay. l love you, Bella. l love you.
So much.
Thank you.
Everything's packed and ready to go.
Cool.
Oh.
-I'm gonna go see him.
-Yeah.
Dad.
Well...
It's gonna be strange, you not living under my roof.
Yeah.
It's gonna be strange for me, too.
You know it will always be your home, right? l love you, Dad. Forever. l love you, too, Bells. l always have and l always will.
All right.
Go on.
You don't wanna miss your plane.
Wherever it's going.
Okay.
Bye.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Please pull over.
So, we're not staying in Rio?
No, we're just passing through.
Are we close?
That's lsle Esme. lt was a gift from Carlisle. ls this totally necessary? l am nothing if not traditional.
You wanna take a look around?
You tired?
Do you wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, that sounds nice. l could use a few human minutes.
Don't take too long, Mrs. Cullen.
Okay.
Okay.
She's a caged animal
London by night
Crashing lights and cymbals
Queens of twilight
And if I was you I'd use the loo
Before the long drive
We complement each other
Just like Satan and Christ
Baby, when I am laid to rest
May my laughter remain
Like your kiss blew me away
Answer your spirit
I gotta know right now
I see you before me
Won't you show me how?
Alice!
I wear my hair fizzy
I don't copy no style
But kissing and a-scrubbing
It has consequences
You're on the bus again
Past Big Ben
With your rip off Oyster card
Don't be a coward.
Gotas mínimas
Caudales de agua
You're so beautiful.
Agua lisa l promised that we'd try.
If this doesn't work... l trust you.
Tu vida...
I've waited a hundred years
But I'd wait a million more
For you
Nothing prepared me for the privilege of being yours
It's okay.
If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
I would have known what I was living for
What I've been living for
Your love is my turning page
Only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase
I surrender who I've been for who you are
Nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
I would have known
How badly are you hurt?
What?
No, Bella, look.
Bella, l can't tell you how sorry l am.
I'm not.
Really, I'm not. I'm fine.
Don't say you're fine.
Just don't.
No, you don't.
Don't ruin this.
I've already ruined it.
Why can't you see how perfectly happy l am?
Or was five seconds ago. l mean, now I'm sort of pissed off, actually.
You should be angry with me. l mean, we knew this was gonna be tricky, right? l think we did amazing. l mean, it was amazing for me.
That's what you're worried about?
That l didn't enjoy myself? l know it's not the same for you, but for a human, l can't imagine that it gets any better than that.
Last night was the best night of my existence.
You're the best.
You're not gonna touch me again, are you?
You know that's not what l mean.
Let me make you breakfast.
Dreamed last night about a time and place
Where from our troubles we had escape
I held your hand and I felt complete
As you turned and said to me
From now on
From now on we'll be
You and me
We will be
From now on
From now on we'll be
You and me
You and me
We will be
Only a dream
From now on
Only a dream
From now on
Only a dream
From now on
Only a dream
From now on
You and me, we will be l win.
Bella?
You having a nightmare?
No. lt was just a dream. lt was a really good dream.
Then why are you crying?
Because l wanted it to be real.
Tell me.
Bella, l can't.
Please.
Maybe they'll say she was in a car crash.
Or tripped and fell off a cliff.
Keep it in play! Keep it in play!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
At least I'll get one thing out of it.
No, you won't.
Cullens are not a danger to the town or the tribe.
Well, he's either gonna kill her or change her.
-And the treaty says...
-l say, Jacob. l say.
You know, if you wanted things different, you should've become alpha.
Turning it down seemed like a good idea at the time.
Jake, you really think you could kill Bella if she comes back a vampire?
No, make one of us do it, then hold a grudge against us.
Shut up, Leah.
Would you just get over it?
It's not like you've imprinted on her.
At least they seem happy.
Yeah, some people are just lucky, l guess.
Lucky?
None of them belong to themselves anymore.
And the sickest part is their genes tell them they're happy about it.
Least if you imprinted on someone, you'd finally forget about Bella. l mean, being any kind of happy is better than being miserable about someone you can't have.
Bella, these are our housekeepers,
Gustavo and Kaure.
This is my wife Bella.
Excuse me.
Well, l guess we just leave them to it.
What was that all about?
She's afraid for you.
Why?
Because l have you here all alone.
You mean she knows about you?
She suspects.
She's native Ticuna. They have legends about blood-drinking demons who prey on beautiful women.
Hey.
You're late.
Bella?
Hey, don't come in here.
You don't need to see this.
"In sickness and health," remember? lt must have been the chicken.
Could you grab my bag?
What is it?
How many days has it been since the wedding?
Fourteen. Why?
Will you tell me what's going on?
I'm late.
My period, it's late.
That's impossible.
Can this happen?
- Whoa!
- Alice.
- Bella?
Are you all right?
I'm not 100%¤ sure.
Why? What's wrong? I just...
You just what?
Alice, what did you see?
- Here's Carlisle.
- Bella, what's going on? l don't know. I'm a little worried.
Can vampires go into shock?
Has Edward been harmed?
No. l know that it's impossible, but l think that I'm pregnant.
Whoa!
Carlisle, l swear, something just moved inside me.
-ls this even possible?
-I don't know.
What's he saying?
The sooner Bella's here, the sooner we can find out what it is.
I need you to get to the mainland at once.
Yeah, yeah, l will.
Well?
Damn it.
Kaure's making sure you're still alive.
Slow we paddle through the lake
Straight to the very center
Of the darkest water
Where we can embrace
The shadows on the surface
The eyes that look up lifeless
From our twins below
And though your arms and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your ears
When all is lost and plundered
My love will be there still
True, it's chilling to behold
Up close we stumble back...
What did you do with her?
What do you know about this? l know that you are a demon!
You killed this little girl!
What?
Her people have legends.
She might have seen this before.
Please.
Tell me how to help her.
You only do bad. l am begging you. l will do anything. l love her.
Please.
Tell me how she can survive this.
Death.
I'm not gonna let it hurt you.
Carlisle will get that thing out.
Thing?
Wait here while we load.
- Hello?
- Rosalie.
Bella?
-What's going on?
-l need your help.
Hey, Son.
What's going on?
Bella called him.
Hey, haven't seen you in a while.
-You okay?
-So, you finally heard from Bella?
They're extending their trip.
Seems she caught a bug.
They wanna wait until she feels better before they travel.
She's sick.
Yeah, she told me not to worry, but she sounded, l don't know, off.
She'll be okay, Charlie.
Come on. Let's eat.
Jacob, let it go. ls it true?
Hello, Jacob, how are you?
Listen, just give it to me straight.
Jake, is that you?
-She's here?
-They came home two weeks ago.
Jake.
I'm glad you came.
-Close enough.
-What's your problem?
Rose, it's okay.
You look terrible.
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.
So, are you gonna tell me what's wrong with you?
Rose, you wanna help me up?
You did this!
We didn't know it was even possible.
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.
Ultrasounds and needles won't penetrate the embryonic sac. l can't see it, either.
And l can't see Bella's future anymore.
We've been researching legends, but there isn't much to go on.
What we do know is that it's strong.
And fast-growing.
Why haven't you done anything?
Take it out of her!
This is none of your business, dog.
Rose!
All this fighting isn't good for Bella.
The fetus isn't good for Bella.
Say the word, Alice. "Baby."
It's just a little baby.
Possibly.
Carlisle, you've gotta do something.
No.
It's not his decision. It's not any of yours.
Jacob, l need to talk to you. l always knew you'd destroy her.
She thinks Carlisle can turn her at the last minute, like he did for me and Esme.
-Can he?
-Probability is slight.
And if her heart fails...
Look, Jacob, l need you to do something for me.
For her.
You have a connection with her that I'll never understand.
Maybe you could talk to her, change her mind.
You can keep her alive.
And if l can't?
If she dies, you get what you always wanted.
To kill me.
Rose, I'm fine, really.
-So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?
-Sort of.
Though l can't figure out why he thinks you'd listen to me. l mean, you never have before.
Since when are you and blondie BFFs?
Rose understands what l want.
What are you thinking, Bella?
Seriously. l know this seems like a scary thing, but it's not.
It's like this miracle or something. l can feel him.
So, it's a bouncing baby boy.
I'm sorry l didn't know.
Should've brought some blue balloons.
It's just a guess.
When l picture him, l see a boy.
We'll see.
You won't.
Jake, l can do this.
-I'm strong enough.
-Come on.
You can spout that crap to your bloodsucker, but you don't fool me. l can see what that thing's doing to you.
It's a killer, Bella.
-You're wrong.
-And when you die, what was the point?
Of me loving you, you loving him.
How is that right for anyone?
Because l sure don't see it.
Listen to me, Bella.
Please.
Just don't do this.
Live, okay?
Please.
Jake, everything's gonna be okay.
Jacob, don't go. l know how this ends.
And I'm not sticking around to watch.
Jacob.
Jake, I can do this. I can do this.
Don't do this.
I'm strong enough.
I'm strong enough.
This is none of your business, dog.
Jacob, don't go.
You did this!
Everything's gonna be okay.
The fetus isn't good for Bella.
I know how this ends.
Don't you even care that it's killing you?
Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Is it true, Jacob?
- What will it be?
It's growing fast.
- It's unnatural.
- Dangerous.
- Monstrosity.
- An abomination.
On our land.
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.
We have to protect the tribe.
What they've bred won't be able to control its thirst.
Every human will be in danger.
- We're ready.
- No time to waste.
Now?
We must destroy it before it's born.
You mean, kill Bella?
Her choice affects us all.
Bella's human.
Our protection applies to her.
She's dying anyway!
We have real enemies to fight tonight.
Tonight?
You will fight with us, Jake. l will not.
I am the grandson of Ephraim Black.
I am the grandson of a chief!
I wasn't born to follow you, or anyone else.
Whoa.
Don't worry. They're not following us.
What do you think you're doing here?
-l left Sam's pack.
-Go home, Seth.
-l won't stand behind him.
-Oh, yes, you will.
I'm not kidding. Get out of here. ls that an order?
Gonna make me bow down, too?
I'm not ordering anyone.
Look, I'm just going off on my own here, okay?
Great, and I've got your back.
No, you don't.
If Sam comes after Bella, are you really ready to fight your own brothers?
Your sister?
If it's the right thing to do.
Whatever.
I'm gonna go give the Cullens a heads-up.
Do what you want.
How cool is this? Two-man pack.
Two against the world.
You're getting on my nerves, Seth.
I'll shut up. Can do.
Get ready.
They're coming for Bella.
They're not gonna touch her.
Agreed.
Man, l can smell them from all the way out here.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm not gonna let my little brother get himself killed.
Go away, Leah! l can take care of myself.
That you think so proves you need a babysitter.
Okay, would the both of you shut up?
Did Sam send you?
Sam doesn't even know l left. l think he just figured it out.
Jake. l know what his plan is.
Sam's lost the element of surprise, and he doesn't want to take you on outnumbered, so he's not gonna come at you head on.
He's got the place surrounded and he'll wait for his opportunity.
We won't get through without a fight.
No fights.
We won't be the ones to break the treaty.
The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind.
Not in ours.
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.
We'll make do.
You've done us a great service, Jacob.
Thank you. l know they're out there somewhere, but l can't hear them anymore.
It's so quiet. l stopped hearing them, too, the second l decided to leave.
It's nice.
You know you can't stay here.
-But l don't have any place...
-l can't trust you with the Cullens.
You hate them too much.
You don't even like me. l don't have to. l just have to follow you.
Look, Seth doesn't want you here.
Neither do l.
Being unwanted isn't exactly a new thing for me.
Look, I'll stay out of your way.
I'll do whatever you want, except go back to Sam's pack and be the pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from.
You don't know how many times l wished l could imprint on someone.
Anyone.
Just to break the connection.
All right.
I'm gonna do a perimeter run.
You got my flank?
God and his priests and his kings
All will wait
As they go on
Mmm-mmm
Held between heaven and hell
As they're dancing
As they don't
Cold
Your rib is cracked.
But there are no splinters.
You haven't punctured anything.
-Yet.
-Edward.
It's breaking her bones now.
It's crushing you from the inside out.
Carlisle, tell her what you told me. Tell her.
Carlisle, tell me. It's all right.
The fetus isn't compatible with your body.
It's too strong. lt won't allow you to get the nutrition you need.
It's starving you by the hour. l can't stop it, and l can't slow it down.
At this rate, your heart will give out before you can deliver.
Then I'll hold on as long as l can, and then...
Bella.
There are some conditions that even venom can't overcome.
You understand?
I'm sorry.
Edward, I'm sorry. l can't live without you.
You won't. You're gonna have a part of me.
He'll need you.
Do you honestly think that l could love it or even tolerate it if it killed you?
It's not his fault.
You have to accept what is.
Because you've given me no choice!
Bella, we're supposed to be partners, remember?
But you decided this on your own.
You've decided to leave me.
Don't see it that way.
Well, l have no other way to see it.
'Cause it's me who'll lose you.
And l don't choose that. l don't choose that.
Cold
Sing for the lion and lamb
Yours completely
Yours
As we go over
Sing for the lion and lamb
Washington driving in the red zone.
Almost stripped of the ball.
He stood up and Calvin finally...
Are you cold? l got it.
Don't do that.
What?
Smile like I'm your favorite person in the world.
You're one of them.
Feels complete when you're here, Jake.
We need to find a way to get some food into her system.
-If l could only see the fetus...
-The baby.
...maybe l could figure out what it wants.
Think you might be right.
Jacob just had an idea. lt wasn't an idea. lt was a snide comment.
What were you thinking?
That it's probably just looking for someone to sink its teeth into.
He's thirsty. l know the feeling.
If it's craving, it's not gonna want animal blood. l have some O negative laid aside for Bella.
Walk with me.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're gonna make her drink that?
It's the fastest way to test the theory.
Only if you're comfortable with it.
I'll try anything.
Just hold on. l think I'm gonna be sick.
This might make it a little easier to take.
Tastes good.
Mmm.
Your pulse is already getting stronger.
It's working.
- Well, you sound better. l am. l feel much better.
This whole thing must've put a kink in the honeymoon, huh?
You could say that.
Otherwise, married life treating you okay?
Edward still walks on water and all that?
Yeah, but, l mean, it is different now.
The important thing is that you're better.
And that you're coming home soon, right?
Okay, Dad, l don't want you to freak out, but I'm going to a medical center in Switzerland.
What? No, no, you're not.
You're not going to Switzerland.
What are you... You said you were better.
I am.
No, Bella. I'm getting on a plane. No.
No.
It's really more of a spa.
And I'm sure that I'd be better by the time you got there anyway.
Bells... l don't know.
Dad, don't come.
And picture me healthy, like I'm sitting on the couch with you, eating pizza or something.
You want me to visualize?
They say that it helps.
Just picture me like that.
Like l was.
It'll make me feel better.
Dad, l got to go, okay?
Bella. l love you.
Bella...
I'm sorry I've been so angry. l would be, too.
I've left you alone in this.
Marriage.
Well, they say the first year is the hardest.
Who was that?
What? l thought l just heard...
Just say something else.
Like what?
Edward, what's going on?
He likes the sound of your voice.
You can hear him?
In mind.
He likes my voice as well.
What?
What do you hear?
It's so strange. l thought he was like me, but he's not.
He's like you.
Good and pure.
He's happy.
Of course you are.
Of course you're happy.
How could you not be? l love you so much.
What do you hear now?
He loves you, Bella.
Oh, my gosh.
Jacob.
So, that's the last of it?
Bella could deliver as early as tomorrow.
If she's going to have any chance at all, she'll need more blood.
And you need to feed.
You have to be at your strongest for her.
We need to go tonight.
Carlisle, you're the enemy now.
Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered.
Emmett will come with us.
- That won't be enough.
- We have no choice, Jacob.
If there's anything we can do to save her, we have to try.
-You'd risk your lives for her?
-Of course we would.
Bella's a part of our family now.
Yeah. l can see that.
This really is a family.
As strong as the one l was born into. l know what l have to do.
Jake! They're coming. l know.
We should phase, Jacob.
We can't protect ourselves like this.
They'll see it as a threat. l wanna talk!
Be easier if l could hear you, too.
This isn't your territory anymore.
-How's the new family working out?
-You done?
You coming home, Jake?
Not until l finish this.
What do you mean? l want Sam to take back Leah and Seth.
- What?
- No way!
Quiet! l want them safe.
And l want this over. l need Sam to wait until Bella's been separated from the problem.
You mean till she's dead.
Ease up, Paul.
Then what?
Tell Sam that when the moment comes,
I'll be the one to destroy it.
Jake!
I'm the only one who can.
They trust me.
You played us?
Can't we come up with something just a little more classic?
Thank you.
-They make it out all right?
-Yeah.
Good.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's not like I'm the one carrying a demon.
This is pretty important, Bella.
Why don't you tell Jacob what you've decided?
What now?
Rose is trying to talk Bella out of her baby names.
She hates them.
Well, then I'm on your side no matter what you picked.
They're not that bad.
If it's a boy, EJ.
Edward Jacob.
Okay, fine, that one's not awful.
Why don't you tell him the girl's name? l was playing around with our moms' names.
Renée and Esme.
And l was thinking...
Renesmee.
Too weird?
No, that's not too weird.
It's beautiful.
And it's unique, which certainly fits the situation. l like Renesmee.
He likes it.
Rosalie, pass the morphine.
Carlisle said the placenta must have detached.
-He's coming as fast as he can, but...
-We'll have to do it.
Rose! Let the morphine spread.
There's no time. He's dying.
Get him out now!
Look at me, Bella.
Rosalie, don't!
Alice, get her out of here!
Rosalie!
Ow!
Save her! You've got to change her! l can't, not whilst he's still in there. l got to get him out first.
Stay, Bella. Stay focused.
Keep your heart beating.
No! He's suffocating!
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
It's Renesmee.
You're beautiful.
Hey.
Bella?
Bella?
Bella!
Jacob, take the baby.
Keep that away from me!
Edward.
I'll take her. l promise I'm okay. Let me.
What is that?
It's my venom.
You're okay.
Come on.
It's supposed to be working.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Bella, come on. l won't kill you.
That'd be too easy.
You deserve to live with this.
She didn't make it.
You're not dead. You're not dead.
Come on!
No, it will work. lt will work.
Please, please, please, please.
Come back to me, please, baby.
Bella, Bella, please, please.
Hi, hi. l don't care what he's done.
-He's still my son.
-I'm sorry, Billy. l just thought you should know.
Bella's dead. lt killed her.
Let's go!
It's like gravity.
Your whole center shifts.
Suddenly, it's not the Earth holding you here.
You would do anything, be anything she needs.
A friend, a brother.
A protector.
Alice! Jasper!
You're gonna be all right.
-We're outnumbered.
-By a lot. l won't let them hurt my family.
Stop! It's over!
If you kill her, you kill me.
Jacob imprinted.
They can't hurt her.
Whoever a wolf imprints on can't be harmed.
It's their most absolute law.
She shouldn't be this still.
It's the morphine.
- Maybe l was too late.
- No, Edward.
Listen to her heart.
Sitting pretty uptightly
The knots keep you at my side
Upstairs, in corners
Eyes blink for the crawl
Up and out
My beacon will choke
If yours is taken
I dare four more lines
Four more lines
Sellotape an end to
Sellotape an end
Hover thought
Mosquito
Bite down
My fickle hands machine
Surprises
Sellotape an end to a story that is hanging
Over silence always wasted
Swells with every teardrop
Pulls my threads to kid gloves
Sellotape an end to this
Now I'm the guilty one
Hey!
Give me my sentence
I'll pay my penance
Let me kill them all
And the pain I have for hurting you
I didn't mean it
Ah. It's from Carlisle.
Which is spelt with an "S," Sweet Bianca.
He's added a new member to his coven.
Ah.
Increasing his power.
First it's the spelling, then the grammar.
At least our dispute with the Cullens is over.
-Over?
-Mmm.
Goodness, no.
Our dispute goes far beyond the fate of a mere human.
And what might it be?
Why, brother, l thought you understood.
They have something l want.
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have, we don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
Will keep you by my side
Will keep you from walking out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away
Every day it will rain, rain, rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
If I was in their shoes,
I'd be doing the same thing
Saying there goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
But little darling, watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away
Every day it will rain, rain, rain
Don't just say goodbye
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away
Every day it will rain, rain, rain
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid
To fall
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Took a job
Working late
Jacking cars from out of state
Who's there?
Who's there?
Help!
What do you want?
"Some say the world will end in fire
"Some say in ice
"From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire
"But if I had to perish twice
"I think I know enough of hate
"To say that for destruction ice
"Is also great
"And would suffice"
You know, I've got an English final.
I gotta focus.
Marry me.
No.
Marry me.
Change me.
Okay, I will if you marry me.
It's called a compromise.
Let's just call it coercion.
It's not fair.
Marriage is just...
It's a piece of paper.
Where I'm from, it's the way one says, "I love you."
Well, where I come from, at my age, it's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up."
So, you're worried about what people will think?
You know, two out of three marriages end in divorce.
Well, I think you'll find the vampirelhuman divorce rate is a little lower.
So marry me.
I can't.
I have to be back at 4:00.
4:00 on the dot.
That kid trying to brown-nose me now or something?
He has a name.
Now he's too punctual for you?
Okay.
You understand why you're being punished, right?
I know, I put you through hell.
Yes, you did.
But I have other reasons for grounding you.
Like...
I just want you to get some separation from him.
Dad, there's nothing you can say.
Edward is in my life.
Yeah, I'm gathering that.
So, all right, how about this?
I'll make you a deal.
You're not grounded anymore if you use your new-found freedom to see some of your other friends, too, like...
Like Jacob.
He's going through a really tough time right now.
His dad's really worried about him.
I remember when that was you.
You needed a friend.
Jake was there.
Hey, it's Jake. Leave a message.
Jacob hadn't talked to me in weeks.
I wanted to fix it, he just...
He wouldn't give me the chance.
And tumbling, tumbling
Don't go fascination
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost
If just for tonight darling
Let's get lost
If just for tonight darling
Let's get lost
You scared me.
You're going down to the reservation.
How did you...
Alice.
Hey, did you do this to my truck?
Bella, you have to understand.
Your safety is everything to me.
Jacob's not gonna hurt me.
Not intentionally, but the wolves have no control.
Edward.
I have until graduation to see him.
And then I'll be one of you, and he'll hate me forever.
Well, I'm sorry.
- No way. Stop.
- Throw it away.
- Good.
- Hey.
- Just in time. All right, check it out.
- All right. Let's see, we got.
- "My fellow students." Right?
- Good.
- Cute.
- Right? "We are the future.
"Anything is possible, if you just believe."
Nice.
Perfect.
And you got yourself a speech.
No, this'll be my speech when I want everyone to throw diplomas at my head.
So, thank you.
You gotta embrace the clichés, Jess.
They are the bread and butter of all valedictorians.
And that is why you are not valedictorian.
Jess doesn't need clichés.
The speech is gonna be epic.
Epic? It'll change lives.
I've decided to throw a party.
After all, how many times are we gonna graduate high school?
A party? At your place?
I've never seen your house.
No one's ever seen their house.
Another party, Alice?
It'll be fun.
Yeah. That's what you said last time.
- Hey, Angela.
- Yeah?
Do you need some help with those?
...be sending money
'cause it's the polite thing to do, and then you'll be raking it in.
Wait a minute. People give you money?
I know you know what she saw. Tell me.
It was nothing.
You looked worried.
Just that everyone noticed how strange Alice is.
I think that ship sailed long ago.
I wonder what's wrong.
Their son went missing in Seattle over a year ago.
Charlie's doing what he can, but...
You know something about this?
We've been tracking the situation in Seattle for a while.
Unexplained disappearances. Killings.
If the situation gets any more conspicuous, the Volturi will step in.
If they go to Seattle, they could come here.
They could see I'm still human.
It won't get that far.
But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.
- I'll fax these down, first thing.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You ready for dinner?
- Yeah.
It is still just you and I, right?
No, I'm just dropping her off.
See you later.
Bye.
Bella, my parents wanted to remind you about the airline ticket
- you got for your birthday.
- What airline ticket?
A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.
That was generous.
It expires soon, so you might want to use it this weekend.
Well, I can't just drop everything and go.
It might be your last chance to see her before you graduate.
Might not be a bad idea.
Get out of town for a couple days.
Get some distance.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom.
As long as you use the companion ticket.
Wait. There's two tickets?
Super.
That makes me really happy.
I did want to see my mom.
I wanted to know that her life was full and satisfying.
Aren't you gonna miss this?
Can't you just feel the vitamin D soaking up in your pores?
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.
You know, colleges in Florida are a lot sunnier.
I'm just saying, if you go to the University of Alaska,
I'm never gonna see you.
They have a really great science program.
You mean, Edward program?
The way he watches you, it's like he's willing to leap in front of you and take a bullet or something.
Is that a bad thing?
It's an intense thing.
You're different with him.
He moves, you move.
Like magnets.
I don't know, we're just...
In love. I get it.
I just want to make sure you're making the right choices for you.
You know, 'cause you're the one that's gonna have to live with them.
All right, enough with the heavy.
Mom.
Congraduation.
I didn't want you to spend any of your money.
I didn't, come on.
- Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Get out!
- I saved them all.
I thought they'd make a good quilt, keep you warm up in Alaska.
Remember this one? Ensenada.
- The Snake Pit.
- Yeah.
But this one is my favorite, here.
The three-headed lobster from Maine.
- This is amazing.
- Honey, I'm glad you like it.
I just figured, you know, when you get older, have kids, we can add to it.
Maybe go visit the world's largest ketchup bottle or something.
Thanks.
I'm glad you like it.
Just thought you should have a little piece of me up there in Alaska.
- Mom...
- Yeah?
I miss you.
Honey, I miss you, too.
Are you sure this is where you saw her?
She's almost here.
On your left!
Wait!
She's in their territory.
She'll get away!
No, she won't!
Emmett, no!
Do you regret going?
No.
It was really great seeing my mom.
Just really hard saying goodbye.
It doesn't have to be goodbye.
Is that why you asked me to go?
You thought I was gonna change my mind?
I'm always hoping for that.
What?
If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?
Of course not.
Hey.
Charlie said you left town.
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?
He's checking to see if you're still human.
Look, I'm here to warn you.
If your kind come on our land again...
Wait, what?
You didn't tell her?
Just leave it alone, Jacob.
Tell me what?
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.
It's nothing to worry about.
Listen to you.
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?
You should just leave.
Now.
She has a right to know.
She is the one the redhead wants.
Victoria?
Alice's vision.
I was trying to protect you.
By lying to me.
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...
You.
Why haven't you called me back?
I had nothing to say.
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.
Bella.
Edward, you have to trust me.
I do trust you.
It's him I don't trust.
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.
Hold on tight.
Last born of the clan
First one to be free
Lived inside a house
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I am the vampire girl, remember?
Hey, look who's back!
What up, Bella?
- Quil? You, too?
- Yep.
Finally made the pack.
I'm glad you're here, Bella.
Maybe we can get a break from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.
"I wish Bella would call."
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."
- "Maybe I should call Bella."
- "Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."
All right, you can shut up now.
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.
If you're here to torture Jacob some more, feel free to leave.
Fun, isn't she?
- Bella, hi!
- Hey.
I was wondering when we'd see your face around here again.
Yeah. Same here.
Sam, we good?
We're good. She won't be getting through our line any time soon.
- Cool.
- Yeah, that's right boys!
So when did Leah join the pack?
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.
He's only 15, one of the youngest we've had.
Sam keeps him home studying, but he's chomping at the bit.
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.
Come on, don't be such a guy.
No, it's not a chick thing.
It's, you know, a triangle thing.
We all have to live the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest.
Wolf telepathy, remember?
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.
But Emily was the one.
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.
It's more than some crush, Bella.
Sam imprinted on Emily.
Do I even want to know what that is?
Imprinting on someone is like...
Like when you see her, everything changes.
All of a sudden, it's not gravity holding you to the planet.
It's her.
Nothing else matters.
You would do anything, be anything for her.
Sounds like you know the feeling.
Have you imprinted on someone?
You'd know if I had.
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.
So for now you're still you.
And you're still you.
Yeah.
Until graduation.
Graduation?
You knew this was gonna happen.
Not in a month!
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.
Or before I could...
For a second, just a second, I thought...
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...
I decided this, not him.
Bella, they're not even alive.
It makes me sick.
Better you really be dead than one of them.
I can't believe you said that.
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.
Bella, come on. Please.
I'm sorry.
You know, Edward could at least respect meal times.
I was just with Jake.
Oh.
Good.
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.
- Hey.
- Do you understand how worried I've been?
I was perfectly safe.
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.
- I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, something's wrong.
Edward, what's wrong?
Someone's been in here.
Who was it?
Someone we know?
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.
A nomad passing through?
A passerby wouldn't have left Bella's father alive.
The scent disappeared about 5 miles south of Bella's house.
Someone's orchestrating this.
Victoria?
I would have seen her decide.
Has to be the Volturi.
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.
So we keep looking.
We'll also take shifts guarding Bella at her house.
Another protection detail?
Rosalie.
No, she's right.
You can't protect me, watch my dad and search for the intruder.
And for Victoria.
And keep yourselves fed.
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...
What?
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.
It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again.
We'll handle it from here.
We don't need you to handle anything.
Or anyone.
I could care less what you need.
All right, we're done here.
- No, you're done here.
- Stop!
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?
Edward hated the idea, but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.
In the days that followed,
I got them to at least try to work together.
The wolves took over so the Cullens could hunt.
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.
Doesn't he own a shirt?
I'm good here. You should go.
I'm not gonna be gone long.
Don't rush. You need to hunt.
Maybe rush a little bit.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.
So, what do you wanna do today?
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.
But we're going to a party tonight.
Are you sure this is okay?
I really hate being a party crasher.
Technically, you're a council meeting crasher.
You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.
She took over for Harry when he died.
Okay, I should not be here.
You're okay. I thought...
I mean, they thought it would be good for you to hear the histories.
The histories?
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?
We all got a role to play, and you're part of this.
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.
But you are the first outsider. Ever.
If I had known that, I would have, like...
- I don't know, dressed better.
- Jake!
- Hey.
- It's about time you got here.
Paul's been hoovering the grub, but I saved you some burgers.
Good looking out, bro.
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.
- Hi.
- Newest member of the pack.
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.
And slowest.
- Come on, your dad's about to start.
- Okay.
The Quileutes have been a small tribe from the beginning, but we have always had magic in our blood.
We were great spirit warriors, shape-shifters that transformed to the powerful wolf.
This enabled us to scare off our enemies and protect our tribe.
One day, our warriors came across a creature.
It looked like a man, but it was hard like stone and cold as ice.
Our warriors' sharp teeth finally tore it apart, but only fire would completely destroy it.
They lived in fear that the cold man was not alone.
And they were right.
She took her vengeance out on the village.
Our elder chief, Taha Aki, was the only spirit warrior left to save the tribe after his son was killed.
Taha Aki's third wife could see that he would lose.
The third wife was no magical being, with no special powers but one, courage.
The third wife's sacrifice distracted the cold woman long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.
She saved the tribe.
Over time, our enemies have disappeared.
But one remains, the cold ones.
Our magic awakens when they're near, and we sense it now.
We feel the threat in our blood.
Something terrible is coming, and we must all be ready, all of us.
What did you do to me?
I'm so...
Yeah. I know.
We'll find you someone to drink.
Mine!
Just try not to get killed, will you?
I'm gonna need numbers.
Seattle is in a state of terror.
Police are baffled by the escalating murders and disappearances.
Theories range from a vicious new gang to a wildly active serial killer.
Reporting live...
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.
It takes more than one of our kind to cause the damage they're reporting.
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.
It's newborns.
What, like new vampires?
In the first few months after the change.
That's when we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.
Insane with thirst.
Something to look forward to.
No one's trained these newborns, but this isn't random.
Someone's creating an army.
Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle.
An army of vampires?
And they've been created to fight someone.
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.
Regardless of why they were made, if we don't put a stop to them, the Volturi will.
I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.
Maybe they're behind it.
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.
He wants me and Alice to join him, but he knows we'll never choose him as long as our family's still alive.
An army could solve that for him.
Hey.
Did you eat dinner yet?
No, I haven't.
This kid, Riley Biers, disappeared over a year ago, and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.
You think they should just give up?
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.
Not ever.
I have to figure out what to tell people.
Why I won't be home for Christmases, and why I won't visit, why they'll never see me again.
After a few decades, everyone you know will be dead.
Problem solved.
Why are you so against me becoming like you?
I've told you.
Be honest with me.
There's more.
I know the consequences of this choice you're making.
I've lived through it.
And to let you suffer that...
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.
But to risk yours, just for the sake of never having to lose you, that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.
I thought that you were afraid that I'd be too different.
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm, and I wouldn't smell the same.
You'll always be my Bella.
My Bella, just less fragile.
Gosh, it's so pretty here.
So, Alice has planned a big graduation party.
Which you're invited to.
Yeah, I figured that.
What?
I just wanted to do this differently.
Smoother.
But now I'm out of time.
Do what?
You need to hear the truth, Bella, understand all your options.
And you need to know that I'm in love with you, and I want you to choose me instead of him.
I thought you understood.
- I don't feel that way for you.
- I don't buy it.
What don't you buy?
That's how I feel.
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.
So I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna fight for you until your heart stops beating.
Well, then you're not gonna have to fight for long.
You're rushing into it because you're afraid you'll change your mind.
No, I'm not.
I know what I want.
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella, or say goodbye to anybody.
I can give you more than him.
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you without hurting you.
Feel that?
Flesh and blood.
And warmth.
God!
God!
Edward!
If you ever touch her against her will again...
- Don't do this here!
- She's not sure what she wants.
- Don't do this here!
- Let me give you a clue.
Wait for her to say the words.
Fine! And she will.
Jacob, just go, okay?
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.
Let's take it down a notch. All right?
What's going on?
I kissed Bella.
And she broke her hand.
Punching my face.
Total misunderstanding.
It's just a sprain.
It should heal fairly quickly.
Trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again, Bella?
I punched a werewolf in the face.
Badass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.
Tough enough to take you on.
Don't worry about it.
Got any leads?
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria continues to make appearances.
Go blather to someone else about the joys of becoming a newborn.
Okay...
Rosalie,
I don't understand what I did to make you hate me so much.
Hate...
I don't hate you.
I don't particularly like you, but...
Bella, I envy you.
What?
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.
You have a choice.
I didn't.
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.
I don't care how miserable your human life is.
My life is not miserable.
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.
Mine was.
Absolutely perfect.
There were things I still wanted, to be married, with a nice house and a husband to kiss me when he came home, a family of my own.
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor in town.
I barely knew him.
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.
I wasn't far from home.
There she is.
Hey, Rose!
Come over here! Here. Hold this.
Hey, come over here.
We've been waiting for you.
There she is.
Royce. Royce!
You're drunk.
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.
What do you say, Rose?
- Why don't we take off a few layers?
- Stop it, stop it.
Stop. Stop!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sober.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
- I said, get... Come back... Hey!
- Stop! Stop! Get off me!
- You'll do as I say!
- Let go of me! Stop!
Stop! Let go! Stop!
They left me in the street, thinking I was dead.
Believe me, I wanted to be.
Carlisle found me. He smelled all the blood.
- Thought he was helping me.
- I'm sorry.
I got my revenge on them.
One at a time.
Saved Royce for last, so he'd know I was coming.
I was a little theatrical back then.
Things got better after I found Emmett.
But we'll always be this.
Frozen.
Never moving forward.
That's what I miss the most. Possibilities.
Sitting on a front porch somewhere,
Emmett, gray-haired, by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren.
Their laughter.
I understand that that's what you want.
But there's nothing
I'm ever gonna want more than Edward.
You're wrong again.
After you've been changed, there's one thing you'll want more, one thing you'll kill for.
Blood.
What did I say about a low profile?
Something's coming.
Something bigger than any of us alone.
And if you can't control yourselves, we're all going to die.
What's done is done, just clean up after yourselves.
They've already drawn too much attention.
So has our inaction.
Others may begin to question the Volturi's effectiveness.
Let them.
Maybe we should consult with Aro.
Aro's decisions are being watched.
We must decide.
Then decide, sister. It's time.
Yes, it is.
Either we let them do what they were created for, or we end them.
Decisions, decisions.
When we were five, they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up.
Our answers were things like astronaut, president, or, in my case, a princess.
When we were 10, they asked again.
We answered rock star, cowboy or, in my case, a gold medalist.
But now that we've grown up, they want a serious answer.
Well, how about this?
Who the hell knows?
Yeah!
This isn't the time to make hard-and-fast decisions.
This is the time to make mistakes.
Take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere.
Fall in love a lot.
Major in philosophy, because there's no way to make a career out of that.
Change your mind, and change it again, because nothing's permanent.
So make as many mistakes as you can.
That way, someday, when they ask what we want to be, we won't have to guess.
We'll know.
You made it!
Hey. What did you think of my speech?
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?
- No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
- Yeah?
It's like I was born to lead, right?
I love this song! Let's go.
What are you doing here?
You invited me, remember?
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know, the kiss and your hand.
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing, but it was really just me being an ass.
I'm really sorry.
I brought you something.
A graduation present. I made it myself.
Wow.
You made this?
It's really pretty.
Thanks.
I'll be right back.
- Alice, what'd you see?
- The decision's been made.
What's going on?
- You're not going to Seattle.
- No.
They're coming here.
They'll be here in four days.
This could turn into a bloodbath.
Who's behind it?
I didn't see anyone I recognized.
Maybe one.
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.
He didn't start this.
Whoever did is staying out of the action.
They must be playing with the blind spots in your vision.
Either way, the army is coming and there aren't enough of us to protect the town.
Hold up. What damn army?
Newborns. Our kind.
What are they after?
They were passing around Bella's scent.
A red blouse.
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.
All right. We're in.
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.
I wasn't asking for permission.
Edward?
It means more protection for you.
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?
As long as we get to kill some vampires.
Jasper?
They'll give us the numbers.
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.
We'll need to coordinate.
- Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.
Fighting newborns requires knowledge that Jasper has.
You're welcome to join us.
All right. Name the time and place.
Jake, you don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Bella, this is what we do.
You should be happy.
Look at us, working together.
You are the one who wanted us to get along. Remember?
Again!
It's a graduation present.
They don't trust us enough to be in their human forms.
They came. That's what matters.
Will you translate?
Hey, Jake.
Welcome.
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.
They want to know how the newborns differ from us.
They're a great deal stronger than us because their own human blood lingers in their tissues.
Our kind is never more physically powerful than in our first several months of this life.
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.
A newborn army doesn't need thousands like a human army, but no human army could stand against them.
Now, the two most important things to remember are, first, never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.
And second, never go for the obvious kill.
They'll be expecting that, and you will lose.
Emmett.
Even if they stick to humming
Holding on a song to see them
- Don't hold back.
- Not in my nature.
Sick of, sick of, sick of love
When you went down, the men came callin'
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'
Never lose focus.
When you went down, the men came callin'
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'
One more thing.
Never turn your back on your enemy.
Singing in tones that makes things summer
I got the skills
I'm in love with you
Everything you taught me, honey
It never even mattered really
This song's about my love for you
Some of you are gonna get hurt.
Some of you could get killed because of me.
It's gonna be 100 times worse than this, right?
Done for the day.
Jasper?
Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?
Well, your presence alone, your scent, will distract the newborns.
Their hunting instinct will take over and drive them crazy.
Good. I'm glad.
Hey. How do you know so much about this?
I didn't have quite the same upbringing as my adopted siblings.
- Those bites are like mine.
- Battle scars.
All the training the Confederate Army gave me was useless against the newborns.
Still, I never lost a fight.
This happened during the Civil War?
I was the youngest major in the Texas cavalry, all without having seen any real battle.
Until?
Till I met a certain immortal.
Maria.
I was riding back to Galveston after evacuating a column of women and children when I saw them.
I immediately offered them my aid.
Lovely. And an officer.
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.
- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.
I hope you survive.
You may be of great use to me.
- Maria was creating an army?
- They were very common in the South.
There were constant brutal battles for territory.
Maria won them all.
She was smart, careful, and she had me.
I was her second in command.
My ability to control emotions served her well.
I trained her newborns, an endless occupation since she never let them live beyond their first year.
It was my job to dispose of them.
I could feel everything they felt.
I thought what Maria and I had was love.
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.
I didn't know there was another way till I found Alice.
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.
You kept me waiting long enough.
My apologies, ma'am.
I don't know what I'd have become without her.
You never have to be that again.
Jasper.
I want you to do something for me.
Kill her.
What is it?
The intruder, the newborn army, they're all her puppets.
Victoria.
Alice would have seen if she wanted to make an army.
Unless she's hiding behind them and she's letting someone else decide.
Welcome to the army.
I'm not just gonna hide while you're out taking all the risks for me.
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible.
- Jasper said that I could be of help.
- We won't need your help.
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.
The rest of us aren't gonna have enough to do.
Okay.
Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide or it's so easy that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.
Okay, you're right.
- So I'm coming with you.
- No, we both stay away together.
I can't make you choose between me and your family.
The only way I can protect you is to be with you.
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?
- He's doing it for me, okay?
- Whatever.
Just tell me the plan.
This field will give us an advantage in battle.
We need to lure the newborns with Bella's scent, but it needs to end here.
Edward and I are going to a campsite.
Even if he carries me, they'll still pick up on our scents.
Your stench, however, is revolting.
Dude, you really don't wanna start comparing stinks.
What he means is that your scent will mask mine if you carry me.
- Done.
- This is not a good idea.
Edward, they won't want to get anywhere near his odor.
Okay. Let's just try it.
- Eau de wolf coming up.
- Run.
So you gonna ask me to sit out of the fight, too?
Or don't you care about my safety?
- Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
- I won't have a choice, anyways.
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.
Since you let Sam be alpha?
I didn't wanna be in a pack, let alone be its leader.
Wow.
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.
But every choice has its consequences.
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.
But you can love more than one person at a time.
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.
- Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.
It has to do with feeling something for somebody.
And I know you feel something for me.
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.
I make you nervous.
Jake.
Don't worry.
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again till you asked.
You're gonna be keeping that promise for a while, chief.
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.
- This will work.
- Great.
Yes. Scout's honor.
- Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
- Okay.
- Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.
- Really?
I told your father that our whole family's going camping this weekend, so you and I are having a sleepover at my house.
- Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
- Charlie?
- You guys are on first name basis now?
- Me, he likes.
Actually, you and Edward will have the house to yourself tonight.
Like alone?
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.
You're welcome.
- Hey. You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.
Well, the sister, I like.
Alice. Yeah, she's great.
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I thought you just maybe gave up on the whole institution of it, of marriage.
But do you think there's any value in it?
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.
When you're older.
Much older.
Like your mother.
It seemed to work out fine for her the second time around,
- later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.
I mean, you definitely don't wanna have to get married because you weren't careful.
- What?
- Look, you know what I'm talking about.
There's things you need to think about if you're gonna be physically intimate.
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me as it is for you.
I doubt that.
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.
I'm sure things work the same way.
All right, so...
You guys are taking precautions and...
Okay, Dad, please, just don't worry about that.
Edward is old school.
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.
- Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
- Me, too.
Virgin.
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It seems only fair that I be represented, as well.
It's really pretty.
Thanks.
There's a bed.
I thought you might need one to sleep in.
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.
- Is this too much?
- No.
No, it's perfect.
- I wanna ask you something.
- Anything.
Okay, marriage is the condition for you to change me yourself, right?
Yes.
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.
Anything you want. It's yours.
You promise?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
Bella.
No.
But you said that you wanted me to have every human experience.
- Not ones that will risk killing you.
- You won't.
And everyone says once I'm changed all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.
- That part doesn't last forever.
- I want you.
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.
- It's too dangerous.
- Try. Just try.
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive college and let you buy me a car.
I'll marry you. Just try.
You were searching
For release
You took my hand
Added a plan
You gave me your heart
I know you're pleased to go
Stop trying to take your clothes off.
- You wanna do that part?
- Not tonight.
You...
You mean, you don't...
That's fine.
Believe me, I want to.
I just want to be married to you first.
You really make me feel like I'm some sort of villain trying to steal your virtue or something.
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.
Are you kidding?
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.
It might be too late for my soul, but I will protect yours.
I know that's not a modern notion.
It's not modern. It's ancient.
I'm from a different era.
Things were a lot less complicated.
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls and iced tea on the porch.
I may have stolen a kiss or two, but only after asking your father's permission.
I would have got down on one knee, and I would have presented you with a ring.
This was my mother's.
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you every moment of forever.
And would you do me the extraordinary honor of marrying me?
Yes.
You're not coming with us?
It'll be a last minute decision.
- I told you how it works.
- The Cullens have powers.
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers, but they'll be able to anticipate your every move.
- According to your friend?
- Yes.
My dead friend.
Laurent found out about the things they could do, and they killed him.
But not before he told me.
Maybe he was wrong.
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.
We've been tearing it up and I've never even seen them here.
You don't trust me.
- With my life. I'm just saying...
- I'm doing this for us.
So that we can feed without their retaliation.
I can't live in fear anymore, waiting for them to attack.
I won't let them.
I am going to end the Cullen clan.
I swear.
I love you so much.
You're going overboard.
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.
The newborns'll be frantic.
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.
It doesn't bother me anymore.
Since when?
Since I spent 24 hours thinking you were dead.
You're not wearing your ring.
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.
Or risk Jacob seeing it.
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.
- I just want him to have a clear head.
- Whose head is unclear?
Nobody's I hope.
- Alice says there's a storm coming.
- Yeah, I can feel it.
We should get going.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Something up?
- Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
- Same old same old.
Thank you.
- You should get back before the storm hits.
- No, I'm staying.
You'll need my connection to the pack to keep tabs on what's going on.
- You're not gonna fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.
He's not happy about missing the action but it'll keep him out of trouble.
Let's get you inside.
- I should have chosen a site lower down.
- No, it's fine. I'm okay.
What can I do?
I can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on.
- Forget it.
- She may need her toes someday.
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.
- Get your hand off me.
- Keep your hands off her.
Don't fight.
If she gets sick, it's on you.
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.
Relax. You'll warm up soon.
Faster if you took your clothes off.
- Jake.
- Survival 101.
Can you at least attempt to control your thoughts?
I really get under that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?
What?
Are you doubting her feelings for you?
Nice.
So picking through my brain's okay, but letting me into yours, forget it.
Look.
- I know she's in love with you.
- Good.
But she's in love with me, too.
She just won't admit it to herself.
I can't tell if you're right.
Then let me ask you something.
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.
If she did, would you try to kill me?
That's an intriguing idea.
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.
So you'd just turn her into a blood-sucking demon like you?
I don't want that. I never wanted that.
- So stop her.
- I tried.
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.
Trust me.
You have to consider that I might be better for her than you are.
I have considered that.
I know you can protect her.
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.
But I'm not...
I'm not going to force her into anything ever again.
The last time I tried, it almost killed us both.
Yeah. That I remember.
When you thought she was gone, that you'd lost her, how did you cope?
There are no words.
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.
This might sound odd, but I'm glad you're here.
Meaning,
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."
If we weren't natural enemies and you weren't trying to steal my reason for existing,
I might actually like you.
Well, if you weren't planning on sucking the life out of the girl I love,
I might...
No. Not even then.
But she could still change her mind, you know.
Then I'd let her go.
Right. Hey, Seth.
- Where's Jacob? Did he already...
- Not yet.
He's checking to see if the woods are clear before he goes.
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.
It definitely won't make my list of top 10 favorite evenings.
- You have a list?
- All 10 I spent with you.
Number one is when you said you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.
- You're marrying him?
- Jake, I...
- You knew he was listening!
- He deserves to know.
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...
Don't!
Jake, stop!
- Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!
What can I do?
You can't do anything. I can, by going out there and killing something.
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!
Maybe I'll get myself killed and make it simple for you.
No! Just, Jake, stay.
Why?
Give me one good reason.
Because I don't wanna lose you.
It's not good enough.
Because you're too important.
- Still not good enough.
- Jacob!
Kiss me.
I'm asking you to kiss me.
That should have been our first kiss.
I gotta go.
I'll be back.
- You saw.
- No, but...
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.
I don't know what happened.
You love him.
I love you more.
I know.
It's starting.
Jacob just got there.
He's good.
Someone's hurt?
She's close. I can hear her thoughts.
Seth, go.
She knew we weren't there, but she caught my scent.
She knew you'd be with me.
She found us.
She's not alone.
Riley, listen to me.
Victoria's just using you to distract me.
She knows I'll kill you.
In fact, she'll be glad she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.
He's lying.
She only created you and this army to avenge her true mate, James.
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.
There's only you. You know that.
Think about it. You're from Forks.
You know the area.
That's the only reason she chose you.
She doesn't love you.
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.
You know I love you.
You're dead.
You won't get another chance like this again.
You want her.
You want me to feel the pain you felt when I killed James, when I tore him to pieces, when I turned him into ash, when I turned him into nothing.
Victoria!
Victoria!
Victoria!
- Something is wrong.
- Alice needs us to go.
Now.
- How long?
- A few minutes. Maybe 10?
The pack needs to leave.
The Volturi won't honor a truce with the werewolves.
Leah, don't!
Jacob!
Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.
The bones on the right half of his body are shattered.
- Bella.
- Jake, I'm right here.
- Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
- Leah!
I need to set the bones before his accelerated healing kicks in.
- It's already starting.
- We need to get him out of here.
We're not gonna win a fight with the Volturi.
- We'll take him back to Billy's.
- I'll be there soon as I can.
Hang in there, Jake.
- It's okay. We got you.
- We got you.
They're coming.
Impressive.
I've never seen a coven escape an assault of this magnitude intact.
We were lucky.
I doubt that.
- It appears we missed an entertaining fight.
- Yes.
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.
If you'd arrived a half hour ago, you would have fulfilled your purpose.
Pity.
You missed one.
We offered her asylum in exchange for her surrender.
That wasn't yours to offer.
Why did you come?
Who created you?
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.
I know.
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.
He said our thoughts weren't safe.
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.
Edward, if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria, they would have stopped her.
Isn't that right, Jane?
Of course.
Felix.
She didn't know what she was doing.
We'll take responsibility for her.
Give her a chance.
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.
Caius will be interested to know that she's still human.
The date is set.
Take care of that, Felix. I'd like to go home.
Hey.
- It's been going on for a while.
- Doc's re-breaking his bones.
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.
Give it a rest, Leah.
The worst is over. He'll be all right.
I gave him some morphine, but his body temperature will burn it off soon.
I'll come back to set up a drip.
Thank you.
He's asking for you.
Hey, Jake.
Hey.
- I was worried about you.
- You were worried about me?
Yeah.
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.
- Was he hard on you?
- He wasn't even mad at me.
Or you.
Well, damn.
- He's better than I thought.
- He's not playing a game.
Right.
Bella.
He's not as perfect as you think.
I know who he is.
Can we just not talk about that?
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done at once.
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.
It wasn't easy making you admit your feelings for me.
I only fought them because I knew they wouldn't change anything.
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.
You know I love you.
You know how much I wish it was enough.
Should I come back?
I need some time.
But I'll always be waiting.
Until my heart stops beating.
Maybe even then.
- August 13th?
- Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.
I don't need to be another year older than you.
Alice said she could get the wedding together by then.
I'm sure she can.
There's no rush.
I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.
And so you're gonna let Alice plan the whole thing?
The dress, the reception, the guest list.
I mean, who knows who she's gonna invite?
Does it matter?
I just don't know why you're doing this.
- What? The wedding?
- No.
You're trying to make everyone else happy, but you're already giving away too much.
You're wrong.
This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob.
It was between who I should be and who I am.
I've always felt out of step, like literally stumbling through my life.
I've never felt normal.
Because I'm not normal.
I don't want to be.
I've had to face death and loss and pain in your world, but I've also never felt stronger and more real, more myself.
Because it's my world, too.
It's where I belong.
So it's not just about me?
No. Sorry.
I've made a mess trying to figure all this out, but I wanna do it right.
And I wanna tie myself to you in every way humanly possible.
Starting with a wedding.
Actually, something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.
We have to tell Charlie.
It's highly dangerous.
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.
I'm gonna need that ring.
All the lives
Always tempted to trade
Will they hate me
For all the choices I've made
Will they stop when they see me again?
I can't stop now I know who I am
Now I'm all yours
I'm not afraid
I'm yours always
Say what they may
And all your love
I'll take to a grave
And all my life
Starts now
Tear me down
They can take you out of my thoughts
Under every scar
There's a battle I've lost
Will they stop when they see us again?
I can't stop now I know who I am
Now I'm all yours
I'm not afraid
I'm yours always
Say what they may
And all your love
I'll take to a grave
And all my life starts
I'm all yours
I'm not afraid
I'm yours always
Say what they may
And all your love
I'll take to a grave
And all my life starts
Starts now
I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced a crown
I was a heavy heart to carry
My feet dragged across the ground
And he took me to the river
Where he slowly let me drown
My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
I'm so heavy
Heavy
Heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy
Heavy
Heavy in your arms
And is it worth the wait
All this killing time?
Are you strong enough to stand
Protecting both your heart and mine?
Who is the betrayer?
Who's the killer in the crowd?
The one who creeps in corridors
And doesn't make a sound
My love has concrete feet
My love is an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
I'm so heavy
Heavy
Heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy
Heavy
Heavy in your arms
I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced a crown
I was a heavy heart to carry
But he never let me down
When he held me in his arms
My feet never touched the ground
I'm so heavy
I'm so heavy in your arms
Run, run, run away
So lost, lost
Never comin'
Home rollin', rollin' down a track
No, no, I'm never comin' back
Hot love pumpin' in my veins
Our love, I hope it's not too late
That's the road, that's the load
That's the role
I've been down, I've been down
I've been down
What part of forever
Don't you understand?
I could stay, stay, stay
If that's what you want, want, want
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart, heart, heart
And we could go, go, go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart
Imagine eternity
Doesn't seem that hard
They say nothing lasts forever
We'll have to prove them wrong
I could stay, stay, stay
If that's what you want, want, want
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart
And we could go, go, go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back here at home there's nothing to do
Hey, Yeah, yeah
Now that I'm away
I wish I'd stayed
Tomorrow's a day of mine that you want be in
Oh, oh, ah
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Okay. All right, one, two, three...
Guys! One...
Hold on. Guys, freeze!
Aw!
- Where's Alvin?
- Hey, Dave.
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?
Trying to board the ship.
Already done that.
Also, checked out our room, dibbed the side of the bed closest to the window, ordered us a round of virgin piña coladas and signed us up for parasailing.
Alvin, you're too young for parasailing.
I thought we were going on vacation to have fun.
Don't worry, family vacations are all about fun.
But first we're gonna need to set some rules.
Let's start with you can't call dibs on a bed until everyone's in the room.
- Good rule.
- That's right.
That's a good one, Simon.
All right, so that's our first rule.
Should we go over the rest of them?
Dave, come on. "Rules" is my middle name.
No attorneys to plead my case
Illa racket ships to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
- Hey, Dave.
- Alvin!
- Ha ha! Whoo!
- Whoa. Ahhh! Ahhh! Ow!
This is your captain speaking.
All kids are now allowed to play an the adults-only Serenity Deck.
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
You think you're right, but you were wrong
You tried to take me, baby
But you knew all along
You can't take me for a ride
I'm not a fool now
So you better run and hide
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
Alvin!
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
Yo! I'm the T to the R to the O-U-bull
Rock it non-stop till the mic gets dull
Take what! want when I want, no holding back
When I kick a ﬂow
I'm all up an the track
A to the L to the V-I-N
When I'm in town, me and all of my friends
Gonna come through like a hurricane
Tearing down everything in my way
Alvin!
- We talked about setting rules, Alvin.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't know the agreement meant no fun.
You're allowed to have fun.
When are you going to stop acting like a child?
When are you going to stop treating me like a child?
I'll stop treating you like a child when you start acting like a grown-up!
I'll start acting like a grown-up when you start...
I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tail back and forth
I whip my tail back and forth
- Hey, girls, not now, please, okay?
- Aw.
- Lame!
- Sorry, Dave.
I need to get ready for dinner with the captain.
We're having dinner with the captain?
No, I am. You're staying here.
I have to go apologize for everything Alvin did.
This is so not fair.
Not to us, not to Dave, and certainly not to the captain, who I'm sure was really looking forward to dining with me.
Why don't I go speak with Dave?
See if I can smooth things over.
Knock-knock.
- What is it, Simon?
- Well, I would never say this to Alvin.
Goodness knows he can be totally irresponsible, but I actually have a suggestion.
You have a suggestion for me?
He's been driving me crazy a lot longer than he's been driving you crazy.
All right. So what is it?
Imagine Alvin is a spirited racehorse.
That's your advice?
No. I'm not done yet, Dave.
All right, so Alvin is a racehorse...
And you, Dave, are his incredibly helpful jockey who's there to guide him down the racetrack of life.
But if you hold the reins too tight, that racehorse is going to fight and buck, which is no fun for anyone.
But if you loosen the reins just a little...
He'll fly right off the track and crash into the fence.
I know you want to protect Alvin, but, Dave, sometimes kids will rise to the occasion if you just show them a little trust.
All right, guys, room service is on its way.
Lights out by 9:00.
Dave, question.
If we're going to be held captive in this room...
Because of Alvin!
Can we at least watch a movie?
All right, let's see what's on.
You know what, why don't you guys pick a movie?
You're old enough to make your own decision.
For real, Dave?
Absolutely.
- Ooh! Dave looks so elegant.
- Have fun!
Wait, Dave, before you go,
I made something for you.
Wow, it's really... it's soft so you can sleep in it and I made it with all the colors, so it will go with everything!
Great. I'll put it on after dinner.
You could put it on now, so everyone at the captain's table could see it.
Nice.
A real chick magnet.
All right, guys, have fun.
But not too much fun, because I'm still very upset.
Goodbye, Dave.
And, hello, ladies!
I like my tail shaken, not stirred.
- Where are you going?
- To the casino. I'm feeling lucky.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Dave said...
Dave said, and I quote,
"We're old enough to make our own decisions."
He meant we were old enough to choose a film!
Well, we're clearly not.
Check out what Theodore just picked.
What's wrong with this movie?
It's for babies!
Which is probably why
Dave treats us like babies.
Munk up, Theodore.
There. That's more like it.
Alvin, please!
I say we go to Salsa Night!
In our pajamas?
Oh, I know!
Party rack is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We/ust wanna see ya shake that
Alvin!
Alvin! Alvin!
And we have a winner.
Ellie, I love these dresses!
You're so crafty.
Thanks. it's what I do.
- Ow!
- Oh! sorry!
Ew! What are you?
We are the Chipettes.
- Hi, I'm Eleanor!
My sister was just trying to apologize.
What's she sorry for?
Stepping on my friend's foot?
Or her busted, tired little dance moves?
Oh, no, you didn't!
Oh, yes, she did!
You better get those Lee Press-Ons out of my face unless you want to meet my claws.
And, yeah, baby, they're real.
- Do you wanna go?
- Hit it!
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
Oh, whoa!
Ugh!
Let the music move your feet
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come an!
Captain, I'm really sorry about what happened.
Alvin, he's a kid.
He's just trying to have some fun.
There's nothing wrong with fun.
Our pelican makes sure that everybody on the ship has fun.
In fact, in port, he circles the ship on a hang glider.
It's really quite amusing.
However, my number one priority is the passengers' safety.
Sol simply cannot have Alvin put himself, or anyone else, at risk again.
Believe me, I understand.
If Alvin breaks any more of our rules, there will be consequences.
The last thing we want is anyone getting hurt.
Excuse me.
- Hot!
- Sorry.
Hot!
Unbelievable. Gravy pants.
Hey, he?!
- Do you have a problem with me?
- You bet I have a problem with you.
- Why?
- As if you didn't know.
I don't know.
Ian? What are you doing here?
I'm working, Dave.
This is your job?
Yeah, not too many record labels are interested in hiring the guy who blew it with the Chipmunks, blew it with the Chipettes and passed on Justin Bieber.
Twice.
Look, Ian, I'm sorry you lost your job and your dignity.
But spilling things, hot things, on me isn't going to bring any of that stuff back.
You're right, Dave.
It's too late for me to get my old life back.
But it's not too late to ruin yours.
You want to ruin my life?
Why don't we just start with this vacation?
If I see those chipmunks break so much as one rule,
I'm going straight to Captain Correlli.
You're in my house now!
Although, technically it's not a house, it's a ship.
The point is, I'll be watching you.
Like a hawk!
- Theodore?
- Please don't eat my brain!
Why are you watching Jungle Monster 4.7
Alvin, how could you...
Alvin?
Simon?
Girls?
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- I'll be right back!
- it's dark.
You're up for an International Music Award.
That's fantastic!
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I guess. If you like a lot of adulation.
We fly there right after the cruise.
Hoping to take home Record of the Year.
That would make you the youngest winner ever.
I'm not that young.
I mean, I'm hanging out in a casino way past my bedtime.
Not that I have a bedtime!
No one tells me what to do.
Alvin!
Who's Alan, I wonder?
Anyway
I'd love to chat more, but I've gotta run.
You're in a lot of trouble, young man!
You can follow me on Critter!
Alvin! Alvin!
Simon?
I wasn't betting. Honest.
Your winnings, sir.
Oh, busted!
I didn't sneak out. I mean, I did.
But only to stop Alvin.
- Right.
- There they are, Captain.
Captain.
What's he going to do, make us walk the plank?
There's a plank?
No, there's no plank, but if you guys disobey me one more time, you will be off the ship.
And you'll miss the International
Music Awards. Do you understand?
- Yes, Dave.
- Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
What if we need to disobey you?
And why would you need to do that?
Well, let's say that you tell me to stay put.
"Alvin, if you move from that chair, you're grounded!"
But then I happen to see pirates climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy, from the side of the ship.
Now, it would be easy for me to take my trusty old Swiss Army knife and cut the ropes.
But I have to stay put. Or do I?
Yes, Alvin, you do.
And what are you doing with a pocket knife?
What pocket knife are you referring to?
Come on, give it to me.
You could cut yourself.
So, I could have saved the whole ship from robbage and pilgering and you'd still ground me?
Alvin, there's no such word as robbage.
And it's "pillaging."
But he does have a point, Dave.
There's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our own hands.
I trusted you tonight and look where that got me!
That's probably just the hot gravy talking.
You're all lucky Captain Correlli has allowed you one more activity.
Is it hang gliding, wakeboarding or bungee jumping?
No. Shuffleboard.
Man!
By my calculations, it appears to be 10% shuffle, 90% bored.
That's funny!
Oh, thanks. You really think so?
You know, Dave, I think
I'd prefer the plank.
Sorry, Alvin, but this is what you get to do.
And I get to do something
I haven't done in a long time.
Absolutely nothing.
Brittany approaches her puck, adjusts her stance, looks over at me, quite annoyed, wonders to herself if I'm ever going to shut my mouth, realizes I'm not, and makes her move.
And... Oh!
Oh, it's short!
A costly error, ladies and gentlemen, that's going to haunt her the rest of her career.
You can make all the jokes you want, Alvin, but not even you can make this interesting.
Oh, really? Well, care to make it interesting that I can make this interesting?
Alvin, what are you up to?
Need I remind you Dave is watching us.
Simon, the poor guy hasn't had a moment's peace since he met us.
He's exhausted.
Check this out. In three, two, one.
Lights out.
- Nap time!
Time to turn punishment into funishment.
You get it?
I took the "pun" in punishment, and turned it into "fun," but kept the "ishment." it's word play!
- Uh-huh.
- What?
Hey, kid!
Wanna make a trade?
That's a nice-looking kite.
Yeah!
I can see Russia from here!
Come on, Simon, grab on.
Forget it. All I ever do is try to save him and it only gets me in trouble!
This won't end well.
Simon, do something!
Oh, seriously?
Simon, help!
Alvin's gotten himself in a bind.
Looks like it's Simon saving him again!
Whoa!
Thanks, bro.
- Huh?
- Thank you!
Hack-a-bye, Davey
On the lounge chair
If you awake, you'll pull out your hair
Whoa! Hey!
- Dave! Dave!
- Ow!
- Dave!
- Help us!
Guys! Guys!
No! No! No, no, no! No! No!
Dave! Help us!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You want to go hang gliding, sign up at the Excursion Desk like everyone else.
- Ian, you don't understand!
- Oh, I think I do.
Dave Seville is so special that the rules don't apply to him.
- Let go!
- No, you let go.
Hey! Come on! Great!
Oh, my God!
I need my pelican head!
Help!
- Ian!
- You idiot!
Oh, no. No, no.
Great. Way to go, Seville.
- Me?
- You!
Hey!
Save your breath, Dave.
They'll come back for me.
In retrospect, this was a bad idea.
We're losing altitude!
I don't think I can make it much longer.
I'm so hungry. Just one bite.
No.
- A nibble?
- No nibbles.
Maybe I can just lick the glaze?
The glaze is what's keeping you alive, Theodore!
Its high fat content is creating a waterproof barrier.
I'm gonna starve to death!
Actually, there are many other things that will kill you before starvation.
Dehydration, sunstroke...
An island.
No, an island would probably be helpful.
So if you see one, you should definitely say something.
Uh, Jeanette?
Oh!
We're alive! We're alive!
Good. Because now
I'm going to kill you!
Guys, guys, guys!
Nobody is killing anyone, okay?
No matter how much he deserves it.
Thank you, Si. Though I could have done without the passive aggression.
Look, we've got nothing to worry about.
Dave knows we're gone by now.
He probably has the whole coast guard looking for us.
Meantime, why don't we all just relax and have some donut?
Did you guys want some?
Theodore! Alvin! Simon!
Can't you kick any faster?
It's been two hours, Dave.
Thanks to biannual Pilates classes,
I have legs that won't quit, but they do slow down.
Take those feet off, let me kick.
No quality mascot suit has removable feet.
Take the suit off, then.
- I can't.
- Why not?
I'm not wearing anything underneath.
Look!
No, no, it's okay, I believe you.
No, look!
Look, an island!
Maybe the chipmunks washed up there.
Kick!
Faster! Come on.
Okay, there we go.
It won't belong before a rescue plane sees our SOS and flies us back to civilization.
I don't hear any planes.
Or helicopters.
Maybe Dave is coming in a hot-air balloon.
Because those things are really quiet.
I don't think Dave is gonna be in a hot-air balloon.
But he is coming, right?
Of course he is.
Just maybe not today.
Alvin's right.
We should prepare to stay the night.
What? You guys expect me to sleep outside?
Last I checked, Brit, we're chipmunks.
We're used to living in the wild.
No, we used to be used to living in the wild.
Come on, Brit, it's just one night.
One cold night.
So we'll make a fire. We're always setting things on fire accidentally.
How hard can it be when we put our minds to it?
And how are you intending to do that?
I will create a spark by striking this rock with my Swiss Army knife, which Dave took from me.
I suppose you have a better idea, smart guy?
As a matter of fact, I do, smart guy.
As you can see, the lens concentrates the energy of the sun, thus creating fire!
Whoa. Impressive.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks for thinking that.
Hot, hot, hot!
We have made fire!
So, what do we do now?
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Oh, lord, Kumbaya
Alvin! Brittany!
We've gotta head inland.
If we climb to the top of that mountain, we'll be able to get a better view of the island, see if they're here.
All right, got it.
What are you doing?
- Building a fire.
- What?
You know, one time in the studio,
Snoop ran out of matches, got a blaze going with just two carrot sticks.
Figure, how hard can it be?
Forget the fire. We have to start hiking.
Yeah, okay, Dave.
Look, it's getting dark-ish.
It's gonna be cold. I'm gonna build a fire.
We'll go in the morning.
- No, we'll go now.
Don't take that tone of voice with me, Dave.
I'm not one of your chipmunks that you can just boss around and stuff into a cage whenever you feel like it.
That was you, Ian!
Calm down.
Jeez, no wonder those furballs would rather fly off the ship than spend another day with you.
They didn't do it on purpose.
It was an accident. They're just kids.
I don't know how long they can survive out there.
And you guys were worried.
 Look at us!
We're warm, we got a great fire going, beautiful night sky and if a rescue helicopter comes by, they'll see us!
Everything's gonna be fine.
Good night, guys.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Night.
Theodore!
What? Dave always turns off the light after saying good night.
That fire was sort of the only thing keeping us from freezing to death.
- Yeah!
- Can't you just relight it?
- How?
- With your glasses. And the sun?
Oh.
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
All right!
Way to keep the spirits up, guys.
Doing it, yeah!
- And what is this supposed to be?
- Breakfast!
No, it's bark.
Yeah, for breakfast!
I bet it's very good. it's not.
It's been forever since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.
Crazy suggestion, guys.
Let's get off this beach and let's find some real food.
If I know my horticulture, and I do, this is a grove of mango trees.
Then where are all the mangoes?
Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!
You were planning on sharing that, right?
Of course.
Oh, well, good.
'Cause it kind of looked like you were gonna eat it all by yourself.
What? I would never do that.
I don't believe you!
Hey!
Yeah! Winning!
What?
Well, I'm just out of school
A sting real, real coal
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message that
I've gotta be a wild one
I'll make sure to save you the pit!
Oh, my acorns!
Way to go, Theodore!
Come on, we'll split it.
Don't listen to him, Theo.
He's gonna eat it all by himself.
I'll share it with you.
No. She's trying to trick you.
No, you're trying to trick him.
No, you're trying to trick him by saying I'm trying to trick him.
He's lying, Theo!
- What?
Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have ourselves a ball
Gonna tell all my friends
Gonna tell 'em all that I'm a wild one
Oh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Theodore, I am so sorry!
Gonna keep 'em moving wild
Gotta keep a-s winging, baby
I'm a real wild child
Oh, no!
My precious! My precious!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look at us.
One day on this island and we've become animals!
Did you hear that?
What was that?
- Jungle Monster.
Positions, everybody.
Hold.
Hold.
Fire!
No! Why?
Please don't eat us, Mr. Jungle Monster!
I'm not a monster, I'm Zoe.
And I'm clearly a girl who has been on this island for so long that now she's imagining that squirrels can talk.
We are chipmunks.
Yeah, Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Who and the what now?
I'm sure you've heard of the Chipettes.
We're kind of world famous.
Who?
Maybe this will help.
Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Caught in a bad romance
- Okay. Stop.
- Lame!
I don't know who you are.
Awkward!
Exactly how long have you been here?
Well, I got here on a Monday, so...
Yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?
Nine years? Wait.
You've been here nine years?
Well, it could be eight.
What if we're here nine years?
What if we're here forever?
I told you, Dave's coming.
I used to think that Dave was coming, too.
And he never did.
Huh?
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.
I used to fly cargo planes for them, until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.
- We crash-landed, too.
- Really?
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.
Right, Alvin?
Absolutely.
You mean I'm finally gonna get out of here?
I can't wait to go tell the others!
There are others?
I mean, can you guys imagine being stuck here for all these years without anybody to talk to?
I think I'd lose my mind!
Chipmunks,
I'm pleased to introduce my friends.
This is Rawlings, Spalding, Callaway,
Dunlop, and, right there, that's Nerf.
Hey, girlfriend, you look good.
They survived the crash with me.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Okay.
I'm Theodore.
Guys, Dave is coming to get us!
No, not Dave Henderson. I saw your face!
It's another Dave.
But, you guys, just get excited.
We're finally gonna get off this island.
She's funny.
In a crazy sort of way.
This totally calls for a party.
Who's hungry?
- Yeah!
- Yes, please!
- I'm hungry.
- We are famished.
Yeah? Let's go to my place.
Is it far?
I don't think I could walk another step.
Who said anything about walking?
We're gonna die!
Oh, man! That was so cool!
I know, I know!
Come on. Come on in, guys! Bring it in.
Come on down!
Yeah! Wasn't that awesome?
No, it was not awesome.
It's a miracle we got here safely.
In fact, the odds of a chipmunk getting hurt on a zip-line are one out of six.
Why do I always have to be right?
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ellie, Ellie! Are you okay?
I think I sprained my ankle!
Ooh, you know what, you should put some ice on that.
Oh, no, guys, I don't have any ice.
I live there in that tree.
I thought that maybe you did, though.
No, we don't have any ice.
Just like we don't have any shelter.
Wow, that's a major bummer for you.
- Do you guys like bungee jumping?
- Yes!
No. We do not.
Listen, lady, maybe you should just leave us alone so we can focus more on surviving and less on killing ourselves.
Whoa, that is a lot of uptight in a very little package.
I'm not uptight. I just don't wanna see anyone else getting hurt. Ow!
Criminy. What was that?
You know what, that was just a spider and they live here because this is nature.
It is not just a spider, it's a Phoneutria bahiensis.
Its bite contains a neurotoxin.
Ooh! Mr. Fancy Words. So what?
Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?
Oh. That's not good.
Side effects include changes in personality, loss of inhibition, dry mouth.
Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably twice a day by these little fellows and I am still completely normal.
Yes, normal.
Oh, no.
Alvin? Simon!
Chubby one!
Girl chubby one!
Brittany? Jeanette?
I hope they're okay.
Who cares if they're okay?
I just need them to be here.
And here I am thinking you've changed and don't only care about yourself.
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.
Because right now the rage I'm feeling for you and those chipmunks is the only thing keeping me going.
Shall we keep going?
Ian, just keep an eye out for something to eat or drink, all right?
All right. Right there!
- Where?
- That thing around your neck.
You're not gonna eat this.
This was a gift from Theodore.
That explains it.
I was gonna say, it's really ugly.
Like, really... Wow.
- Ugly.
- It's not ugly.
It goes with everything and it's soft enough to sleep in.
Yeah, and it's edible.
You will not eat my son's necklace.
He's not your son, Dave.
He's just a chipmunk.
Oh, Dave. Where are you?
Where are you, Alvin?
All right.
I'm gonna crash.
Simon. Where are you going?
Who is this Simon you speak of?
Um. you?
No, my name is not Simon. It is
Simone!
That's pretty close to Simon.
And yet completely different.
Would you care to join me on my adventure?
What adventure?
The adventure called life!
Okay.
But just until Dave shows up.
Alvin, Alvin!
Simon and Theodore are gone.
They probably just went to get stuff for the shelter.
It's all the guy can talk about.
Still, it's not like them to wander off like that.
Could you please go look for them?
Why can't you?
I have a situation of my own to deal with, Alvin.
Oh, right. How is Eleanor doing?
Huh? She's fine. I'm talking about me.
It's been two days since my last bath and I am a mess.
I can't get rescued looking like this.
Oy.
Theo! Simon! Simon!
Theodore! Theo!
Si! Theo!
Bonjour, my friend
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?
- His name is not Simon.
- It is Simone.
That's pretty close to Simon.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he's acting totally different.
The spider bite! That's it!
Remember the side effects?
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?
Lies! Who are you?
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.
Au revoir, Alfred.
Alvin. it's Alvin!
Whoo! C'est magnifique, Simone!
Okay, Theo, it's all you.
Really? I've never done anything like this.
And you never will.
How can you let him do this?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking, "When did my dad wash up on this island?"
- What?
- We were having the best time.
Why do you have to show up and be so uptight?
Me? Uptight?
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!
The cool one. Ask anybody.
- Who should I ask?
Come on.
Theodore, you can't bungee jump.
You get scared just watching a movie.
Munk up, Alvin.
A little help?
Ah! Much better.
Jeanette, these dresses are, like, totally adorbs. I die.
Thank you.
And I also made these for you, Eleanor.
Oh, look how handy you are all of a sudden.
And in case you get tired,
I made you a wheelchair.
Oh, super.
J'arrive.
Enchanté, mademoiselles. A kiss.
A kiss. And a...
A kiss.
- What's gotten into him?
- Spider venom.
Yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some sort of fun-loving French dude.
- Really?
- Now he thinks he's...
The most interesting munk in the world.
Simon? Simon.
- Simone?
- Oui?
I think we should get to work on that shelter.
Pourquoi? I cannot imagine a better roof over our heads than the stars in the sky.
What about the kind of roof over our head that's actually a roof?
It's going to rain!
What is a little rain? Hmm?
We cherish the water, for it is the water that nurtures the flower.
- Okay. This is crazy!
Building a shelter was your idea. Yours!
Oh, great. Great!
All right, guys, we're gonna build a shelter.
I need everyone's help. Let's go.
I'll try. But I feel so useless.
- What are you doing?
- What I've wanted to do since the moment I laid my eyes all over on you.
- What?
- Huh?
Hey, you guys are going to catch pneumonia dancing in the rain like that.
I say, hey, I be gone today
But I'll be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing, that I love you
You ought to be careful kicking mud around like that.
Hello?
Someone could lose an eye!
I've been a lot of places all around the way
But I don't want to write a lave sang for the world
No, I just want to write a song
That looks like fun.
Hocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
I say, hey, I'll be gone today
- Eleanor? Would you care to dance?
- I'd love to.
- With me?
 Yes, Theodore!
I can't believe
Jeanette's getting all the attention.
I'm the pretty one.
Jeanette's the smart one.
You don't see me running around trying to be all smart, do you?
I know! I'm the fun one,
- You're the pretty one.
- Yeah!
Do you know how slippery that dirt is?
This is ridiculous.
Are you even listening to me?
Simon!
Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.
No!
Hmm.
What are you doing?
Ugh. Building a shelter.
Since I'm not the fun one any more
I figure I may as well be... the responsible one.
Ew. Really?
Well, since I'm not the pretty one any more, maybe I should build a shelter, too.
Yeah, good luck with that.
What, you don't think I could do it?
Hey, I didn't say that, Brit.
I thought it, but I didn't say it.
So you wanna play it this way.
Alfons-y!
He's so French.
Oh! Be careful, Simone!
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
Now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?
Good thing we don't wear pants.
Okay, you guys, come on, come over.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Of course it's safe.
I do this thing every day.
Oh! Oh!
- Jeanette!
- Jeanette!
Hold on, Jeanette.
- Viens, ma chére.
No, no. Look into my eyes.
You have nothing to fear.
Yes, yes. Very good.
Voila!You are safe. Bravo!
- You made it!
- You're so brave.
Aw!
- Wow.
- Ooh la la!
Pretty.
Whoa.
Double rainbow. What does it mean?
Alive they're superstars, sure. But dead?
They're legends.
I'm talking about tribute albums, pay-per-view funerals.
Wait a second. You actually think
I'm in this for the money?
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks, you're doing a lousy job.
I'm doing this because I love them, okay?
Look, if you wanna spend the rest of your life running around after a bunch of spoiled brats, be my guest.
- They're not brats.
- Really? Even Alvin?
You never even bothered to get to know them, Ian.
I mean, sure, Alvin can be kind of a handful, but he means well.
He's sometimes just a little irresponsible, that's all.
But, come on, Simon?
He's probably the most level-headed kid I know.
If anything, he's a little too uptight.
And then there's little Theodore.
Dave, I barely cared about what you had to say about the first two.
I can't imagine the big-boned one is gonna be any more interesting.
Forget it, let's just keep going.
Yee-haw!
UP, poisson, up!
Ooh la la!
Oh, no. This is terrible.
Shouldn't he have come up by now?
Uh-oh. Simone! Where are you?
Zoe, you've gotta do something.
All right.
Callaway, I need you to go in there and find Simone.
I know you can do it, little buddy.
You're kidding, right?
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.
Simone!
Told you.
I'm sorry if I caused you any worry, mademaiselle.
But I have something for you.
Maybe this will be a way to make it up.
Oh! it's beautiful!
Where did you find it?
Yeah, it is beautiful.
Where did you find it?
In a cave behind the waterfall.
I thought it would look nice on you.
But now I realize even the most precious gem cannot compare to your beauty.
Aw!
Yeah. Were there any other jewels or gems or diamonds or anything else in there?
By the time I found the gold,
I had already been gone from my Jeanette far too long.
Aw!
What?
You guys, they found it. They found it!
And the best part is, they don't even know what they found.
They think that it's just one bracelet.
Which means that the rest of the treasure is mine.
All mine!
What the...
Whoa! What are you?
Hey! Oh!
Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.
You just take what you want.
Drop it. Drop it!
You mess with me, ése,
I'll go loco on you.
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa!
Give it back!
You can sting like a bee or strike like a cobra, but this honey munk don't care!
Okay, Brit, I'm all done.
If you want, I can help you get started...
Whoa!
This tree house is awesome.
Maybe you are kind of the smart one.
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is...
Well, you did your best.
Anyhoo, no reason we can't be comfortable and stylish while we wait for Dave to show up, right?
Brit, I...
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.
You do? Why?
'Cause he's not even looking.
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?
Because I drive him crazy.
You know, the way Simon's been driving me crazy?
I mean, that's what I've been doing to Dave.
For years.
No wonder he hates me.
Oh!
Don't worry, Alvin.
I'm sure Dave will come.
I mean, he certainly loves
Simon and Theodore.
Un, deux, trois
Simon? ls Dave ever gonna find us?
Simon? I mean, Simone?
I'm so sorry, were you speaking to moi?
Yes! About Dave!
Are we ever going to find him?
I see you are sad, man ami.
And I hate to see you sad.
I will help you find your friend Dave.
You really think you can find him?
I know I can!
And then I will find this Simon you keep speaking of!
As Dave and I have never met,
I will need you to describe him for me.
Well, he's very kind and a good storyteller.
Mmm-hmm. Very helpful.
Oh! And he's about this tall.
Mmm-hmm.
Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?
I don't think so.
Then these footprints must not be his.
Jungle Monster!
Do you hear that?
Yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.
No, no, maybe it's a helicopter! Listen!
Face it, Dave, no one is coming to rescue us, okay?
And my stomach noises are gonna get louder and louder and louder until one day they just stop.
Because I will have eaten you.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe no one's coming.
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
Maybe they're gone.
I really messed up.
Dave, it kills me to say this, kills me, but...
Look, man, you're really good with those kids, really good.
They love you.
And I should know because I was really bad with those kids and they hate me.
But, look, you should know that whatever happens, you did nothing wrong. Nothing.
Thanks, Ian.
Come here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Ian?
Ian?
Ian!
Mon dieu!
The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!
Or hungry. Alfons-y!
That means let's go.
Oh.
Ow!
Great, a volcano.
Of course!
That's why the water was so hot!
It's being heated by the underground magma chamber!
- How do you know that?
- I have no idea!
Maybe I accidentally paid attention.
Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike?
Like, I don't know, maybe to the waterfall or whatever?
Not now, Zoe!
The whole island is going to explode!
What?
Guys, we've got to get off this island.
We have to build a raft, now.
"Right now" like, right now?
Or "right now" like, after a hike to the waterfall now?
I've been hit!
By Dave's necklace?
Tell Jeanette I will watch over her with angel wings.
Dave?
Theodore!
Dave? Ha ha!
Told you we'd find him!
Simon!
It is Simone, but I am often confused for this Simon fellow.
Perhaps we look alike?
- Simone?
- Ian!
Hey, you found the chubby one.
Don't worry, Theodore.
Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?
What was that?
That's an active volcano.
Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck.
Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes.
Jeanette, find as many coconuts and mangoes as you can.
Who knows how long we'll be out there.
Who knows how long we'll be out there.
What can I do to help?
- Dave!
- Dave!
Dave!
- You found us!
Hey.
We missed you so much.
I knew you would find us.
Ow.
Eleanor! What happened?
You know, just a zip-line accident.
- A what?
- I'm fine.
It only hurts when I try to explain it.
Okay, you know what, never mind.
The important thing is you guys are safe.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hey, what is it?
I thought you'd never find us.
That you weren't even looking.
Why wouldn't I look for you?
Because I'm such a pain in the...
Alvin.
I know, you don't think I'm a pain.
No, you're a pain.
But I'd come, no matter what.
Arc de Triomphe, mayonnaise, Napoleon.
I get it, Frenchie, you come from a rich history.
Well, guess what, we're all gonna be history if we don't get out of here.
Uncle Ian!
What's he doing here?
It's kind of a long story.
Don't worry, he's cool.
Yes, for a pelican man.
Oh, yeah, nothing cooler than a grown man in a pelican suit.
So, Dave, how are we gonna get out of here?
I don't know, Alvin,
I think you've got this under control.
Theodore, you and Eleanor are on rope duty.
Dave and Ian, we need oars.
Simone, you and Jeanette are in charge of food.
- And, Zoe...
- No, I know, I know.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pack up my balls!
Who's that?
Another long story.
Yeah! Good work, guys!
Let's get off this island.
This raft won't build itself.
Whoa!
Go! Go! Go!
- Heave!
- Ho!
- Heave!
- Ho!
- Heave!
- Ho!
It's incredible, you guys.
Very impressive.
Just seeing everyone come together to build it...
- I just want to say...
It can wait.
Wait, where are Jeanette and Simone?
I hope this is going to be enough.
Did you hear something?
Who can say?
When I am with you, all I can hear is the beating of my own heart.
Oh, Simone!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Somebody! Help!
Jeanette?
Guys! Guys!
Over here! Come quick, hurry!
- Simone, are you okay?
- Simone!
Why are you calling me Simone?
- Simon?
- Yeah.
You're back! It finally wore off!
What wore off?
You were bitten by a spider.
It, like, messed up your brain.
Ah. Is that why I think I see Dave and a half-Ian, half-bird?
No, it's really me. And really Ian.
'Sup?
Simon, where's Jeanette?
She was out here with you.
Jeanette? I don't know...
I do.
It's Zoe. She took her.
Simon, I need to know where you found that gold bracelet.
What gold bracelet?
The one you gave to Jeanette.
What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?
On your date.
Jeanette and I are dating?
Okay, he's useless.
Theodore, Eleanor, you're gonna have to lead the way.
I don't remember exactly how to get there.
I do!
Which way, Eleanor?
Make a left. No, right. No, left!
I thought you said you knew where you were going.
I do! Sometimes I just forget my left from my right.
That way!
Okay, we just have to cross here.
Are you kidding me?
Guys, I can't do that.
But, Simon, you already did.
No, I didn't.
That was Simone, that was not me.
But Simone is you.
He's in there somewhere.
You just have to find him, taut de suite.
Because Jeanette needs you, Simon.
No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft.
If the volcano blows before I make it out of here, you have to promise me you'll...
Leave without you. Got it.
Okay.
Dave.
I'm coming with you.
Absolutely not, it's too dangerous.
Remember I said someday I may need to disobey you?
Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you.
Let's go.
You're not coming up until you have every last bit of that treasure.
But the volcano is about to explode!
Well, then I guess you better hurry, huh?
Run, go, go. In you go.
Get down there. That's right.
Keep going!
S.0.S.
Please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y. O. U. are
Making it hard
I can't help it
See, it don't feel right
Keep moving!
This time, please
Someone come and rescue me
Okay! Pull me up. I can't hold any more.
If you can still talk, it means you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!
Yes! That sounds very good.
Jeanette!
Dave!
They're supposed to be behind that waterfall!
That's right.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Zoe!
- No, no. Not another step.
Don't come any closer.
Are you all right, Jeanette?
I'm pretty freaked out, and those earrings tasted awful.
Zoe, you don't have to do this.
Oh, I don't?
I spent 10 years looking for this treasure.
It's the whole reason why I came to this stinking island!
You mean you didn't crash-land?
They said that I was crazy and they said that this map was a fake.
And now the treasure is mine!
Run!
Jeanette, come on, come on.
Run!
Jeanette!
Oh, no!
Help, help!
Oh, no, help!
You're going back in that cave, and you are going to get me more treasure.
Jeanette!
- Simone!
- It's Simon!
Alvin!
No!
- Hurry!
- Come on, guys, go!
Go. go!
Come on, come on.
Ow!
Look!
Come on!
Run!
But where's Dave?
- Help me UP!
- Oh, help you UP?
Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave?
All I had was my treasure, and now it's gone.
Do you get that? My life is ruined.
And now you're gonna know how that feels.
No, no! it's tempting to blame Dave.
I know. I've been there.
I wish I could get back all those years
I spent plotting my revenge.
All that time and energy, wasted.
All those pizzas
I had delivered to his house, wasted.
That was you?
Not now, Dave! All right?
You could let Dave fall to his death and I could go back to the raft with the chipmunks, become their manager again and make tons of money.
So, really, I'm good either way.
But let me tell you something.
Hate, anger, regret, those aren't just members of a girl group I once signed.
They're what consumed me.
And they're consuming you.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Or not. Again,
I'm good either way, so...
I don't want to sway you.
What are you guys doing? Help me.
Please. Help me save my dad!
Hurry!
I got you, Dave.
Come on! Help me, guys.
Wow!
There they are!
Come on!
Faster!
Hurry! Hurry!
Let's go, go. 90!
Oh, no!
- Get up!
- Hurry!
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!
Run!
Grab the oar!
Come on! Come on, guys!
Paddle!
Come on! Paddle!
Faster! Come on, hurry!
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Now we'll never get to perform at the International Music Awards.
I guess now we're the losers.
Jeanette, I don't know what to say.
I guess I was just so obsessed with finding that treasure that I kind of... I lost it.
And I'm...
I'm really sorry.
We both are.
Well, apology accepted.
Oh.
Really?
Look, Dunlop, this is a new beginning for both of us.
I hope you don't mind.
Simone gave it to me.
Oh, I don't mind.
You know, Jeanette, even the most perfect gem cannot compare to your beauty.
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?
I just wanted to say now that we're not all, you know, dead, sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry I was acting like a child on the ship.
And kind of maybe ruined our family vacation.
Sometimes a racehorse needs a little room to run.
Yes. Yeah. I like where your head's at.
That is very wise, David.
'Sup?
What, no love for Uncle Ian?
- You put us in cages!
- You put us in cages!
Seriously? Are we still talking about that?
New subject, I saved Dave's life.
Okay, but I'll be watching you, mister.
Alvin, you still have that pocket knife I gave you?
Knife? Oh, right, sorry,
I meant to give it back.
I want you to keep it.
Really?
Maybe you can use it to signal that helicopter.
What?
- Hey!
- Down here!
Hello!
It's me, Ian Hawke! Jet Records!
Guys, circle around!
Everything's aka y. We got you, guys!

English - US - SDH
I can take this, right?
Sure.
My doctor says,
"You can't have a garlic knot.
" I mean...
- Really?
- From mama Lucia's?
Your--no, not right now, thank you.
- Whoo. Is she new?
- You've met Jenny before.
Oh, is she Gordon's assistant? Hey, where's Gordon?
Look, if the doctor's telling you not to have garlic knots,
Don't have the garlic knots.
Okay, I won't. -
All right, just take care of yourself, would you?
What do you want to talk about?
There's this investment property
That I want you to see. - Uh-huh.
And in this climate, it'd be an incredible opportunity.
Before I do anything with it,
I want to get your opinion.
My opinion? Why?
Because you have real estate/business acumen, son.
- Acumen?
- Yeah.
We'd have to drive there, stay overnight.
Come on, dad. I don't have time to go stay overnight somewhere.
Where is this place?
It'd be like father and son time, you know.
We could get a chance to talk, Adam.
We don't have enough of that.
I'll call Kristina.
I'll just make sure it's clear with her, okay?
That's all I wanted to hear.
- All right.
- All right.
You're not gonna be sorry.
All right.
You want some garlic knots?
Why don't I take those from you?
No. I'll have as many garlic knots as I want.
Your real estate acumen?
He used the word "Acumen"?
- Yup.
- That's worrisome.
Yeah, I was wondering if he wanted me
To go in on a piece of,
I don't know,
Vacation real estate with him or something.
Then he tried to sell it to me as father and son time.
Yikes.
Hey, speaking of which,
I brought something over
I want you to look at.
Yeah, what's that?
That's great. What about it?
- That's great?
- Yeah.
You don't think it's weird to receive an invitation
To your son's birthday party in the mail?
You're lucky you got invited at all.
Hey, whose side are you on?
There are no sides here.
You just got to pay attention to your kid.
Yeah, listen, I've been spending
A lot of time with Jabbar, okay?
He knows me pretty well now, and he's smart,
So if I don't plan this party,
He's gonna sense that.
Great chair.
- You like this?
- Yeah, high quality.
Look, if you want to be there,
Just, you know, give Jasmine a call
And tell her you want to be a part of it.
She's just sending a lot of mixed messages.
It's, like, half the time she wants me to be the dad,
And then the other half, she's keeping me on the outside.
I just wish she would pick a path and stick to it.
Well, then you should go.
You should call Jasmine and say you want in.
Except you shouldn't use those words.
I don't get it.
Is there a sexual joke in there?
Amber, I'm coming in.
Mom, can you just give me a minute?
I'm showering. - Yes.
Can you give me a minute?
I'm just brushing my teeth.
Hey, do you have the toothpaste in there?
- No, no, no.
- oh, my God!
Hey, Mrs. Bra-- it's just me.
No, you're dead.
Get out! No, not now.
Later.
We're screwed.
Ah! You have got to be kidding me.
Excuse me, but who the hell is that running out of my house?
Amber! Jeez.
- Dad, it's Amber's boy-
- ex-boyfriend from Fresno.
Don't--don't worry about it.
I can't get any privacy.
Why are you being such a tattletale?
Wait-- Damien, the demon seed?
Why is everybody yelling at me?
We got to set some boundaries, Amber.
Calm down, grandpa.
- I'm not yelling at ya.
- Yes, you are.
- It's okay.
- It's my house!
All right,
I'll take care of it, dad.
I know you're mad at me.
What do you mean?
I'm not mad at you.
You're mad at me because of Mr. Cyr.
Because of dating your teacher.
Please, it has nothing to do with that.
And I know you're still mad, and I'm sorry.
It's fine. I don't care.
I'm sorry I went out with your teacher.
It's fine.
We left Fresno, you know, so you could have a better life.
And I pulled you away from a lot of things,
But he was one of 'em.
And then, to have him here in the shower,
I mean, Amber, come on.
Don't screw everything up for yourself
Just because you're mad at me.
This doesn't have anything to do with you.
Not everything I do is about you.
I love him, and he loves me, okay?
Oh, God.
What?
Why do you insist on making every mistake I made?
You know, every time you talk about your life being a mistake,
All I hear is that my whole existence is a mistake
And you... - Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
I don't want to talk to you right now.
Honey, I don't want to leave you so upset.
Please leave me alone, okay?
Please? I don't want to talk to you.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm really sorry.
It's fine, mom!
Please, just leave me alone. - Okay.
I'll come back.
Don't take any rubber bands off, please!
Wait, wait, whoa. Why?
Well, because I've got 'em all counted up.
18 blue,
53 reds,
118 brown. There's too many brown.
And I don't want the brown rubber bands to take over.
I want my ball.
I want my ball! - Okay.
All right, you know what?
Let's go upstairs.
We're gonna finish getting ready,
And we will talk more about this in the morning.
- I want my ball.
- No. No.
Hey, hey. - I want my ball!
Sweetheart, the ball is staying right here, okay?
- Please, I want my ball.
- No.
We will not touch it.
I promise you.
We're not gonna change it. Okay?
I promise.
Now get upstairs.
You know who I am?
I'm sorry.
Your Amber's grandfather,
The Vietnam vet.
Well, Damien, gee,
I'm just sure you're a nice guy,
And everything, but you left your sock in my house,
But you took my granddaughter's innocence.
Here's your sock.
I'm gonna give you a 20,
And I want you to fill up your tank,
And I want you to clear out of here.
And I'm asking you nicely.
What about Amber?
Damien, if this van is within a five-mile radius of my house, I'll know it.
'cause I can smell it.
And then you and I are gonna have a visit,
And I'm gonna spend some quiet time with you.
Do I make myself clear?
Sir, I just want to let you know
That I consider myself a student of philosophy.
Live and let live.
I mean no harm to anyone.
I am an irrational hardass with rage issues.
Don't piss me off.
- Come in, come in.
- Thanks.
What's happening?
- Oh, um...
- Good to see you.
Just--yeah.
I was gonna make some tea.
Do you want some?
- Sure.
- Chamomile or orange pekoe
Or green? - Whatever. Perfect.
- Whatever? Okay.
- Hi, Max.
Max, buddy, aunt Julia just said hi to you.
Oh, did you know that pill bugs and sow bugs
Are often mistakenly thought of as insects,
But they're actually classified in the group called isopods...
He got a new book on roly-polies today.
Hey, buddy, honey, aunt Julia's probably not in the--
Honey. So Adam is not here.
He's at the office. Um...
That's fine. I actually wanted to talk to you.
What's going on?
This is gonna sound stupid.
- Okay.
- It has to do with this ball.
Sydney's obsessed with it,
And basically I just wanted to ask you
If you could tell me about, you know, some of the first signs
That you saw with Max.
Um, why don't you have a seat?
- Okay.
- And I will be right back.
I'm just gonna try to rally him to get upstairs.
What were you guys talking about?
- Nothing, babe.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
- Can you do mommy a favor?
I need to talk to aunt
Julia about something.
Honey, please, I just want to talk
To aunt Julia for a little bit, okay?
Thank you. - Come up soon so I can get
My stickers. - I will. I promise.
Thank you. Okay.
Um, I am 100% sure that you have nothing to worry about at all.
How can you be sure about that?
Well, I'm not sure,
But I don't really understand. I mean...
Okay, she counted the number of rubber bands.
She knows how many of each color there are.
And she's so utterly fixated on it
That she can't make eye contact anymore if you talk to her.
Okay. You know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you Dr.
Pelikan's number.
He's our doctor that we use for Max.
He's amazing.
And he'll be able to tell you if anything's going on,
Which I really don't think that there is anything wrong.
I really don't. - Okay.
I just wouldn't worry about it.
Yeah, I'm--I'm, you know... - Oh, Julia.
- I'll be fine.
- It's okay.
Oh, so stupid. I'm sorry.
It's not stupid at all.
It's not.
I'm a horrible person, honey. - Why?
Because when Julia told me there might be something wrong
With Sydney, part of me felt glad and happy and, like--
- A big part?
- Like I couldn't stop myself.
It was weird. It was like this feeling just came over me--
Well, I think that's human,
And I don't think that's horrible.
What would be so wrong with having somebody else
In the family like Max? - Well, it doesn't feel fair.
Exactly. And he would be less isolated.
We'd be less isolated.
You're horrible too.
You are-- you're horrible too.
You were thinking it.
I'm not horrible.
You're the horriblest.
And those jeans are just terrible.
Why do you think my dad thinks
I have real estate acumen?
I think he's up to something.
Take these instead.
You should have seen your sister's face, though.
She was totally freaked out.
Look at Sydney compared to Max.
There's no way that these kids have the same thing.
Maybe she has a.D.D.
Yeah, or o.T.B.
Off-track betting? - O.C.D.
Yeah, there you go.
Whatever it's called.
I don't know.
I did do one good thing.
What's that?
I didn't tell her
About Max's rubber band ball.
Well, see, you're not horrible.
- I know.
- You're a sweetie.
I am sweet.
- Kaboom.
- Pow.
Let's try that again.
Kaboom!
All right. - Okay, I feel better.
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Now you could make me feel better.
I'll get you the lotion.
- All right.
- Right back. Lotion rub.
Ooh, Batman. What do you think?
We did Batman two years ago.
Does he like g.I. Joe?
His friend had a g.I.
Joe party last month.
Well, I know he likes spongebob.
He loves spongebob.
We did that last year.
Maybe I should have asked for the list of things
That you've already done.
You wanted to come here.
It was your idea.
Well, he's my kid.
I want to plan his party.
I want to be a part of this.
How about this? Baseball.
Think it'd be cute?
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?
Yeah, bravermans love baseball.
- Great.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Paper plates and utensils.
About a dozen.
Okay, wait, a dozen?
That's not even gonna cover my family.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying my family's not invited?
You've seen my apartment.
It's tiny.
Yeah, well, they're his family too.
Okay, so how about you invite four from your family?
I'll just--like survivor.
I'll just pick four.
All right, how many people from your family are going?
- I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know.
Like, 10, maybe 15.
Oh, just 10 or 15.
Fine. Just, will you promise me
That we're gonna have an a's theme party
And not a giants?
- A's?
- Yeah.
Step aside.
Oh, you-- you don't--oh.
This is gonna get ugly.
Sydney is a great kid.
She is playful and cooperative.
Thank you.
What's wrong with her?
Is something wrong with her?
- Julia, just...
- I wouldn't say wrong.
She doesn't test in the norl range.
Sydney is gifted.
- I'm sorry. What?
- She's--
She tests
Way above average intelligence for her age.
Her issues in school are probably coming from boredom.
So iou have to make sure that she's in an environment
Where she is being challenged.
Something that you'll have to monitor over time,
And something that, as parents,
You have to be aware of, pay close attention to.
- I think we can do that.
- Good.
We're driving in the slowest lane.
What are we doing, about 30?
- Hey, I'm driving.
- Not very well.
You're driving in the slowest lane.
Do you remember the trip to the grand canyon?
Yeah. It was a good time.
Yeah. Remember, you vomited all over your mother's head?
You know what, dad, that wasn't me.
That was Crosby.
All right.
Well, go ahead and deny it.
Blah!
You know, I had a little confrontation
With the kid, and maybe I was a little hard on him.
I'm not sure.
Scared the hell out of him.
- All right.
- Do you think they caught
The zodiac killer?
Move over. We got a lane open.
You know what-- dad, dad, dad.
How's the sex life?
My sex life is fine. Why?
That's not what I'm hearing.
You learned to have sex in Vietnam?
Yeah, basically.
Well, I was a kid, you know?
I mean, gosh, those girls could teach you so much, you know.
Just--I was ready to learn.
She's not having orgasms?
So you were okay?
It was all Kristina's fault?
'cause the bravermans, you know, the braverman men,
You know what I'm saying. - Look.
We're strong in the sexual department, son.
Is this embarrassing to you?
Yeah. Yeah, it is a little bit.
- I'm gonna tickle you.
- Get off.
Is this why you wanted to come out here and take this drive?
Because you wanted to talk about this?
No, there's something
I want to uhow you...
Do you want to tell me what it is you're gonna show me?
No, I don't. I want to keep it as a surprise.
It's gonna be very exciting.
Now I got to pee.
How about a rest stop?
What are you, five years old?
How do you unscrew this thing?
Don't pee in the cup.
I'll pull over up here.
Hello?
Who's there?
Hey, miss braverman.
What are you doing here?
Are you kidding me?
If my father sees you...
He hinted that I should wash up,
But then I saw these plants that needed attention.
Damien, listen, you seem like a, you know, an okay guy,
But Amber's from a broken home.
Do you know what that means?
She doesn't know a serious relationship
From a sandwich yet, and the point is
I want her to focus on herself,
On her future, school, maybe even college.
- Yeah.
- There's an old expression.
If you love someone, set them free.
If they come back, they're yours.
If they don't, they never were.
You know what I mean?
It's not that easy.
You're right.
It isn't that easy.
But it would really help her out.
Just for now, you know.
Oh. Oh, boy.
I got this. - You got this.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I got this. Okay.
- I believe in you.
- Kristina.
- How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
I only have a minute.
Can I come in?
- Oh, please.
- Okay, great.
How you doing today?
- I'm good.
- Yeah?
Yeah, thank you. We're good.
We're good.
I just wanted to stop by
And drop off a couple of books for you.
- Oh.
- They were a real comfort to Adam and me.
And I also wanted to tell you the other day
When you stopped by,
I don't think that I fully expressed to you
How I feel about you and
Sydney and your family.
And I just-- I want you to know
That you're with us in our hearts.
Thank you so much.
We love you too, and, no, I knew that.
If you need any-- - yeah,
Kristina...
Yeah?
You know...
We-- as soon as we hear anything...
- You'll call me.
- I will call you.
Exactly. Thank you.
- We don't know yet, so...
- Yeah.
We'll see. Okay.
- I gotta run.
- Okay, great.
You have a good day.
Okay, thanks. You too.
Okay. Bye.
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.
Wha-- - you were so strong.
I thought she took that rather well.
She just went out with Damien
And didn't even bother to lie about it.
That's good, right?
No, it's not good.
In this context, it shows
A complete lack of respect.
Sweetie, you can't live their life for them.
You know?
Really. The best you can do is help them avoid making some of the mistakes you made.
That's about it.
I failed at that already.
You haven't.
Why didn't I just let dad kill him?
I'm out here quoting
Jonathan Livingston seagull
Like an idiot.
You were obsessed with that book.
And Amber liked it too, didn't she?
Why does she hate me, mom?
Daughters hate their mothers.
I think it's a law of nature.
But you know what?
Then they come back.
Sarah...
You're my best one.
Maybe not my best one, but you're the one that I...
Most identify with.
Not perfect Adam?
No.
You're the brave one.
You take risks.
You always took a chance.
You declared your independence pretty early on,
And you went for it.
You have to honor that person.
That you are.
'cause I do.
I mean, maybe I never said it
In, you know, those exact words before,
But...
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, sweetie.
I promise.
Think about this. If you buy it,
How long are you gonna have to hang on to it
Before it pays off? -
Well, that's the great thing, son, is I already own it.
Well, then what do you need me for?
Well, look, before I do anything else with it,
I was thinking what a great opportunity this would be For you, you know, for your company, right?
A new manufactory and a factory,
You know, that sort of thing.
And I was thinking that your company
Could buy it from me for a price...
Adam, when it comes back, this place is gonna be untouchable.
It's gonna be a great investment opportunity.
Who the hell, you know, wants to build a factory
In Thailand or Mexico?
I mean, come on.
You got the savings right here.
Plus, you can hire
American workers.
Now you're into that, right? - Yeah, definitely.
Well, who owns the rest of the complex?
- Office park.
- Sorry.
Other entities.
I mean, some of it's in foreclosure.
That's why the construction is stalled,
But I mean, come on, it's still got--
Still got plenty of advantages.
Hey, you still got that- the camera thing on your phone?
- Yeah.
- Well, okay, come on.
Why don't you take some pictures,
And right over here,
You can take 'em back to the office
And discuss it amongst yourselves
And all of that, right?
I mean, Adam, son, you're looking at some raw space.
- Definitely raw space.
- All right?
You get it? - Yup.
Oh, whoa, that goes right on this wall here.
I thought you said put it here.
So? I want that here.
So you just want to have two things hanging here
And then nothing over there? - Yup.
That's how your family does it?
How my fam-- wait, what are you,
The party expert now?
How many parties have you thrown?
Yeah, whose fault is that?
We are not gonna go there right now.
No, we're doing this right now.
No, we're not gonna do this right now.
Listen to me.
You robbed me of five years of my son's life.
What gave you the right to do that?
I'm decorating, and I'm seeing pictures of him All over the place, and that's all I'm ever gonna see of him At this age. -
That's right.
Well, you should have called me back
Because I called you three times, four times,
And you never called me back.
What was I supposed to do?
- You know, leave me a-
- - leave a message
On your answering machine?
"Hey, Crosby, it's Jasmine.
I'm pregnant. Call me back."
Yeah, anything would have been better than what you did.
You know what, after the third call,
I realized I didn't want you to call back.
I had this big, serious thing to do--
Have a baby and raise that baby,
And what I didn't need
Was some flaky guy in the picture.
Hey, it's my son.
You don't get to just make those decisions.
What do you mean I don't get--
That's my son too.
I gave birth to him, okay?
All of a sudden, now you want to play daddy?
What kind of father takes his son on a play date
And leaves them with a stranger in a pool?
It's not a stranger.
It was a lifeguard.
Yeah.
This is his party. I'm his dad.
My family is his family.
I want his cousins and his aunts and his uncles here.
They have a right to be here.
Hey. I'm talking to you.
Okay. Um...
You--you need to know that, um, my family Isn't exactly inclined towards you.
What does that mean?
Well, my father abandoned us, and they think you're--
You did just, like, the same thing.
Yeah, I didn't know that I had a kid.
How is that similar?
They don't know that.
Wait, they think that
I knew about Jabbar
And that I just blew him off?
It didn't seem to matter.
I didn't think you'd ever be back in his life again.
I'm sorry.
Just invite everyone.
Have 'em all come.
We'll manage.
I have to admit I like when you screw up, kinda.
It makes me feel like we're a little bit more...
Okay.
No, no, hey, hold up.
What are you doing? This is on me.
Dad, I can pay for my own room.
Two rooms? Come on.
That's crazy.
Uh, two double beds?
You have lovely eyes, by the way.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
Manisha.
Manisha. Can you say that?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Ice road truckers. Come on.
Hey, dad, can we just pause with the tv for a second?
I just want you to tell me what's going on.
What do you mean?
With this property.
You know, that place, it's not a great investment.
I wish I thought it was.
And you're a great salesman, but I don't think
You believe it is either.
Long-term it is.
All right, well, then, hold on to it.
I can't, Sonny.
Why not?
You're my firstborn son.
I never wanted to go to you for anything.
I give to you.
Especially now, I mean, with Max.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
I saw this opportunity.
I mean, how the hell was I supposed to know
There was gonna be a bubble?
I had to take a second out on the house
So I could grab it, and then all hell broke loose.
Pops.
Well, I mean, the country's in the toilet.
It's not just me.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Look, you have great instincts.
It's just--like you said, it's just timing like you said.
You know? - Yeah.
Bad timing.
Okay, now, lookit.
Now listen here.
Do you think there's any chance at all
With your company?
Dad, I said I will talk to them.
I will talk to them.
And you show 'em the pictures,
And you tell 'em that it's...
Both: Raw space.
I got it. Raw space.
That's all I can do.
What does this mean?
Does this mean you might lose the house?
I mean, do you need to talk to my accountant?
I have an accountant, Adam.
I'm just trying to help.
Yeah, I know. It's serious.
I mean, would we be here
If it wasn't serious? Come on.
Serious.
Does anybody else know about this?
Have you told mom?
Oh, I can't tell her this.
- You have to tell-
- you can't keep this from her.
Look, I will talk to Gordon.
Okay? - Yeah.
But you have to tell mom.
Okay.
- Want to see my room?
- Sandwich?
Would you like a sandwich? No?
Sandwich? No?
Watching your figure?
Hey, Crosby. I'd like you to meet some people.
This is my brother sekou.
Oh, great.
- And this is my-
- my mother Renee.
- Hi.
- Yes.
Mom, this is Crosby.
So nice to meet you.
Well, so nice to meet you, Crosby.
Sheila, could you help me?
Yeah, um...
- Hi.
- Hello.
Who are all these white people?
The cirque du soleil?
We did see one of those, but--
It's a houseboat.
There's actually a bedroom and a living room
And a kitchen.
It's pretty comfortable.
Well, that's an interesting choice.
Sekou.
That's a beautiful name.
Thank you.
You named him after sekou tarunga,
The African independence leader, I assume.
Now how did you know that?
Berkeley in the '60s, babe.
Oh, I hear that.
You know what,
I'm sorry, this is weird.
I know you're trying and all that stuff,
But where have you been, dude?
Um, I wish I had been here.
Yeah, that's your loss.
Yeah. No one knows that more than me.
You know, I'm just glad I get to be in his life now
And hopefully be a role model.
He has a role model, Crosby.
I've been here since the day he was born.
- Sekou.
- No, I'm just telling him how it was.
I drove him back from the hospital.
I stood at his christening. Huh?
Look, I moved apartments just to be closer to him.
I'm gonna go get the cake.
Sekou, would you help me?
No, I'm telling him how it was, mom.
I would like to say something if I may.
- Dad.
- Are there any more
Of those little corn muffins?
You seem to have a wonderful family.
I've met you, and I like you all,
But why are you treating my son
Like he's a pariah?
The only reason I can think of
Is because he's white. - Dad!
Grandpa, no one--
We think he has Tourette's.
He didn't mean that the way that it sounds.
Stating the obvious.
You know, maybe it's because he's irresponsible.
Renee, that is not my understanding.
Well, there's a five-year-old little boy here
That he hasn't seen for five years.
Um, Zeek, I think I understand
What you're trying to say.
Everyone here is upset with Crosby
Because they feel that he abandoned Jabbar and me.
But he didn't.
What?
I never told him
About his son.
- You what?
- Wow.
Uh, it was just, um, easier For me to lie to all of you
And let you believe that he was just like dad.
Easier for who, you or Jabbar?
Look, um, you know,
I was the one
That chose to have this baby
And not let his father know.
It was me. It was me.
And I'm sorry.
But if you're gonna be mad at anyone,
Just be mad at me.
Don't be mad at him.
Is it time for cake?
Oh, buddy, is it ever.
Yeah, let's eat cake now.
Maybe grandpa Zeek can help us cut the cake.
I'm on top of it,
Renee, I must say.
Is this too much mayonnaise still?
- No.
- Never too much.
Excuse me, by the way, why wasn't Amber there today?
- Um, she...
- She was studying.
Oh, well, I think she should have been there.
Sorry. Yeah.
Did you talk to mom yet?
Hey, Sonny, I told you
I would talk to her. - Okay.
- Kristina.
- Hey.
Um, I'm returning this.
I read it three times.
- You did?
- I did.
I did. - Was it helpful?
- Yeah.
- It's helpful, right?
I had no idea what you guys were facing.
- Well.
- I wanted you to know also,
Just, Joel and I both, we were so moved
By the way that you reached out,
And thank you for that, so... - Oh, my gosh.
Are you kidding me?
You would do the same.
It's fine. - Yeah. Thank you.
How is Sydney? Is she good?
She's good, yeah.
We--we got the test results, and he said that
Her trouble's stemming from boredom in school,
And she tested gifted.
Gifted.
That's great.
That's--what am I- that's really great.
That's amazing. - Yeah.
I was embarrassed to tell you that.
- Julia, no.
- I'm sorry.
- That is amazing.
- Thanks.
That's wonderful.
I'm happy for you and her.
That's great.
Hey, I'm going out.
So I'll see you later, okay?
Good night.
Bye, honey.
We missed ya at the party.
- How was it?
- It was fun.
It was good.
I saved you a piece of cake.
That's nice. Thanks.
I'll have it when I get back.
Oh, no, take it with you.
It's a paper plate.
That's okay.
I'll have it when I get back.
Why won't you take the cake?
I don't want to take the cake.
I'm done trying to control you.
I--it doesn't work.
You know, I'm fine.
Are you?
Sometimes I'm not sure.
I just don't want us to be like this.
I love you so much.
I think I'll just...
Try to get along with you
And...
Trust you.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm meeting Damien.
He's picking me up.
Okay.
See you later. - See you later.
You look like a little baby.
It's all over your face.
So, like, the other day,
I got a "C"
On this test that I was, like, sure that I had aced.
- A "C"?
- It was so weird.
Well, I guess a "C"'s better than a "D,"
And you've had plenty of those, right?
Yeah, I guess.
You know, you could ace whatever you want,
But that stuff doesn't really mean anything.
I mean, after the electrical grid fails,
I mean, who's gonna survive?
Someone who gets an "A" On a test
Or someone who's been in the school of life?
It's all coming down, the whole world as we know it.
Really? That's what you think?
Yeah. I mean, I don't know when.
But I do know that what you get on a report card
Is gonna seem pretty insignificant
When you're living off the land
And fending off "Marooders."
What did you say?
Marooders.
But you know it's marauders.
Marooders.
Mm. Marauders.
No one says that. - Mm, marauders.
- Okay?
- Marauders.
Eat this.
You didn't tell me about your trip.
How'd it go?
Well, it was great.
Was our number one son helpful?
Now, I will tell you something, that kid Adam
Has got a great head for business.
Oh, you can settle an argument we were having.
Now we were talking about trips going to the grand canyon...
Was it Adam or Crosby
That vomited on your head?
It was Sarah.
Boy, you really don't remember, do you?
Well, I mean, there was so much going on.
You know, there's been quite a background of information.
I can't keep track of all of it.
Well, maybe that was because the vomit wasn't dripping
Down your face.
You were too busy laughing.
Oh, you got to admit it was funny.
This is the way it went.
Julia got sick
And threw up in my hair.
She was screaming her little heart out.
And I was trying to comfort her
While wiping puke out of my eyes.
You were too busy laughing to even think about helping.
You did me the big favor of pulling into a gas station.
While you were filling up the tank,
I was in that...
Blech, disgusting bathroom trying to wash the vomit
Out of my hair under the faucet in the sink.
Millie, I never knew it upset you that much.
Would you accept a belated apology?
I'm sorry.
Ha. Sure.
So what else about the trip?
Anything?
Adam, he snores like a chainsaw,
But he's not going to admit it.
What else can I tell you?
- Is he asleep?
- Yeah. The eagle has landed.
Thank God. I'm exhausted.
Well... I found Sydney's ball
Beneath his pillow.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, she gave it to him?
No. He stole it from her.U/
- He stole it from her?
- Uh-huh.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Okay, honey, we have to call Julia and Joel.
Call them. Where's the phone?
Call them and what?
Give it back?
- Yes.
- Oh, screw that.
- What?
- Look, if she's
Such a little genius, she can make, you know,
A thousand of 'em using cold fusion.
- Cold fusion?
- Yeah.
Honey, you have to tell him that this is not okay.
He can't just take things without asking.
- Well, I did tell him.
- Okay. Good. What did he say?
He said he asked her.
- And?
- And she said no.
- So he just stole it?
- Mm-hmm.
What's so funny?
- You are, buddy.
- Is that my rubber band ball?
- Huh?
- I couldn't find
The rubber band ball when you guys woke me up
With the laughing.
Why don't you come in here?
- Well, I asked her for it.
- You did?
You said I just had to ask.
No, I didn't.
You just said you can only have it if you ask her.
- But she has to say yes.
- You never said that.
What you reading about?
Water scavenger beetle.
Emerald click beetle.
What's your favorite beetle?
- Hercules beetle.
- Hercules beetle.
You know how much we love you, buddy?
Hmm? - As much as I love beetles.
What are you smiling about?
Your family is intense.
You think?
That's saying a lot, coming from me.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
I know that wasn't easy.
Yeah, well, I should have told 'em the truth
A long time ago, you know.
I think Jabbar had a good birthday party.
Yeah. Did you notice
That he had three pieces of cake?
Did you notice that he went into a weird little sugar coma
At one point on the third slice
With, like, drool coming down
Mixed with the blue dye? - Yes,
I noticed that.
He's very cute, our son.
I think I'm falling in love.
With Jabbar. - Oh.
- It's okay.
- Good.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.
You look like you saw a ghost.
Good. I was worried for a second.
Why don't you...
Why don't you come join me in the living room?
Okay.
I told Damien to go back.
It had absolutely nothing to do with you.
I hope you're happy.

Do not stop until you reach Tartarus
The horses will run until their hearts give out.
Hyperion will soon have the Bow. Leave.
Forgive me, Father. Forgive me.
I only broke the law to protect the mortal.
No god will ever again come to your aid.
You are on your own!
Do you understand, mortal?
I have faith in you, Theseus.
Prove me right.
Lead your people.
Halt!
The horse I prayed for when I was a boy.
What is wrong with him?
They're dying.
Where are the men?
MAN: They have yet to return, sire.
What does the sight of the bird tell you?
Speak.
The gods.
They came from above.
The gods?
They appeared and laid waste to the men, my king.
The gods.
The gods.
They protected the slave who travels with the oracle.
The gods fight on their behalf, sire.
If the men hear of this, there will be panic.
I know. I know.
ATHENA: In peace, sons bury their fathers.
In war, fathers bury their sons.
Are we at war, Father?
I have important information for the council.
Theseus.
I know this man. Let him through.
I hope you've come to join the fight.
Where's the army?
Tell me about the slave.
He's from your village, is he not?
- Answer me!
- Yes.
He was a peasant.
As was I.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- I meant no...
- Quiet.
And his family?
His mother was raped by some villagers.
Nobody would many her.
He was a bastard.
And his name?
Theseus.
Very well. I'll meet him.
Helios tells me you have information that could be of use to us.
Hyperion is in possession of the Epirus Bow.
- The Epirus Bow?
- Yes, it's a weapon forged by Heracles.
Oh, please. I heard the same stories you did as a child.
There are gods living in the clouds.
Titans buried in the rocks.
Listen, I was a disbeliever just like you are. But the Epirus Bow exists
I understand there are many Hellenics who put faith in the myths and the gods, but we on the Hellenic council do not.
They are metaphors, son. Nothing more.
We are a society of laws based on negotiation and reason.
If you try and negotiate with Hyperion, you will be the death of us all.
If I were to accept your counsel,
Theseus from Kolpos, what would it be?
Seal the gates and prepare for war.
We have Hoplite battalions returning.
We can't seal the gate.
No one will return! We are the last!
I'm sure you'll understand if I don't accept the advice of an alluring palm reader and her peasant lover.
Sir, a Heraklion envoy approaches.
There, you see? No ruler wishes for war.
They only wish to be taken seriously at the bargaining table.
Alert the council. Prepare a delegation.
MAN: Bows!
HELIOS: Stop!
Stop! Remain still, or we'll be forced to fire upon you.
Extend your arms outward.
He bears the olive branch of peace.
HYPERION: My king wishes to speak to the one called Theseus from Kolpos.
Theseus.
Hyperion's envoy desires a word with you.
Like the vision, he sends for you with arms open.
Seeking an embrace of loyalty.
Phaedra.
Have you never been wrong?
We can't protect you beyond this gate.
I am Theseus!
Come closer. I have a message for you.
Don't risk it.
At worst, you lose a peasant.
- Better?
- Uh-huh. Yes.
Why do you cover your face?
All are equal in Hyperion's midst.
I myself am only a vessel for his demands. Nothing more.
- And he asks me by name?
- Indeed he does.
And how does he know it?
There's little the king does not know.
He knows that you have no father.
And like him, you were cast aside by your own people.
Does he know of my rage?
Does he know that I live only to see his blood at the end of my sword?
Does he know he butchered my mother?
Now that he's seen your face, he knows.
You wouldn't make it.
Coward!
Embrace me, Theseus.
They will never give you a seat at their table but you could sit at the head of mine.
Long after this war is over, my mark will be left on this world forever.
The sun will never set on my blood, Theseus.
This is what I offer you. Immortality.
Deeds are eternal. Not the flesh.
The gods may be on your side, but tomorrow...
I unleash the Titans.
What was discussed?
Seal the gate.
- What were his demands?
- Seal the gate.
HYPERION: Theseus.
Ahh...
- That was him, wasn't it?
- I was that close.
I don't know if I can do what Zeus asks of me.
By doubting one comes the truth, Theseus.
The gods chose well.
Sir, there's movement on the front.
What is he holding?
The Bow.
MAN: The commanders are all dead! Fall back!
Hold! Stand your ground!
Hold! Stand your ground!
Listen to me!
Listen!
- Who are you to tell us what to do?
- I am nobody to tell you what to do!
I am Theseus, a common man! One of you!
I share your blood!
And I share your fear!
But to run now would offer our souls and the souls of our children to a terrible darkness!
Hold! We must stand and fight!
Their numbers count for nothing in the tunnel! Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Who are they that we are not?
Just because they scald their faces and scar their bodies... does not mean they are braver or stronger than we are.
They are cowards!
They hide behind their masks.
They are human, and they bleed like you and I.
Listen to me!
Stand your ground!
Fight for honor!
Fight for the man beside you!
Fight for the mothers who bore you!
Fight for your children!
Fight for your future!
Fight so your name survives!
Fight... for immortality!
Let us write history with Heraklion blood!
Ready! Move!
King Hyperion.
We can negotiate. I see no reason...
HYPERION: Theseus!
Here I am! Theseus of Kolpos!
- Where's your king?
- He is no king.
Stavros! The shrine!
Theseus! I'm right behind you!
Phaedra!
Phaedra!
Stay in the shrine.
Hyperion!
No!
STAVROS (MUFFLED):
Theseus, wake up!
Theseus!
Theseus!
Theseus!
I got the Bow!
Stavros.
I got the Bow.
Get out of here while you can!
I'll hold them off!
Stavros.
Go now! I got the Bow!
I'll hold them off while I can!
- Get out of here! Go!
- (CREATURES SNARLING)
Which one of you are coming with me?
None of you will leave this place.
Leave here!
This is no longer your fight.
Find Hyperion.
Die with your gods.
Athena!
Father!
Don't forsake mankind.
What does it feel like, knowing... knowing that there'll be no memory of you?
I have won.
My death will make me a legend.
My deeds... will go down in history.
I'm writing your history.
Do it!
This... is our last embrace, Hyperion.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm the last thing... you will ever see.
Witness hell.
OLD MAN: All men's souls are immortal.
But the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine.
Once a faithless man,
Theseus gave his life to save mankind
and earned a place amongst the gods.
They rewarded his bravery with a gift.
A son. Acamas.
Don't be afraid of your visions, little one.
- What's your name?
- Acamas.
Acamas.
A strong name.
I knew your father.
He was a very brave man.
Soon, it will be your time
My time for what?
The fight against evil never ends, Acamas.
War is coming to the heavens.
And your father will be there, fighting for your future.
PHAEDRA: Acamas.
Acamas.
Who was that, son?
Just...
Just an old man.

I was beginning to worry you had lost your way.
Come, we've saved you a seat.
You bring news, I trust?
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.
YAXLEY:
I've heard differently, my Lord.
Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy...
...will not he moved until the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17.
This is a false trail.
The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that right, haven't they?
[ALL LAUGH]
What say you, Pius?
One hears many things, my Lord.
Whether the truth is among them is not clear.
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.
You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he he taken, the boy?
SNAPE: To a safe house.
Most likely the home of someone in the Order.
I'm told it's been given every manner of protection possible.
Once there, it will he impractical to attack him.
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy.

But I face an unfortunate complication.
That my wand and Potter's share the same core.
They are, in some ways, twins.
We can wound, but not fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him...
...I must do it with another's wand.
Come, surely one of you would like the honor?
Mm?
What about you, Lucius?
My Lord?
"My Lord?"
I require your wand.

Hello.
HAGRID: You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.
What say we get undercover before someone murders him?
HARRY:
Evening.
[GRUNTS]
HARRY: I thought you were locking after the Prime Minister.
You are more important.
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.
FRED: He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.
True enough.
Owe it all to a werewolf, name of Greyback.
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.
LUPIN: Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.
My husband, the joker.
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I--
All right. We'll have time for a cozy catch-up later.
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.
Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.
What's the Trace?
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.
We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect:
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.
That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will he...
...they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one?
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
No. Absolutely not.
I told you he'd take it well.
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, I--
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.
Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.
MOODY:
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They've all agreed to take the risk.
[MUNDUNGUS CLEARS THROAT]
Technically, I've been coerced.
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.
All right, Granger, as discussed.
- Blimey, Hermione.
MOODY: Straight in here, if you please.
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:
It tastes like goblin piss.
Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye?
Just trying to diffuse the tension.
Oh.
Ugh.
[ALL GRUNTING]
BOTH:
Wow, we're identical.
MOODY:
Not yet, you're not.
GEORGE: Haven't got anything a hit more sporting, have you?
FRED:

MOODY: Well, fancy this, you're not you.
Sc shut it and strip.
MUNDUNGUS:

You'll need to change too, Potter.

Harry, your eyesight really is awful.
Right, then. We'll he pairing off.

I wanna keep an eye on you.
- As for Harry--
ALL: Yes?
The real Harry.
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.
MOODY:
You'll ride with Hagrid.
I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.
Seems only right that I should he the one to take you away now.
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.
[HEDWIG SCREECHING]

We'll rendezvous there.
On the count of three.

He's on your right!
He's over there!

HAGRID: They were on us right from the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness you two are all right.
HAGRID: The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush.
GINNY: Ron and Tanks should've already been hack.
Dad and Fred as well.
LUPIN
Here!
Quick. Into the house.
Oh, my boy.
Oh. Oh.
[BOTH GRUNT]
- Lupin!
GINNY: What are you doing?
What creature sat in the corner...

- Are you mad?
- What creature?!
A Grindylow.
[HARRY SIGHS]
LUPIN:
We've been betrayed.
Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight.
I had to make sure you weren't an impostor.
[WHOOSH IN DISTANCE]
Wait.
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.
Thanks.
TONKS:
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.
- I wouldn't he standing here without him.
HERMIONE: Really?
Always the tone of surprise.
We the last hack?
FRED:
Where's George?
How you feeling, Georgie?
Saint-like.
Come again?
Saint-like. I'm holy.
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?
The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for "I'm holey."
That's pathetic.
Reckon I'm still better-locking than you.

Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.
MOODY:

DUMBLEDORE:
This is beyond anything I imagined.
SLUGHORN: Seven?
RIDDLE: Seven...? A Horcrux.
HARRY:
They could be hidden anywhere.
SLUGHORN:
To rip the soul into seven pieces...
HARRY: If you did destroy each Horcrux...
DUMBLEDORE: One destroys Voldemort.
Trust me.
VOLDEMORT:
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.

RON:
Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.
For you?
You think Mad-Eye died for you?
You think George took that curse for you?
You may he the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
It's always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.
Don't tell her I said that.
Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.
They're our only chance to heat him...
...and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.
Tonight's not the night, mate.
We'd only he doing him a favor.
[HARRY SIGHS]
[BAG THUDS]
Dc you think he knows?
I mean, they're hits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...
...he must have felt something.
To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them.
Where are they?
Where do we start?
FRED:
Ready when you are.
[RON & FRED GRUNTING]
ARTHUR: Please pay attention! it's your brother's wedding. Buck up.
GINNY:
Zip me up, will you?
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?
Given everything that's going on.
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...
...because of everything that's going on.
GEORGE:
Morning.
ARTHUR:
Come on, keep up.
All together now.
One, two, three.
How's it looking at your end, boys?
FRED & GEORGE:
Brilliant.
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.
And this is...?
SCRIMGEOUR: "Herein is set forth the last will and testament...
...cf Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...
...I leave my Deluminator...
...a device of my own making...
...in the hope that, when things seem most dark...
...it will show him the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.
Brilliant.
What is if?
Wicked.
"Tc Hermione Jean Granger...
...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...
...in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive."
RON:
Mom used to read me those.
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pct."
"Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump."
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.
No?
"Tc Harry James Potter...
...I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...
...as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance...
...and skill."
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important historical artifact, it belongs--
HERMIONE:
To Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor.
That does not make it that wizard's property.
And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.
HARRY: Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...
...hut you can't fight this war on your own.
He's too strong.
[FOLK MUSIC PLAYING]
LUNA:
Hello, Harry.
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
Of course not. How are you, Luna?
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler...
...unlike those toadies at The Daily Prophet...
...fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime...
...and, in his death, support you just as fully.
Thank you.
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.
He's just too polite to say so.
XENOPHILIUS:
Harry Potter.
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.
HARRY:
Thanks.
I found what you wrote in The Daily Prophet really moving.
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...
...and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.
Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.
Don't despair, Elphias.
I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter...
...in 800 pages, no less.
Word has it that someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.
A monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
MURIEL: My God, boy...
...she's only the most celebrated magical historian cf the last century.
She was as close to the Dumbledores as anyone.
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...
...to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.
Godric's Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot lives at Godric's Hollow?
Well, that's where she first met Dumbledore.
You don't mean to say he lived there too?
The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.
Oh, it was quite the scandal.
Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?

It just popped into my head.
This way.

You're amazing, you are.
Always the tone of surprise.
[THUD]
Ah. That'll be the hooks.
What about all the people at the wedding?
- Do you think we should go hack?
- They were after you.
We'd put everyone in danger by going hack.
[MUFFLED MUSIC

- Ron's right.
WAITRESS: Ahem.
Coffee?
HERMIONE: A cappuccino, please.
- You?
- What she said.
- Same.
Sc where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?
It's too dangerous.
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.
Everyone from the wedding will have gone underground, into hiding.
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.

I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.
RON:
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.
HARRY:

Stupefy!
[SINGING INDISTINCTLY]
DOLOHOV:
Expulso!
[GRUNTS]
Petrificus Totalus.
Go.
Leave.
HARRY:
Lock the door, get the lights.
[GLASS RATTLING]
This one's name is Rowle.
He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.
Sc, what we gonna do with you, hey?
Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?
HARRY:
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.
HERMIONE:
Ron.
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?
It's better we wipe their memories.
You're the boss.
Hermione...
...you're the best at spells.
Obliviate.
HARRY:
How is it they knew we were there?
HERMIONE:
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?
Can't he. Trace breaks at 17. it's wizarding law.
[HERMIONE GASPS]
What?
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.
We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed...
...by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
Right.
Perspective.
We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.
[HERMIONE SHRIEKS]
What was that all about?
Probably Mad-Eye's idea, in case Snape decided to come snooping.
[CLATTERING]
Homenum Revelio.
We're alone.
OLLIVANDER:
I believed another wand--
VOLDEMORT: You lied to me.
OLLIVANDER: It makes no sense.
[OLLIVANDER GRUNTING]
I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.
There must he another way.

[DOOR OPENS]
RON:
Harry? Hermione, where are you?
I think I've found something.
Lovely.
"Regulus Arcturus Black."
R.A.B.
HARRY: "l know I will he dead long before you read this.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it."
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.
Yes.
Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?
[CLATTERING]
[KREACHER GRUNTING]
You've been spying on us, have you?
KREACHER:
Kreacher has been watching.
HERMIONE:
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.
HARRY:
Have you ever seen this before?
Kreacher?
It's Master Regulus' locket.
HARRY:
But there were two, weren't there?
Where's the other one?
[KREACHER WHIMPERS]
Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?
Filthy Mudblood.
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.
KREACHER: Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.
Yes.
It was here in this house.
A most evil object.
How do you mean?
Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...
...hut no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things, including the locket.
Who did?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
[DOOR OPENS]
My father will hear about this.
NEVILLE:
Hey, losers.
He isn't here.
As your new Minister for Magic...
...I promise to restore this temple of tolerance...
...to its former glory.
Therefore, beginning today...
...each employee will submit themselves...
...for evaluation.
But know this:
You have nothing to fear...
...if you have nothing to hide.

They have flesh memories.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.
That Dumbledore had hidden something inside it.
MAN [ON RADIO]:
Many of you are wondering...
...why Voldemort has yet to show himself now that he has vanquished...
...the most powerful symbol of opposition to him and his followers.
MUNDUNGUS [MUFFLED]:
Get off.
Harry Potter, so long it's been.
MUNDUNGUS [IN NORMAL VOICE]:
Get off me.
[ALL GRUNTING]
As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...
- Expelliarmus.
- ...Mundungus Fletcher.
What you playing at? Setting a pair of bleeding house-elves after me.
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.
And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.
You foul little-- Git.
I'm a purveyor of rare and wondrous objects.
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.
Master Weasley, so good to see you again.
Wicked trainers.
[NEWSPAPERS THUD]
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?
Could I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?
KREACHER: You...
HERMIONE: Tell the truth.
When you turned this place over--
Don't deny it.
-- you found a locket, am I right?
Why? Was it valuable?
HERMIONE:
You still got it?
No, he's worried he didn't get enough money for it.
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?
[SIGHS]
There I was, flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...
...when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license.
Says she's a mind to lock me up.
And would've done it too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- NO, I--
Well, she's there. Lock.
Bleeding how and all.
[GRUNTS]
[SNORING]
Right, remember what we said.
Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.
If we do that, then with a hit of luck, we'll get inside.
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.
- Correct.
- Yeah.
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.
The world's mental.
Come on...
...we've got a Horcrux to find.

That's bloody disgusting.

Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a hit.
How long did you say this hatch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?
I didn't.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
YAXLEY:
Cattermole.
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You do realize I'm going downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now, if my wife's blood status were in doubt...
...and the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement...
...needed a job doing, l think l might just make that a priority.
You have one hour.
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.
FEMALE VOICE [OVER SPEAKERS]:

This is you, Ron.
Finite lncantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?

If we don't locate Umbridge within the hour...
...we go find Ron and come hack another day.

Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
Yes.
A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today.
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?
MARY:
I didn't take it.
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You're lying.
Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.

We were there, we were there, but Yaxley had hold of me, and I...

Snape's curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...

Maybe you could tell me now.
The sword of Gryffindor, it's goblin-made.
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
Okay.
Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right?
Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...
- ...in that bloody headed bag of yours...
- Don't you see?
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.
Its blade is impregnated with Basilisk venom.
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.
Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail...
...and perceive clearly that which others overlook.
Yeah, there's only one problem, of course.

The sword was stolen.
Yeah, I'm still here.
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.

- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Not according to you, anyway.
Lock, if you've got something to say, don't he shy. Spit it cut.
All right, I'll spit it cut.
But don't expect me to he grateful...
...because there's another damn thing we've gotta find.
I thought you knew what you signed up for.
Yeah. I thought I did too.
Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.
What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?
Did you think we were gonna he staying in a hotel?
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd he hack by Christmas?
I just thought, after all this time...
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.
I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile.
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.
In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux.
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them.
Ron. Please, take--
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't he saying this...
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

Want to know why I listen to that radio?
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom.

I don't know.
I found something as well.
At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is.
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary.
Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the hook. Somebody drew it.
HARRY: Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Why would someone draw it in a children's book?
Lock, Hermione, I've been thinking.
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.
It's where I was horn. it's where my parents died.
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you.
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost died there.
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd he likely to hide a Horcrux?
It's dangerous, Harry.
[HERMIONE SIGHS]
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.
I think it's possible something else is hidden there.
What?
HERMIONE:
The sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...
...where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.

I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?

With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.
I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub...
...keeping away from some Snatchers...
...and I heard it.
If?
A voice...
...your voice, Hermione...
...coming out of it.
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.
Just my name.
Like a whisper.
Sc I took it, clicked it, and this tiny hall of light appeared.
And I knew.
And sure enough, it floated toward me, the hall of light...
...went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here.
And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...
...and came to this hillside.
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.
I just hoped that one of you would show yourself.
And you did.
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.
How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
Well, just keep talking about that little hall of light touching your heart...
...and she'll come round.
It was true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy...
...hut I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator.
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way hack, and she'd lead me.
Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you?
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.
Took if off a Snatcher a couple of weeks ago.
Don't tell Hermione this, but they're a hit dim, Snatchers.
This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him.
Engorgio.
- Reducio!
HERMIONE: What's going on in there?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
We need to talk.
Yeah, all right.
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?
See this?
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Lock at the signature.
It's the mark again.
It keeps cropping up.
In Beedle the Bard, in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.
HARRY:
It was there too.
- Where?
HARRY: Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.
But what does it mean?
Lock, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...
...hut this, this means something.
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood.
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?
You're not still mad at him, are you?
I'm always mad at him.
RON:
Luna.
HERMIONE & HARRY:
Luna.
[KNOCKING]
"Keep off the dirigible plums."
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.
Could we come in?
HERMIONE: Where is Luna?
- Luna?
She'll he along.
Sc how can I help you, Mr. Potter?
Well, actually...
It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
You mean this?
Yes.
That exactly.
What we've wondered is, what is it?
What is if?
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.
RON & HERMIONE: The what?
- The what?
The Deathly Hallows.
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."
RON & HERMIONE: Yes.
- No.
HERMIONE:
I have it in here.
"There were once three brothers...
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight."
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight"
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.
HERMIONE:
Dc you want to read it?
RON:
No. it's fine.
HERMIONE:
"There were once three brothers...
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.
But being learned in the magical arts...
...the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.
Before they could cross, however...
...they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death, and he felt cheated.
Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.
But Death was cunning.
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic...
...and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.
The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.
So Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby.
The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further...
...and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.
So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.
A humble man...
...he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place...
...without being followed by Death.
And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
The first brother traveled to a distant village...
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...
...he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled.
Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him...
...he bragged of his invincibility.
But that night, another wizard stole the wand...
...and slit the brother's throat for good measure.
And so Death took the first brother for his own.
The second brother journeyed to his home...
...where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death...
...appeared before him.
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.
Driven mad with hopeless longing...
...the second brother killed himself so as to join her.
And so Death took the second brother.
As for the third brother...
...Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.
Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother...
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son.
He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly...
...departing this life as equals."
[SQUAKING]
XENOPHILIUS: Sc there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.
[MUMBLING]
Where's that pen I had?
The Elder Wand.
The most powerful wand ever made.
The Resurrection Stone.
The Cloak of Invisibility.
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
Together, they make one master of Death.
That mark was on a grave in Godric's Hollow.
Uh, Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell Family...
...have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?
Uh-- uh-- lgnotus-- Excuse me. -- and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...
...are thought to he the original owners of the Hallows...
...and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh-- Uh--
But your tea's gone cold.
I'll he right hack.
Let's go down here.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff, hot or cold.
Thank you, sir.
- You forgot the water.
- Water?
For the tea.
Did-- ? Did I?
[XENOPHILIUS LAUGHING]
How silly of me.
It's no matter.
We really should he going anyway.
No, you can't!
[MUMBLING]
HARRY:
Sir?
You're my only hope.
They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing.
Sc they took her.
They took my Luna.
My Luna.
But it's really you they want.
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
[SHRIEKING]
[HERMIONE SHRIEKS]
Stop! I've got him!
[G ROANS]
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?
They kidnapped her because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello, beautiful.
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.
[ALL PANTING]
[HERMIONE YELLS]
[GRUNTS]
[grunting]
[G ROANS]
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...
...hut surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Tell me who possesses it.
The Elder Wand lies with him, of course...
...buried in the earth.
Dumbledore.
[PANTING THEN SIGHS]
HARRY:
The Hallows exist...
...hut he's only after one of them, the last one. He knows where it is.
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.
- Don't touch her. Unh!
HERMIONE: Leave him.
SCABIOR:
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...
Get off me.
...if he doesn't learn to behave himself.
[HARRY & RON GRUNTING]
What happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
SCABIOR:
Check it.
[HERMIONE GRUNTING]
And you, my lovely...
...what do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.
[SNIFFS]
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.
GREYBACK: Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.
How come you don't want us to know who you are?
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.
BELLATRIX [WHISPERS]:
Get Draco.
[GRUNTS AND PANTS]
BELLATRIX:
Well?
DRACO: I can't he sure.
- [WHISPERS] Draco. Lock closely, son.
If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...
...everything would he forgiven.
All would he as it was, you understand?
Now, we won't he forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
Lucius.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Don't he shy, sweetie. Come over.
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all.
We need to he absolutely sure.
What's wrong with his face?
BELLATRIX:
Yes, what is wrong with his face?
SCABIOR:
He came to us like that.
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.
Ah. Got you.
[LAUGHING THEN GASPS]
What is that?
Where'd you get that from?
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.
[BELLATRIX GRUNTING]
[Hisses]
SCABIOR:
Are you mad?
[GROANING AND CHOKING]
Go! Get cut!
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.
I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl.
[BOTH GRUNT]
[DOOR CLOSES]
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.
GIRL:
Ron?
Harry?
Luna?
That sword is meant to he in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?
What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!
[SOBBING] I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.
I don't believe it.
[SCREAMING]
[BELLATRIX LAUGHS]
We have to do something.
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. it's enchanted.
HERMIONE: Please! please!
BELLATRIX: Shut up!
LUNA:
You're bleeding, Harry.
That's a curious thing to keep in your sock.
[HERMIONE CONTINUES SCREAMING]
Help us.
- Let her go.
WORMTAIL: Shut up. Get hack.
You, goblin, come with me.
[DOBBY GRUNTS]
- Aah!
- Dobby?
What are you doing here?
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.
Dobby will always he there for Harry Potter.
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.
Works for me.
Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--
Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
Trust me.
Whenever you're ready, sir.
Sir? I like her very much.
[DOBBY MUMBLING]
Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.
[GRUNTS]
Ow.
Who gets his wand?
BELLATRIX: I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin.
Think very, very carefully before you answer.
GRIPHOOK:
I don't know.
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?
GRIPHOOK: When I was last in your vault, the sword was there.
BELLATRIX: Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
GRIPHOOK:
There is no place safer than Gringotts.
Liar!
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.
The same won't he said for this one.
Like hell.
Expelliarmus!
Stupefy.
BELLATRIX:
Stop!
Drop your wands.
I said, drop them!
Pick them up, Draco, now.
Well, well, well, lock what we have here.
It's Harry Potter.
He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord.
Call him.
Call him.
[SQUEAKING]
[BELLATRIX YELLS]
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Stupefy!
BELLATRIX:
Stupid elf.
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.
Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.
[NARCISSA GRUNTS]
How dare you take a witch's wand?
How dare you defy your masters?
Dobby has no master.
Dobby is a free elf.
And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.
[WHOOSH]
[HARRY PANTING]
Hermione.
You're all right. We're safe.
We're all safe.
DOBBY:
Harry Potter.
Dobby.
[DOBBY GROANS]
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.
Hold on. Lock, just hold on, okay?
We'll fix you.
Hermione will have something.
In your bag. Hermione?
Hermione?
What is it? Help me.
Such a beautiful place...
...to he with friends.
Dobby is happy to he with his friend...
...Harry Potter.
We should close his eyes.
Don't you think?
There.
Now he could he sleeping.
I want to bury him.
Properly. Without magic.
TWENTY-FOUR DAYS before Christmas
This, is what's been worrying me.
Turning sample number 76 from 1300 foot.
We finally found something else than just plain rocks and dirt.
Have a look for yourself, sir.
Sawdust.. Hmm.
At first I thought we drilled into some old tree or something.
But, no.
This level of sawdust is 65 foot thick.
It doesn't add up, it doesn't make sense.
It does.
In the olden days people used to store ice by encasing it in sawdust.
Yea, but what do you mean, what are you trying to say.
This mountain, it's like a giant icebox.
For storing, what?
- Drill deeper and you will see.
- Well, I am..
They're drilling as we speak
- Make sure everyone has one of these.
- What are these?
It's the new safety instructions.
Wash behind the ears.
This is funny shit!
Watch your mouth!
It's Christmas time.
So, let's act like it.
KORVATUNTURI mountain drill site
Hey, someone's coming.
Mr. Green, I think we found something.
Sample number 98.
I think you were right.
Always believe, always.
Gentlemen, listen up.
My dream, since my early childhood
Is about.. to come true.
I can proudly say,
That we are standing on the sacred grave..
Biggest burial mound in the world.
Something's been buried here.
This remarkable place puts even the pyramids to shame.
It took the Saami-People of Lapland centuries to build this mound,
You have 24 days to open it.
Roll up the sleeves, prepare the dynamite, do what you do best!
They're going to blow up this mountain.
We have a grave to rob.
Juuso!
Juuso! Wait!
Santa's been buried.
Juuso! Is Santa Claus dead?
Idiot, you still believe in Santa Claus?
You're such a little kid. Come on already.
- So they've lied to us this whole time.
- At least to you.
What Santa came to our home then?
Piiparinen, haven't you realized that?
Piiparinen? Do you think Dad knows?
Your dad pays him for it.
Don't you understand, kid?
The whole Santa business is a fraud.
The Truth About Santa Claus.
First Santa Claus.
Have you been naughty?
Santa walks barefoot in the snow.
Santa making Christmas-Stew.
1 day before Christmas
Pietari!
Wake up! Wake up, son!
Pietari! Are you awake?
- Yea, yea.
- Then get up, and get cleaned up!
Bad Vuppe. You were supposed to keep watch.
Dad!
Come here, Dad!
Come inside if you have something to say.
I don't want to.
Then go back in the house.
I don't want you outside alone.
For real! I've got something important to tell you.
For real. Wolves are going to eat you,
And I'm not kidding, you hear?
Dad, I'm coming.
Close your eyes, little man.
Your dad's working.
- You shouldn’t have turned off the lights.
- Who's going to be looking at them at night?
- Were you on the roof?
- Wha?
Under my window?
Pietari, I'm too busy to answer stupid questions.
- Were you, or not?
- No, I was not there.
Perhaps the chimney sweep?
Go get dressed, chop chop.
- We've got to go.
- Where?
Don't you remember what day it is?
Oh, right, it's reindeer round up day.
Am I going too?
I'd think you were already dressed.
He's spying on us.
This is yours now.
Is it loaded?
Of course, it's not much use unloaded.
And take off those glasses.
Got a light?
Where is your father?
They had to take the snowmobiles,
Piiparinen couldn't get the chopper started.
Everybody off the fence!
Three, two, one!
Can you even use that thing, squirt?
Of course.
- Are you going to shoot Santa Claus?
- He was outside my window yesterday
I thought you said he's dead.
Try to make up your mind.
- Doing some electrical work?
- You like my handiwork?
Got to try something, there's predators about.
The explosions are driving them crazy.
I wonder what they are looking for.
Some kind of research.
Hey, Check it out.
They're coming.
Dad! Dad!
They're coming!
Our refrigerators will soon be filled with meat.
Open the gate.
Get out from under foot.
Come! Come in, what are you doing there.
- Two skinny little runts
- Something's wrong
Maybe the others have just lost their way?
No, they haven't.
Merry Christmas to you.
- You say here.
- Me too?
Look after Pietari.
What kind of a wolf makes a mess like this?
A big and fucking nasty one. Look at this.
All because of those idiots and their explosions.
Now we've got Russian wolves here too.
They found the hole.
Rauno, it's been cut with forceps.
It's our fault.
Not a word to your father, or I'll kick your ass!
We never went anywhere near that fence, remember that.
- They deserve to be shot.
- They're probably gone already.
They are already gone.
The last few days were very quiet.
Fuck, if it wasn't for the border,
I'd kick all their asses.
You've got insurance, right?
No, we don't fucking have insurance.
Four hundred and thirty three carcasses.
Aimo, how much will it cost?
About 85 thousand.
Plus VAT, twenty two percent.
There's our money, rotting away.
He was very hungry.
So, what do we do now?
Let's go talk to them.
Fuck.
I hear they've paid off the border patrol,
To shoot trespassers on sight.
Crossing the border is a big deal.
Bankruptcy is also no small thing.
Pietari, come on!
This is a shitty idea!
They left in a hurry.
Fuck!
Come see this!
Enlarged area
They found him Vuppe.
Seismic research, bullshit.
They've been digging for something.
What the hell did they find?
That's the end of that.
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to open it?
No.
- Tape these to your butt
- Are you serious?
Do I look like I am?
You look, like you're wearing diapers.
So this is why you called me here?
Look at these.
The real Santa was a bit different, the Coca Cola Santa is a fraud.
These are from a story book.
This one isn't.
- What is this?
- Evidence that some stories are real.
And what should I be seeing here?
The real Santa..
.. Who whips naughty children to death.
Their blood spraying all over..
.. Until there's nothing left of them, not even the bones.
But how did he end up there?
A long time ago, the Saami-People were angry at him,
They lured him onto a frozen lake.
When Santa came, the ice broke under him.
Santa fell in and the lake froze completely trapping him.
When summer came, they pulled up a huge ice block,
They then buried it under several hundred meters of dirt and stones.
- And that became known as Korvatunturi.
- Yep.
You're such a tool!
- When was the last time you got spanked?
- Dunno. When I was little.
Should we tell them?
Listen, kiddo, do you have any idea what your dad's going to do..
When he hears those reindeer died because of you?
- Are you making gingerbread?
- Are you hungry?
Yes.
- Did you play hockey?
- No, just playing make-believe.
Must be a rough game.
Yes.
These are really good, just like mother used to make them.
Glad to hear that.
Dad?
What if I didn't exist?
What do you mean?
If I had disappeared.
You should disappear... into your bed.
It's already very late.
Dad, do you think I've been nice?
Nice boys are already in bed at this hour.
Merry Christmas, Dad.
Merry Christmas, Pietari.
- This is Subzero one.
- Finally!
- I've tried contacting you a thousand times! Where are you?
- We *indistinct* tomorrow.
- Is the cargo ready!?
- No!
We have to cancel the whole operation!
It's not what you think!
- I repeat. Is the cargo ready?!
- Cargo?
Don't you understand?!
It still has a pulse!
Calm down, Mr. Green,
Just follow the safety instructions.
Fuck your safety instructions!
What the fuck?
CHRISTMAS
Stay there, I'll check it out.
Do you think this is funny?!
You nearly killed me!
You're definitely not going skating!
You're grounded for Christmas.
I'm going for a pee.
Come on, Vuppe, let's go out.
Dad!.. DAD!
- What's wrong?
- The bait's been taken
Carefully now.
Stay there.
Did you hear me?
Don't come any closer.
Some bird..
What is it?
There's nothing there.
- Can I take a look then?
- No.
Some kind of a bird snatched the bait.
- I want to see it!
- See what? There's nothing there.
Then why can't I look?
Because we haven't even had breakfast yet.
Hey.. We really don't have anything else?
These are fine.
If I eat all of these..
Then can I go take a look?
Then you take some more.
Are you angry at me?
No.
You wait here.
Did you hear me?!
You're still grounded.
- What the fuck took you so long?
- Had to get ready for the Santa gig
Follow me and keep your mouth shut.
Vuppe, come on.
Serves him right for trespassing, god damned.
Greene, Brian, Jonathan.
Born in -52.
One of those nuts from the mountain.
Under 60 years old.
What are you going to say?
To whom?
People.
Nothing.
You probably are aware that wolf pits are illegal..
God damn you, Piiparinen!
Whether you like it or not, you're involved in this.
- I ought to..
- Be silent,
And think.. If you know how.
I have exactly one hour, before my first Santa gig.
Vuppe, stay.
Did you see?
He's breathing.
Tough old guy.
What's he doing?
He's scenting something.
Pietari.
Pietari!
I told you to stay inside!
Pietari!
Get back here right now!
- Did he see?
- Well, what do you think?
Hey, I've gotta get to work.
What do I do with that one?
Chitchat with him.
Shit!
Pietari, Pietari. God damned.
What is he up to?
- Afternoon.
- Hello
- What he hell sort of a dress are you wearing?
- What?
- Is everything all right?
- What do you mean?
Horrible ghostly figure...
.. Been going around town.
Strange things have happened.
Everything's fine with us, isn't that right Pietari?
Then you're an exception.
I see the whole murder squad showed up.
- What's messed up here then?
- My side-business.
Couple of hundred sacks of potatoes, the whole harvest.
I'm here for potatoes?
Yes!.. And no.
They just took the bags.
Holy hell..
Last night nearly every house got their heaters stolen.
Ripped right out of the walls.
It's going to be a damn cold Christmas.
Inkeri's hair blower was stolen from the bathroom.
Who would need all that old crap?
Listen. Our junk is high tech to the Russians.
- Pietari, shouldn't we be heading home now?
- No.
- Where's Juuso?
- Probably still asleep
Pietari!
Not so fast.
Let's take a look at your car.
Juuso.
Juuso, wake up. He's at our place now.
Juuso?
Juuso has been taken!
- What's this?
- It was in Juuso's bed.
Maybe he's snuck out to see a girl.
When I was your age, we used to make a building out of pillows and..
- Pretended it's...
- He'll probably be home by nightfall.
- You still don't understand?
- Pietari! Nobody wants to listen to your nonsense.
- Now I can go?
- Yes, go.
Aimo, you speak English, right?
Why?
We need a translator.
Oh shit.
Old devil.
Gingerbread?
So, who am I translating for?
I have other things to do.
We have guests from Korvantunturi.
- What kind of guests?
- American guests.
Get inside now.
- But dad, we have to help Juuso!
- Nonsense, Juuso is a big boy.
Well?
You can not go there, he's not human.
- Not a human?
- Not human!
- He bit me, damned!
- Well, well..
- This I have to see.
- No, really, don't..
Look at that.
There's something about him, something odd.
- Am I right?
- He's foreign..
Go talk to him.
Be careful.
How do you like the land of the Northern Lights?
I'm not going there alone.
Understood.
Cover me.
This does nothing.
Wake up, Grandpa!
We need money.
Pietari here, hi. Sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve, but is Hemppa home?
Oh, he isn't... Well, thanks anyway.
No, haven't seen.
Oh, and Merry Christmas to you. Bye.
Give me the broom.
Where are your friends?
Ask him what they dug out of the mountain.
What did you dig inside the mountain?
Pretending to be deaf; old trick.
Tell him, we're keeping him here until someone pays.
- Like, as a hostage?
- Yes!
Explain!
We keep you here 'til somebody pay.
- You're going to make him mad!
- He doesn't understand.
This is just the first phase.
Last chance, asshole,
Rauno here will ask the next question; he don't speak English.
- What the fuck was that?
- Dad!
Oh no, what does he want now?
Dad, we need to talk.
Pietari. Piiparinen and I are in the middle of something. What is it?
Spank me.
- Wha?
- I need to get spanked.
Fifteen good strokes ought to do it.
What is wrong with you?
I've been naughty.
What have you done?
We went to Korvatunturi even after you told me not to.
Juuso and I made the hole in the fence.
You did what?
I'm the last one.
Everyone else has been taken, Juuso too.
What is this nonsense?
They took all of the children.
Rauno, you gotta see this.
Wait for me here.
He's up to something.
See? He bit through this.
Look at his eyes.
What is he seeing?
Pietari!
No!
Do you know this guy?
Looks like he knows you.
He knows all the children in the world.
Who is he? Answer me!
He's been spying on us the whole time.
What do you mean?
Speak up!
He's Santa Claus.
He came to get me.
They dug him out at Korvatunturi.
A god damn fantastical creature!
I knew there was something odd about him!
- He's coming right for us!
- Dad, don't let him take me!
Get on the ground! Tell him..
Translate it for him!.. Get down on the ground!
Down boy!
Go down!
He has his own language.
- He is not afraid of you, Dad!
- Yes, he is
Tie him up.
- I'm not touching it.
- Right now!
What was that?
Subzero One, do you read me?
It's coming from the jacket.
Be careful.
Mr. Green? Is everything okay?
- We are landing in 30 Minutes.
- What did she say?
They want him back.
Mr. Green?
Is Santa ready to fly?
- I'm right, aren't I?
- What are you going to do?
This is Rauno.
Rauno from Finland.
We have Santa Claus.
Who is this?
Where is Mr. Green?
Tell them that we have Santa for sale.
How much are you going to ask for it?
- Enough to cover my debts.
- At least.
- We should think about this.
- Are you afraid?
We're giving it up way too easy.
Think about how much it might cost.
A real Santa Claus.
Someone is going to get rich from it.
That's what we're doing.
- Dad!
- Stay here, this won't take long.
- It's Inkeri's hair dryer!
- What the fuck?
Put the fucking thing away,
And try to look like you mean business.
Fucking little midget.
Who are you?
Where are my men?
- Say something.
- Yea, yea; we are men.
Let's do business.
Business?
What kind of business?
What do you want?
- How much do we want?
-85 thousand.
85 thousand dollars.
- At minimum a million.
- You shut up.
Hey. Where is the cargo?
The last door..
Shh, put down your weapons and smile..
As nice as you can.
Move slowly and do exactly as I say.
- What did he say?
- We need to stay quiet.
This is not Santa.
What?
It's one of Santa's little helpers.
- What... fucking helper?
- He says it's an elf.
Enough of that bullshit, show me the money!
God damned. Santa is going to find out who is naughty or nice.
What happened to him?
Is someone there?
What the fuck is that thing running there?
What the hell is happening here?
They're protecting their master.
Pietari!
Pietari!
The Elves have built a nest for it.
.. For what?
- Is that..?
- Yes.
They're trying to defrost it.
- Dad.
- Shh, that was that?
Help, Daddy!
Juuso. They are all here.
And about to get spanked.
Juuso, where are you?
- Kill the heaters!
- Juuso, say something!
- Piiparinen, the door won't hold!
- What should I do?
Pile stuff at the door!
We need to barricade it!
Hurry!
Aimo, leave the brat there and come help us!
My son.
- Daddy, I want to go home!
- We're all right, we're going home soon.
We're all going to die!
Dad!
Aimo!
Piiparinen!
Listen to me!
As long as Santa is here,
The elves will not leave kids alone.
It's either me, or Santa;
I suggest Santa.
This is Piiparinen.
Pietari, you read me?
Pietari, read you fine.
- Ready for takeoff.
- Roger.
- Why do I have to be in the sack?
- Because it's my plan! Let's go.
- Here's another one.
- Not Juuso.
All of the children must be together, otherwise this won't work.
I'm scared, Dad.
Piiparinen!
The package is ready!
- Aren't you going to get cold out there?
- You stay out of this!
Dad, don't worry, everything will be fine!
Cleared for takeoff!
You take care of your part,
I'll take care of this!
Slow down!
We'll wait for them here!
Piiparinen, look down!
I can't believe it, they're following us.
What did I say.
Piiparinen, let's turn back.
- What?
- Let's fly to the corral!
What do you mean?
Pretend they're reindeer!
Reindeer?
Fuck yea!
That's what we're going to do!
I guess we were a bit Naughty.
If you ever wondered, Aimo, how Santa manages to visit thousands..
Of places simultaneously; this is how.
Magic of Christmas.
Piiparinen, the gate is closed!
God damned.
We have to think of something else.
There's no time, I'll open the gate!
You're not going anywhere!
I can not land there to pick you back up.
I'm not coming back.
Pietari? Do you hear me?
Pietari!
Piiparinen!
Tell Daddy what I did!
Dad..
A peaceful Christmas to all..
And a fucking banging New Year.
Feast your eyes on that, bastards!
What happened?
A Christmas miracle.
Congratulations, Pietari!
You just made all the elves unemployed.
Take the kids home, it's way past their bedtime.
Roger, and out.
One hundred and ninety eight Santa Clauses.
Do the math Juuso, how much will it cost?
How much for one?
Eighty-Five thousand.
About 16.800.000, something like that.
Plus VAT, twenty two percent.
- You're quite a guy.
- You too.
312 days until Christmas
Seventy-Six days before Christmas
There's nothing for you there, caveman!
TWENTY-FOUR DAYS before Christmas
Take them into the forest now.
You stay here.
I'll be back soon.
- Wait!
- No!
I said, stay here!
Father! Wait!
Help us! Please!
Hello! Is anybody there?
Eat!
- Eat!
Eat!
Eat!
This oven's not hot enough!
More wood!
What?
Is it hot enough for you now, bitch?
My sister and I never saw our parents again.
It was just the two of us.
But we learned a couple of things while trapped in that house.
One: Never walk into a house made of candy.
And two: If you're gonna kill a witch,
set her ass on fire.
Fresh milk! Fresh milk for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!
After weeks of living in fear, we have finally caught the one responsible for all this terror!
For crimes against the city and people of Augsburg, and for consorting with the spawn of Satan,
I hereby accuse this woman of the craft of witchery!
Burn her! Burn her!
Behold the eyes of the demon.
Go to hell.
Order!
Order!
Berringer, this is still my town.
Listen to me.
As your mayor, I know only too well that many of you have lost precious loved ones to this witch plague, but we can't just burn this woman.
We first need evidence.
We can't just have...
You know a witch when you see one!
They ride at night and they make pacts with the devil!
This woman will burn!
Burn her! Burn her!
Let the girl go or I'm gonna blow your sheriff's brains all over these fucking hillbillies.
Move. Go on.
Let her go. Go over there.
Check her.
What's your name?
What's your name?
- Mina.
- Don't worry.
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft, she cannot hide it.
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth, in her skin and her eyes.
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying to protect you good people.
But your mayor has done a very smart thing.
He hired us.
My name is Gretel, and this is my brother, Hansel.
We know that many of your children have gone missing.
But killing an innocent woman will not bring them back.
Go home! We don't want you here!
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!
Well, evil is upon you, whether you like it or not.
Now if your children are still alive, we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman, you're gonna have me to deal with.
Now go home!
Go!
I guess you're free to go.
Thank you,
Hansel.
You're welcome.
What the hell do you think you're doing? Huh?
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...
Any man with half a brain could see that she was not a witch.
Now listen, Sheriff.
Hansel and Gretel have been brought here...
You better listen!
I'm not going to have this bitch and her scoundrel of a brother coming into my town, telling me what to do.
Don't!
Just don't.
Come on. Let's get you started.
There's been reports of a strange cottage in the north forest.
Locals won't go near the place.
A good place to start the investigation.
Move!
Gretel!
She looks angry.
Yeah.
A face like that, I'd be angry, too.
- Would you shut up?
That witch we found was a dead end, Mayor.
No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.
But we found this.
That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor.
An eclipse of the moon.
It happens once in a generation and is a night most holy to witches.
Oh, my God.
When?
According to this, three nights from now.
There's no doubt in my mind that all this is connected.
Children being taken in these numbers from the roads and fields so close to town.
A witch does not come out in the open like that.
Not unless she has to.
Witch activity has been increasing lately.
More sightings, animal slaughter, Sabbaths.
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon is dragging every damned witch from their dark hiding place.
So, it seems like a good thing that you brought us here, doesn't it, Mayor?
Half your money now.
The rest when the children are brought back alive.
Oh, there he is, right on time.
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.
And he'll take you to where the last sightings were.
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.
Not at night. It's too dangerous.
We'll leave in the morning.
Yeah, she's right.
It's much too dangerous.
So, any place we can get a drink in this hellhole?
Shut up!
The last one they took was a boy.
Less than two days ago, so the scent is still fresh.
100 shilling for every child you return alive.
You better be fast before our mayor's witch hunters rob this town blind.
You leave tonight.
In witch country at night?
You must be out of your mind.
Not until you finish the job.
Thank you, Wolfgang.
I'm telling you, we should put the fire out.
We're hunting witches, not bears. And we have to eat.
Such beautiful creatures.
Are they yours?
Yes, ma'am.
Why have you come here?
To the dark of the forest?
A child was taken, ma'am.
We're here to find him and take him back.
There are no children here.
Here...
There's only death!
- Witch!
Fools!
This is my land!
How dare you?
Please?
Hmm...
Please, God... No.
There's no use in praying, my friend.
Even your God knows better than to come here.
So we got this witch on the ground, right?
And her eyes, they start rolling back in her head. They're glowing red.
She's trying to put a Soul Searcher spell on me, you see.
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.
And she starts pissing, starts pissing everywhere, right?
But a witch's piss, it's the worst, you see, because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.
Although, in small doses, it does cure poison ivy, insect bites.
I'm getting way off the subject, aren't I?
I've got to get back to my friends.
What are you looking at?
There have been abductions here and here, on both sides of the river.
And on this last one, we believe a troll was involved.
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.
Hey, so what's wrong with the girls in this place, huh?
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't bar wenches supposed to be easy?
- It's really unusual.
- Yes, it is unusual.
Look at this one.
A father and three children attacked.
One child was taken, but she didn't touch the other two.
- Uh-oh.
- That's weird.
That's so weird.
- It is strange. It is strange, okay!
- Yeah, yeah.
Then again, we hunt witches for a living.
What's normal, really?
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here.
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.
I am really quite a fan of your work.
That's great.
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.
Listen, if it's not too much trouble,
- would you please sign...
- Oh, no...
Okay.
- Oh, my.
Yeah, that's from when you found the Fox Witch of Antwerp
- and sank her in the moat.
- Oh!
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.
When they tried to put a gate to hell under the courthouse.
I mean, you guys, you certainly taught those witches a thing or two.
Wow.
- This is amazing.
- And, uh, weird.
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...
You really keep all this stuff.
All right, well...
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.
- You go ahead.
- All right, um...
Okay. Um, how do you best kill a witch?
Hansel?
Uh, cutting off their heads tends to work.
Ripping out their hearts.
And skinning them is also nice.
Yeah, but burning is the best way.
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.
- Burning, yeah, of course.
- Burn them all.
Oh, is it true that witches can't harm you?
Well, no, that is horseshit, son.
Their magic doesn't work on us.
And they haven't killed us, yet.
Oh, do you think that's because of the witch that you burned when you were children?
I guess that's how it all started for you guys.
I mean, is that how you became witch hunters?
How did you get your guns?
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay, okay.
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid, but we have a town under attack.
She killed them!
She killed them all.
Who killed what?
The witch!
She killed the trackers. All of them.
She gave me a message.
For you all.
The Curse of Hunger for Crawling Things.
I fucking hate that one.
That was awesome.
The witch hunters are near,
I can smell their stench.
Your plan's working.
Did you bring the preparations?
Of course, Muriel.
Oiled frogs, fattened on possum maggots.
And Carpathian nightshade, deadly to the touch, most rare.
And, Muriel, we brought something to test it with.
Open your mouth.
Open!
Swallow, little pig!
He's ready.
It's working.
It's not even warm.
Muriel, this could change everything.
It will change everything.
We will be invincible.
Ow, Ow! Take it out.
Take it out! Take it out!
It's of no use if it doesn't last.
I can make it last.
Forever.
Where are we going?
We're almost there.
Hey.
Hey.
I just had this really weird dream.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
About what?
I think it was about our mother.
We don't talk about that.
Go to sleep.
What do you think? Boy, girl?
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.
A little small for you, maybe.
Oh, hello.
Uh, no, this, this is...
This is not for me.
Um, so, how goes the witch hunting?
It's good. Witch hunting's good.
It's strange being among these people.
Yeah?
If you hadn't come, they'd have burned me alive.
Yeah, well, I probably would have let them, but I'm old-fashioned that way.
My sister, however, requires a little bit more evidence before someone gets roasted.
- Have you ever come across a witch that you didn't want to kill?
No, never.
The only good witch is a dead witch.
- Can you hold this?
- Mmm-hmm.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
When I was a kid, a witch made me eat so much candy, I got sick.
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection every few hours or else I die.
You have the sugar sickness.
I actually know a thing or two about it if you ever need any help...
It's all right.
- So...
- I'm fine.
It was good seeing you.
Yeah.
You're very handsome.
And no man in this town will walk with me.
And you have my pumpkin.
I... I have to go.
- See you.
- Mmm-hmm.
It'll all be perfect.
Daddy! Daddy, please help me! I'm lost!
Daddy, please!
Please help me! I'm lost!
Daddy, I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!
I can help you, little boy.
Sweet little boy.
- Please help me!
Daddy! I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!
Please help...
You move, you die.
Get her wand.
Will you stop that?
Ooh.
I like your toys.
They have brought a live witch into my office!
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...
Good night, Sheriff.
Hey, wake up.
What is she doing?
I have no idea.
I see them.
Is she there?
That Gretel bitch?
Oh, yes, under the moon, over the sheriff, in the town.
There she is.
Good morning, sunshine.
You tell us what we want and this might not end up being the most painful night of your life.
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
No, no, better, fuck each other.
These witches, they never learn.
Let's try this again.
Where are the children? Why so many?
Where are the children?
The blood of the twelve moons will soon be collected.
And after that, only one object remains.
Why don't you just burn her?
We're wasting our time. She's useless.
Twelve moons. Twelve...
Twelve, twelve...
How many children have been taken so far?
I don't know, ten or eleven.
The files. We need to count them.
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.
They need one more child.
One more child.
Look, there's gotta be some sort of pattern.
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.
...hair color, genders, something.
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.
You need another girl?
"Twelve moons," what does that mean?
It's a month. It's a month.
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.
They need a girl born in April.
You are too late.
- Go!
- Yes!
Sheriff, birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?
It is there. Strictly for the law of this town, not for filthy bounty hunters like yourself.
Come on.
There can't be that many.
Ah!
- Anything?
- I only got one!
Little girl, six years old, born April 8th.
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.
This girl, do you know her?
Yes, I know her. Mary Behlmer.
Where does she live?
Sheriff, she's in danger!
Fire! Fire!
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.
Over here!
- Mama!
- Shh!
Stop! Stop right there!
Oh, no! No, no. Oh, no.
No, Lucas! Lucas.
No!
Damn you!
Too late, already damned.
Take her back!
To the Well!
Over here!
We need more help!
Now whatever happens,
I want you to stay cool.
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.
Are you a good shot?
No.
Not really.
That's why I use a shotgun.
Gretel, the famous witch hunter.
Finally we meet.
Who are you?
I see you got my invitation.
Say your name or I'll pin you to the fucking wall.
I go by many names, none of which you're worthy of pronouncing.
Oh, my God.
Help! Help!
Please!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Help!
Feisty bitch.
Shit.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kill you.
Not now.
And not like this.
You have something I need.
The last ingredient.
Ugh! Humans have such ghastly taste.
I think this place...
...could use a bit of color.
Shit!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Yes. No, people. Please be calm.
Yeah, one at a time.
Look what his witch hunters have brought to Augsburg.
Seven people burnt to death in the fire.
And another young, innocent child taken because of those witch hunters.
No.
Because of you.
I say bring them all to justice.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
No! No!
The witch hunters are not the ones to blame for this.
This is madness.
People, hasn't enough blood been shed?
No, no...
Not enough, Mayor.
Not yet.
Ah!
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?
You were covered in filth, so I was just cleaning.
What happened?
Um...
Well, the witches took a young girl, and a lot of people died in the fires.
And now the Sheriff, he's blaming you and your brother for what happened last night.
Augsburg's not really safe for you anymore.
And my brother?
Last time I saw him, he was fighting one of them on her broom, flying out of town.
Right.
Wow.
Where did you get all this stuff?
Um...
From everywhere.
I actually plan to be a witch hunter, too, when I get older.
Like you guys.
This isn't the life we chose, Ben.
I was wondering about that story about your parents leaving you.
Is all that true?
Yep.
Why?
I don't know.
That's what they did.
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you want some porridge?
Ah! Sure.
Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.
So last night, who was she, the witch who attacked us?
I don't know.
She looked normal at first, but then she changed her face.
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability, yeah.
Who is this?
She lived outside of town a long time ago.
She was accused of witchcraft, but she never confessed.
We just burned her anyway.
You're safe.
You'll be safe.
I have to find my brother.
Hansel!
Hey!
Hansel! Are you all right?
Oh, shit.
The witch hunting is going well, I see.
Yeah.
Hey, say, can you...
Can you tell me which way is back to town?
That way.
That way.
Okay.
Thank you!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- You need some help?
- No, I'm fine.
I'm fine. Thank you.
Okay. I'll see you later.
Motherfucker!
Are you okay?
Hi. Help me.
Hansel!
Hansel!
Hansel!
Come here.
Oh, she's a wild one, eh?
What do you think you're doing?
You're under arrest for the burning of Augsburg and for bringing the witch plague to our streets.
Listen, you idiot! The witches are planning something big!
I need to find my brother and save your shitty little...
Shut up.
This time,
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.
Are you done yet?
I've got to get to my sister.
This may take a while.
But if we don't clean it, you'll get the fever.
Fever?
You've really taken a beating, haven't you?
I think the real damage was to my dignity, which I left somewhere in that tree back there.
It's probably gonna be easier if you just get in.
Oh, no, no. No, I can't.
The water is healing.
Yeah, I don't swim well.
Then I'll go in with you.
Oh, okay.
Oh, boy.
So, it's healing waters, did you say?
I have a passion.
Horses, just love them.
Beautiful creatures, huh?
When you break any kind of a horse, you have to be hard on them from the beginning.
Show them who's boss.
Or else, they will never learn.
At first, they will hate you.
But once their spirit is broken, they will do anything you want.
Oh!
Bitch!
Hey, boss, maybe we should take her back to town now.
I'm not finished breaking her yet!
You're making this too easy.
I got it.
You know, the last time
I was in waters like this,
I came across a formidable Serpent Witch.
She mostly looked like a toad but she could breathe underwater, which made her difficult to track.
- She was deadly.
- Shh.
You talk too much.
You're pathetic.
She has guts.
Ooh! I like that.
Aah!
That's going to make me enjoy this even more.
No!
Well, boys, you can have her, after I'm done...
No! No!
...If there's anything left.
What the hell?
No!
Following this road, you should be able to make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.
Yeah.
I hope so.
When you find your sister, could you come back to see me again?
Yes, of course.
Drink.
No.
Drink!
Why did you save me?
Trolls serve witches.
Hey, wait.
Wait!
What's your name?
Edward.
Edward, wait!
Where am I?
Hansel?
Gretel?
Where have you been?
- Where have you been?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, what happened to your face?
Gretel?
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.
Who did this to you?
I'm okay.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm okay.
Where are we?
I don't know.
Oh!
You okay?
Did you have to land on me?
What is this place?
This isn't a regular witch's lair.
No.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, sis?
I think you're gonna want to come see this.
I think this is our old house.
And this is our old room.
Here. Look.
There's your bed.
Right?
Ah!
Remember this?
I think that's you.
And some sort of vicious badger.
Old beds.
Hansel.
You ever wonder what happened to our parents?
We don't talk about that, Gretel.
We made a promise, you know that.
Why do you think the witches' spells don't work on us?
Leave it alone.
- This is our house.
- Yeah?
This is where we grew up!
And what does that look like to you?
I don't know, Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.
So what? So we're cursed?
No. I think that our mother was...
I see you finally found your way home after all these years.
Mmm. How very sweet.
I remember this house.
The house of Adrianna, the Great White Witch.
Your whore of a mother.
Let me tell you a little story.
Once upon a time, near a shitty little town, there was a farmer who fell in love with a white witch.
And with their two beautiful children,
oh, they were so happy.
But not for long.
During a Blood Moon, there is a potion
that will make you immune to fire.
The key to the potion
is the heart of a Grand White Witch.
But your mother, the most powerful white witch,
was too strong for us.
So it had to be you, Gretel.
It had to be your heart.
As the Blood Moon approached,
I sent out a little rumor
to the people of Augsburg.
And when she knew they were coming,
she had your father take you into the forest to hide you.
- Father! Wait!
Don't let her get away!
She didn't know what they would do to her,
but she was too proud to run.
And a white witch would never use her magic against humans.
When your father came back for her...
No!
...they hanged him.
- Run him up!
- No!
...right in front
of your mother's burning flesh!
Adrianna was gone.
But so was your heart.
And the Blood Moon passed.
The end.
It's a beautiful story, don't you think?
They died to save you.
And all your life, how you've hated them.
Tomorrow sisters from all dark corners of the land will join me in the light of the Blood Moon for the greatest Sabbath of all.
The only thing left is the everlasting power of the heart of a Grand White Witch.
You know, you talk too much.
Bad move, witch hunter.
Hansel!
Drink it. It will help the pain.
Mina?
What did you do?
Mina?
You're a witch?
There are good witches in the world.
- Not many, but some.
- You stay back.
I'm a witch, but I won't hurt you.
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.
Yeah, but only the dark witches bear the signs.
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?
Think about it, if their spells don't work on you, why would mine?
I'm not like them, Hansel.
Gretel. Shit.
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.
Who has your sister?
Witches have my sister. They...
- Where?
- They said something about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.
There's a place deep in the forest, nearby the mountains.
A place dark witches use for their Sabbath.
Where is it?
Hansel, I...
Mina, how do I get there?
If there is a Sabbath, there will be many witches.
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you, Hansel.
I don't have time for this.
No, listen, Hansel,
I found something here, in this cave.
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.
The Abramelin Grimoire! It exists!
This is the book of protection against black magic.
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?
Don't ask, kid.
If this thing does what it says, it will allow us to penetrate their protection.
Oh, yeah?
Their wands won't protect them anymore.
We just need something to bless.
Okay, let's start with this.
I hope this works.
All right.
You ever shoot a gun?
Well, I did win the county fair three times.
All right. In that case...
Don't touch the gun.
Edward.
What are you doing here?
What's going on?
Muriel.
Edward,
I need your help.
Please, Edward.
- Hey! You filthy oaf!
Get the children. We're moving out.
It's time.
Okay, are we good?
Yes.
Well, as far as you go, kid.
But, I will leave you with this.
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.
Shoot anything that moves.
Good luck.
Shut up!
Oh!
After tonight, no sister will be burned on their pyres!
No sister will be ashes on the ground!
I want your brains!
And now, now we feast!
- That's a lot of witches.
Okay.
I'm gonna go down around the other side.
Push them into the middle, get them away from the kids.
Now, when you see my signal, you unleash hell.
Wish me luck.
Wait. Wait. What's the signal?
It'll be me blowing one of these bitches' heads off.
Yes.
The hour has come!
The Blood Moon arrives!
- The Grand White Witch dies!
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies. Hi.
It seems as if I've lost my invitation to your little dinner party here.
I apologize.
But don't worry.
I didn't come empty-handed.
Sisters!
Allow me to introduce you to the famous witch hunter Hansel.
Personally responsible for the deaths of over 600.
Listen to me carefully!
If you let my sister and the children go now,
I'll consider not killing each and every one of you.
Enough with this.
- Take his fucking head off.
- Yes.
Please work.
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!
Now, move!
Fucking...
Eat it!
Walk!
Move it!
Come on!
- Gretel!
Ohh!
Edward.
Gretel!
I'm okay! Go get the children!
Stay still!
Get off of me!
No!
Thank you!
- Shit!
- Too late.
Gretel!
Thank you.
- You okay?
Muriel's still alive.
I'm not done.
Ah, Gretel, Mina. Mina, Gretel.
- Hey.
- I need that.
- Okay.
- She flew off that way.
Well, where are you going?
I have to help Edward!
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?
- Ah! Hell, yeah!
- Ben!
Hansel! Hansel!
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.
- Where?
- Uh, I shot her down, over there.
Good job.
She's close.
Edward?
Oh, you can't be serious.
Is this...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wow.
Whatever you do, don't eat the fucking candy.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Stop right there, or the little boy dies.
I thought it would be fitting for us to end up here, where it all began.
Kind of lost its charm a little, huh?
Drop it.
Good boy.
Don't worry, kid.
I'm not gonna let her hurt you.
Oh, really?
Really.
The end is near, witch hunter.
I wish I could say it would be painless, but that would be a lie.
Get away from him.
Always funny seeing a white witch with a wand.
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?
Not bad.
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.
Pathetic.
No!
Mina. Hey.
Come here.
Hansel.
Hansel.
I tried to stop her.
You did. You did good.
You did good.
I want you to do something for me.
Anything.
Kill the fucking bitch.
You got to be fucking kidding me.
Oh, please.
Please?
Please, stop.
Please.
Yeah, nice try.
I fucking hate you.
You know, you look like shit.
You know that?
- So do you.
Finish her already.
Revenge doesn't change the past.
It won't bring our parents back.
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.
- Glad to hear it.
- Ow!
But it sure as hell feels good.
My sister and I know the truth.
We know who we are now.
And so do they.
They know our story,
our powers,
what we can do.
And they should fear us.
All of us.
We should be getting close now.
And so after this next one, we've got three more to go.
Three? You said three more three witches ago.
Come on, you always say, more witches, more money, right?
Yeah, but you ain't getting any of it.
Unless you want to pull the cart.
Right, big guy?
I told you he'd come in handy.
There are good witches in the world.
We know that now.
But for the ones practicing the black arts, beware.
We're coming for you.
No matter where you are, we'll find you.
And dead or alive,
we'll take you down.
Edward, want to knock?
- Dead.
I hate to break it to you, but it's not gonna be an open casket.
{857}{930}Master, where did this blizzard|come from?
{953}{1029}Don't believe everything you see!
{1065}{1113}But I really cold!
{1116}{1176}Then, you're already under|her spell.
{1177}{1241}I've lost without fighting?
{1433}{1461}The ice harpy!
{1462}{1487}Wait!
{1638}{1669}You're no match for her.
{1669}{1720}Now you tell me!
{1749}{1816}You have come so far to find me.
{1816}{1885}Are you not entranced by my charms?
{1889}{1949}Instead of meditating on your sins...
{1950}{1993}...you are still harming humans!
{1994}{2087}Blame those men, not me!
{2089}{2161}I was so good to each of them.
{2162}{2284}But their roving eyes strayed|away from me.
{2287}{2347}So they deserved it!
{2351}{2438}You're an enchantress, they were humans.|You were never meant to be together.
{2438}{2489}Today I'll bring it to an end.
{2528}{2637}Monk, you think you can escape|from my spell?
{2638}{2670}Then come and get me!
{4326}{4365}Master, have you killed her?
{4366}{4405}I've trapped her!
{4412}{4455}Confine her in the Lei Fang Pagoda.
{4456}{4485}Me again?
{4486}{4528}It's me!
{4894}{5036}{y:i}Jin Shan Temple
{5156}{5271}{y:i}Lei Feng Pagoda
{5558}{5592}Trying to scare me?
{5593}{5697}Master wouldn't have trapped you|if you were really scary.
{5752}{5851}We're giving you another chance.
{5852}{5921}A chance to reflect and improve.
{5922}{5965}If you make real progress in meditation...
{5966}{6034}...you'll be realised.
{6053}{6131}You, too! Study to improve yourself!
{9363}{9454}Hey! Hurry up back there!
{9457}{9503}Coming!
{9790}{9816}Xu Xian...
{9817}{9890}I shouldn't have climbed up here|to pick up herbs with you.
{9894}{9929}Be a bit more patient.
{9930}{9968}Look! Here's one.
{9969}{10064}Unlike Shennong, you know the|value of herbs.
{10065}{10116}Xu Xian, you even know which|flowers to eat.
{10125}{10163}Which flowers cure which ailments...
{10164}{10209}Do you even know what flower that is?
{10210}{10319}That fool is eating flowers!|They have thorns!
{10336}{10378}He's no fool.
{10379}{10445}He's not picking the pretty wild|roses with thorns.
{10446}{10495}Roses are pretty...
{10496}{10565}...but not as pretty as me.
{10622}{10698}You...you're more like a hornflower.
{10698}{10811}Blowing your own horn from|dawn to dusk.
{10832}{10858}Hey, don't you even know...
{10859}{10920}...medicines cure ailments...
{10921}{10995}...but others need liqour distiled|from flowers!
{10996}{11065}That's absolutely right!
{11081}{11104}Let's keep going.
{11105}{11168}- Alright|- Climb further?
{11254}{11328}Look, they are still digging for herbs.
{11329}{11402}They'll strip the whole mountain bare!
{11416}{11465}I'll give them a scare!
{11485}{11533}What? Qingqing...
{11816}{11869}Xu Xian? Xu Xian?
{14394}{14407}He's coming to...
{14407}{14453}Xu Xian, are you alright?
{14459}{14479}Xu Xian!
{14585}{14620}Xu Xian!
{14621}{14649}Where's that girl?
{14650}{14678}What girl?
{14679}{14709}May be you banged your head too hard...
{14710}{14761}Just now, in the water, a girl kissed me.
{14761}{14783}She breathed into my mouth.
{14784}{14827}She saved me.
{14861}{14959}Hey! The one giving you the|kiss of live was me!
{15131}{15169}Why did you save him?
{15170}{15303}You even gave him his vital energy a boost!
{15329}{15454}Hey, I'm talking to you!|What are staring at?
{15481}{15532}Nothing.
{15543}{15629}Nothing? You're smitten!
{15945}{16025}Master, it looks like another|bat-demon bite.
{16026}{16089}Amitabha...
{16093}{16117}Today is the 15th...
{16118}{16194}The day of the Lantern Festival.
{16195}{16236}We have to find these demons soon.
{16237}{16286}Or many more people will die.
{16292}{16328}Amitabha...
{16552}{16590}Ferryman, wait!
{16591}{16620}Here!
{16621}{16689}We need to cross the river,|ferryman.
{16717}{16786}I'm no ferryman, but jump in.
{16787}{16819}I hope we're not delaying you.
{16820}{16870}Not at all! To help others...
{16871}{16929}...is to spend time well.
{16942}{16976}Thank you kind sir.
{17095}{17115}Sir...
{17116}{17156}What you just said was very|interesting.
{17157}{17261}How do you use your time when|you're not helping others?
{17262}{17329}I'm aiming to become a doctor of medicine.
{17329}{17384}Good, good! Young men like us|should have dreams!
{17385}{17410}I have one too.
{17410}{17498}I dream of become the Abbot of|Jinshan Temple.
{17499}{17531}And where would that leave me?
{17532}{17600}Uh, Master...that's not...
{17600}{17639}I didn't mean now...|I mean after...
{17640}{17670}After my death?
{17671}{17705}You want me to die?
{17705}{17739}No, I...
{17739}{17787}That's not what I meant, Master...I...
{17788}{17871}It seems your are Abbot Fahai|of Jinshan Temple.
{17877}{17915}It takes ten years of good deeds|for two people to meet.
{17916}{17969}It's destiny that let us to be acquainted.
{17975}{18041}Young men, you're from Hangzhou?
{18042}{18092}Yes, my name's Xu Xian.
{18092}{18139}I'm herbalist.
{18188}{18248}Master, what are you counting?
{18248}{18301}How long until I die.
{18302}{18367}Xu Xian, the weather's nice today!
{18368}{18395}That it is.
{18395}{18431}Don't change the subject!
{18432}{18461}What was your dream again?
{18462}{18482}No...
{18483}{18521}The ultimate dream.
{18522}{18545}I don't have any dream!
{18546}{18587}My only dream is my wish that you...
{19443}{19530}White, tell us what's bothering you.
{19531}{19587}Turtle and I can help you resolve it.
{19588}{19685}What...do...you...
{19686}{19736}I want to visit the human world.
{19736}{19845}You just want to see that|flower-eating fool!
{19845}{19898}I'd just like to take another|look at him.
{19899}{19987}Look at what? He's just a common mortal!
{19987}{20047}You've been moping over|him for days!
{20057}{20104}What's this all about?
{20105}{20186}She used her vital essence to save|a fool who was drowning.
{20187}{20262}If...your...lips...
{20263}{20286}Let me say it.
{20286}{20351}If their lips met...
{20352}{20383}...there was a flow of vital essences.
{20384}{20488}He's in you and you're in him!
{20503}{20599}Nothing so serious, I just want|to look at him.
{20602}{20642}Don't give a hard time.
{20650}{20681}Qingqing, come with me!
{20684}{20743}Hey, where are you going?|I want to come! Take me too!
{20773}{20824}I will just stay here.
{21121}{21194}See how much fun the mortal world is?
{21195}{21261}In a moment, get off the boat...
{21262}{21303}...and find him for me.
{21304}{21347}I'll be strolling around here.
{21348}{21411}When you find him, bring him to the|pavilion on the lake.
{21412}{21468}Why don't you find him yourself?
{21469}{21539}I want to play a little joke on him.
{21540}{21596}And see how nice he is.
{21736}{21778}Master, it's turning!
{21779}{21822}Then don't blow on it!
{21823}{21882}We'll split up to look around.
{22242}{22282}Watch out!
{22283}{22320}What it is?
{22321}{22362}A demon!
{22363}{22447}A demon? How do you know?
{22448}{22512}I'm an expert, of course I know.
{22548}{22609}Are you going to exorcise it?
{22610}{22714}Shh, not so loud. It's nearby!
{22724}{22765}My Master and I have been tracking it|for ages.
{22766}{22827}Master says we must exorcise it today.
{22828}{22878}Why do you have to do that?
{22879}{22913}Demons hurt people.
{22913}{23002}What about the demons which|don't hurt people?
{23032}{23064}I don't know.
{23064}{23100}Could you make friends with them?
{23101}{23127}Definitely not!
{23128}{23160}Why not?
{23161}{23249}Master only taught me how|to exorcise them.
{23250}{23325}Not how to make friends with them.
{23340}{23483}Then your master has a problem.|Or may be his Master had a problem.
{23530}{23615}Why don't I have a problem?
{23642}{23756}Because you absolutely don't have one.
{23779}{23838}You're very nice.|And very smart.
{23839}{23896}I'd like to have a friend like you.
{23897}{23959}I'm Qingqing.
{24110}{24173}I'm Neng Ren.
{24174}{24253}I'm busy, I have to go.
{24271}{24317}Take care!
{24767}{24885}You are the gentleman my sister|wants to see.
{24895}{24954}Look again, do I look like a gentleman?
{24954}{24997}You have the wrong man.
{25012}{25071}Can't be...
{25119}{25175}You're a herb-picker, aren't you?
{25175}{25252}Yes, but I'm not a gentleman.
{25263}{25344}So I can't possibly be the one|your sister wants to see.
{25419}{25507}I recognize you, you're the man|who eats flower.
{25508}{25558}Then what's my name?
{25559}{25600}Who am I?
{25648}{25705}I don't know.
{25709}{25799}But you are the one my sister wants to see.
{25804}{25911}It's Lantern Festival night,|go and enjoy it.
{25914}{25953}And stop bothering me.
{25954}{26049}Goodnight...young miss.
{26125}{26207}What on earth?
{26483}{26534}Why is it moving?
{26992}{27056}Stop!
{28088}{28135}You're a real fool.
{28136}{28210}Where do you think you're going?
{28739}{28817}Sorry, sorry!|I didn't do that on purpose!
{28818}{28862}Sit down.
{28879}{28949}Miss, it's late and you're|alone here.
{28950}{28995}This isn't proper.
{29008}{29059}Don't treat me as a stranger.
{29059}{29122}You don't need to be so polite.
{29128}{29219}No, no, I should go.
{29220}{29291}Who built this pavilion?|It's so rickety.
{29291}{29362}Well, I think it's very nice.
{29363}{29440}And it's a perfect spot|to see the West Lake.
{29441}{29482}I'm afraid I'm not so interested.
{29483}{29520}And I need to get home.
{29521}{29579}This early?
{29579}{29691}There's moonlight on the lake,|a pavilion in the moonlight...
{29692}{29758}And we're in the pavilion.
{29759}{29842}Don't you think it's romantic?
{29850}{29897}I'm too busy for romance.
{29898}{29957}What are you avoiding?
{29958}{30023}Why are keeping such a distance|from me?
{30024}{30087}Why don't you like me?
{30098}{30152}It's not that I don't like you Miss...
{30153}{30289}But someone else already has my heart.
{30429}{30547}Miss, I'm a very poor man.
{30548}{30603}I pick herbs for a living.
{30603}{30686}I'm not worthy of your affections.
{30687}{30758}Then tell me about her.
{30759}{30838}What kind of person is she?
{30889}{30985}I know almost nothing about her.
{31014}{31146}I can't even recall her face.
{31169}{31293}All I know is that she saved my life.
{31294}{31407}That day I fell into a lake|in the mountains.
{31408}{31469}She rescued me.
{31583}{31685}If she saved your life, you owe her a lot.
{31709}{31772}But when I revived...
{31784}{31838}...she was gone.
{31839}{31905}My friends said I'd imagined her.
{31906}{32007}But I'm quite sure she was real.
{32025}{32141}Because she kissed me so deeply...
{32142}{32247}...that kiss saved my life.
{32286}{32356}In a way it also took my life.
{32403}{32515}What if...you could kiss her again?
{32516}{32580}Would you remember her this time?
{34545}{34595}Hello, my friend!
{34596}{34638}Oh, it's you...haven't gone home yet?
{34638}{34684}Done with your errands?
{34686}{34724}All done.
{34725}{34790}It's dangerous here, you should go home.
{34793}{34860}If it's dangerous, you should leave too.
{34861}{34923}I can't, I'm hunting demons.
{34924}{34961}Know the saying?
{34962}{35045}"There's someone smarter than you know"
{35046}{35144}It applies to the demons too.
{35145}{35199}You're no match for this one.
{35200}{35260}I advise you to give up.
{35302}{35349}I can't, I sworn to obey my Master
{35350}{35401}We have to trap the bat-demon tonight.
{35431}{35536}Well, if you want to kill yourself...
{35611}{35684}This is a very, very powerful demon.
{35738}{35778}Not really...
{35779}{35869}Just a bat-demon which bit a girl.
{35869}{35923}Ugh, she's all bloody!
{35924}{35955}How do you know?
{35956}{36049}I am an expert too.
{36146}{36205}I can't let it get away.
{36206}{36276}Sorry we can't talk more,|until next time!
{36276}{36336}No!
{36337}{36368}Watch out!
{36381}{36491}Oh well, there goes another friend.
{36522}{36572}Neng Ren of Jinshan Temple!
{36573}{36649}Demon hunter and enforcer of Buddha's Law
{36676}{36750}No bluffing!
{38273}{38369}Master! Save me!
{38605}{38685}Master! Save me!
{38795}{38845}Master!
{38975}{39032}Master!
{41997}{42114}Look! Master Fahai and|Neng Ren are back!
{42125}{42159}What's wrong with Brother Neng Ren?
{42160}{42194}The bat-demon poisoned him.
{42199}{42252}Can he be cured?
{42253}{42332}If he's lucky...
{42733}{42811}What are you staring at?
{42812}{42847}You...
{42870}{42935}No need to keep staring so long.
{42945}{42998}I can't stop wondering...
{42999}{43058}...if this is really happening.
{43087}{43140}What do you think?
{43155}{43194}That are you dreaming?
{43254}{43301}Someone once told me...
{43302}{43383}If I want to see someone,|I should keep her in my heart.
{43384}{43438}Then I really see her again.
{43439}{43538}Now I know it's superstition,|it's true.
{43689}{43782}You're saying you did want to see me|again.
{43911}{43993}Xu Xian, let's go on like this.
{43995}{44049}Always together, alright?
{44049}{44172}Eating together, sleeping together...
{44173}{44219}Doing everything together.
{44220}{44266}Won't you get tired of me?
{44318}{44371}Won't you?
{44459}{44508}But I want to take you seriously.
{44509}{44585}I want to meet your parents.
{44586}{44670}And when I have their permission|to court you...
{44671}{44808}Then we'll have a formal match|and get married?
{45151}{45189}Brother! Brother!
{45190}{45248}Wake up!
{45249}{45290}The sun rose hours ago!
{45291}{45344}Brother, wake up!
{45344}{45381}What?
{45382}{45449}That's scary, Brother!
{45450}{45519}Brother! You...Your ears|have grown pointly!
{45520}{45576}And you got fangs! So scary!
{45577}{45683}Brother, are you turning into a demon?
{45972}{46096}Master! Master!|Something very bad happened!
{46097}{46124}Brother Neng Ren has run away.
{46124}{46205}Come end see! Quickly!
{46408}{46488}This place isn't bad, we could live here.
{46489}{46527}Change!
{46676}{46735}Hey, friend...
{46763}{46801}You want to hang yourself?
{46802}{46879}Hurry away, friend.
{46880}{46947}Death by hanging is an ugly sight.
{46948}{46982}You'll get nightmares.
{47000}{47043}I know!
{47044}{47112}After death, your body turns purple...
{47112}{47185}Your tongue hangs loose and|your eyes fall cut!
{47186}{47211}What?
{47211}{47266}If you don't believe me, give it a go!
{47509}{47572}You don't look like you really want to die.
{47588}{47649}You don't understand.
{47650}{47702}I'm a demon hunter...
{47703}{47777}...but I'm turning into a demon!
{47787}{47816}Just think...
{47816}{47896}...when I meet a demon I've hunted before...
{47897}{47963}...I'll will seriously lose face.
{48003}{48057}If you're a demon, just be a demon.
{48058}{48089}When a demon meets another...
{48090}{48134}...mostly they just nod a greeting.
{48135}{48218}And lots of them don't have limbs
{48219}{48270}Who'll care about your face?
{48306}{48348}I'll let you in on a secret.
{48372}{48456}Actually, I'm a demon too.
{48531}{48589}You...you...
{48590}{48630}What's wrong?
{48630}{48709}Aren't we the same now?
{48710}{48797}All demons together! Don't look|at me like that!
{48826}{48884}Since we are so close now...
{48885}{48964}...I'll teach you how to be a demon.
{48964}{48999}Come on!
{49000}{49043}I'm gelded!
{49051}{49079}Come on!
{49080}{49135}- A gelding!|- Come on!
{49136}{49233}I just had chive for breakfast.|I'm going to throw up!
{49234}{49307}Bats hang upside-down, get used to it!
{49308}{49399}My head will burst! It's full of blood!
{49415}{49478}That will make you smarter.
{49479}{49520}I have a question for you.
{49521}{49563}Am I pretty?
{49564}{49599}Listen...
{49602}{49653}Right now, all I can see is|stars.
{49653}{49730}I'm seeing you upside-down.
{49731}{49773}Pretty doesn't come out into it.
{49774}{49812}I see.
{49975}{50030}And now, am I pretty?
{50031}{50128}Seeing you now...very pretty.
{50150}{50273}So do you get a special|feeling when you look at me?
{50363}{50454}Would you like to bite my neck?
{50460}{50523}Taste my blood?
{50686}{50716}Amitabha...
{50717}{50747}I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner.
{50748}{50785}Drink some water.
{50964}{51007}What's this?
{51007}{51047}What do you think?
{51083}{51111}You bit my neck...
{51112}{51146}...ate meat and drank blood!
{51147}{51170}You violated the Three Taboos!
{51171}{51216}No more calling yourself a monk!
{51217}{51290}From now on, be demon you are!
{51291}{51427}Liar!
{51529}{51585}- We're there|- Have we brought enough gifts?
{51586}{51636}Stop worrying' Come on in.
{51724}{51792}I didn't expect your family|to live in a mansion!
{51801}{51853}It's just a broken-down old house.
{51854}{51939}You here at last! You kept us waiting!
{51940}{52045}They are all here...this my family.
{52055}{52089}Go on in.
{52090}{52131}Thanks.
{52165}{52209}We need to hurry.
{52210}{52279}They can't keep these forms for long.
{52280}{52312}I know.
{52313}{52364}I want to play too!
{52365}{52418}You can't take a human form! Scram!
{52674}{52724}Hello, everyone.
{52778}{52818}I'll make the introductions.

{53254}{53299}You're just perfect for each other!
{53299}{53329}The perfect couple!
{53332}{53380}Really...
{53381}{53432}Really nice to see!
{53433}{53494}How wonderful that you're|here to propose!
{53513}{53531}Don't worry, he's fine.
{53532}{53600}Auspicious day for an engagement,|isn't it?
{53647}{53718}This is...my mother.
{53719}{53748}She's so young!
{53749}{53779}Really?
{53800}{53839}Actually, my stepmother.
{53893}{53928}I'll introduce you...
{53928}{53999}Googie...Googie...
{54030}{54113}How come you have a girl's name?
{54125}{54186}You misheard, it's Gugu.
{54187}{54260}He was a chubby kid, that|was his nickname.
{54261}{54325}And it stuck.
{54367}{54435}- Hello, Gugu.|- Let's sit down.
{54492}{54588}It's this year's latest fashion.
{54782}{54840}This is called Doodle do Wine
{54841}{54900}It'll make you hiccup! Doodle-do!
{55006}{55081}My parents like you to look|at them when you speak.
{55121}{55170}Aren't you here today to propose?
{55171}{55234}Hurry then, we can hardly wait!
{55393}{55483}I'm Xu Xian, poor and humble...
{55489}{55562}I never dreamt I'd win anyone|like your Susu...
{55729}{55763}I've came here today...
{55764}{55841}...because I seek your exalted permission...
{55842}{55905}...to marry Susu.
{55916}{55945}Sir...
{55946}{55993}Altough I have nothing to my name...
{56030}{56086}...I love Susu very much.
{56111}{56185}No need for a cowry, juts take|her home! Go on!
{56186}{56260}I also want to say to Susu...

{56400}{56458}I want to hear what Xu Xian has to say.
{56459}{56493}Sister...

{56656}{56709}I don't know what stroke of good fortune...
{56710}{56774}...allows me to make you mine.
{56775}{56829}All it took was one kiss.
{56830}{56872}The wheels of fate turned...
{56888}{56937}...and brought me to a perfect|moment...
{56938}{57019}...of tenderness and happiness.
{57019}{57098}From now on every moment, every|second I have...
{57099}{57152}...I'll spend...
{57161}{57206}...beside you...
{57207}{57317}...to make you happy.
{57459}{57564}- Why did you do that?|- They're reverting to their true forms.
{57697}{57727}It's bad! It's bad!
{57728}{57787}Fahai is here to exorcise us!|Run!
{57857}{57889}Run!
{57889}{57950}Get Xu Xian away from here while|I distract him.
{57951}{57981}Be careful!
{58034}{58136}A tawdry illusion to dupe humans!
{58282}{58313}Send them all back to the demon|realm!
{58314}{58342}Yes, Master!
{60160}{60212}Master!
{60251}{60325}Master, let her go!
{60365}{60421}You know what you're asking?
{60422}{60453}Come back with me.
{60454}{60505}Master...
{60548}{60619}I can't go back anymore
{60850}{60914}Master, take care!
{61883}{61946}We escaped?
{61947}{61991}I'm not dead?
{61992}{62072}Be calm, I'll always protect you.
{62741}{62790}What are we doing here?
{62791}{62838}Weren't we getting engaged?
{62839}{62874}We did it.
{62875}{62956}My parents gave us their blessing.
{62957}{62991}- Really?|- Yes.
{63013}{63048}That was easy.
{63049}{63098}So, now we're married.
{63099}{63156}I'm your wife.
{63164}{63232}We can be together for the rest|of our lives.
{63277}{63321}One day...
{63344}{63391}...I'll have my own pharmacy.
{63392}{63437}Then I'll have more money.
{63472}{63536}I don't want you to suffer|with me.
{63537}{63610}How could that be?
{63620}{63665}As long as we're together...
{63666}{63749}...I'll never know.
{64677}{64755}What's love like in human world?
{64756}{64809}What do you mean?
{64829}{64908}I'd just like to know what kind|of couple we are.
{64917}{64961}Tell me.
{64970}{65023}Well, there are several kinds.
{65067}{65118}Some couples are like birds|in the forest.
{65119}{65162}Each can fly away if they want.
{65163}{65208}Not that kind!
{65224}{65254}Another kind is...
{65254}{65297}...where the husband gets rich and|dreams...
{65298}{65323}...of his wife's death.
{65331}{65375}Xu Xian!|I'll kill you!
{65426}{65458}Watch out!
{65495}{65521}Don't chase me!
{65529}{65568}You'll make me drop the herbs!
{65569}{65613}I'll kill you!|I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
{67273}{67332}This disease can't be cured.
{67358}{67415}- Master!|- They're victims of demons.
{67416}{67556}At best they'll go mad, at worst|they'll die.
{67568}{67655}While they're alive, I must|try to save them.
{67704}{67786}Take precautions, don't go|strange places alone.
{67794}{67849}Thank you Master.
{67916}{67955}Where did this disease come from?
{67960}{68003}So many people suddenly dying.
{68003}{68047}You should take some rest.
{68048}{68092}You have been taking medicine|for three days!
{68093}{68114}I can't.
{68134}{68215}I have to find the cure.
{68247}{68309}Susu, give me a hand.
{68310}{68380}It musn't stick to the bottom|of the pot.
{68473}{68505}Preserving vital essence...
{68506}{68532}...concentrating vigor...
{68533}{68570}...boosting the spirit.
{68571}{68613}Aside from these fundamentals...
{68613}{68694}...the medicine must strenghten|the basic functions.
{68720}{68768}This is such a fierce disease.
{68769}{68810}Can this medicine work?
{68810}{68859}I really don't know.
{68988}{69064}Woman...
{70154}{70171}Disciples!
{71030}{71099}Foul demons! Crossing the three|realms and five planes...
{71100}{71190}...you harmed the people and spread|chaos and evil!
{71191}{71253}By Buddha's mercy, if you choose|to repent...
{71254}{71315}...you still have a chance to live.
{71316}{71426}We'd rather die than listen to your|nonsense!
{72112}{72167}Beware! The fox-demons are|casting a charm!
{72168}{72217}- On guard!|- Yes, Master!
{72291}{72331}Maximum protection shield!
{72332}{72410}Heaven needs no hearing ecstasy,|needs no sight.
{72411}{72470}Void my sense of self.
{73491}{73536}What's that mantra?
{73547}{73651}Is it real or are you making it up?
{73898}{73938}Show your real forms!
{74589}{74632}By heaven's mercy.
{74633}{74688}Master, we regret our sin.
{74689}{74745}Please let us go. We beg you.
{74747}{74793}Silence! You are demons!
{74794}{74844}Return to the six oath of transmigration!
{74845}{74903}Accept your punishment with humility!
{74930}{74980}Amitabha...
{75313}{75368}Sister, Sister.
{75369}{75440}What's wrong? Are you alright?
{75488}{75512}It's nothing.
{75513}{75551}That's impossible...
{75552}{75598}If you keep on like this...
{75599}{75690}...something will go very wrong.
{75691}{75721}I know what I'm doing.
{75722}{75767}All you care about is that Xu Xian.
{75768}{75818}Adding your vital essence to|that medicine...
{75819}{75898}..is costing you centuries of|self-improvement
{75899}{75979}I don't want him work so hard.|I want to help him.
{75980}{76073}But you may not live to see|him again!
{76074}{76147}- It can't be that bad.|- Of course it is.
{76148}{76195}I have to go.
{76222}{76299}Wait!
{76317}{76407}- Ah, Dr. Xu is here.|- Dr. Xu, thank you!
{76421}{76467}You're truly our savior.
{76480}{76516}We owe you our lives.
{76517}{76591}You and your wife are such good people.
{76616}{76664}Don't rush.
{76665}{76732}There's enough for everyone.
{76750}{76780}Thank you.
{76792}{76838}Master, you should take some too.
{76839}{76918}It cures sickness and|prevents infection.
{77054}{77081}Thank you.
{77082}{77120}Master...
{77121}{77153}Did you mix this medicine?
{77154}{77181}Yes.
{77182}{77268}- No one helped you?|- Yes, my wife did.
{77268}{77335}You are the quintessence of the benevolence.
{77336}{77416}Take this spirit dagger as a token|of thanks.
{77420}{77468}I can't Master, I'm just doing my duty.
{77469}{77520}You shouldn't refuse a gift from|a senior.
{77521}{77572}Keep it to protect yourself.
{77598}{77658}Thank you, Master.
{77669}{77720}Amitabha...
{78427}{78489}You think you can run?
{79829}{79909}You made the cure for the|fox-demon's poison.
{79910}{79953}So what?
{79975}{80033}Making it has cost you centuries of|vital essence.
{80034}{80126}You're kind to ordinary people.
{80127}{80214}But in your eyes, all we do is harm people.
{80215}{80277}Despite good intentions|you will harm someone.
{80278}{80308}Who will I harm?
{80309}{80341}You should know that.
{80346}{80409}Xu Xian is my true love,|how could I harm him?
{80410}{80473}You're from different realms!|Being together...
{80473}{80533}...you drain his life-force and|distort his destiny.
{80534}{80612}Human lives are short and true|love is rare.
{80613}{80664}He didn't choose to love you,|you took his love.
{80665}{80746}What does that matter?|He's happy with me.
{80747}{80800}Go chant your sutras!
{80801}{80870}You know nothing of love.
{80901}{80953}If Xu Xian knew you are a snake...
{80954}{81019}...would he still love you?
{81117}{81188}I truly love him.
{81261}{81301}If that's the case, shed your own tears...
{81302}{81391}...don't make him shed tears over you.
{81525}{81566}Since you're so benevolent...
{81567}{81631}...I'll let you go this time.
{81645}{81756}If I see you again in this realm,|there'll be no mercy.
{82273}{82324}Susu, I'm home.
{82325}{82391}So soon?
{82452}{82480}You're back!
{82481}{82544}Look!
{82545}{82591}What's special about today?
{82592}{82677}Well, everyone else is|celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival.
{82678}{82746}While I'm celebrating the best day|I have ever had!
{82747}{82840}The day my medicine cured everyone!
{82841}{82886}- Really?|- Yes.
{82890}{82937}That's wonderful.
{82938}{83029}The old villagers were so grateful.|They gave us all this food.
{83029}{83104}Susu, thank you for working|so hard.
{83105}{83181}Here, a toast to you.
{83368}{83445}I'm hungry.|Here, try this.
{83556}{83624}It's good.
{83625}{83679}You have some too.
{83731}{83789}What's wrong?
{83844}{83881}What kind of wine is this?
{83882}{83950}They distiled it themselves.
{83988}{84019}Sulphur-flower wine!
{84020}{84041}That's right.
{84045}{84156}It's a festival tradition, it wards off|snake bites.
{84173}{84233}Susu?
{84249}{84321}Susu? What's wrong? Susu!
{84325}{84401}Susu? Susu? What's the matter?
{84401}{84435}Are you alright?
{84440}{84473}I'm alright.
{84483}{84515}Susu!
{84533}{84598}Why lock the door? Open it!
{84608}{84622}Susu...
{84623}{84679}Don't frighten me!
{84680}{84725}Susu...
{84766}{84805}What's the matter?
{84806}{84835}Susu!
{84852}{84910}Susu!
{85200}{85238}Susu!
{85246}{85302}Susu, what are you doing?
{85303}{85343}Open the door!
{85357}{85429}Susu, don't frighten me!
{85453}{85480}Xu Xian...
{85489}{85522}Do you recalll...
{85526}{85575}...what you said to me when you|proposed?
{85595}{85654}I want to hear you saying it again.
{85673}{85741}I knew you were playing|a trick on me!
{85742}{85780}I'd rather not repeat it.
{85795}{85839}If you don't...
{85843}{85887}...I might never hear it again.
{85888}{85965}Alright, alright! I'll say it.
{85966}{86046}But then you must open the door!
{86059}{86149}Alright.
{86213}{86273}" All it took was one kiss"
{86274}{86360}"I'm sure that the wheels of the|fate turned..."
{86382}{86444}"...and brought me to a perfect moment..."
{86445}{86556}"...of tenderness and happiness."
{86602}{86658}"From now on..."
{86669}{86741}"...every moment, every second I have..."
{86741}{86827}"...I will spend beside you..."
{86873}{86990}"...to make you happy."
{87041}{87136}Susu! Susu!
{87137}{87214}Open the door, Susu!
{87341}{87387}I gave you a chance.
{87388}{87441}You didn't leave, so now I must take you.
{87442}{87527}Monk...Why are you intent on|destroying our happiness?
{87528}{87587}Susu! Who are you talking to?
{88745}{88783}Don't chase her!
{88784}{88832}She was stabbed with the spirit dagger.
{88833}{88911}Losing vital essence,|she can't take human form.
{88917}{89005}Master, where is my wife?
{89012}{89081}Did the white snake eat her?
{89082}{89131}The white snake was your wife.
{89132}{89216}You married a thousand|year-old snake demon.
{89305}{89345}Impossible!
{89403}{89449}Impossible!
{89498}{89544}Impossible!
{90653}{90751}Sister, I'll give you some of|my vital essence.
{90779}{90843}No, it's no use.
{90881}{90988}You have only a few centuries' worth.
{90989}{91131}That spirit dagger had thousands!
{91210}{91290}We were wrong to come here.
{91296}{91407}It wasn't worth it, to see you like this.
{91515}{91584}May be I shouldn't have done it...
{91641}{91706}But I have no regrets.
{91787}{91837}Only now do I know...
{91853}{91925}...what true love is.
{92005}{92051}Love...
{92052}{92123}Is it really so important?
{92222}{92266}Tell me...
{92267}{92338}How can I save Susu?
{92356}{92408}The one thing that might is spirit herb.
{92409}{92483}It can bring the dead back to life.
{92483}{92570}It only grows in the Lei Feng Pagoda.
{92570}{92646}A demon like me can't even get in there!
{92647}{92723}Plus, there is only a single sprout.
{92724}{92823}It is really, really scary.|They say that even the fire can't burn it!
{92848}{92920}Even if it takes braving swords and|seas of fire...
{92955}{93002}...I shall save Susu.
{93301}{93420}I can't take you any further.
{96065}{96207}You dare to steal the spirit herb? Thief!
{96559}{96633}Which is the real spirit herb?
{96634}{96709}You will know after your death.
{96724}{96803}I'll find even if it kills me!
{96839}{96909}I must save Susu!
{97101}{97193}{y:i}There's only a single sprout.|Fire can't even burn it!
{99381}{99411}They found us!
{99657}{99694}- Did you get the spirit herb?|- I did.
{99695}{99728}Then let's get out of here!
{99790}{99831}It's going to be disaster if they|catch you!
{99832}{99912}You take the spirit herb,|I'll distract them.
{100655}{100739}Demons have been confined in|Lei Feng Pagoda for aeons!
{100740}{100809}The spirit herb kept them trapped.
{100810}{100884}Your theft has caused a catastrophe!
{100885}{100972}Let me go! Why are you keeping me here?
{100973}{101010}I needed to save her!
{101011}{101052}I wounded Susu.
{101053}{101134}Master, let me go! Let me go!
{101135}{101186}I wounded Susu.
{101248}{101321}Master, we can't hold them much longer.
{101322}{101377}Call al the senior monks now!
{101378}{101433}We'll cast the Luohan spell!
{101611}{101655}I got the spirit herb!
{101735}{101785}Spirit herb? From where?
{101786}{101834}Xu Xian gave it to me.
{101861}{101886}Where is he?
{101919}{101985}The monks took him.
{102925}{102951}Disciples!
{102952}{103025}Seal the main hall with a maximum|protection spell!
{103227}{103266}Maximum protection in force!
{103267}{103356}Now we cast the spell!
{103357}{103422}Any interruption will kill him!
{104155}{104219}Leave! You trespass on hallowed ground!
{104220}{104264}Fahai, give my Xu Xian!
{104265}{104330}You should be thankful you aren't dead!
{104331}{104372}Why this further trouble?
{104373}{104438}Release him and I'll go at once.
{104439}{104493}He stole the spirit herb for you.
{104493}{104553}He's in great danger because|evil spirits possessed him!
{104554}{104614}Now, we're breaking your spell!
{104615}{104682}I possessed him?|That cannot be...
{104682}{104708}I want to see him.
{104709}{104786}He's in a life-or-death struggle.|Interrupting the ritual...
{104787}{104823}...will end his life...
{104824}{104890}...and threaten those around him.
{104891}{104967}Relations between humans and demons|can bring no good.
{104968}{104996}You...
{104997}{105085}You're just coming between|my sister and Xu Xian.
{105086}{105170}If you won't release him, I'll fight you!
{106665}{106740}If I don't leave here with Xu Xian,|I'll flood Jinshan!
{106741}{106825}You're selfish! How many lives|will you threaten?
{106831}{106921}I will be force to put an end|to you unless you stop.
{106921}{107015}Very well...You're forcing me!
{108915}{108977}Get the important ones first!
{108996}{109043}Quick!
{112970}{113112}Forward, brothers!|Charge!
{113182}{113244}Bite them!|Break their human chain!
{114229}{114298}Xu Xian! Xu Xian!
{114735}{114777}Xu Xian?
{114799}{114826}You...
{114863}{114909}It's me, Susu.
{114923}{114957}Susu?
{115095}{115159}Who is Susu?
{115277}{115339}I'm your wife.
{115357}{115401}When did I get married?
{115417}{115479}Do you remember how we met?
{115531}{115557}I...
{115686}{115803}Fahai, what horrible magic did you use|to make him forget me?
{115804}{115871}As I told you, evil spirits possessed him.
{115872}{115948}You broke in and disrupted the|Luohan spell!
{115949}{116029}You're the one who's harmed Xu Xian!
{116030}{116119}What Louhan spell? What possession?
{116120}{116174}You're making up!
{116175}{116245}You just want Xu Xian to leave me.
{116246}{116299}You're a monster!
{118308}{118334}Qingqing!
{119765}{119800}Brother Neng Ren!
{119960}{120092}Brother Neng Ren!
{120370}{120418}I've been a dharma defender all my life...
{120419}{120482}...to maintain natural order and|ethical conduct.
{120500}{120591}Why did the calamity happen instead?
{120623}{120688}Have I been too stubborn?
{120752}{120819}Was I really wrong?
{121454}{121513}Why is it...
{121541}{121609}...that every time I wake up...
{121636}{121705}...you're beside me?
{126623}{126682}Open the door! Let me out!
{126683}{126750}Let me see Xu Xian one more time!
{126751}{126845}I don't care if you turn me to dust|and scatter me.
{127116}{127210}The love we had...wan it not real?
{127289}{127377}Where is all your great benevolence now?
{127553}{127624}Can't we see each other just|one more?
{127743}{127795}Just once...
{127999}{128057}I'll accept my punishment.
{128149}{128244}Amitabha...
{128850}{128901}Your mercy is boundless...
{128939}{128991}I understand...
{128999}{129074}Amitabha...
{129800}{129856}Xu Xian!
{129926}{129987}You're suffering...
{129988}{130054}I don't recognize you...
{130086}{130141}...but for some reason I don't understand...
{130142}{130238}...when I see you shedding tears...
{130265}{130315}...my heart aches for you.
{130442}{130558}Don't be upset, I don't want you to cry.
{130583}{130650}I'll cry for both of us.
{130668}{130772}I don't mind that you've forgetten me.
{130809}{130877}My own memories are enough.
{130877}{130952}Before I first saw you...
{130953}{131027}...I meditated for a thousand years.
{131074}{131126}But those thousand years...
{131164}{131271}...were worth less than a moment with you.
{131314}{131369}You'll never know...
{131415}{131536}...how I've had to suffer.
{131536}{131602}But even if I die...
{131629}{131695}...I'll have no regrets.
{132734}{132817}Susu...
{132818}{133181}{y:i}Your hair tickles my heart
{133181}{133247}{y:i}Your eyes lingers in my mind
{133248}{133338}{y:i}I can bear any hardships to be with you
{133338}{133442}{y:i}Our love shall remain in dark
{133443}{133509}{y:i}year after year
{133510}{133562}{y:i}but nothing can change it
{133563}{133589}{y:i}Nothing at all
{133593}{133641}{y:i}I will be there
{133642}{133704}{y:i}If you are there
{133705}{133860}{y:i}I vow to live for you
{133868}{134031}{y:i}Because I can lose anthing but you
{134036}{134103}{y:i}Love is right
{134103}{134194}{y:i}If there is joy between us
{134194}{134271}{y:i}Our love shall survive
{134272}{134366}{y:i}longer than any time
{134367}{134496}{y:i}I vow to live for you
{134497}{134554}{y:i}till the end of time
{134555}{134667}{y:i}Because I can lose anything but you
{134668}{134760}{y:i}Love is right
{134761}{134853}{y:i}If the tortures on me are to|protect you
{134854}{134926}{y:i}Our love shall survive
{134927}{135042}{y:i}longer than any time
{135042}{135192}{y:i}And we'll meet again in our next lives
{135274}{135312}Susu...
{135540}{135680}For two of them that was probably|the best outcome.
{135681}{135824}I never want to love anyone|as she loved him.
{135825}{135948}You...you'll never be much good|as a demon.
{137383}{137454}Neng Ren...that new form you have...
{137455}{137495}It kind of suits you.
A hundred years ago, all was right with our world.
Prosperity and peace filled our days.
The Four Nations:
Water, Earth, Fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony.
Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element.
The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements.
He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World.
With the Spirits'guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world.
And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey!
It Worked better that time.
I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Yeah. I guess so.
Just stop doing that stuff around me.
I alWays get Wet.
My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city.
Our father is off fighting in The War.
My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young.
In this time of war, food is scarce.
My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.
- Tiger seal.
- Are you sure?
I did everything Dad said to do.
I Watched Which side of the fin tracks are more indented.
That shoWs Which direction they're going.
I saW hoW long the drag skids are.
That shoWs you hoW fast they're going.
There's something under there.
It's a cave-in!
Move aWay from the cracks!
Katara, don't go near it.
This is probably some Fire Nation trick.
Just back aWay really sloW.
Katara! Do not hit that sphere!
Uncle, look!
Is he breathing?
Did you see that light shoot into the sky?
What's your name?
HoW did you get here?
HoW did you get in the ice?
He's exhausted.
We need to get him back to the village.
What is this thing?
It's trying to eat me!
Look. See?
HoW'd you get all the Way out here?
I ran aWay from home.
We got in a storm. We Were forced under the Water of the ocean.
I see.
It Wasn't very smart. I Was just upset.
- Thanks for saving me.
- Lucky.
I probably should get home.
They'll all be Worried.
- You're not still upset?
- Not as much as I Was.
The Fire Nation is here.
- What?
- And they brought their machines.
Don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
- Is something Wrong?
- No. Please Wait here.
- Hurry, noW!
- Secure the area!
It can't be coincidence that We break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and noW the
Fire Nation is here With their machines.
Sokka, don't.
I am Prince Zuko...
...son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne!
Bring me all your elderly!
- Papa!
- Move!
Yeah?
Grandma!
Please don't... don't harm him!
Come on!
Katara, don't.
- Form a line!
- Come on!
Here.
Hey.
Grammy!
You're scaring these people.
Who are you? What's your name?!
- I don't need to tell you anything.
- Firebenders!
I'm taking you to my ship.
If you don't come,
I'll burn doWn this village.
I'll go With you.
Don't hurt anyone.
They Were looking for someone old and they Were looking for someone
With the same markings the boy had.
They dragged Mom aWay the same Way When We Were babies.
She Wouldn't have Watched us being taken aWay. She Would have fought.
We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight.
What Would you do if they tried to take me aWay?
I'd kill them all.
- Why?
- Because you're my sister.
Because Dad told me to protect you With my life.
Because I'm your responsibility.
And this boy is our responsibility.
What do you Want us to do, Katara?
HoW are We supposed to save him?
They're on a ship.
We'd need a miracle to catch them.
I knoW you think everything's going to Work out, but I don't.
His bison creature thing floats.
What do you Want With me?
My nepheW Wants me to perform a little test on you.
- What kind of test?
- I assure you, it Won't hurt.
I've performed it hundreds of times.
It only takes a feW moments.
And then you're free to go.
Would you mind if I put a feW things in front of you at the table?
It Will only take a moment.
That's all you Want?
My name is Iroh, and you have my Word.
Grandma, I knoW you're gonna try to stop us,
- but this is just something I need...
- Sit doWn.
I kneW from the first time
We discovered you Were a Bender, that one day,
I Would realize your destiny.
There hasn't been a Waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama Was taken aWay.
Today, I found out that destiny.
Did you see that boy's tattoos?
Tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century.
I believe they are Airbending tattoos.
HoW can that be?
I believe that little boy might be the Avatar.
Once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
What is the Spirit World, Grandma?
It's not a place made up of things you can touch.
But it exists, nonetheless.
It is filled With the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures...
...that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests.
Each of these creatures is a Spirit.
They've Watched over us since the beginning.
They have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
Aren't there Spirits here?
Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're Watching us
With great sadness...
The Fire Nation doesn't Wish to live by the Spirits.
That's Why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
- What can he do?
- With his mastery of the four elements, he Will begin to change hearts.
And it is in the heart that all Wars are Won.
NoW, go help this boy.
He Will need you tWo.
And We all need him.
You are my prisoner...
...Airbender.
I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
- You said...
- I apologize.
I should have explained further.
If you failed the test, as all others did, you Were free to leave.
But, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire World
Who could pass this test.
It is truly an honor to be in your presence.
Don't even try to escape.
This is a Warship!
Stop! There's no Way you can...
Don't move! You have noWhere to run!
Halt!
Don't let him escape!
Get him!
Thanks for bringing Appa to me.
The Fire Nation is up to something.
I have to go back noW.
- We'll come With you.
- I can take you back to the village.
We're going With you.
You found the Avatar.
For a moment, I had my honor back.
Your destinies are tied, Zuko.
That, you can be sure of.
Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned.
Aang Airbended a sphere around them, and ice formed.
And he couldn't remember anything after that.
Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back!
Hey, guys! I Want you to meet someone!
This is Where you live?
They must be playing some trick or something.
Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment.
He's the teacher responsible for me.
He's kind of like my father.
- Is it OK if you tell me your name?
- The monks named me Aang.
OK, guys! Enough!
Spider-rat!
They're poisonous! Get behind me.
He's a flying lemur-bat.
We keep them as pets.
Weren't they extinct a long time ago?
Extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
Your friends Were monks?
I knoW Where they are right noW.
They're at the prayer field!
Aang, Wait! I have to talk to you!
Aang...
...I think you Were in that ice for almost a hundred years.
- The Firebenders started a War.
- I left a feW days ago.
Aang, the Fire Nation kneW the Avatar
Would be born into the Air Nomads...
...so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
You're lying!
You're lying!
This is Monk Gyatso's.
I made it for him.
No!
Katara! Stay aWay from him!
Katara!
Stay away from him!
Your friends were monks?
The Avatar?
Where have you been?
Aang!
You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need!
Don't give up! We can do this together!
Aang!
The banished prince.
Let's offer him lunch.
I Wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining With us.
As you knoW, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the Prince, and renounced his love of him, and Will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar.
The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he Will become strong and become a Worthy heir to the throne.
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.
For example, it seems
I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not alloWed to Wear the Fire Nation uniform.
But We Will let him Wear it today, like a child Wearing a costume.
One day, my father Will take me back and you Will boW before me.
You OK?
I'll be fine.
You knoW, my grandma thinks because you're an Airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
HoW much does the Fire Nation control?
A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here.
They haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
So...
...are you the Avatar, Aang?
What is this?
Stay hidden.
- That child is being arrested.
- For What?
He Was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
He can bend earth?
Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
Leave him alone.
You're not taking him anywhere.
No one is taking anybody aWay!
She's a bender!
Katara!
Move.
You, too.
Dad!
- This is my father.
- Hello.
That's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
HoW did this happen to your village?
Fire Nation sent soldiers.
We fought them and defeated them.
Then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal.
There Was nothing We could do.
Those Who could not bend Were alloWed to live in peace, if We Were imprisoned.
Earthbenders!
Why are you acting this Way?
You are poWerful and amazing people!
You don't need to live like this!
There is earth right beneath your feet.
The ground is an extension of Who you are!
If the Avatar had returned...
...Would that mean anything to you?
The Avatar is dead.
If he Was here, he Would protect us.
My name is Aang...
...and I am the Avatar.
I ran aWay, but I'm back noW.
It's time for you to stop doing this!
The Avatar Would have to be an
Airbender. Are you an Airbender, boy?
Leave him alone!
HoW is he doing that?
I don't Want to hurt anyone.
All Airbenders should be dead.
Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
OK! Everybody can help us noW!
Don't be afraid!
Just leave them!
Fall back!
Go! He's an Airbender!
They took aWay any tools related to bending.
The Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
A Waterbending scroll.
This is rare.
My mom told me about these.
This Was you When you Were born an Earthbender, tWo lifetimes ago.
You came to our village.
Avatar Kyoshi loved games.
I do, too.
I mean, I still do.
A lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village Was.
They prey on the Weakest toWns and villages.
We should go visit some of these toWns, Aang.
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it, Aang?
I ran aWay before they trained me to be the Avatar.
I don't knoW hoW to bend the other elements.
Why did you run aWay?
The day they told me I Was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family.
They said it cannot Work With the responsibilities of the Avatar.
- Why can't the Avatar have a family?
- I asked that!
They said that's the sacrifice the Avatar alWays has to make.
OK. So, What if We found you teachers.
Teachers to teach you bending?
Which element Would you have to learn first?
Water. Water comes after Air in the cycle.
Air, Water, Earth, Fire.
But there are really poWerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe.
My dad told me about it before he left.
It's led by a princess because her father died.
There are teachers there, but all the Way on the other side of the World.
- We can get there on Appa.
- That's What I Was thinking.
And maybe We can stop in the villages on the Way, start a change in The War in these small villages.
- Should We try it?
- Yes, We should.
The scroll we had was proving to be helpful.
Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with Waterbending.
We moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom.
We tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.
Sire, I have good neWs.
As you knoW, I conducted a raid on the Great Library,
- Which most said didn't exist.
- Get on With it.
I found scrolls in the library.
We are deciphering them.
But I believe they may contain information as to Where the Ocean and Moon
Spirits live in this World.
With this information,
We could bring doWn the Northern Water Tribe city,
We could shoW the World the true strength of fire.
I am pleased.
Well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
Our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar.
They describe him as just a boy.
We should set a trap for this person.
We have many Earth Kingdom people under our control.
I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
- And my son?
- He had his chance. He missed it.
Let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar.
He Would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
Well, I suppose it's a race, then.
We're close, Uncle.
They've been moving farther and farther north.
We're catching them.
There are a lot of pretty girls in this toWn, Zuko.
You could fall in love here.
We could settle doWn here, and you could have a blessed life.
We don't have to continue this, Zuko.
I'll shoW you Why We must, Uncle.
Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
You look like a very smart boy.
Tell me What you knoW about the
Prince, the Fire Lord's son.
- He did something Wrong.
- He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends
Who Were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
Then Prince Zuko
Was sentenced to an Agni Kai duel, but When he shoWed up,
- it was his father he was to fight.
- That's right.
He would not fight his father.
Then his father mocked him and said,
"I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
Then the father burnt his son...
...to teach him a lesson.
We'll catch him soon, Uncle.
Then We can think about the pretty girls.
Aang...
Try to keep your Wrist bent, like it's shoWing.
What's Wrong?
You've really been distracted today.
I saW Sokka's maps.
We're near the Northern Air Temple.
Do you think it Would be OK if I just visited there and came back?
- I'd be back in less than a day.
- Why?
He had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field.
He talked to a Dragon Spirit
Who he thinks can help us.
He thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
I don't think that's a good idea.
We started a rebellion.
Try to talk him out of it.
I can't do this.
I need help.
- I guess your talk didn't Work.
- He'll be back in a day.
The Fire Nation is folloWing us. If We make a Wrong move, they'll catch him.
Who are you?
Why, it cannot be!
I've heard stories. Are you?
My name is Aang.
I cannot believe
I've lived to see your return.
I'm an Earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
The Fire Nation destroyed this temple.
They have ruined everything.
No, no, no, not everything.
You knoW, there's a hidden chamber of statues
I think you, of all people, should see.
These are all the Avatars.
These are the reincarnations of you over the years.
The Avatar Roku Was your last life.
NoW, hoW did the Airbenders knoW you Were the Avatar, little one?
They gave me a test.
They put 1,000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four.
They said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars.
That's When they told me
I could have no family.
Told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations.
There's a ceremony
When everyone boWs to me.
That's When I accept my role as the Avatar.
But When everyone boWed...
...I didn't boW back.
You seem like a nice young man.
You really do.
You Will forgive me, Won't you?
- For What?
- For luring you doWn here.
I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.
So you Will understand my actions today.
I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.
I have seen a vision of the moon turning red.
The Fire Nation has stolen knoWledge of us from the Great Library.
They are planning to misuse this knoWledge.
I Will stop them.
You must go to the Northern Water Tribe.
If they take that city, more Will suffer and die, as your Airbenders have.
You must go noW!
Will I stop them?
Wake up, young man!
My name is Commander Zhao.
I set this trap for you.
Don't Worry, I'm not gonna kill you.
Besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search Would continue.
So Where have you been all this time?
And hoW is it that you're still a boy?
I understand that When you freed that handful of toWns, you Were very impressive, but...
...you only used Airbending against my soldiers.
NoW, Why is that?
The Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the doWnfall of our enemies.
I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.
Who are you?
Wait! Don't!
Stop!
Fools.
Close the inner gates!
The Avatar has escaped!
Lock doWn the gate!
Lock doWn all the gates!
To the main post!
This Was their practice area.
Go again!
Do not kill the Avatar!
He Will just be reborn again!
Why are you doing this? Who are you?
Open the gates.
Let them out!
- Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
- Not at all.
Do it.
What is this?
And hoW did he escape?
I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor.
Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
You think...
...my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Yes.
Zhao's men Were searching the coast, looking for you.
They also searched the ship.
I told them you Went on vacation With a girl.
Where Were you the past four days?
NoWhere.
We have to keep moving.
The Avatar is traveling again.
Take rest first.
It looks like you
Went through a great deal.
When you Wake, We'll have tea together before We start the engines.
Do not harm my son.
Leave him to his isolation.
You have my word, sire.
I will not harm him.
Zuko!
And what of the Avatar?
We assume he has rejoined with his supporters.
It has been confirmed that he's traveling north.
It is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.
I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, Air.
I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water.
He's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice Waterbending.
We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe.
We presented ourselves to the royal court.
My brother and the princess became friends right away.
Aang showed them he was the last Airbender, and was accepted to train with the master.
The city knew our arrival would bring great danger.
And they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.
The city Was designed to Withstand any assault.
If We keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls,
Where We have the advantage,
We Will succeed.
If We let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us.
As many fires in this city should be put out as possible When the alarm sounds.
We Want to minimize their bender sources.
I must assign a guard to be With you at all times, Princess.
Your presence is our inspiration.
I'll do it. That's me.
I'll be her guard.
Nothing Will happen to her.
I had a feeling you might volunteer.
I've heard no word of my son for quite some time.
- Do you know where he is?
- I've not heard of anything, sire.
I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
The Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
They Will be difficult to defeat.
NoW, if for some reason the Spirits Were not involved, that Would be different.
What have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
We have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
It is our destiny to have found this information, Zhao.
Eliminate the Spirits, take the city and We Will have thWarted the Avatar in the process.
Water is What?
The floWing element.
The element of change.
To master Water, you must release your emotions,
Wherever they may lead you.
Water teaches us acceptance.
Let your emotions floW like Water.
Aang, Would you like to spar?
You haven't sparred in a feW days.
NoW, use offense, Aang!
General Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us
- on this historic event.
- Your invitation Was most gracious.
You are a gifted strategist.
No one can argue that.
Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se Won't be held against you.
Your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
Again, I offer my condolences on your nepheW burning to death in that terrible accident.
Thank you.
I've loved spending these Weeks With you, Sokka.
Me, too.
Should We see What the ocean is doing today?
When there is some safety for all of us,
I Will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
That Would be great.
But I Warn you...
...my grandmother Will ask you a lot of questions.
What might she ask me?
She'll say, "Why is your hair White, young lady? You look very odd."
I Would say to your grandmother, my hair is White because When I Was born
I Was not aWake.
My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move.
So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred Waters.
My parents said that my hair turned
White then and life poured into me.
WoW.
You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask me.
Only your grandmother did.
I'm sure Zhao Was the one
Who ordered the attack on you.
Any problems?
We have arrived at the Northern
Water Tribe's stronghold.
They believe the boy is there.
Why do you seem upset, Uncle?
Zhao has no sacredness.
Are you sure you Want to be here?
I Will not be alloWed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father!
Is that not clear to you?
What is this?
Yue...
...the Fire Nation is here.
NoW be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck.
And remember, your Chi can Warm you.
I knoW, Uncle.
Be safe.
Aang needs to ask you something.
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.
He can help me defeat the Fire Nation.
Is there a spiritual place
Where I can meditate?
There is a very spiritual place.
The city Was built around this place.
But we must hurry.
Momo, be nice.
To get your Airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time Without losing focus.
Some of the great monks can meditate for four days.
- I have to get back.
- I'll take you.
I'll stay With him.
Aang?
Aang, can you hear me?
I kneW you Were real.
I alWays kneW you'd return.
Me, too.
The Fire Lord's son.
You took him from our village.
Who are you?
My name is Katara, and I'm the only Waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.
- Go for the children.
- Yes.
I'm not alloWed to go home Without him.
The Waterbenders get poWer from the moon.
They Will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
General Iroh,
I've been keeping a secret.
And What is that?
In my raid of the Great Library earlier this year,
I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
To meet a Spirit Would be a great honor.
Well, I hope I can give you that honor.
What happened?
What happened?
Prince Zuko's here in the city.
He took Aang again.
We'll just Wait till everyone's fighting everyone.
Then in the night, We'll slip out.
Aang, can you hear me?
I knew you were real.
I always knew you'd return.
Hello! Hello!
Please, tell me hoW to beat the Fire Nation!
You are not dealing
With the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths.
You are stopping yourself from grieving.
You are angry.
You must let this go.
As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others.
Use the ocean.
ShoW them the poWer of Water.
Go! Do this noW.
My sister Azula was always the special one.
She Was a Firebending prodigy.
My father loves her.
He can't even look at me sometimes.
He says I'm like my mother.
I advise that you pull back your men soon.
They Will be trapped in the city
When the moon's poWer comes out.
Do not Worry about the moon's poWer,
General Iroh.
Why should you not be Worried about the moon's poWer?
Because your brother,
Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
What?
Calm doWn. We'll find him.
Are you OK?
Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me.
I knoW What to do.
Aang, We have to go.
You Won't be killed by Waterbenders if you stay hidden here.
We could be friends, you knoW.
They're getting stronger.
This is a scroll from the Great Library.
This is our map.
Our World is going to change soon, gentlemen.
Right there and right there.
See Where they're going!
I'll go join the fight!
They are called many names:
Yin and Yang, push and pull.
May I introduce you to the mysterious
Ocean and Moon Spirits?
Why do Spirits take the form of such benign things?
It leaves them so vulnerable.
To teach man kindness and humility.
Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper With.
The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.
What are you doing here?
Stop, Zhao.
The World Will go out of balance.
Everyone Will be hurt.
The Fire Nation is too poWerful to Worry about children's superstitions,
General Iroh.
Commander Zhao, don't.
We are noW the gods!
No!
Man all battle stations!
You are too soft, General Iroh.
He's making fire out of nothing!
They're breaching the Wall!
To the front!
As the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others.
You must show them the power of Water.
All is lost.
You have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
- He gave me life When I Was a child.
- Then there is still a chance.
You can give your life back for the Spirit's.
- Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
- Nothing is ever truly lost.
- Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
- There are reasons each of us are born.
We have to find those reasons.
- This Was the reason I Was born.
- Yue, please.
There is no love Without sacrifice.
Yue, What are you doing?
You don't knoW What Will happen.
I believe my life force Will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
And then What?
My soul Will no longer exist in this form.
Please don't do this.
There must be another Way.
I can't let you do this.
I'm supposed to protect you.
My people are dying, Sokka.
Those Who are in charge of others have a responsibility.
It is time We shoW the Fire Nation
We believe in our beliefs
- as much as they believe in theirs.
- But Yue...
I'm scared.
Don't make me any more scared.
I Will miss you more than you knoW.
I killed you.
Come aWay from him, nepheW.
There are too many soldiers noW.
They Will never let you take the Avatar.
We must leave immediately.
He Wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko.
Walk aWay!
Come!
You stand alone.
And that has alWays been your great mistake.
Water teaches us acceptance.
Let your emotions flow like water.
Aang?
They Want you to be their Avatar, Aang.
We all do.
Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city.
General Zhao Was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor.
My son's proven himself a failure.
NoW, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years.
It Will give all Firebenders the ability of the highest Firebenders, the ability to use their oWn Chi to create Fire.
That is the day We Will Win this War and prove the Fire Nation's dominance.
NoW you must stop the Avatar from mastering Earth and Fire.
You must give us the time to get to that day.
Do you accept this unspeakably important task
I'm putting in your hands?
I do, Father.
