Once upon a time, a long time ago, a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed by a terrible curse.
By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.
Only true love's kiss could lift her curse.
So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.
But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.
Whoa, there.
I don't know about this, Lillian.
Fairy Godmother said only true love's kiss could break Fiona's curse.
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.
Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.
But to put our daughter's life in the hands of this... person?
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...
Rumpelstiltskin!
Mrs. Highness.
How do you do?
Down, Fifi. Get down!
As you can see, everything's in order.
So you'll put an end to our daughter's curse?
And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me.
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?
Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long.
It's not like she's getting any younger.
But to sign over our entire kingdom?
Well, if your kingdom's worth more to you than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.
Jump, Fifi, jump!
Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!
Who saved her?
No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.
True love's kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!
The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace.
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!
Sir? You're gonna have to pay for that.
Maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?
Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!
I wish that ogre was never born!
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.
Better out than in.
That's my line.
Did my little Fergus make a...
...big, grownup ogre stink?!
Oh, that's diabolical!
And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop...
...and finally, into the castle.
Play date!
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
Happily...
- Ever...
- After.
Look! A shooting star!
So, what did you wish for?
That every day could be like this one.
Come here, you.
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.
Better out than in.
Did my little Fergus make a...
Cute. Real cute.
This lovable lug taught us you don't have to change your undies to change the world!
Play date!
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!
She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After?
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...
- Play date!
- No!
Outhouse again!
Come on.
Undies!
Outhouse!
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...
- Happily...
- Ever...
After.
Roar.
Nice landing, baby.
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.
Happy birthday, niños!
Vamos a la fiesta!
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!
Mr. Shrek, would you sign our pitchforks?
And our torches?
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!
A real ogre?
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
Why does being your best friend entail me doing everything I don't want to do?
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?
Could you do that ogre roar of yours for my son?
He's a big, big fan.
Do the roar.
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.
- Do the roar.
- Honey?
Why don't you go check on the cake?
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.
Hold still.
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!
Your cake. Voilà!
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!
I'm in a great mood, actually.
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!
As long as you're not doing anything, how about one of those famous Shrek roars?
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.
An ogre only roars when he's angry.
You don't want to see me angry, do you?
Do it.
Hold it together. Just hold it together.
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.
Oh, good.
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.
- You licked it!
- No.
Just because you're an ogre, doesn't mean you have to eat like one.
Looks like you forgot the candles!
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.
Watch the cake?
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.
- Ya.
- What?
No, don't cry.
Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.
- Do the roar.
- Roar.
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.
No, I ate them.
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.
We need the cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake!
I love you, Daddy.
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.
Is this really how you want to remember the kids' first birthday?
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?
Let's talk about this after the party, at home.
You mean that roadside attraction we live in?
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, OK, maybe you're not the ogre you used to be.
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.
And the other half locked away in a tower.
Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace.
When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it!
Back when the world made sense!
You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?
Exactly!
Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you.
You have everything.
Why is it the only person who can't see that is you?
That's just great.
If she thinks I'm gonna slink back there and apologize, she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize for acting like one.
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!
Please, help!
Please, help!
I'm stuck! Help!
Oh, please, help!
Someone, anyone! Help me!
The pain! I can see a bright light. A tunnel!
Grandma? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Granny.
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre, please don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.
Look, move out or get crushed.
So you're not gonna eat me?
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?
Nowhere.
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.
But, seriously, letme give you a ride. I insist.
Come on. It's the least I can do after all you've done for me.
I got a hot rat cooking.
AII right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?
A liquid libation to ease that frustration?
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.
To live the life of an ogre... no worries, no responsibilities.
You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?
Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.
Why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty!
Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.
Hold on.
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.
You'll be, like, "Roar!"
And the villagers will be, like, "Get away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"
It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle.
- When the world made sense.
- AII right, what's the catch?
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
AII right, I knew it.
So what do you want?
- A day.
- A day.
Rat's done!
To make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something.
In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That's all.
I can't just pick up and leave my family.
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.
No one will even know you're gone.
And by the time this day is up, you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Still, I don't know.
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.
Do you like white meat or dark meat?
So what day would I have to give up?
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?
A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it didn't belong destroying your business and ruining your life?!
Just for an example.
How about the day I met Donkey?
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.
I don't know who that is.
I know. What about a day you wouldn't even remember?
Like a day when you were a baby.
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.
I guess there's nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.
Just 24 tiny little hours.
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!
I never needed to ask for anyone's permission before.
So why start now?
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it!
Go on, Shrek.
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!
You signed it.
So, tell me. What happens now?
Have a nice day.
I think I fell on my keys.
There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day.
Oh, great.
As we head over the river and through the woods...
Ogre!
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!
This is the part where you run away!
Sure is great to be wanted again.
Nice one.
Fiona?
Oh, no.
My home.
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you in there?!
AII right, Rumpel!
This wasn't part of the deal!
Rumpel!
Ogre!
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!
Who are you?!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Looks like a troublemaker!
Spread 'em!
Nice job, ladies!
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut your mouth!
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?
Donkey!
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.
I'm driving, so I'm in charge of the music.
Will you witches make up your mind?
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me in trouble and I need this job.
I am not going back to work for OId MacDonald.
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?
Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!
And how do you know my name anyway?
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?
A donkey and an ogre friends?
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!
Can you at least tell me where they're taking me?
To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!
Oh, no.
It's time to crumble!
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!
Yeah!
Gingy?
Gingy snap!
There's one!
Disgusting, filthy ogre!
Hideous monster!
Filthy, filthy creature!
Disgusting creature!
Move it!
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!
Mr. Stiltskin?
You got another customer.
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me my business wig.
Mr. Stiltskin, please!
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!
Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy.
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
Stiltskin!
Shrek!
There he is!
So close!
Have I been waiting for you!
Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?
AII right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.
They would never do that.
They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.
And then they disappeared!
They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter's curse.
I ended Fiona's curse!
How could you when you never existed?
You better start making sense, you dirty little man!
Here, letme spell it out for you!
You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn't even remember.
A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.
You took the day I was born.
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up...
But you haven't heard the best part.
Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.
Where's Fiona?
Where's my family?
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?
You see, you were never born.
You never met Fiona.
Your kids don't exist.
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?
Looks like you got exactly what you wanted!
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!
Get him, witches!
You know what'd help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.
Come on, girls!
Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! Do it!
I'll be right back, Donkey!
I don't know you! I don't know him!
I'm glad I'm not you.
Help me! Help!
Help!
No, not my pretty ball!
Watch out!
Wolfie?
My angry wig.
Help! I've been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!
Donkey! Get off of me!
Watch it with your pointy hooves!
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!
I'm being ass-napped!
Animal cruelty! Help!
You need to calm down!
I'm your friend.
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
Good. I'm gonna letgo...
...right... now.
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!
Donkey! You've got to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...
Because...
OK.
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?
I've never seen an ogre cry.
I'm not crying.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.
Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, or a little baby grandma kitten.
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.
It's none of my business why you're upset.
By the way, why are you upset?
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.
You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?
No. I signed this.
You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!
Yeah, I got that.
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.
Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I've read the fine print.
There's nothing about an exit clause in here.
Well, you didn't expect him to make it easy for you.
Here, letme show you how it's done.
I didn't spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks.
Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn't begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.
What are you doing?
Hey, I can't get my origami on unless you back off.
Thank you. OK, here's what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do. There!
"Try Lou's Bliss."
Who's Lou?
Give me that!
"True Love's Kiss."
You have to take me to dinner first.
"According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love's kiss will render this contract null and void."
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?
Well, that's just it, you see.
I don't know.
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.
So... where did you leave her last?
The last time I saw her,
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!
They keep dragons in there!
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!
I'm gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!
Fiona!
Oh, no.
If I didn't save Fiona...
...then who did?
This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.
Now smell it!
Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling.
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog, not Donkey!
And another thing...
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.
Luscious and tasty.
Hey! That's my wife you're talking about.
Donkey!
Yeah! Waffles!
And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story.
Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!
Donkey! Don't eat that!
There's a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest.
Don't you find that a wee bit suspicious?
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.
You did.
Look out!
Donkey!
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Donkey.
Help! Help me!
Help, Shrek! Help!
Watch your head.
Hey, it's a new guy!
Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.
He's really tiny, isn't he?
Yeah. Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Hey!
- Here you go.
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?
We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!
I didn't know we could do that.
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.
Trust me, you don't want to eat this one.
I go down smooth, but come out fighting!
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.
Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!
- She's back.
- There she is.
Fiona!
I'm so happy I found you!
Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me.
You don't know who I am, do you?
No.
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.
Gather the others and meet me in the war room.
Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
OK, I know you don't remember me, but...
...we're married. Hear me out.
And at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."
Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Right? Who's with me?
I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.
Fiona, I need to...
Witches! AII right, everyone, you know the drill!
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.
Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!
Some people like to look at the goblet as... as half empty.
Me, I like to look at it as half full.
We've gone from the bottom to the top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We're a family.
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?
Good.
Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres.
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Except... funny thing.
Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek!
And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it is the end of the world! Our world!
My empire!
But, as I was saying,
I like to look at the goblet as half full.
Yelling makes me so parched.
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...
...of agua purificada?
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?
Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it's going to take to get this ogre? You.
Faster brooms?
- No!
- Pointier hats?
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?
What a world! What a world!
You know, actually not a bad idea. Baba!
I need a bounty hunter.
And if music doth soothe the savage beast...
...then I think I might know just the person!
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.
Stiltskin is leading tonight's ogre hunt himself.
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?
I bet that's because of us.
If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest...
...he'll be vulnerable.
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route, they'll reach the river by midnight.
We'll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan.
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.
And then we attack!
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?
That's my chimichanga stand.
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, OK?
Go and finish your little speech.
AII right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears,
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten.
Far Far Away will finally be free.
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.
How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?
Actually, I was talking about the revolution.
Revolution?
Why don't you just tell her what you told me?
About how you're her true love and you came from an alternate universe.
Well, while I'm at it, why don't I tell her that you're married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.
I do?!
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
I'm a daddy?
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...
...then I can do it again.
Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?
Donkey...!
Hello?
Fiona?
You should not be here, señor.
Puss?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Feed me, if you dare.
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...
-...fancy.
- Do I know you?
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?
Your wee little boots?
Boots? For a cat? Ha!
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once.
But that is a name I have outgrown.
That's not the only thing you've outgrown.
Hey! I may have letmyself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life.
I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.
I'll get him later.
Puss, what have I done to you?
You've gone soft.
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.
Look, it's not too late to fix it.
AII you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?
Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be...
...rallying the troops, planning attacks, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension.
A gift basket?
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.
Heart-shaped box of slugs.
Skunk-scented candle.
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.
Look, I don't know what this is all about, but I'm trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,
I suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself useful!
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
An apologetic hug?
And a quick kiss goodbye.
Hey!
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?
Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?
I am.
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.
Honk.
AII right, Piggies, be gone!
Don't forget to take her little potty box with you.
This little piggy wants to go home!
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Good.
You call this guy a bounty hunter?
What's he gonna do, flute those ogres a lullaby?
OK, got it!
Make it stop!
AII right, that's enough.
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.
Griselda, seriously, it's time to pay the piper.
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!
Things are getting real sloppy around here!
Here, now make sure they eat up!
You can't end tyranny on an empty stomach! Go on! Go!
Din-din!
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?
AII right, but this is the last time.
Here it comes. Look at him.
I see you!
That's quite a friend you've got there.
I can see why you haven't eaten him.
Donkey! I hate to pull you away from your adoring public, but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.
Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.
That's a good one, Cookie!
Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain't gonna work on her.
Works on me.
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.
- To the cause!
- To the cause!
AII right!
Hello!
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational... op.
This one taken?
We use that to clean the toilets.
And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.
I knew that.
There you go, chief.
Hey... Scott?
My name is Shrek, actually.
You're going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...
Well, let's see about that.
Hey! Hey... Hey!
What the...?
Fiona?
I got it.
Give me your hand.
The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...
Into the castle.
Wow.
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!
AII right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed!
Preparation is half the battle!
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!
Ogre, ogre, un momento!
Just give me a minute.
Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.
I am not believing what I have just witnessed.
Back there, you and Fiona.
There was a spark... a spark inside her heart
I thought was long extinguished.
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!
I am her true love. I ended her curse.
You know of her curse?
By day, one way, by night another.
This shall be the norm.
Until you find true love's first kiss...
...and then take love's true form.
You even know the little rhyme!
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!
- How?
- Convince her!
Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know.
Know about what?!
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?
Excuse me. Coming through!
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.
Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick!
Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!
And you are ri-donkey-lous!
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.
Secure your positions!
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!
Get back in position!
You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.
You are going to ruin everything!
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
How do you know about my curse?!
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.
I can explain everything.
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.
Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.
I know everything about you.
I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?
I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.
I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes...
...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.
But, most importantly, Fiona...
...I know that the reason you turn human every day...
...is because you've never been kissed...
...well...
...by me.
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!
No, I can't stop myself!
Please! Make it stop!
I can't control myself!
Yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!
Oh, no! It's the Piper!
I can't believe I letthis happen, and it's all because of you!
- If you'd just letme kiss you!
- What? You're insane!
We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!
Then it's up to me!
Hurry! We must get them away from the music!
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?
Say what?!
No. Hell...
I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.
AII right!
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.
Puss, say something.
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
That's how you knew so much about me.
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?
It's the only way to save your friends.
Get out of my way.
You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss was supposed to fix everything!
Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too.
True love didn't get me out of that tower.
I did. I saved myself.
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!
How would you know?
Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep?
Did you live all alone in a miserable tower?
Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!
But... But I'm your true love.
Then where were you when I needed you?
Maybe you kissed her wrong?
No.
The kiss didn't work...
...because Fiona doesn't love me.
Don't despair, fellow ogres!
They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!
Shrek and Fiona are together?!
Yeah, I've heard enough of your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!
Wolfie! My speech wig.
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.
Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...
...shepherd of your dreams.
Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.
And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!
That is why I come to you, dear citizens.
For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.
Just think of it! Total and
- complete happiness.
- Ya!
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
AII your greatest wishes.
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.
So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Go back where you came from!
It seems that we are safe.
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There's no day after that, and there's no day after that day after that!
My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!
If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?
Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! AII right?
I didn't know what I had.
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!
Gingy?
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?
Collecting my bounty!
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?
Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?
Where all your wishes come true.
Wait a minute.
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
Were you going to eat that?
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
AIso not Shrek.
That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try.
- And that...
- Roar.
...is just sad.
And what is that supposed to be?
I'm just a frightened old man.
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!
That is your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek! Honest!
Take them away!
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!
Stiltskin!
I hear you're looking for me.
AII right! Finally!
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?
- I do.
- What? But...
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.
That means you have to give me anything I want.
No! Only true love's kiss can break your contract!
So if you thought you were just gonna...
-...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.
Then what do you want?
The ogres. They are all free.
But where is Shrek?
This is not good.
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.
The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.
AII that matters is that they're free...
...and Fiona is safe.
I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that.
But, hey...
...I guess you can tell her yourself.
Fiona!
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!
Oh, yeah.
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.
Nobody's smart but me!
That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek.
Thank you.
No, you were right.
I wasn't there for you.
And not just at the Dragon's Keep, but...
...every day since.
Well...
...you're here now.
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!
Don't be a fool, mule!
She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter
- than OId Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.
Hey! We can hear you!
Sorry!
We must get into the palace.
Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!
But how?
The same way we're gonna bust in.
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?
I guess it'll have to do.
Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for.
The main event of the evening!
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past behind us once and for all,
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!
Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...
...Dragon!
- Donkey?
- And Puss!
In Boots!
Get them, get them, witches!
Incoming!
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?
Your wife!
Uh-oh.
I'll call you! We're in love!
Fiona, hold on!
Hey, you!
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!
Jump!
Now!
The dragon goes under the bridge!
Through the loop!
And finally...
Into the castle!
Run!
Foo!
So long!
Come on, Fifi, go!
Go! Witches, close up the floor!
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!
Come on, go! FIy away! Up, up! Go!
Fifi, no!
Victory is ours!
Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
You have no idea.
Shrek?
His day is up. His day is...!
Shrek?
It's all right.
There has to be something I can do.
You've already done everything for me, Fiona.
You gave me a home and a family.
You have kids?
We have kids.
Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...
-...Felicia.
- Felicia.
I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.
And someday...
...you will.
You know what the best part of today was?
I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.
Fiona, the sunrise!
You're still... an ogre!
- True love's form.
- Impossible!
The kiss worked.
What?!
Fifi!
Puss!
No, no, no!
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!
I love you, Daddy!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Everybody, I have found another cake!
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona. I've never been better.
Roar!
Happy Birthday, Farkle.
Fergus, my little man!
And Felicia, sweetheart.
I believe this is yours.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!
Please, señor, letus have it!
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!
You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.
You did.
No. It was you that rescued me.
Yummy!
English .srt Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
This is Berk.
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a few degrees south of freezing to death.
It's located solidly on the meridian of misery.
My village. In a word, sturdy.
It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new.
We have fishing, hunting and a charming view of the sunsets.
The only problems are the pests.
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.
We have...
...dragons.
Most people would leave. Not us.
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.
My name is Hiccup.
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls.
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
Morning!
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!
That's Stoick the Vast, chief of the tribe.
When he was a baby, he popped a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.
What have we got?
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.
Good.
Hoist the torches!
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.
They wouldn't know what to do with all this.
They need toothpicks, don't they?
The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber.
I've been his apprentice since I was little. Well, littler.
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.
Hurry! 
See? Old village, lots and lots of new houses.
Fire!
Let's go!
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...
...and...
...Astrid.
Their job is so much cooler.
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.
You've made plenty of marks, all in the wrong places.
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.
You can't even throw one of these!
OK, fine, but this will throw it for me.
See? Now this right here is what I'm talking about!
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!
If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons...
...you need to stop all this.
But you just pointed to all of me.
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.
Oh, yes.
You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.
Keeping this much raw Vikingness contained?
There will be consequences!
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...
...is everything around here.
A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed.
Gronckles are tough.
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.
A Zippleback?
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.
They found the sheep!
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.
- Hurry up!
- Fire!
And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.
Only the best Vikings go after those.
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.
Reload! I'll take care of this.
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!
Get down!
Jump!
This thing never steals food, never shows itself and...
...never misses.
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.
Stay. Put. There.
You know what I mean.
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!
Let's get him!
Mind yourselves!
The devils still have some juice in them!
Come on. Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!
Did anybody see that?
Except for you.
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!
You're all out.
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know.
Sorry, Dad.
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...
Stop!
Just stop.
Every time you step outside, disaster follows.
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding.
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just kill it.
It's who I am, Dad.
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.
I have his mess to clean up.
Quite the performance.
I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped.
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.
When he does, it's with this disappointed scowl, like someone skimped on meat in his sandwich.
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side.
This here, this is a talking fishbone."
You're thinking about this wrong.
It's not so much what you look like, it's what's inside that he can't stand.
Thank you for summing that up.
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.
I just want to be one of you guys.
Either we finish them or they'll finish us!
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!
One more search before the ice sets in.
Those ships never come back.
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me?!
Count me out.
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.
All right. Those who stay will look after Hiccup.
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!
That's more like it.
I'll pack my undies.
No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits.
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades, lots of time to himself.
What could possibly go wrong?
What am I going to do with him, Gobber?
Put him in training.
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.
He'd be killed before the first dragon is out of its cage.
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.
No, you don't.
Listen, you know what he's like.
From the time he could crawl, he's been... different.
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for trolls!
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.
But only the left ones.
What's with that?
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.
...my father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it.
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.
That rock split in two.
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas!
Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become.
Hiccup is not that boy.
You can't stop him, Stoick.
You can only prepare him.
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't always be around to protect him.
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.
Oh, the gods hate me.
Some people lose their knife or their mug. Not me.
I manage to lose an entire dragon.
Oh, wow. I did it.
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!
I have brought down this mighty beast!
I'm going to kill you, dragon.
Then I'll cut out your heart and take it to my father.
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!
I did this.
Hiccup.
Dad...
...I have to talk to you, Dad.
I need to speak with you, too, son.
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.
- What?
- What?
- You go first.
- No, you go first.
All right.
You get your wish. Dragon training... you start in the morning.
Oh, man, I should have gone first.
I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?
You'll need this.
I don't want to fight dragons.
Come on. Yes, you do.
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.
But you will kill dragons.
No, I'm really very extra-sure that I won't.
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?
This is serious, son.
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.
Which means you walk like us, you talk like us...
...you think like us.
No more of... this.
You just gestured to all of me.
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.
Deal?
Deal.
Good.
Train hard.
I'll be back. Probably.
And I'll be here.
Maybe.
Welcome to dragon training!
No turning back.
I hope I get some serious burns.
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or back.
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
Yeah, no kidding, right?
Pain. Love it.
Oh, great. Who let him in?
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?
Don't worry. You're small and weak... that'll make you less of a target.
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.
Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight!
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.
The Hideous Zippleback.
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.
Can you stop that?!
And the Gronckle.
Jaw strength 8.
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?
I believe in learning on the job.
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...
...you're dead!
What's the first thing you'll need?
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield!
If you must choose between a sword or a shield, take the shield!
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!
Take that one. It has a flower... girls like flowers.
Oops, this one has blood on it.
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?
Shields are good for another thing.
Noise! Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim!
All dragons have a limited number of shots.
How many does a Gronckle have?
- Five?
- No, six!
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!
Fishlegs, out!
Hiccup, get in there!
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.
You look like you work out.
Snotlout! You're done!
So it's just you and me, huh?
Nope, just you.
One shot left!
Hiccup!
And that's six.
Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!
You'll get another chance, don't you worry.
Remember, a dragon will always, always go for the kill.
So... why didn't you?
This was stupid.
Why don't you just fly away?
All right, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.
Where did Hiccup go wrong?
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.
He's never where he should be.
Thank you, Astrid.
You need to live and breathe this stuff. The dragon manual.
Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
No attacks tonight. Study up.
Wait, you mean read?
While we're still alive?
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one...
Yeah. That sounds great.
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.
Another one has spines like trees.
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...
...tomorrow.
Dragon classifications.
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous.
Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.
Night Fury.
Speed unknown. Size unknown.
The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
Never engage this dragon.
Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you.
I can almost smell them.
They're close.
Steady.
Take us in.
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.
Hard to port!
Steady!
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies.
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!
Today it's all about attack!
Nadders are quick and light on their feet.
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods!
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.
Find it, hide in it and strike!
Do you ever bathe?
If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.
How about I give you one?
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.
Hey, so, how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
No one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Get in there!
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!
Get down.
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
What do you want me to do, block out the sun?
I could do that but I don't have time!
They probably...
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.
Has anyone ever seen one napping?
Hiccup!
Love on the battlefield.
She could do better.
Let me... Why don't you?
Well done, Astrid.
Is this some kind of a joke to you?
Our parents' war is about to become ours.
Figure out which side you're on.
Toothless.
I could have sworn you had...
...teeth.
No, no, no.
I don't have any more!
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole!
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg.
Isn't it weird to think your hand was inside a dragon?
Like if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from inside by crushing his heart.
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.
It's the wings and the tails you really want.
If it can't fly, it can't get away.
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.
Tomorrow we get to the big boys, slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare.
But who'll win the honor of killing it?
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?
Your mom let you get a tattoo?
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.
OK, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me from the left side.
Hey, Toothless.
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.
OK, that's disgusting.
We've got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod...
...and a whole smoked eel.
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.
Yeah, I don't really like eel much, either.
That's it.
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.
It's OK.
OK.
That's not too bad. It works.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my! It's working!
Yes, yes! I did it!
Yeah!
Today is about teamwork.
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.
One head breathes gas, the other head lights it.
Your job is to know which is which.
Razor-sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion.
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims...
Will you please stop that?!
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...
There!
Hey, it's us, idiots!
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.
Not that there's anything wrong with a dragonesque figure.
Wait.
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Chances of survival are dwindling to single digits now.
Wrong head.
Fishlegs!
Now, Hiccup!
Oh, come on.
Hiccup!
Back, back, back!
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got some things I need to...
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.
Meet the Terrible Terror.
It's like the size of my...
Get it off!
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Wow! He's better than you ever were.
Oh, great.
Hiccup.
Hiccup? Are you in there?
Astrid. Hey.
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.
Well, weirder.
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.
Excellent.
I hope you had more success than me.
Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over, yes.
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!
Out with the old and in with the new, right?
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!
- Come over here.
- Hurry!
He's gone?
Most afternoons, but who can blame him? The life of a celebrity's rough.
He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.
Hiccup?
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.
Here we go. Here we go. Position...
...three... no, four.
All right, it's go time. It's go time.
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!
Yes, it worked!
Sorry!
It was my fault.
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.
Three.
Yeah! Go, baby!
Yes!
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!
Stop!
No!
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!
All right, OK, you've gotta kind of angle yourself.
OK, no, no, no. Come back down towards me! Come back down...
Yeah!
Come on.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?
Here you go.
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...
I know.
- I came looking for you.
- You did?
You've been keeping secrets.
I have?
Just how long did you think you could hide it?
I don't know what you're...
Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
So...
...let's talk...
...about that dragon.
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.
I just didn't know how to...
You're not upset?
What?! I was hoping for this!
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!
Wait till you spill a Nadder's guts the first time!
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.
And all the while you were holding out on me!
Oh, Thor Almighty!
With you doing so well in the ring...
...we finally have something to talk about.
Here, I brought you something, to keep you safe in the ring.
Wow. Thanks.
Your mother would have wanted you to have it. It's half of her breastplate.
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.
Thanks for stopping by...
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.
Well... Yep. Good night.
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.
Please, by all means.
This time, this time for sure!
No! No, son of a half-troll,
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.
- So, later.
- Not so fast.
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!
Late for what, exactly?
Quiet down! The elder has decided.
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!
That's my boy!
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...
...leaving! We're leaving.
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.
Forever.
Oh, man.
What the?!
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on.
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?
Training?
It better not involve this.
I know this looks really bad, but you see...
You're right. You're right.
You're right.
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.
Why would you do that?!
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.
Oh, man.
Get down!
Run, run!
It's OK! It's OK.
She's a friend.
You just scared him.
I scared him?!
Who is "him"?
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.
We're dead.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!
Hiccup, get me down from here!
You have to give me a chance to explain.
I am not listening to anything you have to say!
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.
Please, Astrid.
Now get me down.
Toothless, down. Gently.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.
Toothless!
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!
And now the spinning.
Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile.
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.
Just get me off of this thing.
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.
It's amazing.
He's amazing.
So what now?
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.
You know you'll have to kill...
...kill a dragon.
Don't remind me.
Toothless, what's happening?
What is it?
Get down!
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.
What does that make us?
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.
It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
They're not eating any of it.
What is that?
All right, bud, we got to get out of here... now!
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.
They're the workers and that's their queen.
It controls them. Let's find your dad.
No! No.
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.
We have to think this through carefully.
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest, the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here, and you want to keep it a secret?
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?
Yes.
OK. Then what do we do?
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.
OK.
That's for kidnapping me.
That's for everything else.
What are you looking at?
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I can show my face in public again!
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks
Hiccup would go from, well, being Hiccup to placing first in dragon training, well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad!
And you know it!
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised or more proud than I am.
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.
Today, he becomes one of us!
Be careful with that dragon.
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?
Put an end to this. I have to try.
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.
I will. Just promise me it won't go wrong.
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!
I would have gone for the hammer.
I'm ready.
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!
What is he doing?
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
I'm not one of them.
What's he thinking?
- Stop the fight.
- No!
I need you all to see this.
They're not what we think they are.
We don't have to kill them.
I said, stop the fight!
Out of my way!
Hiccup!
This way!
Night Fury!
Toothless, go. Get out of here.
Go, go!
Stoick, no!
Dad, he won't hurt you!
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!
Toothless, stop!
No! No!
Get him!
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him.
Put it with the others.
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.
- Dad?
- We had a deal!
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.
So everything in the ring, a trick? A lie?
I screwed up. I should have told you before now. I just...
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?
Not the people you almost killed?
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.
They've killed hundreds of us!
And we've killed thousands of them!
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.
There's something else on their island. It's a dragon like...
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.
Only a dragon can find the island.
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.
Dad, please. I promise you, you can't win this one!
No, Dad. No.
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me?!
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.
You're not my son.
Ready the ships!
This way.
Set sail!
We head for Helheim's Gate.
Lead us home, devil.
It's a mess.
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:
Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
Thank you for summing that up.
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods?
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.
So why didn't you?
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
Because I want to remember what you say right now.
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
You said "wouldn't".
Whatever! I wouldn't!
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.
First one to ride one, though.
So?
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.
I looked at him and I saw myself.
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.
Then something crazy.
That's more like it.
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.
- Here!
- One length to your stern.
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here. Not me, of course.
I know you're always the man with the plan. But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.
Of course. Send them running.
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.
Step aside.
Bear to port.
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.
It's me.
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...
You're crazy. I like that.
So, what is the plan?
That's not really encouraging.
I was wondering where that went.
Stay low and ready your weapons.
We're here.
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.
It's OK. It's OK.
Where are you going?
You'll need something to help you hold on.
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose.
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.
No matter how this ends, it ends today.
Is that it?
We've done it!
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!
Get clear!
Beard of Thor! What is that?!
Odin help us.
Catapults!
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.
Lead the men to the far side of the island!
Gobber, go with the men!
I think I'll stay, in case your thinking of doing something crazy.
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt!
Then I can double that time.
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!
Come on! Fight me!
No, me!
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!
Move, Fishlegs!
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!
Up! Let's move it!
Every bit the boar-headed stubborn Viking you ever were!
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing!
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot, make noise, keep it confused!
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!
That's my specialty!
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!
- Troll!
- Butt elf!
Bride of Grendel!
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!
There!
Go help the others!
OK, hold on. Hold on.
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!
I'm OK!
Less OK!
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?
Yeah! You're the Viking!
Dad?
You got it, bud.
Hiccup!
I'm sorry... for everything.
Yeah. Me, too.
You don't have to go up there.
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Thanks, Dad.
He's up!
Get Snotlout out of there.
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.
No, this way.
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!
I can't believe that worked!
Night Fury!
Get down!
Did you get her?
Go.
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!
You think that did it?
Well, he can fly.
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.
Come on, bud!
Here it comes!
Watch out!
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.
Hold, Toothless.
Now!
No.
No!
Hiccup!
Son!
Hiccup.
Oh, son.
I did this.
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.
Hiccup!
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.
Thank you for saving my son.
Well, you know... most of him.
Hey, Toothless.
I'm happy to see you, too.
I'm in my house.
You're in my house.
Does my dad know you're here?
What? OK, OK.
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.
Toothless! Oh, come on.
OK. Thanks, bud.
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!
Hold on tight! Here we go!
What?
I knew it. I'm dead.
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!
It's Hiccup!
Turns out all we needed was a little more of this.
You just gestured to all of me.
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?
I might make a few tweaks.
That's for scaring me.
What is it always going to be this way? 'Cause...
...I could get used to it.
Welcome home.
- Night Fury!
- Get down!
You ready?
This is Berk.
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.
The people that grow here are even more so.
The only upsides are the pets.
While other places have ponies or parrots...
...we have...
...dragons.
On "The vampire diaries"...
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
- The Sun and the Moon curse?
- Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
- is coming after me?
- Elijah.
- He´s one of the Originals...
- a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall draw
Klaus out together and I shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed.
- And then what?
- Then I kill him.
I come bearing gifts... this is how you kill an Original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and a little white out cash?
If you kill Elijah, then
I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
- then he stays dead.
- Pretty much.
How did you get out?
I knew that I had begged you
not to kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as Originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you?
About your daughter...
You know where Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
No!
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.
Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
- Hey!
- School?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes.
- Only for 5 minutes.
Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here?
I told you to leave.
What is your problem?
You're wearing her clothes?
Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine?
Why would you think that?
Katherine's in a tomb!
Isn't she?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?
What are you doing?!
How could you do this?!
Stefan, you're hurting me!
Stop it, Katherine!
Stop what?
It's getting really easy being you.
- What is she doing here?
- When we killed Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
- How's that possible?
- He's an Original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
- You all do.
- Like hell.
We all want the same thing... Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are, running around like chickens
- with their heads cut off.
- I don't need your help and I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
You know where Klaus is?
When he's coming, what he looks like?
If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill and have some lunch... maybe
Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
Live band?
Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all?
Have you heard from Tyler?
Not a peep. You?
No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you?
- What did he say?
- Not much, really.
I mean... I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know.
And that's all he said?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
Yeah! I...
I mean, no, I... it's just not that easy.
I don't get it!
Since when have I been the one that can express himself and you're one with a loss for words?
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision or leave me alone.
Why is she still here?
She was free.
She wants what we want...
Klaus's death.
Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
- I want her gone.
- So do I.
But you're right, she's staying.
Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus. She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
Hmm, I can't.
I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and
Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Mmm, burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger back, you're wasting your time.
He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about Original vampires?
Spend 500 years running from one.
So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?
Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.
Did you know I would die?
Did Elijah tell you his plan?
Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with?
Why are you still here?
Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't be honest about helping,
I'd be long gone by now, ok?
You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know...
I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
She's out of the tomb?
Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right?
Just be extra careful.
She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena.
With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side.
I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture.
It's impossible.
They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
I'll try.
Thanks. Keep me posted.
Ok. I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see ya.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon.
I promise.
All right.
It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel and now Jenna knows
I'm lying about something.
John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So.
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?
I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?
You think we should tell her the truth?
I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair to her, and it's not the kind of relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus.
You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know?
How does someone hear that?
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
But I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her.
But until then,
Jenna and I are done.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
We can help you.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
I'm sorry about the way
I had to get that information, but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
How?
I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
I'll just help you carry it out.
You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do.
- What you up to?
- None of your business.
We're pouting now?
Are those the Gilbert journals?
How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
No.
- Then you can't help.
- Ugh.
If it's any consolation,
I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy making the place of their death with power.
I think Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
What was he going to do when he found it?
I don't know.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
Wasn't she gone or dead? Yeah?
For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...
They wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
We just need to find it.
But what if they can find the burial ground?
They won't. We tried,
Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
- You're going to kill them?
- No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
Chinese food or pizza?
Like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation?
What about "The Notebook"?
Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
That is so not the point.
Well, yeah, I mean...
Hey.
What's going on?
Girls' night.
Oh.
How are you doing?
You heard about my fight with Ric.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
No. No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or...
Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
You, too?
You have no idea.
Ok, then.
It's this whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
You know what we need?
Dancing. There is a band at the grill.
- I'm in.
- In.
In.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, I would go if I could.
No. I'm not strong enough to send you.
I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
- If you feel weak...
- Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see?
Elena and Damon.
They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you?
I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today.
"They kidnapped her from her home
"and took her to the same location
"her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago."
So Emily died on the site of the massacre, too.
Does it say where?
Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
Mm-hmm.
I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of those.
Find anything?
Nope.
That's too bad.
Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
What's wrong?
She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce.
Luka... kill her.
- What?
- She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon!
Katherine!
What happened?
Damon...
Luka, what's going on?
Luka! Luka!
What are you doing?!
Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack!
Get over there and do something about it.
Now!
No!
Oh, my God! Luka!
Luka! I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka!
I love my boy!
I need a drink.
Hey, Matt.
Things just got real awkward.
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila.
Yeah.
Well, señor tequila's not going to be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me.
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Because whatever it is you're keeping from me;
Whatever you think I can't handle...
You're wrong.
'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent, so I think
I can handle anything, Ric.
Jenna...
He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing?
What is she doing?
Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band!
Weren't they awesome?
This isn't going to end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Like it's so easy.
Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about.
Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
Yeah! Yeah.
You know what, I'm going to sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up.
What will it be?
♪ Close your eyes, give me your hand ♪
♪ darlin' ♪
♪ do you feel my heart beating? ♪
She's good.

Matt, I...
- You killed him!
- Aah!
He's dead and I have no one.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell?!
That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time...
It goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who... ahh...
- is trying to help you?
- You wanna help?
Start talking.
I'd love to, but you're not going to like it.
Try me.
Fine. John Gilbert and
Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life.
That's old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb, so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie?
Ahh! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
You know, I really have to get back to work.
Definitely.
I... I wouldn't.
Caroline and Matt are...
In the bathroom?!
If they're happy,
- I'm happy.
- Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
You're into my brother?
I know it's weird, um, but he's been so good and strong. It makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking...
Right now.
I'm thinking that...
My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and...
He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really?
Really.
Oh.
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the grill.
I can't hear you.
Hold... yeah.
Where are you going?
Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.
I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Wait.
I don't need your help.
I don't want it.
I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr. Martin. You ok?
Where is she?
I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena.
No. No, Dr. Martin.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
What the hell?
Mmm!
- The power's out.
- Even better.
I wish, but I should probably... whoa.
Hey!
- We have a problem.
- What's going on?
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
Oh, my God!
We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
Well, what can I do?
- It's time to get out of here.
- I have to find Elena.
She's with Stefan, she's ok.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie.
Come on. Come on.
Dr. Martin!
I'm so sorry about Luka.
I never wanted that to happen, but... at least let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline!
Get away from her!
Matt, no!
Matt!
Matt! No!
Matt! Matt!
Oh! Oh, my God!
Ok. Uh...
Just breath Caroline... just breath.
You have to drink.
Please, please.
Luka...
I can't believe he's dead.
After what we did to him.
No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this, but I don't.
I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.
- What's going on?
- He'll explain.
When did you guys get home?
- A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house?
And why would we check the house?
You're welcome.
You didn't have to kill him!
Yes, we did.
Get off!
How did you guys convince her to do this?
We didn't.
It was actually her idea.
Wow. That's...
Not good.
No. No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry clean.
You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me?
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead, but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kinda need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be ok?
Look,
Isobel is dead.
And there things about her death that I can't tell you;
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
Hey.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and...I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
Not that denial's the worst thing.
Did you...
When he grabbed me...
He gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how?
Yeah.
He did.
You know what I can't figure out?
What's that?
How the town knew
Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mmm, I should have figured as much.
Oh, she was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.
You know what I can't figure out?
Do I care?
Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew that Emily Bennett was the key to getting me out of that tomb.
And something tells me that you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe, yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now?
- You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
I like this Damon.
Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
Hi.
What the hell?
I had your face...
And all the blood.
I... I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me?
How can your blood heal me?
Because that's what vampire blood does for humans, and that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
No.
But it's all going to be ok, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine.
We'll be fine?!
Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my God.
Vickie, oh, my God, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.
What?
Vickie, she knew about the vampires, and I...
What... what did you do?
Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
I need to get out of here.
No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
What did you do to my sister?
Nothing! Nothing! I swear,
I swear, nothing, nothing!
- What did you do?!
- Nothing, Matt!!
You have to calm down! Matt!
Are John and Jeremy asleep?
I think so.
If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that?
Hi. You must be Jenna.
I'm...
Elena's mother.
Isobel.

GWEN:
Dear Santa, are you real?
If you live at the North Pole, how come I can't see your house when I look on Google Earth?
Are you Saint Nicholas?
Because you'd be incredibly old.
How do you have time to read all the letters from all the children in the world?
And how many cookies and mince pies have you eaten in all of history?
How do you get all the presents in the sack?
Does your sack have to get bigger every year because of exponential population growth?
And how do you get down the chimneys?
I put my head in ours and it's really small.
Even if you could squeeze down it in one minute, there's nine houses in my road so that's nearly 10 minutes.
And there are millions of roads in the world.
It must be so hard being Santa these days.
I mean, what if after all of that,
I'm staying at Grandma's?
Santa, how can you get round the whole world in just one night?
My friend said that you'd have to go so fast, it would make you and the sleigh and the reindeer all burn up.
I think you are real.
But how do you do it?
For Christmas I would love a pink Twinkle Bike with stabilizers.
But please don't bring it if it makes you and the reindeer burn.
Love, Gwen Hines. 23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England.
ARTHUR:
Dear Gwen, thank you for your letter and, heh, brilliant picture.
Your request for a pink Twinkle Bike will be passed on to Santa.
And, yes, do believe in Santa.
He is real.
He's the greatest man ever.
And he can get around the world to every child without a single reindeer being roasted ali...
Hurt.
By the time the sun comes up on Christmas Day, he'll get to you too using his special magic.

He'd have to get past the wrapping, the box and 14 twist ties anchoring it to the cardboard.
It's too noisy!
It'll wake the boy! He'll see Santa!

They tracked him home.
He had to go into hiding.
No Christmas for six years.

Ha, ha, ha.

ARTHUR: Yes! Ha-ha-ha!
GRANDSANTA:
What happened to going down the "chimbley"?
Never did me any har...
Get off me!
You smell like a wet elf.
Goodness! Down, boy!
Basket.
Here you are, Grandsanta.
I've made you a nice mince pie.
I can't eat that. It gets in me teeth.
Oh, dear.
Now I've got to visit the elf hospital, look over a treaty with Greenland and make the gravy.

Tonight we delivered
2 billion presents.
On this, my 70th mission!
ELF 5:
We'll miss you, Santa!
Stand by.
Psst!
Oh, thank you.
You know, I sometimes think
I couldn't do it without you.
And my splendid
Margaret, who's stood by me all these years very ably doing all that, uh... stuff that women do when their husbands work. Marvelous.
And, uh, Arthur, yes, doing vital work in Maintenance, really vital.
I, um... I work in Letters.
Letters, of course. I'm so sorry.
ARTHUR: You moved me after I tripped over that plug and melted down the elf barracks.
DAVID:
I lost everything in that flood!
SANTA:
Yes. Now, many years ago, my father told me that being Santa is the best job in the world.
He was right.
I've loved it.
I can't wait for year 71!
Merry Christmas, everyone.
ELVES (CHANTING): He's red, he's white!
He's worked all through the night!
Santa!
"What do you get if you eat Christmas decorations?
Tinselitis!"
Isn't this the best bit of Christmas?
It certainly is, Arthur.
The whole family together.
How about a toast, Malcolm?
Oh! Um...
Well, uh, here's to me doing an even better job next year.
MRS. SANTA: Next year.
ARTHUR: But you're already perfect, Dad.
Ha! That turkey did more than him.
Ha, ha! Aah!
SANTA:
You wouldn't understand, Father.
I've rather moved things on since your day. Eh, Steve?
Forget Techno Tommy. He's texting on his calculator after another job.
It's a Handheld
Operational and Homing Organizer.
The HOHO 3000.
I'm enacting mission closure.
Whoopee-doo.
Aren't you the fancy nancy?
Don't matter what you come up with.
You may be next in line, but you'll never get to be Santa unless you knock him off.
ARTHUR:
Um...
I've got you all a present.
After all the hard work, I wanted everyone to have some Christmas fun.
Ta-da!
GRANDSANTA: I'm Santa!
STEVE: No, no, I'm Santa. It's ridiculous.
You just took the piece out of my hand.
Well, I am actually Santa so I think I should have it.
Yes. You're the nonexecutive figurehead.
SANTA: Exactly.
Figurehead.
GRANDSANTA: It means a fatty with a beard who fits the suit.
The other pieces are good too.
Or I can make extra Santas for everyone.
Why don't you be the candle, Steve?
All those bright ideas, eh?
Fine. I'm the candle,
Arthur's the turkey and you, Father, are, of course, Santa.
Grandsanta, you can be this charming relic.
"Relic"? "Relic"?
I did the whole of Christmas in one of these, Arthur.
Oh, yes. I didn't need a trillion elves in bleepy hats.
We don't fly about throwing lead-painted toys down chimneys anymore.
That space sends you back to Lapland.
Malcolm, where did you get those?
Just moving things along.
Do I win?
Cheats, the pair of you!
ARTHUR:
Mum, are you okay?
Polar bear, dear. Attacked me on the ice.
Good I did that online survival course or there'd be one less for turkey.
GRANDSANTA: Christmas has gone right down the rodney hole.
You're a postman with a spaceship.
My S-1 festivized the world at 1860 times the speed of sound.
Christmas 1941, World War II, did the whole thing with six reindeer and a drunken elf!
I was shot at, Arthur.
Took 12 direct hits.
Lost three reindeer.
ARTHUR:
What happened to the elf?
Fell out of the sleigh over Lake Geneva.
Never saw him again.
Goodness. Now...
"Christmas crackers.
Sing 'Silent Night' backwards."
Who'd know that?
I went on alone.
I could still do it now, Arthur.
Just give me a go!
In a heap of sticks.
"Heap of... "?
Let me up and at him!
I'll show you, Robby the Robot!
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
I'll have that back.
GRANDSANTA: Would've won anyway.
What?
Oh, yeah. Run away now you're losing!
ARTHUR:
Steve!
Whoa! Unh!
Steve.
Don't be upset. Look.
You keep this.
Then you can be Santa next time.
That'll be you there, Steve.
Next year,
I bet.
You'll be great.
How many times, Arthur?
It's the North Pole. Shut the doors.
BRYONY:
I secured the gift.
Gift secured!
Just can't be.
The system is foolproof.
It has to be an error, sir.
"Error"?
I spotted the ribbon glinting in the shadows.
I am actually trained in wrapping.
And I said to myself, "Bryony, the wrapping looks okay. Thank goodness.
But that present should not be lying in the..."
Thank you, soldier.
ARTHUR: Has someone got the wrong present?
That's awful.
Whose is it?
No one gets the wrong present. 47785
BXK.
"Gift undelivered"?
They got nothing?
Mm-mm?
ARTHUR: A child's been missed!
Not necessarily.
A child's been missed!
Wanna wake up the North Pole?
Good idea. A child's been missed!
STEVE: Arthur!
Everything all right?
There's been a glitch.
"A glitch"? We've missed a child!
Really? Dear, oh, dear.
That's awful.
How did you let it happen,
Steven?
How did I...?
I thought it was your mission.
No. This is your department.
What'll we do?
We must, um... We must, uh...
What must we do, Steven?
STEVE: There's nothing to do.
The mission was a success.
We can't leave a child out of Christmas.
Sunrise at destination is 7:39 a.m. There's no way to get there in time.
Except, of course, for the S-1.
The S-1 . Right-o.
STEVE: No! The S-1 has just traveled 7 million miles.
We could damage it.
Oh, dear. Um...
And risk the lives of the elves.
SANTA: Oh, my. No.
I'll go, sir!
Bryony Shelfley,
Wrapping Division. Grade 3, sir.
Who asked you?
I wasn't called up for field duty.
I served out my mission in Gift Wrap Support.
I wrapped 264,000 presents in three days, sir.
If you want that bike delivered in a perfect state of enwrapment, then I'm your elf.
STEVE:
No one is going.
It's impossible.
But this child...
PETER: It's a margin of error of 0.00000001514834 percent,
I mean, hello?
Where's the champagne?
My department has delivered the most outstanding Christmas ever.
Oh, uh... Ha, ha.
Well done, us.
But there's a child without a present.
Arthur, Christmas is not a time for emotion.
We will get 47785BXK a present within the window of Christmas.
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in five days.
But that'll ruin the magic.
If there was any way at all to make the drop tonight.
But it can't be done.
SANTA:
Your brother knows about these things.
I won't sleep easy after this,
Arthur, but there it is.
Can't be done.
Merry Christmas.
Arthur! You're compromising the wrapping! That is not a toy! Well, it is, but, I mean, that's not...
Arthur!
ARTHUR:
Um... Oh, come on, come on, come on. Child 47785BXK, where are you?
"Dear Santa, my friend doesn't believe in you.
For Christmas I'd like a pink Twinkle Bike.
Gwen Hines.
23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England."
COMPUTER:
Lights out.
This figurehead thingy:
I'm not just a fatty with a suit, am I?
Of course not, dear.
No. I'm Santa.
Children rely on me.
Oh. Ugh. Ha, ha.
Here.
Thank you. It's just checks for the boys and cash for Father.
Oh, Malcolm.
It's the 2 billion other gifts, dear.
Christmas has become such a mad rush.
Until you retire.
Retire?
Sit next to Father, watching Steve on TV?
MAN (ON HOHO): You are sitting on a level one access HOHO.
Please state your identity.
State your identity.
Who would I be?
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.
And there's Arthur.
Dear Arthur.
What a puzzle.
This one's for me, dear.
Oh!
Happy Christmas, Margaret.
Oh, thank you.
I'm still very much up to the job, you know. Ho, ho...
Good night, dear.
Good night, Malcolm.
It just can't be. It can't.
It just can't be. It can't.
It just can't be! Oh!
GRANDSANTA:
What's all this ka doodle, young man?
Grandsanta.
This little girl.
She's been missed!
Ha! So much for your brother's fancy-pants technology.
Steve and Dad racked their brains but said it's impossible.
Is it, now?
Missed a child. Dear, oh dear, sends shivers down me shins.
In two hours, she's gonna wake up tear downstairs, search under the tree and the look on her face.
But there's nothing there.
She won't understand. She'll think she's the one kid in the world that Santa doesn't care about.
She'll feel so... left out.
On Christmas night, he comes.
Gwen can't not have a present from Santa.
Do you know, Arthur, there is a way.
It's impossible.
They used to say it was impossible to teach women to read.
Follow me.
It's... It's the actual sleigh.
Hello, Evie.
I thought it was scrapped years ago.
So did everyone else.
Can I...?
Icelandic birch. Arctic balsa.
Built in 1845.
Able to reach 50,000 miles per hour at a height of 40,000 feet.
GRANDSANTA:
Over here, you string of tinsel.
Got it.
"Potash of carboniloroxy amilocitrate."
Magic dust.
Mined from the aurora borealis.
But she doesn't still go?
Ha.
Not just a hobby, Arthur.
Great-great-grandchildren of the original eight.
Dasher.
Wow. Heh.
Dancer.
Prancer.
Uh... What are the others called? I could never ruddy remember. Bambi? John.
You there, with the white ear. And you.
And... Not you, you bag of fleas.
Uh... Uh...
Arthur?
I'm not really good with big animals.
Piffle!
Heh-heh-heh.
Don't get bit, mind.
They can smell fear.
Let's hitch them up.
Oh, Grandsanta.
Uh, uh... Excuse me.
Unh!
You can go to Gwen!
On the old sleigh, with the reindeer and the magic dust and everything!
It's a miracle.
You're coming too, lad.
Me?
On that? Up there? Pulled by them?
No. No way.
I'm 136. I can't do it on me own,
I need an elf.
I can't fly a sleigh. I can't even ride a bike without stabilizers.
I know, let's wake Steve. He'll...
No.
He's a worrier, Arthur. What if he stops us? Gwen's forgotten.
You really care.
Well, of course
I do. I was Santa too.
Think of your dad lying awake, chewing his beard off with worry over this girl.
Don't you want to help for once?
Make him proud?
I can't.
I just... I can't.
No, I can't.
Ready?!
ARTHUR: No! You promise
Ha, ha!
Not to go too fast?
Whoo-hoo!
ARTHUR:
Or high. Or bumpy.
I get travel sick.
I'm allergic to snow.
Ye baubles.
And you a son of Santa?
Wait! My slippers!
They're not for outdoor use!
GRANDSANTA:
Dash! Dash!
Dash!
See?
Who's Santa now? Ho, ho, ho!
Whoo-hoo!
ARTHUR:
Aah! Put me down!
What's the matter, boy?
I'm having a heart attack.
They've never flown before.
Just gotta break them in.
Now.
Come away!
Dash away!
Look, Arthur.
All those stars.
We're one of them now.
A shooting star!
Whoa!
Stuck that there for your dad when he was a boy.
Dad? What, he sat here?
So did I.
Every young heir to the Pole gets took out by his father.
Right back to Saint Nick.
We Clauses used to be the only men in the world who could fly,
Arthur, and see all this.
It was a gift, a great big ball wrapped in oceans and mountains.
I remember the look on your father's face when he saw it.
Yah!
Fish!
With horns!
Want to help me make a snowman?
Yah!
No! Not ye...!
Aah! Aah!
Oh, where's the seat belt?
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Could Dad do that? Did he make a snowman for Steve?
Robot Roy?
Ha! I should cocoa.
The next Santa, and he's never even sat in a sleigh.
Oi!
Is that...?
The map of the Clauses.
Used every Christmas night in history.
Whatever your brother says,
Arthur, it's the same old world.
ARTHUR:
What is it?!
No idea. I've never seen it before.
ARTHUR: It's a city!
A new one?
Ruddy cheek.
They're always putting these things up.
I remember the first time
I ran into Chicago.
Ha, ha.
Chicago wasn't on the map?
GRANDSANTA:
Whoa!
Now, where are we?
Ah. Here we are, see?
Oh, no, that's Peking.
Ahead, there's a...!
GRANDSANTA:
Whoa!
ARTHUR:
They can see us.
Well, pull the camouflage lever.
Now, then, we'd better draw in a few sky scratchers. Just, uh...
Not that one.
That's a steam train, you ninny.
ARTHUR:
Do this one.
GRANDSANTA: So, what do they call this place?
"Toronto."
Toronto's in Canada.
The Santas always come through Canada.
Nobody lives here.
It's nice and quiet.
Till your brother came with his "You can't cut through Saigon, there's a war" rubbish.
Don't need him to tell me what's ahead.
I got eyes.
Grandsanta!
Ye baubles, an elf.
Bryony Shelfley. Oh!
There's a small trauma to your giftwrap, but I can fix it.
A stowaway!
I can wrap anything, sir, with three bits of sticky tape.
Three!
Good. Wrap yourself a parachute.
Aah!
Grandsanta!
BRYONY: Aah!
GRANDSANTA: Whoops.
Toronto. Present and correct.
Not quite, sir. You've lost one of the reindeer.
Quantitative...
Hello?
What elf?
PETER: Bryony Shelfley, sir.
The crazy wrapping elf, you know?
Security tracked her to Sector 19.
And we think Arthur was here.
Arthur?
Who else leaves the door open, huh, sir?
The old sleigh barn?
That was sealed up decades ago after that terrible night
Grandsanta sneaked out and...
Thank goodness he's too old these days to get into trouble.
Bash it with a brick, Arthur. Go on.
ARTHUR:
It just won't...
Grab its antlers and tug.
I may just be a wrapping operative, sir, but this contravenes.
MAN (ON HOHO): Seventeen.
Specific mission regulations.
I'm in charge here, not Billy the Bureaucrat.
ARTHUR:
It's stuck.
GRANDSANTA:
Shh!
Eighteen.
Elf, wrap your head.
Sir!
Come on, lad. You're as much use as a cheese chopstick.
Got it!
Oh, no.
(BRYONY MUMBLING
INDISTINCTLY)
Oh, my big Aunt Betty.
It'll have to do. Pass it down.
What?
Permission to breathe, sir. I have about nine seconds left before I black out.
One breath.
BRYONY:
Sir?
I said one. Hurry up, Arthur.
But don't we need a whole one?
You know, to balance the sleigh?
Oh, it won't balance the sleigh. No, no.
If anything, it'll slow us down.
(BRYONY MUMBLING
INDISTINCTLY)
So why are we taking it?
It's for Gwen. Eight beautiful reindeer.
That's what she's dreaming of.
The jingly bells, the sleigh on the roof.
Yeah, but...
That's what the kids want, not some spaceship.
We're giving her the star treatment.
What now?
We have a waker, sir.
With a gun!
GRANDSANTA:
That's it, lad.
You distract him!
ARTHUR: Grandsanta!
MAN: Who's there?
ARTHUR:
Uh... Uh... Uh...
We come in peace.
Our craft has to travel around the world in less than an hour!
We need a sign for our slei...
Craft.
Sorry I can't pay you. Where I come from, we don't have money!
GRANDSANTA:
Christmas 1923, had a heart attack at the reins.
Left ventricle popped out me mouth.
Pushed it back down and carried on!
(GRANDSANTA &
ARTHUR CHUCKLE)
It's big, isn't it, the Atlantic?
Think we should stop and ask someone?
Pishywibble, we're nearly there!
See, I take the North Star there as a fixed point.
Then I plot my bearings from, um...
That's a plane, sir.
Insubordination.
I'll have you harpooned, elf.
ARTHUR: I thought it would be chillier near England.
GRANDSANTA:
Globular warming.
Ha! Land ahoy! There it is.
Told you!
ARTHUR:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
GRANDSANTA: There you are. Down.
ARTHUR: Watch that rock!
GRANDSANTA:
There you go.
Ah.
ARTHUR:
Wow.
England.
Maybe we pulled to the right a bit.
We're a reindeer short.
France.
They have elephants in France?
The odd stray. They breed in the drains. This way.
(GRANDSANTA SPEAKING
IN SPANISH)
Paris Zoo.
BRYONY:
Then this is where they keep the lions!
GRANDSANTA:
They won't eat me.
I'm Santa!
Lie down!
Oh, right.
Call the keeper!
ARTHUR:
How old is this?
"Atlantis"?
"Here be cannibals"?
Watch out for cannibals.
This isn't France, is it?
Technically, it's known as Africa.
Aah!
Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.
How can you possibly be sure?
The GPS on my HOHO.
Take her!
Take the elf!
GPS? Why didn't you say?
I'm a wrapping elf. I don't navigate,
I wrap. I use it to store pictures of bows.
She's right. You brought us to Africa!
I've seen it on a stamp.
I'm too young to die, Arthur.
Do something. Arthur!
STEVE: The old sleigh.
What is happening here?
Was supposed to be chopped up for firewood decades ago.
How did that devious...?
Old people, sir.
Shall I get you your stress ball?
We have finer comms than the Pentagon, and you say we can't contact him except by some ancient...
ERNIE:
Toodle-loo!
Here comes the cavalry!
Ernie Clicker, sir.
Head of Polar Communications for 46 missions!
Oh, crikey blikey, me and your granddad saw some times!
I remember once...
Wow, must catch up soon. Now...
Oh, you're in a hurry. I can tell.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Could we hurry this?
Ooh... You can't rush the Signalator.
Got to play her gentle.
So, what do you wish to say?
I wouldn't worry. It's not like they're facing man-eating lions.

GRANDSANTA:
Dash!
Something's coming through.
What does it say?
GRANDSANTA:
Get off! No!
That's me Evie, you mangy moron!
ARTHUR:
No!
That's Gwen's gift!
Hi-yah!
Only children get to tear the wrapping.
Bryony?
Automatic tape guns!
GRANDSANTA: Down, doggy!
Bad doggy!
Laser-guided scissors!
Oh, no, no!
Standard-issue giftwrap!
No time for a bow!
There's always time for a bow!
ARTHUR:
Oh!
GRANDSANTA:
I can't look.
Not that knob!
Good night!
Oh, no!
ARTHUR:
Something else!
No, leave it! Don't...
Aah.
My camera!
(ROARS THEN
CATERWAULS)
Wait! Look!
Oi!
BRYONY:
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Wow.
Whoa!
GRANDSANTA:
What's so funny?
Look what they've done to my Evie.
And the map.
But it's okay.
We've got this. Look!
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.
MAN (ON HOHO):
Proceed to the highlighted route.
What's the point? Look at us.
And my camera, totally banjaxed.
How do I get my picture now?
What picture?
The sleigh on the roof, the eight beautiful reindeer and Santa... Me!
...going down the "chimbley."
That's what I wanted them to see.
They missed the kid, but I got there.
My way.
That's why you came. Not for Gwen.
1368 miles, then slight left.
For the love of Lulu, bossed about by Tinpot Tom.
Dash!
Try them again.
Keep trying.
All this for one child.
In 600 million.
We should turn her off a mo.
Don't worry, sir. Children are stupid. Either it won't know it got missed or it'll think it's been bad.
It's a win-win.
You missed one?
A nipper? Cor!
Ha, ha. What's all this here for if you miss one?
Could you please type faster?
All right.
COMPUTER:
Systems critical.
Lead in Christmas.
ERNIE:
Oops-a-daisy.
STEVE:
Peter, let go of my hand, please.
PETER:
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
And get me IT.
MAN (ON HOHO):
Descend 1000 feet.
You are at your destination.
ARTHUR: Yes!
We did it, we did it!
We did it! Hooray!
Whoopee-doo.
In 100 yards, turn left.
Straight ahead, left, right.
You are at your client's dwelling.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, steady!
We made it. I survived!
I'll walk home, I'll get a boat, but I am never getting back in that crazy flying death trap ever again!
GRANDSANTA:
Go on.
Get it over.
I want my bed.
What, you're not coming?
You have to deliver the present.
You've got your special coat on.
You're our Santa.
I said me and Evie could get here, and we did.
The rest is just elf work.
Go on, Festive Freddie, sling your hook.
It doesn't matter how we got here.
The sleigh on the roof, the jingle bells, the eight reindeer.
Gwen would never have seen that.
ARTHUR (WHISPERS):
I wish Dad could see this.
It would take such a load off his mind.
So, what are your orders?
Hmm?
You're a Claus.
You give the orders.
Do I? Oh! Um... Heh.
I'm just happy being an elf, really.
You know, just part of it all.
You want to order me to go through the cat flap?
Oh! Um... Yes, that's a great idea.
Do you want to tell me to let you in?
Brilliant. Thank you, Bryony.
BRYONY:
And do you want to...?
Quick!
The alarm? Definitely, yes.
Is this your first time?
But...
Bryony?
Sorry.
He likes these slippers even more than you do!
Happy Christmas.
BRYONY (IN NORMAL VOICE):
When you put the address into the HOHO, what did you see?
(IN NORMAL VOICE) A list of Trelews.
I just clicked on the first one!
Which was not Trelew, England.
We're in the wrong Trelew!
What's going on?!
They've been watching us.
They've seen Evie.
It's just like last time.
REPORTER: Governments tonight are waking to news of a UFO traveling the globe at incredible speed.
BRYONY: That's us!
The clearest sighting was at this tractor dealership in Idaho.
Had eyeballs on its feet and a pointy little head.
It asked me for a sign.
BRYONY: We're on the news.
REPORTER: From the trail in Toronto, these beings do not appear friendly.
COMPUTER: Rebooting.
We are online, sir.
WOMAN 1: This is
Charlotte. Mexican police found a furry thing trying to mate with a dog.
MAN 1: I have calls reporting a steam train flying around.
MAN 2:
Steam train? Been on the eggnog?
MAN 3: It's gone black over Mexico.
This thing's going faster than anything we know of.
STEVE: No.
The herd is now in
Mozambique's airspace, threatening the fragile peace between the two nations.
Two billion items delivered, and we didn't leave a footprint in the snow.
And now...
DOUG: Sir?
We have lost 80 percent of our data.
No, no. We have 18 pulse data reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
Sorry, autosave was off.
Shall I slap him, sir?
Quite hard?
DEBORAH:
Sir, there's a polar bear on Level 6.
Sir? Why is
Arthur out there?
ERNIE:
He missed one.
A nipper.
I mean,
47785BXK.
Sir, we've got something.
Bryony Shelfley, it's her HOHO.
We can still get there.
We just have to go faster, higher!
You've changed your tune.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not here!
ARTHUR:
I've taped myself in! Grandsanta!
Leave me. It's that terrible night all over again.
What night?
Last time I took Evie for a spin.
I didn't know it was the Cuban missile crisis!
I nearly started World War III.
BRYONY:
Hold still. Someone has to drive.
Whoopsie!
ARTHUR:
Oh, no!
Fencer!
Mincer! Come back!
Bryony!
BRYONY:
Hi-yah!
ARTHUR:
Grandsanta, get here!
Oi! That's me new hip.
Please, I'll read you Gwen's letter.
GRANDSANTA:
Stone-deaf. I'm 136.
What's that?
It's Steve.
Steve!
GRANDSANTA: Tell him
I'm not here!
Grandsanta says he's not here.
Hi. I'm looking for a missing relic.
Steve, three words.
Is the first one "help"?
ARTHUR: Yes.
You can help us, Steve!
It was him!
Frosty the Madman.
He forced me to come.
Elf, back me up if you want a career.
I forced you?
You see? Look.
What did you want, Grandsanta?
Let me guess. Hm.
A picture of you in the sleigh delivering the gift to show me how it's really done?
No.
You know the picture they'll have tomorrow?
You, led away in handcuffs!
The Santa who was seen.
By everybody on Earth.
The Santa who ruined Christmas.
Ruined it!
We'll fix this, Steve. We'll be back home in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.
And Evie can go back in mothballs.
You can forget she ever existed.
You can't just go home.
What about Gwen?
Gwen. For that, you'd threaten my whole operation?
Steve, you said if there was any way to get there, you would.
Well, this is it. Look.
The old sleigh is perfect!
Uh, right. Well, anyway, it goes really fast, even with bits missing.
And we've got quite a few reindeer left.
And, if I'm sick again,
I could be sick in a bag.
I'll wrap him one.
We can help them.
No one missed, sir!
All correct presents, present and correct.
ARTHUR:
If you help us, Steve, we can do it!
THOMAS:
Grandsanta and Arthur would be the heroes of the night, sir!
Come home now!
If we all just gave in to Christmas spirit, there'd be chaos.
Unh! We're on our way, Steve.
No!
Santa will want us to get to Gwen.
Ask him. Please.
STEVE:
Arthur, this is Dad we're talking about.
There was a time when he cared about every last gift tag, but now he just wants to be loved and get some rest.
No. He's lying awake, worrying his beard off about Gwen.
SANTA:
Ho-ho-ho. Off to the land of nod.
Please do not disturb until December 26th.
Is that it, dear?
MRS. SANTA: Yes.
Press the red...
No.
Santa's the most caring man in the world.
So why are you here, not him?
Don't leave me, Arthur!
Poor old man and his reindeer, on our own at Christmas?
At least have the decency to finish us off with a rock!
Poor Evie.
Sun'll be up soon.
It's Christmas!
Christmas is for kids.
You grow out of it.
What, in the last six minutes?
I know what you all say about me, you know.
"He belongs in the South Pole."
"Dear Arthur, what a puzzle."
Well, you were right.
All that fuss over one kid.
I was being ridiculous.
This is nice.
It's good to get away from it all, you know.
All the Christmas fuss.
I'm sorry I messed things up, lad.
You see, the night I last took Evie out when there was all that fuss, your father came to me.
I'll never forget it.
Couldn't look me in the eye.
"Dad," he says.
"Steve thinks it best you don't fly again.
We're scrapping the sleigh."
Me own son who used to sit where you sat, looking up at me.
I just wanted them to remember who I used to be.
I was a bit like you, lad.
Keen as cranberry.
So was your dad.
You get old, that's all.
Everything changes.
Does it?
How can I ever write another letter saying that Santa cares?
Good night, Dad.
Sleep well.
Oh!
Sir, we know you shouldn't believe rumors, but we do.
Is it true you missed a child?
Me? No, no, no.
Well, uh, in a way, yes.
It was just one.
In fact, not even that.
Naught point lots more naughts, then a number and some sort of percent at the end.
Not really an error, just a one.
One child doesn't matter?
Which one?
Well, I... It's not that...
SEB:
I did nine ones in Greece.
Did those matter?
FERGUS: What about my ones in Germany? One of them was twins!
They don't matter half each.
Um... Why don't you ask Steve?
He can explain. Fiendishly clever.
But aren't you in charge, sir?
Of course. I'm Santa.
THOMAS:
Sir, if the one that got missed doesn't matter, why have Arthur and Grandsanta gone to take it?
What?
Malcolm, what's this about Arthur?
ELF 1:
He's crazy.
DEBORAH: Is there a list of children who don't matter?
Santa said they don't matter
100 percent.
ELF 2: Is it true children aren't real, they're just antimatter?
Shh, shh! Do not... Look. Look!
I festivized every single country in the world. You see?
This one, this one, this one.
All of them.
I mean, who cares about one single tiny child?
Uh... I do.
Arthur.
My poor boy.
Why on earth would he...?
You're his brother, Steve.
How could you let him?
And about this child you missed,
I'm really not sure you made the right decision.
Is that bird doo on your shoulder?
Right.

Sleigh fever, they call it.
Pressure of Christmas sends a man doolally-tap.
Santa Claus XVI got it, 1802.
Every child that year got a sausage nailed to a piece of bark.
Unh! Whoa!
Arthur, do you really think you can row the Atlantic Ocean in the next
37 minutes?
It's not, unh, too late yet.
I just have to keep, unh, going.
We need a blunt instrument.
Knock him out and regroup.
MAN (ON HOHO): Make a legal U-turn, then slight right in 4228 miles.
You do know we're going round in circles?
You know, we're not the only ones.
Maybe I will see Evie again.
What do you mean?
GRANDSANTA: Reindeer are brave, powerful beasts but they're also dappled cretins with twigs on their heads.
They'll just keep going in a straight line right round the world.
They'll be way up in the sky, flying at unimaginable speed, but they'll pass right over our heads.
Great!
We can get the sleigh back!

It's circling the Earth, ma'am.

GRANDSANTA: You'll be torn in half!
Depends on the angle the sleigh hits.
You might just get beheaded.
I've got a phobia of being beheaded, and heights and speed and reindeer and buttons.
Buttons?
Yeah, I'm pretty much scared of everything.
Gwen thinks you're coming. Ah!
You can't do this. Yes, you can!
No, you can't. Yes, you can!
Come on, Arthur!
Don't worry. Only a raving lunatic...
I have to worry!
It's the only thing I'm good at!
Worry me.
The sleigh'll be back any minute.
Come on. Worry me, quickly!
Imagine Gwen, all alone, nothing under the tree.
Here we go. Unh.
No! Don't like this! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Get me down!
The tears as she finds she's been left out.
Screaming, "Santa didn't come!"
Oh, Gwen.
No! It's just too high!
BRYONY: Gwen in the street surrounded by kids on new bikes, pointing:
"That's the girl that Santa hates!"
She runs away, alcoholic by the age of 9.
Dead before she's even...!
She may never build a snowman again!
What if there are buttons on the sleigh
I don't know about?!
Here it is!
Um...
How do you think he's, uh...?
Fine, fine. Probably just, uh...
(SCREAMING
AND WHIMPERING)
(WHISTLING
"GOOD KING WENCESLAS")
So how come they didn't scrap the sleigh, sir?
I threatened the elves.
Said I'd feed them to the polar bears.
Whoa!
Elf, how do you fancy being the one to tell his parents about all this?
(GRUNTS THEN
WHIMPERING AND YELLING)
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Yay! Arthur!
You did it!
I did it with worry!
Oh, I was sure you'd die.
It was great!
MAN (ON HOHO):
Proceed to the highlighted route.
Proceed to the highlighted.
Just keep worrying about Gwen.
I'll find a way there, boy.
Whatever it takes.
To Trelew!
Margaret.
Hand me my Me suit.
All sorted. Steve's, uh... holding the fort while I deliver the present, yes, and find Arthur and Father.
Well done, dear.
Trelew's on a course of 187.7 degrees from the geographic pole but as it's the old sleigh, allow a drift margin of 1000 miles either side of the meridian.
Got a sweater for Arthur, your father's pills, and some nice sweet tea.
Hm.
COMPUTER:
Curtains.
S-1 dented.
PETER: Sir. Sir!
Big scratch down side.
"Popped out to take present.
Turkey sandwich in fridge.
Mum and Dad."
Espresso machine broken.
That idiot, Arthur. He's sent everyone crazy.
He'll destroy Christmas.
And you'll never get to be Santa.
Steven!
I, um...
23 Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.
Malcolm, there's no harm in using a manual.
Men.
Margaret, I order you to disembark.
It's not safe. Unh!
Piffle. I did a microlight flying course on the Internet.
It can't be that different.
Oh! Steve.
You've dented it!
You take it out without asking?
Malcolm, you told me he knew.
You know how Steve feels about his S-1.
It's my S-1 . S for "Santa."
I'm flying to this child.
Of course she's all that matters.
Not me, your son.
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight.
No!
This is about that pool table, isn't it?
I told you, you should've written to me.
I was 8. You're my dad!
For goodness sake!
Arthur and Grandsanta are out there probably not wearing nearly enough layers and you two are bickering over a big red toy?!
I'm not bickering.
If Steven could just stand back... Ooh!
COMPUTER:
Air bag.
You drive, Steven.
Thank you.
So since gift delivery to child 47785BXK is all that seems to matter,
I'll do it myself.
Then we'll pick up Arthur and Grandsanta from whatever ditch they ended up in.
Maximum thrust.
Um, when Santa said he'd be right back, what do you think he...?
He's not coming back!
The Santas are leaving!
Children don't matter?
Christmas doesn't matter!
Nothing matters!
It's like 1816!
Abandon the North Pole!
DEBORAH: Everybody, panic!
COMPUTER: Are you sure you want to delete Christmas?
Meltdown: 10 minutes.
ELF 1: Head south!
ELF 2: It's all south from here, you fool!
I know where we can find a map, lad!
A bit risky, this.
Breaking the rules, even in the old days.
There!
Biggest map in the world!

DE SILVA: Friends, on this night of peace, we stand confronted by an unknown danger.
Aliens. Aliens from space.
MAN 1: Blast them from the skies!
WOMAN 1: Let us do an autopsy.
But maybe the aliens come in peace?
They burst an inflatable
Santa Claus in Toronto.
On Christmas night!
WOMAN 2: What a terrible thing.
DE SILVA: Let us attempt contact, but be ready to save our planet.
GRANDSANTA:
Hold tight, lad. This is where it gets really rough.
Not now, you sack of antlers.
MAN (OVER PA):
Alert level six.
It's coming down through the atmosphere.
We'll see it.
Forty-six, 45,
They'll be waiting for us, sir.
We were on the news.
All their technology against my Evie.
Oh, come on. Let's do it with worry!
Santa mustn't be seen, eh, lad?
Let's give them something to shoot at.
We have visual.
Here it comes.
GRANDSANTA:
Take us to your leader. Ha-ha-ha!
ARTHUR:
England!
GRANDSANTA:
No sign of anyone.
ARTHUR: The sun's coming up!
Come on, lad! You can do it! Move your hooves!
Mankind greets you. Do you copy?
Season's greetings from mankind.
Good morning, do you copy?
The hull is some kind of woody substance, ma'am.
Like wood.
Coated in lead paint.
The engine seems to be alive.
And furry.

BRYONY & GRANDSANTA:
Your slipper!
We have lock.
We got to get you down there, lad.
They'll see us! We'll be stopped!
Give me that.
What are you doing?
It's Evie they're after.
She doesn't fit this world, Arthur.
She's a relic.
Evie?
I always knew she'd be needed one more time.
You go on. We'll let them have her.
You're coming too.
You were right, Arthur. It doesn't matter how Santa's gift gets there.
Doesn't even matter if it's
Mr. Postman in his spaceship.
As long as it gets there.
You made it happen, lad.
No one got left out.
Get off.
Now, do as I say.
MAN:
They're firing on us!
A death ray!
Made of chocolate and oranges.
WOMAN: Unidentified varnished object, turn back or we shoot.
Go!
Turn back.
Happy Christmas!
In Santa we believe!
Go on, elf.
You too.
Hi-yah!
DE SILVA:
Fire missiles.
This is it, old fella.
Maybe the next
Santa never sat in my Evie, but Arthur did.
And he's as good a man as any Santa there's ever been.
Yah!
Goodbye, Evie.
Thank you, everyone.
You just saved Christmas.
STEVE:
Trelew.
Out with the old, in with the new.
Well done, dear.
Poor Arthur.
He tried so hard.
He's flunked again.
Of course he hasn't, dear.
We're here. The little girl will get her present.
I think he's done rather splendidly.
My Margaret.
(DOORBELL RINGS
OVER MONITOR)
Good morning, Gwen.
Ho, ho, et cetera.
Apologies for the minor delay.
I'm sure that even a child can understand that in an operation as complex as Christmas, there's always an insignificant margin of error, which is you. As a gesture,
I've upgraded you to the Glamorfast Ultra X-3 which retails at 9.99 more than your requested gift.
Bigger ergo better.
If you wouldn't mind just signing a legal waiver?
Pedro? A boy?
A Spanish boy?
This is an error.
Now get off the bike.
Will you get...?
No, no, no. Please don't cry.
No cry-o.
No, uh, "sob-idad."
Uh...
It's over a mile.
We've got no sleigh, no reindeer, and you can't even walk.
What are you doing?
I can cycle!
Oi! Come back!
What about the wrapping?!
ARTHUR:
The church. She lives by the church!
Happy Christmas, cows!
COMPUTER: Meltdown. Ten seconds to figgy Flensburg. Snowman.
German, leave out the carrot.
Is Santa on shoe?
What the...?!
Look, everyone! It's Arthur!
He's delivering the present.
It's Arthur.
ELF: Hooray for Arthur!
COMPUTER:
Meltdown paused.
BRYONY:
Come back!
Oh, my head.
Ye baubles, a beautiful young reindeer.
Ah. So who am I, then?
Okay, so I'm not great with children.
Does that make me a bad Santa?
You're hardly perfect.
Let me guess. You put in the address, you saw a list of Trelews and just clicked on the first one?
You're just like Arthur.
Am I?
COMPUTER: North Pole,
DEBORAH:
But, sir, it's Arthur. He's still going.
ELVES (CHANTING):
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!
Arthur?

You wouldn't just go to bed and forget Gwen.
You're Santa!

Give me that.
I'm Santa! I'm delivering it!
(WHISPERING) Don't be silly, I'm Santa.
Can't you see from me suit?

Humphrey, you are totally genius.
Come on. Let's do it.
Air wolf!
Guys. Guys.
We're not moving!
This caribou is mine.
Kate, l'm not a caribou. l'm your sister!
Gotcha.
Omegas don't play like this.
You can't escape the greatest Alpha ever.
Well, l just did.
We're going to die!
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!
What was l thinking?
That was great!
We are flying today, guys.
Humphrey?
Kate?
What are you doing up here? l'm practice-hunting for our lunch.
Good, 'cause l'm about to lose mine.
You are? l'll try to swallow it.
Kate! lt's time to go. l'm coming, Dad.
Where you going?
Alpha school. lt goes till spring.
Spring?
But that's a whole winter away. l know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.
But by next spring, she will be a trained Alpha, the future leader of the pack.
No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.
Learn to keep the peace.
And Humphrey, remind us all to have fun.
But.. . But.. .
Alphas and Omegas can't.. .
How do you say it?
That's our custom. The law of the pack.
Wolf pile!
Silly Omegas.
Hey.
Take a left! Thirty degrees!
Salty, give her some sail draft! l think l taste the wind.
No, just a bug.
Hey, Mooch, get ready! Lower the boom!
-All right!
-Hang 10, boys!
Guys, we really need to work on the brakes!
-Brakes?
-Brakes?
Wolf pile!
Get your butt out of my face.
What did we hit?
Spring.
Look who's back from Alpha school.
Forget about it, Humphrey.
Kate's an Alpha now.
And you're an Omega.
We're friends, okay?
Exactly. Just friends. End of story.
You better set your sights over there.
Reba and Janice, the vegetarians.
Okay.
Looks like we're eating caribou tonight, boys.
Hey. Hey.
Eastern Pack wolves.
Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.
Great. There goes dinner.
And there goes Kate.
-Holy.. .
-Caribou!
Scatter to the sides!
Look at those moves.
Settle the score, leader.
Are you all right?
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-Hey, what's your problem, you stupid Eastern dog?
That was our hunt.
You can't just snake it out from under us.
Can-do, back off.
You better listen to the girl.
Hey, break it up.
Can-do, Hutch, break it up!
All right, Omegas, duty calls.
Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!
-Hey!
-Candy!
-Kate.
-Humphrey? l'm still going to tear this snaggletooth fool apart.
Guys, lower the boom!
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.
Guys, guys, come on.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.
You wolves are making us look bad.
Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.
Now, that's a moon l don't want to howl to.
Western hunt group, get back to the den.
The two of you, go home.
Now!
Omegas, good job.
Great. My first hunt, and l blew it.
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy.
You were amazing. l mean, if anyone's hungry, they can eat.. .
They can always eat.. .
What?
Here.
They can eat berries.
Berries are really nutritious.
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.
Luckily, the Omegas were there to break up the fight.
-Lilly.
-What?
Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.
Kate, you're slouching. Thank you, honey.
Do you see how strong and beautiful you are?
My.
Any food is a blessing, dear.
Winston? Come join us for dinner? Now!
Thank you, honey.
Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.
Not for my pack. l'm sorry, Dad. lt's just those Eastern Wolves. lt's not your fault, Kate.
When they crossed into our territory, they broke pack law.
Winston.
Can-do was jumped by a group of Eastern Wolves. lt ain't nothing.
Quickly, bring him into the den.
Winston, honey, whoever did this, let's rip his tail off and shove it down his throat.
Sir, are we just going to let them keep raiding our hunts and.. .
Put our Alphas on alert.
Already done, sir.
Good job.
Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated. lnstead, now, keep an open mind, l just want you to have an open mind here, we bring you berries.
How about squirrels?
Bad joke.
Flying squirrels.
Winston!
Tony! You're looking good.
My back feels like wood. l got this disk that keeps cracking.
Drives me crazy.
Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Like that little game of tag during our hunt.
Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.
You know there's no caribou left in the east.
You got a problem.
Unite the packs, Winston. lt was you who gave the big speech that your daughter Kate and my son Garth would marry and unite the packs.
Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?
Don't worry. She knows.
Good.
Then she can meet Garth tonight at the moonlight howl. l won't let my pack starve, Winston. lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.
That would be a big mistake.
Kate. lt's.. . lt's okay, Dad. l understand. lt's.. . lt's my responsibility.
Guys, we got to get ready for the moonlight howl.
Guys, girls.
Girls?
You are cool.
So, let me go ahead.. .
Prepare the girls for your arrival and you guys meet me there.
Game on.
Girls.
Kate, you look so beautiful.
Now, if Garth gets out of line, take those beautiful teeth of yours, go for the throat, and don't let go until the body stops shaking. lf my little girl doesn't want to do this, if she's not ready.. .
Don't worry, Dad. l'm ready.
Come on, Lilly.
Okay. Okay.
Your fur.. . lt looks fantastic tonight.
Oh, my gosh. l had.. .
Omega alert. l will handle this. lt totally relaxes the knots.
Hey.
Hey.
That's all l've got.
Wow. This is a new feeling. l saw the whole thing, guys.
And, l cannot believe they didn't just fall all over you.
When you yelled, ''Hey,'' l thought you cinched it right there.
So, you think you can do better?
Please.
The next girl that comes up the hill, she's mine. l've never seen her look that good.
Kate is hot. l'll be right back.
Hey.
Where do you think you're going?
Humphrey, you know the rules.
You're not allowed to howl with her.
She's an Alpha.
We can eat together.
But we can't, you know, howl together.
Guys, l know. l.. . l was just.. .
Kidding.
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.
Friends for life!
Ugly.
So, do you see Garth?
Great. l'm not even sure what he looks like.
But l'm sure.. .
We'll know him when we see him.
Hey, Kate.
What?
Garth.
Lilly, stand up.
Garth, hello. Good to see you.
-Humphrey?
-My butt! My butt. lt really hurts.
You should really do something about that cough.
Be careful, Kate.
There's something going around.
Tails and ears are falling off, literally.
Name's Humphrey.
Garth.
Wow. You are a.. .
You are a big one, aren't you?
Wow. You're practically a moose.
Where you hiding them antlers?
Who's the coyote?
Who's the coyote? l get it.
That's good, 'cause l'm, like.. .
No one important.
Lilly, why don't you take little coyote Humphrey and run along?
Come on, Humphrey.
Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.
So, tell me about yourself.
What does Garth like to do?
Well, l'm really into fitness, you know?
Rabbit sprints, tree squats.
You know us Alphas got to keep fit to lead the pack.
But, what really gets me going is.. .
Was it good for you?
Unbelievable.
You know.. . l just.. . Just.. . Hold on a sec
'cause l'm going to be right back. l.. . l need some water. Some water. Okay?
So, l'll.. . Just.. . Hold on.
No worries. l'll just keep my vocal chords warm.
Yeah.
''Oh, he's no one important.
''Just take little coyote Humphrey and run along.' '
Coyote.
-Where's Barf?
-lt's Garth.
And we're just taking a little break.
A break?
What? ls that so strange?
No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding? l always like to take a break
10 minutes into a howl.
Well, l do.
Your howling partner, he's not a.. .
He's not a stud.
Not a stud but, like, it's like ''stud'' but.. .
A dud. A dud. That's it. lsn't he?
No.
He is not a dud. ln fact, Humphrey, you'd be surprised to find that he is.. .
Strong!
Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's.. . He's.. .
-Proud!
-Yes! Yes.
Proud. And he's.. .
What's the word l'm looking for?
An Alpha's Alpha.
That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.
You make me so mad!
Hey, l was just kidding.
You're kind of cute.
Really? You think.. . So, wow. Okay. Cute.
Yeah. That's.. . Look.. .
Thank you, first of all, but do you mean ''Cute'' in, like, a rugged, kind of handsomely ''Cute''?
Again with the butt.
These mosquitoes are out of control. l'll meet you on Mars, right after l eat the Milky Way.
That sounds good.
Save some for me.
Bag them up, boys. We're going to ldaho.
You got it, chief.
Okay. There we go. Watch out there.
Kate?
Where am l?
Humphrey? ls that you?
Kate! Where are we? l don't know.
Maybe we're dead.
Nope. Definitely not dead.
At least they left us some water.
You got water?
Nope. Definitely not water.
Kate, what are you doing?
Trying to get out.
Calm down.
Listen, maybe they're taking us to where there's more food.
Or maybe we are the food.
Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.
Yeah.
All right. Set them free.
Look at them go.
Wow.
This isn't Jasper.
Yeah, but it sure does.. . Rock!
Quick, get down!
What are they doing?
What a smashingly brilliant story this is.
The golfing goose from the low regions of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.
He's using the wrong club.
Could you do me a favor, Needles, and shut the hole that makes the words?
Looks like they're playing some sort of weird game.
Maybe they can tell us how to get home.
Yeah. And if they can't, we can eat them.
Yeah. Follow my lead.
Yeah, l'm right behind you.
Now you will see, this shot is mine.
Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.
Just a minute! lt's ugly, but a good runner.
Did you see that? Did you see that? l guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.
You mark it ''Birdie'' because it would have gone in.
Technically, sir, it might have gone in.
That silly bird stopped my shot from going in.
So, l will not take an extra stroke.
Mark it Birdie!
Well, it.. . lt was an obstacle.
And everyone has to play with the obstacles.
You know, we wouldn't want to lie.
This is not a lie.
This is not a lie if you are French.
Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash, a hyphen, in between there.
-l say French.
-Canadian.
-French.
-Canadian.
-French!
-Canadian, sir.
May l just say, though, that you are a wonderful golfer.
And you are a very good caddie.
Take off!
Paddy, what is wrong with you?
Hello.
You are two wolves. l have not seen many wolves in these parts.
But l am not afraid of wolves. No. l like wolves.
Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you a few questions.
Yes. Quick! Look behind you!
Grab him!
So, you want to face the French Resistance?
That's French-Canadian!
My butt! My butt! My butt!
Omegas.
This is not a game anymore!
Don't you wash your feet?
Look out for the trees!
Watch that.
Nice one, sir.
Gotcha.
Oh, no.
That's got to hurt.
How do you like it now, wolf?
Hole in one, sir.
You have bit off more than you can chew this time, my friend.
Help!
My goodness. l.. . Look out for the.. .
No. No. No. No. No. No.
He's a goner for sure.
Wait, what are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
Hey, Frank.
Okay. You have a question?
Yeah. Where are we? ldaho? lda-who?
Oui, ldaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes, and a few billion potatoes.
Sawtooth National Wilderness.
What are we doing in ldaho?
You were relocated to repopulate.
They want you big wolves to make a lot of little wolves.
Sounds good to me.
Park shouldn't be without some wolves. l mean, only for the good of the park.
So you two are undomesticated partners?
Paddy, please. Don't be rude.
So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?
You are an item?
-Well.. .
-No.
You wolves, you are funny.
We have to get home now.
There's going to be trouble if l don't get back to Jasper.
Right. All right. You're freaking out. l'm not freaking out. l just have to get home.
-ls this about Barf?
-lt's Garth.
And it's about responsibilities.
So, l don't expect you to understand.
Can you help me? l need to get home fast.
All right, Miss Fast.
Where is home sweet home?
Jasper Park, Canada.
Jasper park? Get out of here.
We love Jasper Park!
Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.
Paddy, please. We've toured it many times. l dated a Pintail from Jasper once.
She never stopped quacking.
Drove me nuts.
Drove her right to me.
Bound to happen. Bound to happen.
So, you can help me, then, get home.
We haven't played Jasper in quite a while. l think it would be a smashing idea.
This is true. So, of course l will help. l like you two. You make me laugh.
And you didn't eat me, so l owe you favor.
Where did she go?
Maybe l should ask you.
You know that's not my style.
My wolf, Can-do, knows your style. l just want to say one thing. lf any of you wolves have hurt my daughter, l will personally rip out your eyes and shove them down your throat so you can see my claws tear your carcass open!
Mom?
Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.
Well, since Kate stood up Garth, l could show him around until she gets back. l wouldn't say ''Stood up.' '
Garth!
Sounds good to me.
Well, come on, Garth. lsn't that sweet? She gets it from me. l'll give her till the full moon.
lt is beautiful out there.
Almost makes you want
to hit the potato patch.
lf you haven't already hit the outdoors,
get on out your door.
The weather today is...
Your ride home.
Quick! Get in!
What? Boxed up twice in one day.
What are the odds?
-Hide!
-Hide!
That right there is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.
Lucky for you, they travel every year to Jasper right after Sawtooth.
The day's looking pretty, and so is my woman.
This is the song we met to.
Come here, you. Let's dance.
-Down here.
-Hurry.
Now, he was in a motorcycle gang, and she was a librarian.
And opposites attract, if you will.
Exactly. ln this case, it was a bookstore that also sold beer.
So, they met.
Come on. We have to get in.
All right. Here we go.
You're just a dream. l'm like a little bunny. Aren't l, dear? l love you, Deb. l love you, too.
Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.
Well, back in a box.
Good luck, you two!
We will be watching out for you from above!
Well, l'll be watching out for you.
He will be breathing heavily.
lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.
Humphrey?
So, why is this called
Rabbit Poo Mountain?
Because this is where rabbits like to poo. l was just kidding. l get it. You're a funny Omega.
Okay. Make me laugh.
What am l?
You got me. lt's a turtle that fell and can't get up.
That's pretty good.
Okay. What's this? lt's turtle road kill.
What else can you do? l just do turtles.
Okay, it's my turn.
You want to see something an Alpha can do?
Would my mother approve?
Of course.
Well, okay then.
Keep searching.
We must find her before tomorrow night.
Winston?
Don't worry, Eve.
She's the finest Alpha l've trained. l'm not, Winston.
She's also the finest Alpha l've ever trained.
We stopped.
-What's wrong with you?
-l have to go.
You can't leave. Can't you hold it?
No! l can't.
Well, did you try crossing your legs?
-Yes!
-Holding your breath?
Yes! l almost passed out.
-Closing your eyes and.. .
-ln or out, l am going.
Would you hurry? l can't go when l feel pressured.
Go!
What is he doing?
The packaging's wolf-proof.
Where is he?
Come on, Humphrey. lt's a rabid wolf!
Max, bring that gun!
This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?
Max, they're getting away!
Not if l can help it.
-No!
-We're trapped. l got you both now.
Shoot them!
Nicely done, Max.
Okay.
Thinking with my belly instead of my head, not a good idea. l get it. l say we build a comfy den.. .
-l'm going home.
-Great.
You're going home, and it's raining. l'm not stopping.
Rain, rain, go away
Get out of here, rain
No one wants you around
What are you doing? lt's.. . lt's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.
'Cause you're wet
And you really are going to ruin our day
Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.
Right! Well, l'll just do it backwards.
That actually worked.
Kate?
That's not a good idea.
Hold on, Kate!
No!
Hold on, Kate! l'm coming!
Let me think. Let me think.
Humphrey!
Don't worry, Kate. lt's all part of my plan. l can see that.
Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.
Grab your what?
Take those Alpha jaws and grab.. .
My tail. My tail.
Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.
That tickles. My tail hurts!
Who knew l was ticklish there? l can't take any more.
No.
My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!
Your tail. l'm so sorry.
My tail's actually fine, last time l checked.
Come on. Let's get out of the rain.
Okay.
Thank you.
Sir, we've searched the entire territory.
Still no sign of Kate.
Sir?
We must defend our territory.
Fore!
Well, well, well. What do we have here? l say, we've caught them at quite the bad time.
No, l'd say we caught them at a good time. lndeed, sir. lndeed.
What are you doing here?
No, the question is what are you doing here? l give you a first class ticket home.. . lt's a straight shot right to the pin.
-And you blow it?
-Yep.
Over a cupcake.
Ridiculous dessert. ''A cupcake.' '
Actually, they're quite delicious.
There has to be another way for us to get to Jasper.
Another way? Another way?
Always another way.
What am l, a travel agent?
Come on. What, are you kidding me?
A great sportsman like yourself always knows a few ways to win the game.
Well, there could be a train.
Actually, there is a train. lt's the Canadian Express and.. .
Paddy, please. lt's called the Canadian Express.. .
Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.
Right by Jasper Park.
-lf you can catch it.. .
-You'll be home in no time.
No time. Very fast.
Great. So where do we board?
Where do you board?
Watch this.
On the other side of that mountain.
Paddy, please.
Come on!
Let it slip, but may l say, that was a stupendous shot.
You may, and it was pretty good, wasn't it? lndeed, sir. lndeed.
Dinner for two. lt's a new move l've been working on for stalking prey.
You're good.
Thanks. Now you try.
No. l.. . l'm not much of a hunter.
Come on. You'll do great.
Just do what l do.
Okay.
Ready?
-One.
-One.
-Two.
-Two.
Three!
Lilly!
Lilly?
A turtle, right? l told you, l don't hunt.
Maybe this will help.
Wow.
''Wow'' what?
Your eyes.
They're beautiful.
Come on. Let's try again.
-lt sure is pretty out there.
-Yeah.
-l'll race you to the top.
-You're on.
Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.
Humphrey?
Omega one, Alpha zero!
Okay! Okay!
Enough, enough! Stop! Stop! l get it. l get it. l get it.
How's that for a girl's throw?
Very funny.
Well, look who's having fun.
You know, l should go check on the train.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.
Hi, there.
What are you?
Well, l'm a wolf. l've never seen a wolf.
You are really strange.
Am l now?
You're totally weird. l'm going to get you!
No. Look out! Look out!
Okay, you asked for it.
No, no, no. lt's okay. lt's okay. l'm really sorry.
Oh, poo.
Mad.. .
Mad bear.
Kate! Get the snowballs ready!
Mad bear on the attack!
The Canadian Express!
Humphrey, the train is coming!
Kate!
Humphrey?
What's wrong with you?
That!
Don't move. We can handle this.
We can?
Okay, we're in trouble.
Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.
So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown, and one of the bears says,
''Does this taste funny to you?''
A simple ''Boo'' would have sufficed.
Man.
Watch this. One more. One more.
Get up. Kate, get up.
Where are those two?
Why must they make this so difficult? l believe the term is
''high maintenance couple,'' sir.
Stuck between the cliffs and the claws.
This isn't good.
Good luck joking your way out of this one.
What's your name, sir?
Growl. All right.
Do you need a hug?
Why don't we talk? Can we just talk?
Good talk!
Hey, need a ride?
Jump! Trust me! l told you, you could trust me.
Hang a left!
Go right!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Unbelievable. They have missed the train.
Or not.
-l know. lt's not very good, is it?
-Well.. .
That was so awesome.
You with the snowballs.
And you with that little bear in that snowball fight. lt was so cute.
But then you with the log!
The look on your face was so good.
And then we.. .
You know, we make a pretty good team.
Kate and Humphrey, world adventurers!
What do you think? l think you're crazy.
You think l'm.. .
No, l'm telling you, we're onto something here.
Stick with me, pup. We'll go places.
Well, l'll keep that in mind.
All right. Take a deep breath.
Howl from right here.
And l'll join in.
Humphrey, what are you doing? l'm sorry. The moon, the moment. l just thought.. .
Come on, Kate. Howl at the moon with me.
See? That's so good.
No. You better go.
But no one has to know.
Please. Go, now.
No.
Dad.
Howling with an Omega, are we?
-l was just.. .
-Get with the others.
What's going on?
We're going to take the valley, and our caribou.
-Dad!
-Lilly, what's wrong?
The Eastern Wolves. They're coming!
Come on!
Just do it.
She howled at the moon with you.
That was just the moment.
Bonjour, my furry friend.
What?
Are you guys crazy?
That's up for debate.
And where is.. . Mademoiselle.
She's sleeping, so be quiet.
Yes. Quiet.
What are you guys doing here?
Making sure that you don't forget the run of the course.
Jasper Park, it is a few miles up.
Do not miss it.
Jasper, few miles, got it.
Good. l've got to say, your girlfriend looks quite pretty when she sleeps.
She's not my girlfriend.
You should work on that. lt's the full moon, Winston. l can see that, Tony. l didn't want it to come to this.
But here we are.
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
Kate.
Kate, wake up. Wake up.
Humphrey? Where are we?
We're.. . We're in Jasper.
We're home.
Yup. We're home.
-There's something.. .
-There's something.. .
Please, you first.
Humphrey, l just wanted to tell you, these past couple of days, they've been, kind of, fun.
You've been, kind of, fun.
Really?
Really.
Well, that's.. . That's great. l told you, we make a pretty good team.
We do.
Okay.
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
You have to go to the bathroom again.
Why, do you see a truck stop? l just wanted to tell you l.. . l.. .
-l.. . l just wanted to tell you.. .
-No. l.. . l love.. .
Oh, geez.
All l asked was for you to follow our customs, unite the packs.
But, no.
Your daughter had to up and run away. l didn't run away.
Kate!
She's back!
-We were so worried.
-Where have you been?
-ln ldaho.
-ldaho?
What were you doing in ldaho?
We were taken by humans to another park.
We were supposed to repopulate.
No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.
Humphrey actually helped me get home.
What a nice boy.
-l came back.. .
-You came back to marry Garth.
Yes.
And unite the packs!
Good for the pack, good for the belly.
Marry? You're getting married?
Yes. lsn't it great?
No more fighting during hunts.
No more scraps and bones at dinnertime.
We're going to unite the packs.
Welcome back, Humphrey.
Good job bringing her home.
Wow. lt's a big crowd.
Yeah. Good times.
So l heard you and Garth spent some time together.
Lilly.
Sorry. l'm sure he's perfect marrying material.
Well, if you like that sort of thing, big, brawny, and perfect.
Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.
Sorry. l know.
But, l liked it.
Right on the pin.
Marcel! Paddy!
When it comes to hugs, we are all French, Paddy?
Well, l'm English, so we don't hug!
But for a first, l'd say that was a good one. l'm so happy to see you two.
We flew in to see that you made it home.
And what do we find?
-You're getting married!
-You're getting married!
Yeah. l'm getting married.
-Who told you?
-l did.
Humphrey.
We should be going.
Yes, yes.
Excuse me. A flea.
And a little something for your big day.
Thank you.
Just wanted to say good-bye.
Good-bye?
Yeah. l'm thinking about doing a little traveling, you know, seeing where the train takes me.
And maybe l'll visit our friends the bears.
Our old buddies, see how they're doing. l'll tell them you said hi.
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?
Yeah. You know, it's a lone wolf thing. l know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega, not Humphrey, the lone wolf.
So l'll be a fun-loving lone wolf. l don't doubt that.
You know, Marcel, l am a stickler for tradition, but this one, l just don't understand.
These wolves are mysterious creatures.
Tony.
So.. .
Are you ready?
Yes.
Good.
Are you okay?
You bet.
No problems on this end.
Ready to go, go, go.
So, you want to start this thing or me?
We'll start together.
Start together. Yeah.
So, what's happening?
They're accepting each other's scent.
And now, the nibble on the ears.
Do you think l can make it?
Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks, you should see an open train car.
Well, avoid truck stops, bears, and that hideous dessert. What is it called?
-Cupcakes, sir.
-Yes. Cupcakes. l will. Thanks, guys.
You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental about cupcakes.
They really are quite delicious. l wouldn't know.
And finally, they will rub noses to symbolize that they are mates!
Kate, what are you doing? l.. . l can't.
You can't! l mean, you can't?
What is this, Winston?
Why can't she marry Garth?
Quiet.
Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?
Because l.. . l fell in love with an Omega.
An Omega?
Humphrey? That sly dog!
An Alpha in love with an Omega.
That's against pack law.
Dad. l also am in love with an Omega.
What?
What have you done to my son, Winston?
An Omega and an Alpha?
An Alpha and an Omega?
Eve, help me out.
This is madness. This isn't our custom.
This isn't our way. Take the valley! l just love weddings!
Stampede! Stampede!
Everyone, run! Run!
To the sides of the valley! lt's that darn disk in my back.
Come on!
No! They're trapped!
Humphrey!
Kate!
We have to help them!
Look!
Faster, Tony! Faster!
Go left!
Roll right!
You're getting good at this. l had a good teacher.
They're too far ahead. We'll never make it.
Hold on.
Look!
World adventurers. l told you we'd make a good team.
Did you say that? l thought l said that.
Kate!
Kate. Kate.
Please, Kate.
Please, you can't do this. l love you.
Kate!
Humphrey? l thought l'd lost you. ls everyone staring at us?
Well, no, not.. . Not every.. . Well, yeah.
Now they are.
Darn. 'Cause l wanted to tell you something.
What?
Really?
Okay.
Well, l wanted to tell you something, too.
Maybe this can work.
All right.
Garth!
Tony, what do two old wolves do after they retire?
Gentlemen, may l introduce you to golf?
Fore!
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that's good.
Come on, honey.
Let's show 'em how it's done.
You ready to shake your tail?
Now that's a howl.
Are you ready?
Yeah. Ready.

Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city...
...eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing...
...and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time
I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies. No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo,
I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probably--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say
"bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did. Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know. Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay. That should do it. Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops. And....
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts,
Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine...
...you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
Look-- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--? Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see. And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?! How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait! You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir. That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think...
...of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh. It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra-- Smith. You have a vis-- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry. Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay. I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry. My work isn't--
My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea. Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read
The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I like to-- Me too.
-Ha, ha! Yeah.
Ranger Smith. At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time...
...and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really? Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks? Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi? Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right. That Yogi.
Bankrupt? No, no, no. We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes. Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes! Wow. Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay? Thank you.
Ugh. How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm. Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers...
...two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah. That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah. Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre...
...just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson...
...who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans. Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
-Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes. Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh. I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo. This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment. Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What? No. No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it,
Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-Really?
Yes. Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith! Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know
I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding. Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special. Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6. Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money...
...to cover its operating budget...
...can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
-I thought that went well.
-Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget? Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish. Yeah. Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are. But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today. But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right. Have it your way. Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh? Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week! Do I have time for that?
-Impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course! I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer...
...dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds...
...and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry. We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
-Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow. How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir. Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles...
...so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles? Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish,
I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh. Oh, that. Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now. Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying,
"Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned? What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special. People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope. It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi. Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours...
...to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear...
...it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand--
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir. Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'll drive. Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think
I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for llfe.
Try that with people...
...and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh--
If you want.
I mean, it's not that-- You don't-- It's--
You know, it's not a worry. Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did. Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really? Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate,
I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid...
...and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds...
...swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything
I could about the park...
...so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to
Extreme Jellystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi. Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament...
...and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi. That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep. But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in
With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right. We need something flashier than music. Not a problem.
I've got this water-skllng routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski...
...or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park...
...you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay. Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees? That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes. Exactly. Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes...
...the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right. Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant...
... but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary. There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-- No!
Oh, okay. Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah. That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh. It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park...
...which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah. Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says
I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues? Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second. Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No. Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your llfe as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid llfe choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay? Here's my card.
So long.
Hey. Now why is it doing that?
No. Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms. Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms,
$10 off today. Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait. Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea. Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay. Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning. I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried. All Iast night
I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor. Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys. Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored? But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program...
...but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel,
I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so...
...gushy. Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I...
...saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love
And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
Hi. Hello...
...and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you. It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable...
...and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo! Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skllng machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait. There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know. It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh? Fire!
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind. Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different. You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive...
...while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my llfe.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi...
...how smart are you now?
Hey, there! That was quite a show you put on yesterday. Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park. Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor! Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it. You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does...
...and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole llfe, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if
I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm Ieaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this. Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there. Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food. No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park. Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees. They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution...
... have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich...
...and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is. Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing. You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference. No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah. Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger...
...is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and
Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there,
Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements
I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo. I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo. You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing? I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is...
... I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo...
...get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone,
Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called
Evergreen Park.
That's right. In the city.
The city? That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it. Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it. Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles? I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi. We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma. Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want? I don't have a llfe left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends
I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One: light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love...
...whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try. Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do. Park is closed to the public until the press conference. Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone,
I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
-Mm-hm.
Oh, right. Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my. I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True. You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle. See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there. But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke. About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great. Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out. The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We’ll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No. A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is? Wow, I've never heard of that law...
... in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay. You know what? Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages...
...of having lived here since
I was a kid...
...is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh. Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight. My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you’ll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check. Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi. Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
-Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo. Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
-Here we go!
-Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We’ll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We’ll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We’ll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let’s go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha. Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right. You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging? The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they’ll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha. Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that. He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit. Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go. Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
Look, Boo Boo! We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
-Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up. Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you. Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
-Welcome aboard.
-Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it. You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on. Mr. Ranger said--
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that? I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
-Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi. Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know. It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and
I value leadership. I have a merit badge--
Can we talk Iater?
We're pressed for time.
Yes. Get in.
Boo Boo! Boo Boo! Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over. Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry. He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you’ll excuse me,
I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah? Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them
Bigfoot is here. Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what? I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city...
...why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time. Must be something we can do. Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--? Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people. Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this. Keep your eye on the little bear. Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown...
...proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
"frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No. No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay. No. Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
-We got it! Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
-Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are...
...and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay. All right, that's--
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general. I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle. And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi. Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of...
...the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming...
...intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides...
...I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
I....
Let's-- Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi! Hey! srt English Subtitles
Dan4Jem, ADMMXI
Here's my day, so far.
Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked.
Pretty good.
Still, things could be a lot worse.
Oh, that's right, I'm falling to my death.
Guess they can't.
How did it all come to this, you ask?
My end starts at the beginning.
The very beginning.
Yes, that's me.
I had a fairly standard childhood.
I came from what you might call, a broken home.
Literally, broken.
I was eight days old and still living
How sad is that?
Clearly it was time to move on.
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.
And here is your binkie.
You are destined for ...
I didn't quite hear that last part.
But it sounded important.
Destined for, what?
I set out to find my destiny.
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.
And our glorious rivalry, was born!
Could this be what I was destined for?
A dream life filled with luxury?
Apparently not.
Even fate makes its favorite soup.
No big deal.
A much different fate awaited me.
A baby.
How thoughtful.
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.
Can we keep him?
A place that taught me the differences between right...
...and wrong.
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand, had life handed to him on a silver platter.
Our baby can fly.
- Yes, yes
- And that was not the best
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.
But I had something far, far greater,
My amazing intellect.
A knack for building objects of mayhem.
After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior.
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning.
At a strange place called shh-ool.
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.
He bought their affections with showmanship,
So I too would make this 'popped-corn' and win over those mindless dregs.
Lights out!
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.
Good receives all the praise, adulation.
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.
While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider.
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects.
And rehydrate them at will.
Someday's it felt like it was just me and Minion,
No matter how hard I tried.
I was always the odd man out.
The last one picked.
The screw-up... black sheep.
Bad boy.
Oh!
Was this my destiny?
Wait! Maybe it was.
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.
Then it hit me.
If I was the bad boy.
Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.
I was destined to be a super villain.
And we were destined to be rivals.
The die had been cast.
And so began an enduring epic, life long career.
And I loved it.
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.
He would win some, I would almost win others.
He took the name, Metro Man.
Defender of Montrosity.
I decided to pick up something a little more humble.
Megamind.
Incredibly handsome criminal genius, and master of all villainy.
MEGAMIND
Read on your own time. Open up.
Hey!
BOO!
Oh, good morning, Warden.
Great news, I'm a changed man.
And I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.
You're a villain, and you're always be a villain.
You'll never change.
And you'll never leave.
- You're fun.
- You got a present in the mail.
Is it a puppy?
From Metro Man. To count every second of your 85 life sentences.
That's funny, never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.
Oh but he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.
Any chance you could give me the time?
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum.
Oh no, looks like you're
By several thousand years.
Oh, am I?
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.
It's a beautiful day downtown where we're here to honor a beautiful man.
Metro Man.
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.
For years he's been watching us
Saving us with his super strength, and caring for us with his super heart.
Now it's our turn to give something back.
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.
Wow, okay, the stuff they make you read on the air.
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.
What I was trying to say was,
I can't believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news.
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we, like lets just get
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.
That's the first thing.
That's sweet of you.
And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby.
- Mmm.
- Okay, that sounded, Okay that
A little bit, yeah.
And you're making your face, and that's making me feel weird.
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying I'm in love with you.
I'm saying... Roxanne?
Roxaroo?
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.
- Freeze!
- Whoa, what are you doing, guys?
It's ME!
Hey, open up.
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.
You were right.
I'll always be a villain.
Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.
B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.
Bad to the bone.
Well hello good looking, need a lift?
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.
Get in the car, you.
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.
You got it, boss.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.
And... Metro Men.
Hey, Metro City!
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?
Give it to me... all right!
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.
Hey, Metro city.
Hello, hey.
You know, you actually want to bring it down a bit.
Boys, a little lower.
Thank you fellows.
Let's get real for a moment.
That's right, that's right ha, ha, that's right.
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.
Super cool, you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?
Do you really want to know?
Really?
Then I'll tell you.
The greatest honor you've given me is...
...letting me serve you.
To help these people of Metro city.
And at the end of every day.
Well.
I often ask myself.
Who would I be, without you?
I love you Metro Man!
And I love you, random citizen.
I tell you Minion, there's no place like evil lair.
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.
How do I look, Minion?
- Do I look bad?
- Disgustingly horrifying, sir.
You always know what to say.
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
Now, back to work.
She's awake,
Quick, to work.
- Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
- Would it kill you to wash the bag?
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.
Wha..why isn't she screaming?
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.
Like this... AHHHHH!
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.
AHHHHH!
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website, where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?
Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in...
Don't answer that.
...Romania.
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey reporter skills, on your weak little mind to find out all our secrets.
Such tricks... won't work... on me.
- Please talk slower
- Temptress.
What secrets? You're so predictable.
Predictable, predictable?
Oh, you call THIS predictable?
Your Alligators, yes.
I was thinking about it on the way over.
What's this? BOOM!
- In your face.
- Cliché.
No, look, watch.
Juvenile.
- Shuck it all!
- Tacky
- Oh, so sorry.
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?
- Garish.
Okay, the spiders new.
Spider?
Ee, Uh, yes!
The *spee..ider*. Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus
Will instantly paralyze... OW!
Get it off!
- Ow!
- Forget it Megamind. Your plans never work.
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?
OOOWWW!
It is a great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.
If you please.
Hey! Uh, my kid can't see.
- Megamind.
- Oh, bravo Metro Man.
Booooo!
Yes, I can play along too.
Booooo.
Should have known you'd try to crash the party.
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.
This is the day you and Montrosity, shall not soon forget.
It's pronounced Metro City!
Oh, potato, tomato, potato, tomato.
We all know how this ends.
With you behind bars.
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boots.
You will leave, Montrosity.
Or this will be the last you ever hear of,
Roxanne Ritchi!
- Huh?
- Roxanne!
- Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
- I'm not panicking.
In order to stop me, You need to find me first, Metro Man.
We're at the Metroman observatory.
Ah ha, no we're not!
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.
Metro Man approaching, sir.
- HAH!
- Hah, hah!
Hah, hah, hah.
Hold on a second.
Oh, good heavens.
You didn't think you were at the real observatory, did you?
Ready the death ray, Minion.
Death ray, readying.
Over here, old friend.
In case you haven't noticed,
You've fallen right into my trap.
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.
Even the most heartfelt belief, can be corroded with time.
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.
But metals can be melted by the heat of 're-vange'.
It's 'revenge' and it's best served cold.
But it can be easily reheated, in the microwave of evil.
Well I think your warranty is about to expire.
Maybe I got an extended warranty?
Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for it's intended purpose.
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand the full concentrated power of the... SUN!
FIRE!
Minion, fire...
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?
- Warming up, sir.
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?
One... sssecond... more.
Aaannnd.... jussst.
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap, tip top more.
And we are ready, in just.
Oh! I told you to have things running.
Told you out of the sounds.
Why do you always blame me?
My spider bite is acting.
Your plan is failing, just admit it.
Yeah, good luck with that one.
Whose side are you on?
The losing side.
- Thank you.
- Uh, could someone stamp my
You of all people, know that we discontinued that promotion.
- Ta, ta all.
- Same time next week?
What did he just say?
Crab nuggets?
Good lord, I'm trapped.
What kind of trickery is this?
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.
It, it has?
This dome is obviously lined with copper.
- Yeah, so?
- Sir!
Copper drains my powers.
Your weakness is copper?
You're kidding, right?
I don't think even he could survive that.
Well, lets not get our hopes up just yet.
- Look!
- Metro Man.
Metro Man...
Metro Man! AHHH!
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!
Ewwww.
You did it, sir.
I did it?
He did it.
I did it.
He did it.
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!
- You did it.
- I did it!
Montrocity is mine!
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.
All right people, hit it.
Hit it!
Living easy, living free.
Season ticket on a one way ride.
Don't need reason, don’t need rhyme
- Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.
- Drop 'em.
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,
I'm on the Highway to...
- Highway..
- La, la, la, la, la...
- Highway..
- Ahh, ahh, ahh....
First off, what a turnout.
How wild is this, huh?
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.
Are there any questions?
Come on..yes?
You in the back.
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us.
And the city.
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of.
And multiply it by... SIX!
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
Normal people do.
Let's just have fun with this, come on.
And I will get back to you.
Now slam the door, really hard.
They can... they can still see you.
- Now?
- Yeah, you're still there.
- Oh,
- Let's get going.
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.
Ahh, Minion.
Did you think this day would ever come?
No way, not at all, sir. Never, never in a million, not even...
Yes, I did.
Look at the intricate moon links.
I'm looking, I'm looking.
And what's this?
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.
But it seems to only carry one station.
Oh, that sir is called a window.
- Window...
- All the kids are looking through them.
Oooo, I've never had a view before.
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.
If my parents could see me now.
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out of the way.
I can have, everything I want!
And there's no one to stop me.
All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...
Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.
We may as well go home, as I did on my own.
Alone again, naturally.
To think that only yesterday.
I was cheerful bright and gay.
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do, the role I was about...
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.
I understand you, little well dressed bird.
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't it. What's your vacuum like?
Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.
I'm in a heated existential discussion with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.
I... is something wrong, sir?
Just think about it.
We have it all.
But we have nothing.
It's just to easy now.
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.
- I mean, we did it, right?
- Well, you did it, sir.
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.
- Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
- Huh?
Unhappy.
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow, we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.
That always seems to lift your spirits.
Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?
- Him, sir?
- Nothing.
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh, something to consider and um, well, I think I'll just power down for a while then.
He was always there for us.
Dependable.
Perhaps we took him for granted.
Maybe we never really know how good we have it, until it's gone.
We miss you, Metro Man.
I, miss you.
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.
Are you happy now?
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero.
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.
Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas.
- 'Cause we're done.
- Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party at my house.
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really fell like being around a bunch of people.
No, no, no. That's why it'll just be, like you and me.
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.
- But,
- I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case, we were like something crazy happened.
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe we should have this for like ever, like a memory, you know.
Um, I'm gonna pass.
I have some work here I need to do. Okay, bye.
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?
- Goodnight, Hal.
- It's a soft yes, on Thursday.
What's, wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house? She's don't like bouncy houses, they like clown's.
OW! Ohhh!
Stupid van!
Broken finger!
I've made a horrible mistake.
I didn't mean to destroy you.
I mean, I meant to destroy you.
But I didn't think it would really work.
What are we suppose to do, without you?
I am so tired of running rampant through the streets.
What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?
Someone has to stop, Megamind.
Hey, we're closing soon.
Oh, you scared me.
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.
Bernard, I was just well I was talking to myself.
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.
Thank you, I just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I have so many evil plans in the works.
The illiteracy beam.
Typhoon cheese.
Robo sheep.
Battles we will now, never have.
You know we never had the chance to say goodbye.
So, it's good that we have this time now.
You know, before I destroy the place.
Nothing personal, it just brings back to many painful memories.
Hello, hello?
Roxanne!
That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?
- Megamind's head is not that grossly big.
Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...
Hello, is someone there?
Hello, who's there?
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.
It's just you, Bernard.
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.
Well thank you for letting me stay.
And thirty seven seconds if I were you.
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down with you then.
I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes.
Yeah, he was really good at those.
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.
I've looked into the reset button.
The size is impossible.
Bernard, I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you okay?
Metro Man is gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.
Oh, come on, Bernard.
As long as there's evil good will rise up against it.
Ohhh, I wish.
I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind.
- You really think so?
- Yeah.
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.
Hero’s can be made. That's it!
- All you need are the right ingredients.
- Yeah.
- Bravery.
- Yes.
- Strength.
- Of course.
- Determination.
- Imperative.
And a smidgen of DNA.
- With that, anyone can be a hero.
- Yeah!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
I think we should run.
Bye.
Time to put the past behind us.
Only the future... AHH!
Oh, that's to much.
I'm definitely scared right now.
Oh, hope no ones seeing this.
Create a hero? A what?
Why would you do that?
So I have someone to fight.
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.
A ying, with no yang.
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.
In other words, I have no purpose.
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on, ask.
How are you doing to do it?
I'm going to give someone, I don't know who yet.
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that someone to become Montrocity's new hero.
Over here, follow.
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.
We could put everything back the way it was.
When the world was perfect.
And rosy. Behold, Minion.
Metro Man's cape.
Look closely.
Tell me what you see?
Dandruff?
Yes, it's his DNA.
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.
Boss, I think this is a bad idea.
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad, bad.
Okay, you might think it's good in your bad perception.
But from a good perception, it is just plain bad.
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.
Now we have just one shot at this.
I must find a suitable subject.
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.
What on earth is that?
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.
- O-llo,
- Uh, it's hello.
Hello, like that?
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.
- It's Roxanne.
I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day.
- Oh, You've inspired me too.
- Great!
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.
- I'm already hot on his trail.
- Uh, huh.
And what gives you that idea?
- Uh, sir.
- I just found his secret hideout.
How did she find my hideout?
Uh, how did you find his hideout?
This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof.
Okay, there's no way she'll find the secret entrance.
Oh! There's a doormat here that say's 'Secret Entrance'.
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.
She'll discover all our secrets.
- Ohh, oh no!
- You dim-witted creation of science.
What? Oh, not you Roxanne.
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.
Roxanne?
Oh no, not again.
Roxanne.
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm glad you're here.
How did you get here so fast?
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.
- In a suit?
- Uh huh.
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.
But that's not important.
I better take the lead.
This way looks exciting.
No, it says, exit.
Uh, which is the abbreviation for 'Exciting', right?
It's the mother load.
- Ahh.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Just look at this thing.
You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.
- Really?
- You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?
- Yes, right.
- Together we could figure out his plan
Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!
- That's what I want to hear.
Minion,
Code-Send out the brain pods.
You know the whole point of a code is...
Oh code-just do it, Minion.
Ahh, it's me you fools!
Bernard!
It's daddy.
Megamind!
What have you done with, Bernard?
Bernard? Oh yes, I mean poor defenseless,
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!
You know the drill.
Oh no, not the drill.
- Let him go.
- Or what?
Or I'm going to find out what this weird looking gun does.
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.
I'll just go get him.
Unhand me you fiend!
It, it's strength's to much.
Oh, I work out.
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.
Are you okay?
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.
I got this covered.
Let go, it's mine!
Bernard, help!
Give it to me.
Oh no!
Roxanne.
Ow!
Who on earth is that?
Roxanne!
Bernard, you were right about that door being exciting.
This way.
- Huh!
- What are you doing?
This will stop them, here!
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.
Just throw it.
Daddy's, suffering.
- Wow, that was real exciting.
- Yeah.
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.
What's going on?
Hal, what happened?
I think a bee flew up my nose.
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you, when like fifty ninjas tried to attack me.
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...
- and they were all like crying, so.
- Wow.
Brave one, isn't he.
Who are you?
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.
- He's my partner.
- Partner?
Yes, yes partner.
Well look partner, I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's been through a traumatic experience.
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.
Yeah, okay.
I'd like that.
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you accidentally, okay lets end the meeting.
Sir!
Code-Did you find out who it was?
Huh?
Oh, oh.
Code-get the car.
Code-right away, sir.
- Buh bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hal.
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.
Who is this man, infused with godlike power?
Ow, ow, whoa ho.
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.
No criminal record.
Actually, no records at all.
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.
Not yet, Minion.
Not...
...Yet.
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?
So I will just go ahead and defuse him, since this is clearly a mistake.
No, Minion. Something much more powerful is at work.
This is no mistake.
It's destiny.
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.
Hal? Hal Stewart?
Am I saying it right?
Stewart.
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.
- Oops, all out.
- Well use the forget-me-stick.
Oh, right!
Just look at him.
Well, he doesn't look quite the hero type to me.
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.
I smell hero.
I smell something burning.
I think it's working!
Places, places...
You have your disguise?
What?
Ah, you look fantastic.
Rise, my glorious creation.
Rise, and come to Papa.
What's going on?
- Easy my child.
- Who are you?
I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice.
Honor, and nobility.
I am your father.
So you're like, my space Dad?
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.
And you are, what?
I'm your space, Step-Mom.
I, I had some work done recently.
Is this some kind of dream?
This is a dream come true.
You've been blethed with unfathomamble power.
What kind of power?
Unfathamomble.
It's un, without Fathom.
- Whoa
- Yeah, we've come to guide you.
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.
I know this is a lot to take in.
It may take months for you to come to grips..
No frickin' way.
Wahoo! Look at the big hero.
I'm a big hero.
Thee Minion, he's perfect.
Aaannd, action!
- Someone help me.
- I'm okay.
Sun is shinning in the sky
Ohhh, oh!
There ain't a cloud in sight
Zap, zap, zap.
Ha, haaa!
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay something cool back at me.
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.
No, no, no. Shut it down, and stop.
I said slow down.
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!
- Maybe we should change tactics?
- You think so?
Oh, you know how boys are.
They want video games.
I can throw a few parts together.
Can't... wait.
LoL, smiley face.
Can't wait for what, sir?
Oh, that was such a funny story.
And brilliantly told, by the way.
Okay, now you tell one.
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.
And, I never heard you laugh before.
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.
Mr. Blue, you did it right.
And, exit.
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind
I'll remember you this,
I'll remember you this way.
You don't get out much, do you?
Fun!
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.
It was one of my favorite things to do.
Now look at it.
It's a dump.
Hey Mr. Blue, we're so please to be with you.
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?
Um, well we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump, now... do we?
They're all back.
But how, why?
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.
Wa haoooo
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I, were never a couple.
But I thought you two were...
I know, everybody did. It's just, well he was never really my type.
Really?
Okay, now you tell me something.
Something you've never told anyone.
Well, in shh-school.
None of the other kids really liked me.
I was always last one picked for everything.
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't go to the same school.
Hal, I think you're ready for this.
Do I have a son?
No, Hal, you make me laugh.
It stretches, it's for you.
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?
Titan.
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?
It was the only name I could trademark.
Oh.
Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?
No not yet, but.
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.
That's very good. Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.
- All you have to do, is save her.
And she'll be yours.
- Who want's Churro's?
- I do!
Thanks spaced out, momma.
On the count of three, unsheathe your Churro.
One, two, three!
To Titan.
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind.
And the city will know your name.
The City's parks' restored to their original glory.
The street's, the safest they've been.
The banks reopened.
Has something happened to Megamind?
Has someone tamed this monster?
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic, but pleasantly confused.
Well you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.
Huh, how long is this going to take me?
Just a few alterations, sir. And I'll be done with your most terrifying cape yet.
I'm calling it, Black
Mambaaaaaaa... aaaa... aaa.
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am running late. I have to go.
What, where, where are you going, sir?
We have our date to battle Titan in the morning.
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to, run a quick errand.
You don't run errands.
What's going on here?
- What?
- Oh, wait a minute.
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
Fleur Du?
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?
Ahhh.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.
Your going on a date with her.
No my main man, get out of town.
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?
She will never find out.
That's the point of lying.
Ahhh!
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think this is your first day at being evil.
NO!
This has gone far enough.
Oh, that was really grown up.
Sir please, it's for your own good.
Well what do you know.
I may not know much, but I do know this.
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.
You heard me.
Who are you?
- Now give me the keys.
- NO!
My soul purpose in life is to look after you.
Well I don't need you to look after me.
What are you... what are you saying?
- You don't need me?
- Let me make it clear.
Code-I don't need you.
You know what, you know what.
Code-I'll just pack my things and go.
Code-Fine!
Code-Fine back.
Well good luck on your date.
- I will.
- That doesn't even make any sense.
I know.
I know I am so close, I can feel it.
Okay, okay I just have to take a step back.
Wait a minute.
Titan.
What's a Titan?
My super ears are burning.
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.
The names Titan.
- Titan?
- Your very own heroic guardian
What's your name? Just kidding, I know everything about you.
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,
Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed you know, all of them.
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.
- What do you want?
- Thought maybe we could go for a little
- Get to know each other first.
- WHOA!
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.
Just what do you think you're doing?
Oh are we moving to fast?
You're probably right. I should just rescue you a few times before we get
Whoops!
Saved that, You are lucky to have such a great hero here.
Somebody do something?
No wait, Duh! I gotcha.
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.
- Ahhh, building!
- AHHHH!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Gotcha!
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.
Put me down, right now!
Okay, all right, all right, hold on.
Are you crazy?
I suppose I'm, a little crazy... about you.
Who are you? Really.
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare to have your mind blown, little lady.
- Tada!
- Hal?
Yeah, isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.
No, it's not great.
Aww, our first fight. This is so us, we're like an old married couple.
There is no us, okay. There will never be an us.
But, I have powers.
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.
You are a good guy, Hal.
But you don't understand we need to find out why...
Right now, this isn't right.
- Listen to me, Hal.
- You're suppose to be with me.
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.
Hmm, not the only exciting development of the night.
Megamind's created a new hero.
And I know why.
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created a new hero to kick it for him.
But why, Hal?
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.
Wow, that's a lot to take in.
It, it boggles my mind.
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking who's butt.
But in the mean time.
Let's enjoy each other's company.
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right, you know, I could use a breather.
To, Bernard. For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world.
To... being normal.
- Roxanne.
- Yes?
Say I wasn't so normal.
Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color.
As a random, not a specific example.
Would you still enjoy my company?
Of course, you don't judge a book by its cover.
Or a person from the outside.
Oh, that's a relief to hear.
You judge them based on their actions.
Well that seems kinda petty, don't you think.
- You.
- What, what?
Oh, don't look at me!
Just, just a technical glitch.
Don't look yet.
My bad.
Where were we?
Now, now, hold on.
YOU!
I can explain.
What about everything you just said?
About judging a book by it's cover.
Well let's take a look at the contents then, shall we?
You destroyed Metro Man.
You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you.
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?
What could you possibly hope to gain?
Wait a minute.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?
No...
Okay Minion, you were right.
I was.... less right.
We should stick to what we're good at.
Being bad.
Minion...
You there.
Yeah, you.
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!
Okay, Titan it's time to go down, in style.
I hear there's a new hero.
Who dares to challenge my evil.
Where is the one they call, Titan?
Challenge me, if you dare.
Oh no, we're gonna crash.
This is embarrassing.
Ballsy and incipient.
Boneheaded, irresponsible.
RUDE!
Unprofessional, that's what this is.
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?
Of course not, he was a pro.
Hey, Megamind. You're actually the guy I want to see.
Also, there's a door here.
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying to beat this score.
Were you even planning on showing up?
What's this?
Where did you get all this stuff?
It doesn't belong to me.
You stole it!
- Pretty cool, right.
- Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.
Being a hero is for losers.
It's work, work, work twenty four seven, and for what?
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.
Roxanne Ritchi?
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb.
- Ohhhh
- Who needs all that noise.
That's why I think, WE should team up.
You? Wait! What?
With my power, and your big headedness, we could rule the city.
- You want to team up?
- I even drew up some new costume designs.
- See
- Costume design?
You have a brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume, or something.
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like two tanks sword fighting.
I can't believe you.
All your gifts all your powers, and you squander them for your own personal gain.
- Yes!
- NO!
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.
That's why I created you.
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
- Space Dad told me.
- Look, I'm your Space Dad.
You should be more like Metro Man.
You tricked me?
Oh, don't like that, huh?
Well there's more.
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.
- No.
- And we were smooching.
Mwah... Mwah... Mwah.
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna, gonna...
YES! Yes I know.
Break me in two. Oh god, how I missed this.
And the hero strikes the first blow.
But evil returns with a backhand.
YES!
Ahh... shhhh.
Come out you little freak!
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement.
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.
You little blue, twerp.
En Garde!
Oh, now that's the spirit.
Take, that, and again!
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter.
You go first.
Look I'm not sure where you're going at.
This one's for pursuing my girlfriend.
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.
And Megamind! This is for
Space, Step-Mom.
You lied to her!
Oh, well now, I thought that pummeling went really, really well.
I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?
- But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue.
- You're dead!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This isn't how you play the game.
Game over.
Great button.
I'm calling time out.
Time out, time out!
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from Copper. You're powerless against it.
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...
Metro Man?
You, should stop comparing me to Metro Man.
You run Megamind, but you can't hide.
We're saved, we're saved!
What's your name, new hero?
- It's Tighten.
- Thank you, thank you.
Tighten has freed us.
Oh I wouldn't say free.
More like, under new management.
What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.
- Congratulations, another one of your genius
And why did my doorman let you up?
- Carlos?
- What are you, no, no!
I need your help.
Why do you need MY help?
Because you're the smartest person I know.
Well you can't hide here.
Copper should have worked, why didn't the copper work?
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.
Copper? You're not making any sense.
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.
Okay, how can I help?
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.
Well, there is one place I know.
You gave him these powers, can't you just take them away?
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.
The night you dumped me.
Alone.
In the rain.
- Did you ever look back?
- NO!
- Oh, my giant blue head.
- I guess we're here.
So, this is where he hid it.
After all these years. My old shhool house.
You know, I think there's an apology in order, for the other night.
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.
Wow, can't believe he kept all this stuff.
Aww, I remember when he wore that.
Can you just stay focused here?
Yes of course, you're right, focused.
HEY! Come over and look at this.
What is it?
Um..... look!
This glass has ice cubes in it.
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.
No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet?
One of life’s great mysteries.
Hey.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
We now run a confirmed report.
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.
The city has never seen this level of destruction.
If only Metro Man were still alive.
- You're alive?
- You're alive.
I'm alive.
But..we..we saw your skeleton.
- You were dead.
- Are you a ghost?
There had better be, an amazing explanation for this.
Speak, apparition.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You both deserve the truth.
It all started back at the observatory.
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna stop you.
My head wasn't in the game that day.
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...
Using my super speed.
I decided to go clear my head.
Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.
But I just felt stuck.
I began to realize, despite all my powers, each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't.
A choice.
Ever since I can remember I've always had to be what the City wanted me to be.
But what about what I wanted to do?
Then it suddenly hit me.
I do have a choice.
I can be whatever I want to be.
No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig.
You can't just quit either.
That's when I got the brilliant idea...
...to fake my death.
Copper drains my powers!
You're weakness is copper?
Once your death ray hit.
I never felt so alive.
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.
Metro Man was finally dead.
And Music Man was born.
Music man?
That way I can keep my logo.
- WHAT?
- 'Cause of what?
Finally I'm free, to get in touch with my true power.
Weaving lyrical magic.
Check this out.
I have eyes that can see
right through leaaadd.
- Ewww
- Granted you have talent,
But there's a mad man out there destroying our... your city.
Why did you do this?
The people of the city relied on you, and you deserted them.
No offense.
No, I'm with you.
Look, we need your help.
I'm sorry, I really am.
Um, I'm, I'm done.
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying for every Yang.
If there's bad, good will rise up against it.
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.
Now it's about time, you find yours.
Hey, who needs him.
We can beat Tighten ourselves.
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns, hold them sideways, and just go all gangsta on 'em.
We can't
So that's it? You're just giving up?
I'm the bad guy.
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset, and I don't get the girl.
I'm going home.
Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost.
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay indoors until further notice.
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.
Hal!
Hal!
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses.
Well, I'm over you.
I've come to stop you, Hal.
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you going to do, report me to death?
I was going to try reasoning with you.
You and I, we worked together for a long time.
I know you.
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.
I want to talk to the real Hal.
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man, and eating dip,
And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten-Hal.
To late!
Megamind.
You and I have some unfinished business.
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower, oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.
Roxanne!
Come on Roxi, call for your hero to come rescue you.
Megamind.
I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are...
You can't give up.
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight.
Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.
It was your best quality.
You need to be that guy, right now.
The city needs you.
I need you.
Roxanne.
You have one hour.
Don't... keep me waiting.
Warden, Warden!
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life sentences to go.
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.
Here it is. Black is part of my heart.
I.... AM.... Sorry!
Not buying it.
I don't blame you.
I've terrorized the city countless times.
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.
I lied to Roxanne, and...
My best friend, Minion.
I treated like dirt.
Please, don't make this city,
Don't make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings.
Apology accepted.
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.
You got me!
Good luck, fellows.
We're gonna die!
Wait, what?
Hey, Metro losers.
This is Metro Tower.
They say it's suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength.
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.
And I hate reminders.
HAL!
Please don't do this.
I know there's still good in you, Hal.
You're so naive, Roxie.
You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there.
You're weaving a fantasy.
There is no Easter bunny.
There is no tooth fairy.
And there is no Queen of England.
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.
You dare to challenge Megamind?
This town isn't big enough for two super villains.
Oh, you're a villain all right.
Just not the super one.
Yeah, what’s the difference?
PRESENTATION!
I knew you'd come back.
Well, that makes one of us.
- What's the plan?
- Well, mostly involves, not dying.
I, like that plan.
I can't control it.
No!
Well, that was easy.
Looks like there's only one loose end now.
Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation.
You came back.
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have left.
Whoa, I... I thought you were dead.
My death was, greatly exaggerated.
So, you're the punk I've heard about.
Whoa!
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.
I'm so proud of you.
Minion?
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.
He's the real hero.
Megamind.
Going somewhere?
Besides jail.
No, not in the face there, please.
If you know what's good for you Tighten.
You'll stay out of Montrosity.
- You got it!
- Good!
Pretty sneaky, sis.
But there is only one person I know who calls this town, Montrosity.
Ooops.
You!
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.
You're not going to be laughing no more.
The invisible car. Hey, remember that night that I dumped you?
You are bringing this up now?
I did look back.
You did?
YOU DID!
Yes, and you should look back, right now.
Oh, I get it.
This is the last time you'll make a fool out of me.
I made you a hero.
You did the fool thing, all by yourself.
Oh, uh...
You're so pathetic.
No matter what side you're on.
You're always the looser.
There's a benefit to loosing.
You get to learn from your mistakes.
What?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.
Enjoy your flight.
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Megamind.
So, this is how it ends.
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.
But not today!
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.
Say bye, bye Roxie.
Ollo.
Thing about bad guys, they always LOOSE!
Ohhhh.
You did it, you won.
Well, I finally had a reason to win.
You.
MINION!
Can't see it's cold and... warm, and dark and light.
It's me, Minion.
I'm right here.
We've had a lot of adventures together.
You and I.
We have, Minion.
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure, but,
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?
Yes Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.
Code-We're the good guys now.
Code-I guess we are.
Oh, oh. I'm going... I mean this is...
This is it, I mean I'm going far awa...
Oh, what a drama queen.
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim
- He had you, didn't he.
- Whew!
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.
There he is with that little face. Look at that face.
We did it!
We did it!
- Fist pump!
- You did it!
We won, we won, we won.
What! Get back you savages!
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
But the path we choose for ourselves.
All right, put your hands in the air.
Now hand over your wallets.
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding.
I have to admit.
Being good, has its perks.
You know, you look pretty good in white.
Megamind, if you please.
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.
Sorry my friend.
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!
Defender of Metro City.
You know, I like the sound of that.
Hit it!
I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
Come On
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
You Know It
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
You Know It
You know, and The Whole World Has To
Answer Right Now, whose bad.
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad- come on.
You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad- you know it.
You know it, You Know, You Know,
And The Whole World Has To
Answer Right Now
Who's bad!
It's funny how you wake up each day
and never really know if it will be one that will change your life forever.
But that's what this day was.
The day I left the city to spend a week in the house where my mother grew up.
A day I'll never forget.
So many years have passed
Almost there. Feeling all right?
I'm okay.
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And look at the trees
I used to play there when I was a child
Oh, Hara.
How many times have I told her?
Wait here. All right? I won't be a minute.
Okay.
Hara! Your car's blocking the driveway again.
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Shawn? Where are you?
Shawn?
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.
Come meet Hara!
Supper is done and night has come
Let's have tea together near the fireplace
Nice try.
My house, my home ls so small, so pretty
My mom, my dad We are family
Joy everywhere
Hey, back off!
Hey! Go get your own!
Arrietty!
What?
You went outside again, didn't you?
How many times have I...
What happened to your room?
It's my own little garden.
If you ask me it looks more like your own little jungle.
Is that a bay leaf?
Where did you get that?
I wanted to wait and give it to you on your birthday, but...
Happy birthday!
This will last me all year.
But the bay tree is so far away.
If a bean saw you it would...
Beans don't scare me.
The beans should scare you.
That's what worries me.
The world is a dangerous place for a Borrower.
Your Aunt Eggletina wasn't scared either and she...
Was eaten by a toad. I know, I know.
If you don't like your gift
I can put it in my room.
No, no, I should keep it.
I have just the recipe for these.
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.
Oh, you don't have to.
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.
What?
Don't tell me you forgot!
Tonight's my first borrowing!
Look, Papa's home.
Papa. Papa, I made it all the way to the bay tree today.
And I used the leaves over my head just like you said.
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.
So, what I'm trying to say,
- if there was any doubt...
- There's a new bean in the house.
What?
- I know. I saw him.
- Arrietty, I told you to be...
Yes, Mama, I was careful and he didn't see me.
And he's much smaller than other beans.
Papa, you just have to let me come borrowing tonight.
We know nothing about this new bean.
But you promised this would be my night.
And I've seen him.
Papa, please, I am telling you, he's just a child.
And the children are more vicious than the grownups.
I'll be fine.
Well, the young beans do go to bed early.
Oh, thank you, Papa!
Pod!
The boy is very sickly and weak.
She'll be fine.
But...
Oh, and don't worry, Mother.
I'll get Papa back safely.
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.
She'll need to know how to take care of herself out there.
Without our help.
Sometimes I worry that we are the only Borrowers left.
What'll become of us?
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.
Your heart needs rest. No excitement.
- Is that clear, Hara?
- Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.
Whatever you need, Shawn, you ask Hara,
- and she'll get it for you, all right?
- Yes, Aunt Jessica.
Make him feel at home, Hara.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.
Don't you think you should wear something a little darker and longer?
No, I think this one's perfect.
So, I need you to get me some tissue paper and some sugar.
Oh, and promise, dear husband, you won't let our daughter get eaten or squashed like a bug.
Oh, please God. Please help them.
Don't worry about me. Everything's fine.
Okay, bye, Mom. I love you.
Oh, goodbye. Love you, too.
Stay close to your father.
I will
Do I get one of those?
Nope? Okay.
Arrietty!
Did you see that?
That's my girl.
Don't look down.
One step at a time.
All right. You need to hold this for me.
Okay.
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.
Arrietty!
- Let's go.
- Right.
It's so big.
Papa, what is this place?
This is where beans store all their food.
The sugar is over there.
When you get down there, wait for me.
Yeah!
Papa, you are great!
Yay!
There. That wasn't so hard.
- Where to now?
- Tissue paper. Then home.
Papa, look what I found.
Looks like someone got their first borrowing.
Careful with it, it's sharp.
Okay.
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!
Look down there.
Filthy rats.
You want to stay away from those things.
I'm not afraid.
I will cut them down to size with my sword.
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.
What is this place?
I've heard human beans call it a dollhouse.
Dolls are toys for beans.
And we are not toys.
These things are not for borrowing.
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.
Don't you think Mother would absolutely love that dresser over there?
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.
Borrowers take only what they need.
Don't be afraid, okay?
Hey.
I know it was you in the garden.
I knew I saw you.
My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.
Was it you?
Was it?
Please don't go.
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
He might have seen me out in the garden today.
We all make mistakes.
So we'll just have to be extra careful now.
Best not to tell your mother about this.
You know how she worries.
Right.
I'm very proud of you.
A lesser Borrower would've panicked and run away.
Well, we're home.
Safe and sound.
Is everything okay?
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.
This old light gave out halfway to the kitchen.
No.
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up on the sugar.
That's okay.
I'm just happy you made it home.
It wasn't a total loss.
Arrietty, why don't you show your mother your first borrowing?
What a beautiful pin.
Okay. Off to bed.
Night, Mama, Papa.
She looks so worn-out.
Should I make us some tea?
Shawn, come inside.
You'll catch your death of cold.
What did you say?
Why would he do that?
I think he was just being nice.
It's the same cube of sugar
I dropped in his room last night.
Pod, what does she mean, she dropped it?
Do not touch it. Do you understand me?
It's a trap.
I just know it. They're going to trap us like cockroaches.
Homily, let's try not to get hysterical, okay?
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!
We'll probably have to move now.
Goodbye, old table.
We had so many fun times together.
Let's not say goodbye to anything just yet.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I told you that young bean would be trouble!
But no one ever listens to me.
Thank you, Arrietty.
Smart girl, doing this when the sun came out.
Or maybe I have a smart mama who taught me.
You're a good girl.
If you've got this,
I think I'll go lie down a bit.
Okay.
Is that you from last night?
No, wait. Don't go.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Please leave us alone.
We don't need your help.
But can I please just talk to you?
No! Human beans are dangerous.
Whenever we're seen, we have to move.
My parents said so.
So you have a family. That must be nice.
You don't have a family?
Yeah, I have one.
But they sent me here to get the care and attention I need.
Because they're both very busy with their work.
Sorry to hear that.
Anyway, my name is Shawn.
What's your name?
What do they call you?
Not that it's any of your business, but it's Arrietty.
Arrietty. Arrietty.
That's a beautiful name.
Maybe we could be friends?
Could you at least come out so I can see you?
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.
I won't hurt you, I promise.
Help me! Help me!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What in the world? A crow!
Oh! Attack! OW!
You get out right now!
What got into that bird?
Don't think I've ever seen one behave like that.
Maybe it's nesting season or something.
I don't know.
Looks me to like it was after something.
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.
Which I'll have to replace, of course.
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?
Your aunt said for you not to get too excited!
Should I get your medicine?
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.
Nesting season?
Well, Shawn, you have a nice, long rest now.
Papa!
I hear you visited the young bean.
I'm sorry.
I went to ask him to leave us alone.
But I really don't think he intends to hurt us.
Many Borrowers have lost their lives thinking the same.
It must never happen again.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
We'd better start looking for a new home.
The boy knows that we're here.
Are we safe?
Delivery. Package for you, ma'am.
Thanks for the drink, Hara.
It's pretty hot today.
Do you happen to know of any good pest control companies?
Pest problem?
Here's one.
"Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination."
1-800... Oh, hang on.
So you got yourself a mouse problem?
Maybe it's mice, maybe it's little tiny people.
Strange things have been happening here and I know why.
That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I mean, when Hara told me,
I just couldn't believe it.
Why on earth would a crow try to fly into your room?
Were you frightened?
No, I wasn't scared.
Hara came and chased it away
And it's a good thing I came in when I did.
That bird had huge wings and claws...
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara, considering Shawn came here for a little peace and quiet and tranquility before his operation.
Yes, ma'am. Forgive me.
I'm sorry, Hara.
I don't mean to be short with you.
But why his mother chose this time to go away on business is just beyond...
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother here to look after you.
You know, not so much lately.
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped, but honestly, why couldn't she be here when her son needs her so?
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing that miniature house in my room.
And the detail's amazing.
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.
That beautiful little house belonged to your mother.
She had to leave it here when she moved away to go to college.
It was Mother's?
Your grandfather had it specially made because he was hoping it would be a lovely home for the little people.
What?
That's right.
Little people who lived in the walls.
He was quite obsessed with them.
People laughed, of course, and called him mad.
But your mother, she believed him.
They worked on that house together for hours.
And he told her they would come, but of course, they never did.
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any tiny little people in your room?
Can't say that I have.
I think it's why your mother doesn't like to come here any more.
Too many memories of wishes that never came true.
Can we look inside it?
Yes!
You know, I haven't looked inside it in quite a long time.
Hara, could you be a dear and turn off the lights?
Ma'am.
So many years have passed
This is the living room.
Your grandfather had all of this handmade by a real furniture maker in England.
Isn't that just insane?
Look at the attention to detail.
They really were preparing it for someone to live in.
And just in case you don't believe what I'm saying is absolutely true, have a look at that room right there.
Come in the garden
What a kitchen!
And look at the trees
Everything in it a miniature of the real thing.
That oven actually works.
You could bake real cookies.
Some really little cookies.
What a pity their dream never came true.
It really would've made a lovely home.
Settled down there long ago
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I left my childhood
In a garden green
Come in the garden
And sit on the grass
I used to sit there when I was a child
Ivy and moss
Little daisies
Covered the lane long ago
You know, Mother, we've had these same pictures for years.
Wouldn't you like some new ones?
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.
And I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.
Besides, there's no point in changing them now.
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.
Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?
What's wrong with me?
There he is!
Does he look eaten?
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?
I slipped and twisted my leg.
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.
Well, what is going on down...
Pod, you're hurt!
It was the cat, wasn't it?
See, I'm not crazy.
Get up here!
Does it hurt, Papa?
It's just a sprain. Go calm your mother.
I'll get some cold water. I'll be right back.
Everyone relax!
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.
Who's that?
I wonder if he has news about any of the other Borrowers.
Okay, I leave now.
Can't you at least stay and have some tea?
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.
Why don't you see if Spiller would like a cup of tea?
Won't you please stay, Spiller?
I've never met another Borrower before.
We can't thank you enough for your help.
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?
We're all alone here and we're starting to believe we're the only ones left. Are we?
This many.
Oh! Then cousin Lupy could still be alive.
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it? Can I see it?
You use this for your borrowing?
Give that back, Arrietty, before you shoot someone's eye out.
Okay. Go now.
Oh, but couldn't you stay a little bit longer?
I'll cook dinner.
Already got this.
A cricket leg!
Want some?
- Very fresh.
- No, thanks.
Bye.
Thank you, my friend.
I'll go with him. To see him out.
What were you doing out there in that storm?
I was looking for a safe route for our journey.
And now I know which route not to take.
Oh, Pod.
Spiller knows of more Borrowers a few days journey away.
There's a small river past the forest.
He's offered to take us on it.
That's great.
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.
And I'm sure it will almost be as nice as this.
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.
Or that I met anyone.
Hey, maybe next time you could bring your whole family with you.
No family. Only Spiller.
Well, we... We could be a family.
And when you come back you could stay for a family dinner.
Hara?
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.
You'll have to start over.
Why do we need such a big bag anyway?
Are we putting the whole house in here?
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.
Papa, can I come in?
- How's your leg?
- Well, better than that cricket's.
I'm serious.
Papa, why do we have to move?
Once a Borrower has been seen, the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.
Well, isn't it possible that not every human bean is dangerous?
Arrietty, before you were born there were two other families who were living in this house.
One family went missing, they just disappeared.
The other one moved away.
They were seen by humans.
And so, we have to do whatever it takes to survive.
But, Papa...
Oh! Oh, no!
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?
Mother!
It won't open!
Frame is buckled!
The wall!
Homily!
Homily, are you all right?
Pod, remember how I always said
I wanted a new kitchen?
More bills.
Remember, take only the things we need.
We can't possibly carry all of this.
And, Homily, don't take anything from the dollhouse.
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.
- You stay with your mother.
- Okay.
So you finally came.
Did you like your new kitchen?
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.
But it doesn't matter.
Because I came to tell you goodbye.
Can I turn around?
You're beautiful.
My papa said we have to move now.
We've been seen, and Borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.
What are Borrowers?
My mother, father, and I are all Borrowers.
We borrow things that beans won't miss if they are gone.
Just little things, soap, cookies, and sugar.
All things that we need to survive.
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.
I think my grandfather saw one of you once.
It's possible.
And it's my fault that you're leaving.
Niya! Niya!
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.
So, in my aunt's house, how many other Borrowers are there who are living with you?
It's just my father and my mother and me.
What about in other houses?
I'm sure there are some.
But I've only met one other so far.
You must be afraid you'll be the only ones of your kind who are left.
What?
Every year there's fewer and fewer of you, right?
Aren't you scared that soon you'll all be gone?
What a horrible thing to say!
I know that there's more of us because Spiller said so!
Who's Spiller?
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest, and he said that there are hundreds more of us.
That might be true.
But, you know, none of us can live forever, can we?
We all have to die sometime.
Why would you say something like that?
Because it's true.
I guess so.
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes things happen to us that are just beyond our control.
And when these things happen, there's really nothing you can do about it.
You just accept it and prepare for the worst.
I wish it wasn't that way.
But you can't live a life that's built on nothing but wishes.
It isn't practical.
Sometimes you just have to accept the hand of fate.
Oh, no, you don't.
Sometimes you have to stand up and fight for the things that are worth fighting for.
You have to survive.
That's what my papa says.
And so we're leaving even though it's dangerous.
And we are going to survive.
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.
We always have.
As long as we have each other to live for, we'll keep on living.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm actually the one who's going to die.
What?
There's something wrong with my heart.
They're gonna operate next week but it probably won't help.
That's terrible.
I've always been sick and I've had someone looking after me.
And that's why when I saw you,
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.
But I guess I messed up.
I made it worse. I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.
Now what on earth is this doing here?
Now how did you get in there?
There you are!
Mom!
What? What's wrong?
My mother, I think she's in danger.
No!
Give me that, you little thief!
Now we'll see who they call crazy.
And I bet there's more of you, aren't there?
Wait, no! Wait, wait! Wait!
I have to go help her.
But...
Oh, no! Help! No, no, please! Help!
Pod! Arrietty!
Let me out of here!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!
Arrietty! Help!
Watch it!
Let's see.
Now to find the others.
Let me out! No! No!
Something terrible has happened.
- Squeaky Klean.
- Yes, hello.
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.
Could you get out here right away?
I have a very unique pest problem.
- Is it mice?
- Oh, much worse than mice.
Do you want them exterminated?
No, I need you to trap them.
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!
Shawn! Shawn!
Arrietty!
My mother is missing.
Someone took the roof off!
I think a human bean got her.
Oh, Mama.
We will find her.
What?
Someone's locked us in.
There's a room next door. Hold on tight.
One step at a time.
Right.
It's stuck!
Wait.
I can get us in.
Oh, no, no!
Keep going.
What do you mean you're lost?
How can you possibly be lost?
It's the only road!
- Is it before the bridge?
- What bridge? There's no bridge!
Hara must have found it and opened it.
This is what I was afraid of.
Mother's been taken.
Are you okay?
Be careful. Shawn, please.
Where are those idiots?
Mother! Where are you?
Be wise.
They're supposed to catch pests.
But... HOW did you...
Hara.
Could I have some warm milk?
Okay! Wait just a minute.
Thank you, Hara.
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?
Cookies? Now he wants cookies.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Arrietty!
Over here!
Arrietty! Here I am! Here I am!
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Arrietty.
Oh, good. There they are.
They finally found the road.
The only road.
Another bean!
It's okay, Mother. He's a friend.
Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.
See what we see.
Yes, of course.
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?
Hara? Hara!
Oh!
What's going on here?
It's finally happened.
I found the little people.
Little people?
Yes! And what little robbers they are.
I wouldn't have believed it either unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.
It's remarkable!
It's the eighth wonder of the world.
And they're so teeny!
And they have a whole house full of things they've stolen.
Are you sure you didn't find the sherry again?
All these years you thought I was losing things.
But it wasn't me. It was them!
You didn't mention little people to the exterminators, did you?
No. I didn't want to scare them off.
Because I'm sure the house is just full of them.
You'll see when I show you.
This is their nest.
Nest?
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.
What?
It was here! It was here!
Where's that little teapot?
Okay, Hara,
I'm sending the exterminators away.
No! No, no! Wait just a minute.
Oh. Oh! I'll clean that up later.
Oh, please!
Hello, Shawn.
Can we come in for a minute?
It's open.
You'll see.
Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.
I don't know how they did it, but the whole thing is gone.
Not gone.
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait! I can prove it!
I've got one of them in a jar!
Poor Hara.
I think she's finally gone bonkers.
Do I smell fresh herbs?
Someone's been making tea.
It's just as my father told us.
There really are little people living here.
Yes, there are.
Your mother really should be here to see this.
She waited so long for some proof of them.
But they're not thieves like Hara said.
They're just Borrowers.
What?
I mean, they must be very frightened.
I just hope they're still here.
I hope so, too.
Excuse me. Ma'am!
Where would you like us to start looking?
Oh, are you all right?
Where did she go?
Who took my lady?
There are little people! There are!
Easy, 68$)'
And, no, I'm not losing my mind!
If I collapse, leave me behind.
With my tea kettle.
You're doing great. It's just a little further until we break for food.
Can't we just head back?
We can live with the rats in the compost heap.
Oh, no!
Let's hurry.
I can't do it.
Arrietty, you really should eat something.
We're gonna be walking at least until morning.
What?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like maybe it's all my fault that we had to leave such a wonderful house.
That's in the past.
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us, together.
I'm going outside for a bit.
Arrietty, don't go too far.
Niya.
Niya.
Just a little further.
Spiller!
That's the last of it.
Come on, we should keep moving.
Okay.
Mother, are you all right?
Arrietty!
Arrietty!
Shawn.
Arrietty.
We have to leave.
But Spiller says there's more of us not too far from here.
A two-day's journey, at most.
He thinks it might be my mother's family.
You won't be the last of your kind.
But how did you find me?
Niya here showed me the way.
Thank you, Niya. Take care of him.
I brought you something.
Now think of it as a gift from one friend to another.
Thank you, Shawn.
I have to go.
When is your operation?
Tomorrow. But I'm not scared.
Because someone taught me how to be brave.
So you'll remember me.
How can I forget you?
You protected me after all.
Arrietty.
I hope you have a happy life.
Goodbye, Shawn.
Arrietty, my heart is strong now because you're in it.
And you always will be.
Forever.
I never saw her again.
But the following summer I returned
and was happy to hear the people in the house down the road
talking about how many things in their home had gone
missing.
I'm 14 years old, I am pretty
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady
I live under the kitchen floor
Right here, not so far from you
Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams, oh, I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky and the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Now I know there's another world
Butterﬂies floating in the air
There is someone out there for me
Walking down, picket fence
Run my hands along the edge
And music plays in my head
Hear the song before I go to bed
When stars are bright outside my window
Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow
And I remember Oh, I remember
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I'd fly to you
All the way across the states
I'd fly to you
Hear me, the winter day
Oh, I'd follow the sun and come right to your door
I remember my summer with you
Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes
Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close
Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again
Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair
I like you, I don't care
Why did it have to end?
Summer love with my best friend
I will miss you in summer again when
I will miss you in summer again when

Open Season 3
Woo hoo!
One day to guys trip.
Hey Boog!
When are you gonna bring your fine self down here to fix up our habitat, huh?
Just as soon as I finish helping Riley with the dam.
There we go.
You all set for tomorrow?
It's gonna be awesome!
Sorry Boog!
I gotta build this dam.
No guys trip for me.
What? No guys trip?
No guys trip?
Have you lost your mind?
I gotta finish this or
O'Grady will tear my eye.
Yeah. That's okay, it's cool.
We'll think about you while we're making this and talking trash.
I'm not sure that you can fit in there, jerky!
Hey, I don't know, maybe the whole batch?
Alright you troops!
- Let them fly!
- Oi!
Hey, you need anything else, just let me know.
We gotta get on the road bright and early tomorrow, baby.
Uh, about that, Boog.
I've got a wee problem.
With all the new kids,
I'm not done collecting my nuts.
Believe me, lad.
I'd rather be skittling with you.
Than getting my minds with these boffin goons.
Yeah, right.
- Ant! Guys' trip?
- No can't do, bugger!
I got too many. Responsibilities.
No problem.
- Birdie?
- Sorry Boog.
Great.
Surfs, Danny? Let me guess.
Uh. We cannot go suddenly.
That's what I thought.
That's okay.
At least I've got Elliot.
He won't let me down.
It'll be like old times.
Me and he.
The original partners.
Sshh. Quiet.
Koo! Koo-koo!
Giselllal Gesalital I was just looking for your dad.
Rabbit fight, huh?
Yeah, count me in.
Where's your little bro?
You'll never find me here.
Alright, let's see.
Where to hide?
Ahhh "X" marks the spot!
- Got you!
- Gotcha!
You're out!
You gotta work on the landing.
Great game, dad.
Yeah, great game, you guys.
That was awesome.
Alright, when your mother asks.
You'll say I lost for protecting you from a wild boar.
And a sidekick ferret.
Mom's gonna kill you.
I was attacked by a ferret.
- No, you weren't.
- Dad.
Stop telling Elvis to lie.
Mom says you're not supposed to do that.
That wasn't a lie?
It was uh.
It was a reverse!
A stretch of a non-actual. Boog.
Buddy, back me up here.
Just tell the truth. It's the only way to roll.
Exactly what I was saying.
And stay in school.
And don't talk to strangers.
And never run with scissors.
So Boogster, you wanna take the kids fishing?
Actually, Elliot.
- I'm kinda getting ready for guys'.
- I see where you're going with this.
It's time to teach survival skills.
- I was hoping to.
- Grab a baseball.
- Well I..
- Acupuncture? Origami?
- Elliot. Elliot.
- Yoga? Sumo wrestling?
- Elliot!
- Pods. What happened to pods, right?
I tell you what. Just take them.
Do whatever you want.
I'm trying to get ready for guys' trip!
So are you definitely going?
- How could I miss it?
- Yeah, I knew I could count on you.
Remember to tell Boog that you can't go on guys' trip.
I meant to say I have to babysit the kids.
'Cos Giselle's going to see her mother.
That's okay, E.
Don't sweat it.
You've got family obligations.
And sometimes, you've got to cancel.
Sometimes?
Don't you mean always?
How long have you known about this?
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?
Oh, just forget it.
- I don't know why I even bother.
- Boog!
Oh, he'll get over it.
Just like he did when I canceled the fishing trip.
I guess rabbit fight's over.
Pretty much.
Mother! I was attacked by a ferret!
I guess me and Elliot. We weren't as tight as I thought we were.
Oh hey.
You're not gonna cancel on me too, are you?
'Cos bears gotta stick together.
You know what I like about you, dinkleman?
You're always there when I need you.
And don't worry.
We're gonna have a blast tomorrow.
This will be the best guys' trip, ever.
You'll see!
Elliot.
Three meals a day.
And everyone in bed by sunset.
I know.
And make sure to apologise to Boog when he gets back.
- Okay.
- For what?
For some things you said yesterday.
And for some things you forgot to say two weeks ago?
Kids.
Keep an eye on your dad.
- Bye mom!
- We love you!
- Safe journey!
- Have fun!
Have fun with the old dadillacs.
What was that, Elliot?
I love you.
- Say hi to your mother for me.
- I will.
What are we gonna do first, hm? Father?
Don't worry, kids.
I've got a tons of things planned.
Right.
When does uncle Boog get back, again? it's gonna be fun!
Then he realised, that his best one horn friend in the world had abandoned him.
And worse than that?
All that was left on his hand was.
A hook!
This is very fun.
Well, I guess it could be worse.
Who am I kidding?
This whole thing was a bad idea.
It's not a guys' trip with only one guy?
I mean. It's not like I changed?
He's the one who changed.
He's the one who flakes all the time.
But he has a family.
You have to be more understanding.
Yeah.
Understanding my butt!
You're better off without that under privileged broken horn plank, cancel it.
But you guys are partners.
Partners?
Who cares, baby?
That deer ain't got nothing on us.
Yeah! You know, you're right!
You know, what would be great to eat just about now?
Another woo-hoo bar.
And I know just the place to get it.
Beautiful.
Now all we need are the balloons and you'll be ready to go!
Don't worry, baby.
I'll never let anything happen to you, ever again.
Hello. Ladies!
Don't you all love my finest evening?
Hooty-O's?
Hoo- Hoo.
Coco Ding bats.
My favourite!
Honey? Now that's more like it.
There you go, buddy.
Don't worry.
Nobody's driving.
Hey, rabbit!
You ain't leaving 'til you eat those
Coco Dingbats.
This is the best guys' trip ever!
Me and Dinkleman agree with you one hundred percent!
Rabbit loves Dinkleman.
Dinkleman loves rabbit.
Was what that, Dink?
Can't go on guys' trip because
I'm married?
No deer on guys' trip.
Bla bla bla guys' trip.
Dink?
We gotta go somewhere where folks don't let us down.
Place where we fit in.
A real home.
A place like that.
With other bears who totally get us.
If only we knew what that was.
Wait a minute.
A place where no one lets you down.
You stay here, rabbit.
Keep your eye on the stash.
Doug.
Why do you always let me down?
Circus in two days.
You could at least pretend to care.
Oh, was I supposed to catch you?
How classy.
Rehearsals over!
I'm telling you, Alistair.
One of these days, I'm gonna give that diva a piece of my mind.
I'm sure you will.
I mean. Back where I came from.
I know. The zoo.
No.. No.. No...
For the last time.
It's the Wild Animal Park.
There's a difference, you know?
Anyway.
When I was in the Wild Animal Park.
No one treated me like that.
All the animals worshiped me.
There was one grizzly.
One king of the jungle.
Me.
Oh... See....
Just as soon as we get out of here.
We're gonna find a place just like that.
And I won't forget your help.
I'll be king.
And you'll be.
Well, we'll find something for you to be.
- Oh?
- OK, here's the plan.
You lift the cart.
And we'd both squeezed through.
Go on.
Give it a try.
You want me to pull something?
Have I ever done you wrong before?
You promise to take me with you?
Of course I will.
- You're the Yin to my.
- Yang.
What? No!
What kind of word is Yang?
I was thinking more like.
You're the 'Yin' to help me get 'Yout'!
Now let's hurry up before someone sees us.
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
A little help?
Please?
Now you're supervising, that's good.
You want something done?
You gotta do it yourself.
Too heavy!
Doug!
Ssshh. Someone will hear you.
Yeah, I know.
We need another set of arms.
Hey, I'm upset too.
You can't take this on personal?
We all have our limitations?
Oh, hey!
That wheel's on your hoof.
Doesn't that hurt?
Now where were we?
Oh yeah.
We need another set of arms.
Question is.
Where to find it?
Protect me!
What in the world?
Ho! Another grizzly in the flesh!
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.
Yo, you got some kind of thing coming out of your neck.
I know. It's called Alistair.
Hola! Comme es ta?
What do you want, bear?
The name's, Boog.
Man! Another grizzly?
This will be so great!
We'll go fishing, have rabbit fights.
Be best friends!
She's here too?
Hold up. Are you talking about Ursa?
She's difficult to catch.
Bear-vana? Listen Boog.
We're busy here. Go back to where you came from, okay?
Back where I came from?
Back there.
I'm the only bear.
- The only bear?
- Yeah.
- All the other animals? They...
- Worship you?
What?
Oh yeah, that sounds fantastic.
Didn't you hear me?
I said I'm the only bear.
You must be so lonely.
The only lonely bear.
That's very sad.
I promise I wouldn't do this but.
Right. Right. Sounds terrible.
- I'm fighting this one.
- Give me just a second.
What are you doing?
Don't you see this is our chance?
We get the bear to help us move the carts and we're out of here!
But the circus will miss us!
They'll send a search party!
You're right.
I'll go.
- But you. But you.
- Trust me.
I got it all figured out.
Listen, Boog.
You and me? We're gonna do all those things you talked about.
Fishing, camping.
- Oh, and rabbit fights?
- Sure!
Girls, rabbits, whatever you want.
So here's what I'm gonna do for you!
I'm gonna find a place where we can all be best friends together.
Really?
You'd do that for me?
In a bear-minute.
We're grizzlies.
Gotta look out for each other.
So, here's the thing.
We gotta swap places so the circus doesn't know I'm gone.
But I come back tomorrow night.
And you, me and Ursa.
- We go on a kind of..
- Bears' trip?
Yeah, sure.
Bears' trip.
Together.
Alright! I'm in.
Great.
Now hold still for just a second.
Keep it down and stop moving
Oh yeah.
This is gonna work!
Now what about me?
Hey, like you said.
If they figure out you're missing, they'll send a search party.
Don't worry. I'll bring someone back tomorrow night to swap with you.
When I say three, lift as hard as you can.
Got it?
Got it.
One, two, three.
You'd better hide that doll so nobody gets suspicious.
- What doll?
- That one.
In your hand.
You mean Dinkleman?
He ain't no doll!
He's my bro!
My boy!
My Blouse
Right.
Hey, so where's that all for only bear place you were talking about?
You know, just so I make sure
I stay away from it.
Over the mountain, pass forest and down by the stream.
Cool! Thanks!
See you tomorrow night!
When can I meet Ursa?
Perhaps it's better to do that in the morning.
When you're a little more.
Awake. No?
I don't know why I'm so tired.
Oh.. Si...
Could it be the chocolates?
So, what are you?
- Some kind of Iama?
- I'm an Argentinian Carnelian.
What's an Argentinian Carnelian?
It's a kind of lama.
Nice digs.
I just want you to know.
That it is very sympathetic.
That you came all this way.
Just to meet another grizzly.
Oh, Mr. Weenie, mommy's going to miss you so much.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
Now remember.
Play nice with everybody.
Ready for your third dinner?
Yumm.
Mommy and Bob are going to look for Big Foot.
Okay, sugar plum?
Remember.
Mommy loves you!
Is she always like this?
Yeah, but it's not so bad.
And my friends!
It's so good to see you all!
- Hey, you too!
- You look great.
Weenie, it's been ages.
Thank you for it.
Why?
Who is our new friend?
I'd like you to meet Nate.
Nate, meet Mr. Weenie.
He's a strong silent type.
You!
Are trying my patience!
Come on! Work you!
Work! Work! Work!
- Fussy. -Yeah?
- Nine?
- Yeah?
- Nine? -Yeah.
- You know, some animals are much kinder once they've been. - Fixed!
Oh... Hi...
Mr. Weenie.
Come and sit with me.
We can watch the television together.
He's not still mad at me, is he?
I think his angry days are behind him.
If you know what I mean.
One night only!
The great Maslova Family Circus!
Hey! That's Boog!
I don't remember Boog's fur being so light and spiky like that.
Listen, I know Boog as 'Zat' guy Boog!
If that is Boog, he sure looks terrible.
Of course he looks terrible!
They're trying to kill him!
This is horrible!
Look out, Boog!
Poor Boog.
We have to do something!
Let's go save him!
Oh, I wanna go save him.
Oh please, please, please, please.
We must hurry!
How? Have you noticed?
We're in the air stream.
There's no way out of here.
How are we gonna save him?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No.
But if we climb out of that vent.
I could track us to the circus.
To save Boog.
Yeah, the coast is clear!
Keep it moving, keep it moving!
Keep it moving.
Relax, Fifi.
Remember what the vet said about staying calm?
You stay calm!
With 500 pounds of animal on your back!
Nice stitches!
Marshmallows?
Slightly burned.
Mixed with enoki.
Robust poop!
What's with you always with the poop?
The circus! This way!
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Come on.
Who's up for a rabbit fight?
Can't we wait for uncle Boog to get back?
He was supposed to be home last night.
Yeah! Do you think he's still mad at you for ditching him on guys' trip?
He can stay on guys' trip forever as far as I'm concerned.
What does he think?
That I can just, you know.
Leave the kids alone, while Giselle visits the mother in law of doom?
- Dad.
- Children needs constant attention.
- You ignore them for one second.
- Dad!
Come here, Little E.
You're not going rogue, son.
Dad, let's just play, okay?
Good idea.
We don't need uncle Boog.
Rabbit fights are way more fun without him anyway.
You're out.
Gotcha.
New game?
Well, that's enough fun for one day.
Now can we wait for uncle Boog to come back?
Boog, Boog, Boog.
From now on, we will no longer mention his name.
Okay ....
So...
What do you wanna play next?
Well, how about a game of.
Shrub.. Jump?
Diving?
Where we jump into the nearest shrub.
And uh.. Come on Elvis,
I'll show you.
Dad! No!
It's poison ivy!
It's part of the game.
Whoever scratches first.
Loses!
Lwin!
Ooh, that has gotta hurt.
Well played, Little E.
Okay, who's hungry?
Dad.
We need uncle B.
I mean.
We need someone.
Taller.
- To reach a branch that high.
- Not so.
Who knows more about getting honey than adeer, huh?
Come here, Little E.
Spine so frail.
Dad?
Quiet, Gisella.
The slightest sound could wake the bees.
Bees!
At least getting stung will take his mind off the itching.
Yeah.
Hey! Keep it down!
Too much chocolate.
Hey, why did you do that?
Just hold still.
Give a little poof over here.
A tease over there.
A pull, a tug.
A comb.
Make it snappy.
I am a genius.
Get a camera, because you are.
Perfecto!
The spitting image.
They will never know the difference.
Now, let us go dance.
Doug is here everybody!
Remember what they say about not talking.
If you don't have something nice to say?
She's beautiful.
I see what's going on here.
What are you talking about?
Nothing's going on here.
Okay.
I'm serious.
Hm-hm?
Hey, I'm just happy to meet another grizzly. That's all.
Whatever you say.
Tiger. Show me your strength.
So uh...
Hey, Ursa.
- I thought I'd introduce myself, because you know. - Doug?
Why is voice low?
Are you again. To be sick?
Oh! Um.
- I'm not actually.
- You'd better not be.
No!
I mean, um.. Hey!
Watch it with that stick, little dude!
Come on, Doug. Arms up!
Why must we go through this everyday?
A little bribe, perhaps?
It's chocolate! You love chocolate.
- Come on, arms up!
- Please.
Now, we are ready.
Let's begin.
Right foot up!
Left foot up!
- Slower.
- Faster.
Jump!
Squat leg!
- Stop!
- Wildly bear!
Hit it!
You can really move.
You ready?
Hey, I was born ready, baby.
Wait, I'm not. I'm not ready for.
Why can't you just once be there when I need you?
Oh wait!
Ursa, let me explain.
- I'm not.
- Doug!
I don't want excuses.
Maybe if you just.
Cut the lift.
- That's all.
- No, wait!
I could've caught you.
It's just that I'm not.
- Doug. Thanks a lot!
- Yeah, thanks Doug, okay?
He only thinks all about himself.
- Listen, I'm not.
- Doug.
That was worse than yesterday.
Oh, wait!
Ursa.
Uh.. Give her some time to cool down maybe, okay?
But I have to tell her who I really am.
There will be plenty of time for that.
When we are all living in Bear-vana.
Trust me.
If there is one thing I know.
It is women.
And.
Musical theater.
But that is not important right now.
What is important.
Is that women.
Do not like to be rushed.
Look, Alistair buddy.
I wait in here until
Doug is back at sunset
And everything is gonna be fine.
Alright, Alistair.
If you say so.
Alright ladies, buckle up.
- One two three four.
- Look, I'm flying!
This must be the place.
Bear-vana.
Finally.
I'm the only bear.
And all the animals are gonna worship me.
Just like they did Boog.
Boog's back, everybody!
- Boog!
- Thank goodness, he's back!
- Yes.
- About time.
Yeah, I know.
It's good to finally be here.
You look terrible!
And your voice seems worse!
Yeah. Complete Gaga girl.
What are you talking about?
My voice is as smooth as silk.
Must have been rough out there.
Rough? Yeah, it was rough alright.
That's why I look terrible.
My voice sounds like Ka-Ka.
Now why don't you all run along and fetch me some goodies?
Goodies smoothies.
Boog!
Here.
Hold these for a second.
How dare you show your face around here?
After what you've done?
Gotta go polish my...
Uh. Me too.
Me three.
Yeah.
Dad.
I thought you were going to apologise?
Apologise?
If anyone should apologise, it's him.
To me.
For.
For.
This!
And this!
Then this!
Well?
The silent treatment.
Well, I too can play at that game.
Only I'm not playing.
I was fine before I met you.
Oh, sure, I was tied to the hood of the car.
Sorry uncle Boog. Dad hasn't been the same since you've been gone.
Now look at me. A pathetic shell.
And all because of you!
It's too late now, Boog.
This deer.
Has sailed.
Sorry uncle Boog.
I hope you guys can work things out.
Dad!
We're all glad you're back, uncle Boog!
That is one seriously messed up deer.
That's better.
Good to be myself again.
Time to hit the road.
Doug?
He's not coming back.
Give him a chance.
It's still early.
Besides, he's a grizzly.
We're family.
It's all a lie.
There is no Bear-vana.
Come on, Alistair. He'll be back.
Grizzlies hate each other.
It's in their genes.
What are you talking about?
Grizzlies don't hate each other.
The mens do!
They are to macho.
Doug lied so you would help him escape.
And I...
I was his partner in crime!
In crime!
Who have I become?
If Doug's not coming back.
Then Ursa won't talk to me.
What am I doing here?
This one goes to my girlfriend.
Out on the Pampas.
I'm all alone.
My heart.
Has crushed to nada.
I'm all alone.
It won't work.
Don't bother trying.
If you try that.
You'll go flying.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
That was. Well, you were.
That was beautiful.
You are making fun.
No! No! Really!
Listen, Ursa.
I know you've got no reason to believe me.
But I gotta tell you the truth!
I'm not Doug.
I'm Boog!
You are right.
I have no reason to believe you.
Look. I never should've come here.
I know that now.
This was all a big mistake.
Why is fur dark?
Like I told you.
I'm not Doug.
I'm Boog.
I was just you know.
Looking for a place where I belong.
So, if you just give me a hand moving one of the carts.
I'll be out of your hair.
Oh, now I see truth.
You want me to help you escape.
And ruin circus!
- No!
- You are pathetic, Doug.
No, Ursa, seriously.
I just.
You twanged?
No.
Okay, 'cos I thought I heard my name.
It doesn't matter.
I. Just want you to know that.
I am sorry.
I really thought Doug was my best friend.
That's okay.
I suck at picking best friends too.
Are we good? You and me?
Yeah!
We're good.
Excellente.
I promise I will never tell you
I'm coming back when I'm not.
And I promise I'll make time for you..
Even when I got a bunch of important things going on.
- Amigos?
- Yeah!
Amigos.
This is nice.
Talking like this.
We will do this every night.
A kind of. Guys chat.
Si?
Guys chat?
I like that.
Good, okay, so...
Since you're stuck here.
A little advice, okay?
The way to a woman's heart.
Is through.
Her.
Art.
The circus is coming!
How can a circus be coming?
A circus is a tent.
With posts, stuck in the ground!
This is a highway!
Oh no! No!
Thank you.
We made it.
That wasn't easy.
- This still doesn't look like a circus.
- Strange.
It sure smells like it.
No!
I need those! I need those!
I need them!
There you go, baby.
Just like new.
- Hi, how's it going, Stew?
- So far so good.
I got your balloon order.
How could you have been so wrong?
I don't know?
Maybe it's allergy.
Wait a minute.
Look in the window!
The circus poster will tell us where to find Boog.
Quickly!
Before we are seen!
There you go, baby.
Wait 'til you see the super balloon bouquet I whipped up for ya.
Nice exploration of negative space.
Hurry up! I should be on top!
- I should be on the top!
- A little closer!
- Don't wave!
- Nine, a little closer.
Meat snack.
Look, they're colored.
It's perfect replacement.
I need those.
Hey! Stop that!
We have been discovered!
You just. Hey!
Come back here!
No!
I'm gonna get you!
Get back here!
Gotcha!
Meat Snack!
Meat Snack.
Come back here!
You knew you were going to this guys' trip.
For two whole weeks before you told him.
Maybe I should go talk to him.
Hold it right there, big fella.
So you forgot.
If he was a real friend.
- He'd understand.
- You're absolutely right!
Boog is a real friend.
Your life is a mess without him.
By mess you mean awesome!
No, I mean mess!
- Awesome!
- Stop that!
- Enough!
- Dad?
Girls.
I was just.
Not important.
So, is it breakfast time again?
Lunch? Dinner? Play time?
Is it a dope problem?
What's a dope problem?
Nothing, what's up?
Mom always says that.
You should try and work things out.
You're upset with me?
You're right!
I've been a complete failure.
How can you ever forgive me?
We were talking about you and uncle Boog?
You should go talk to him.
Or maybe we should go and get uncle Boog.
Bring him. Here.
And you're not a complete failure.
You're a dad.
We love you no matter what.
Father?
It's okay.
All for the taking.
Hey Boog! Can you help me with my digging?
Can you help me get my wife unstacked from the pine?
- What.
- Can you help me with my nuts?
- I mean...
- Thought we were gonna mark the perimeter?
- Hold on!
- What about our habitat?
- Yeah!
- Hey Boog, can you help me with thing?
Do you think dad and uncle Boog will ever forgive each other?
What's going to happen if they don't?
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
I'm not your servant!
I'm king of the jungle!
Well, technically the lion is the king of the jungle.
And this is the forest.
A jungle tends to be denser and hotter.
- Deer!
- What?
I travel.
Fine! Then I'm king of the forest!
Either way.
Things are gonna change around here.
You! Go get me some nice ripped berries.
And you two. Find me a good waterfall where I can have a nice soak.
And you Doily!
Riley!
Whatever!
You and your guys go build me a nice comfortable bed.
Up on that hill.
Don't you mean in your cave?
Oh, yeah.
My cave.
Move!
Better do what he says.
He's gone bluhnicaccasl
He has really lost it.
- Yeah.
- Could be stress.
Big mad bear disease.
It could be stupid deer disease.
Seriously? Is that going around?
Maybe we've all been taking him for granted a little too much.
Oh! Hello girls.
How long have you two been standing there?
We just uh.
Got here?
What is that?
Some kind of nervous tick?
Nervous?
Who's nervous?
What do you girls want?
We just wanted to say.
How glad we are that you're back.
Bye!
Hey. Perhaps Boog is uh. Changing
- That's not it.
- We change all the time, huh?
Just yesterday.
Deni, he's in love with foei gras.
Then I tell him what it is, and.
He can't talk, he can't sleep.
He saved me.
Can you just go and find our mom?
Please?
I'll be your best friend.
Alright, alright, you twist my wing.
But only because the two of you are so good.
Thank you Serge!
- You guys rock!
- Deni, follow my tail!
What do you think?
Your tie is a smart bow tie.
Perfecto!
I see you're sweating.
Nervous anticipation.
What are you talking about?
- I'm not sweating?
- Yes, you are.
I see a little drop of moisture on your upper brow.
Right there.
- Hello little sweat.
- Yeah, sweat.
Right.
Nothing to worry! You're gonna knock her out with the real you!
She'd be like. Doug!
Who is Doug?
I'm all about Boog, baby!
There is something different about Doug.
Looks like someone got a hair brush for birthday.
- Still think I'm Doug?
- Yes.
How about now?
What are you trying to prove, Doug?
That I'm Boog!
Let's try the ladder.
Oh, forget it.
- Well, can you ride.
- Unicycle?
Check this out.
See?
I'm Boog!
Look, I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.
But once you get to know me.
The real me.
- You might like me.
- Leave me alone!
Doug was afraid of heights.
If you're really Boog.
Why don't you come up here and prove it?
Don't give up.
Follow her.
She wants you to.
That's. Pretty high.
You're probably right.
That impressed a pretty girl.
- Hm.
- Just go!
One can't help but be moved, no?
Now you believe me?
I believed you when you ride the unicycle.
Doug couldn't do that either.
You mean you made me climb all the way up here for nothing?
Not for nothing.
You need to be punished for juggling the dog.
Boog.
What a nice name.
If you want to practice the dance.
Meet me outside.
You put a girl in grizzly!
Cats, tonight, you're gonna play your little whiskers off.
And a one and a two.
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...
You dance very well, Boog.
I practiced.
I figured you might trip me or something if I messed up.
Me?
I would never do that.
Yeah, but I might.
So you'd better watch yourself.
Oh, definitely looking good.
You are not like other bears.
Why is this?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because
I grew up with humans.
Really?
Me too!
I grew up in circus!
Me too!
Well. Kinda.
I mean, I used to do this show back in Timber Line.
It wasn't a whole circus.
But I juggled and stuff.
You and me.
We are not like other grizzlies.
We are not like.
Anybody else in the world!
That was so inspiring.
So moving.
So. So prof undo.
Let us retire to the caravan.
For our end of the day talk.
We should practice the lift.
I'd like that.
Come.
We will hook.
Over to the trailer.
Time to share.
Like the amigos we are!
I pulled something.
If just once I could perform the dance.
The way it was meant to be.
I would never need to perform it again.
Boogie!
What about the guys chat?
Huh? Yeah.
Ursa and I need to practice.
Doily!
Make sure you get that spot right by my third...
Ooh! Yeah!
That's it!
Sorry Boogster.
Just a little cramp at my neck.
Seriously?
Six pack, take some pride in your work!
Any chance we can take a little break?
A break? You all just had a break.
Like. Six hours ago.
What is going on here?
Giselle!
Thank goodness! You're back!
Now you can vent him.
Excellent!
Reenforcements.
You two!
Go get me some more berries.
And you! How about you start massaging my paws?
All this clapping is making me sore.
Now!
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about?
Boog would never yell like that.
Especially at fawns.
So who are you?
Who am I?
- If you haven't noticed, I'm.
- Boog!
I'm so sorry I let you down.
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Does that answer your question?
Giselle!
Oh, thank goodness you're back.
See?
Even the crazy broken deer knows I'm Boog.
Do you even know his name?
Of course I do.
It's. Uh.
Starts with an E.
E .... Emily?
Edward?
What about 2 L's?
Eleanor? Oh, whatever.
It doesn't matter what his name is.
All that matters.
It's that I'm a grizzly.
And I'm king of the jungle.
First of all, this is a forest.
I tried to tell him.
And second of all.
What have you done with Boog?
- Yeah!
- Where is Boog?
What have you done?
What difference does it make?
You would all do what I say.
I'm your Boog now!
Boog!
Boog, now that we're best friends again.
What do you say we go on guys trip?
Just the two of us?
He's not Boog!
Oops.
You're not Boog!
That's not Boog!
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought you were mad at me.
But now I know that you weren't.
Because you're not even you!
What a relief.
- Elliot?
- Yes, dear?
- Elliot!
- Oh, right.
What have you done with Boog?
He's locked away somewhere.
You'll never find him!
Especially after tonight, when they take him back to Russia.
Russia?
- Who's Russia?
- It's not a 'who'!
It's a 'where'.
And believe me.
You could walk for the rest of your life and never get there.
You won't get away with this!
No? Who's gonna stop me?
Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'm ready to talk.
I'm listening.
He's at the circus.
Just follow the search lights and you'll find it.
That's a good one.
What search lights?
Now let's go save Boog!
'Cos I owe him a big apology.
And because we miss him
And we want him to come home before they ship him off to Russia!
Yeah!
Imposter!
Sorry.
That Boog sure is one lucky guy.
I Wish I had a friend like that.
Wait.
I do have a friend like that.
Thank goodness, that nice man at the Punimart called us.
You poor dear's.
Must have been hungry to go all that way to find food.
But don't worry.
Mommy won't make that mistake again.
That's enough, isn't it, Bob?
Maybe we should stay.
No, no, you're right.
My snugly, woddly and I need this time apart.
Kick me out, Bob, before I change my mind.
Well, we might as well dig in, since all hope is lost.
Wait for it, wait for it!
Oh, Meat Snack!
Excuse me for a moment.
I hate cats.
So do I.
Fi! Look! The circus!
I've seen of these lights before.
Wait!
You mean the circus is just behind those trees?
Yes! My new old friend!
Boog is closer than we ever imagined.
Alistair?
What's wrong?
And once again.
I have been tossed away.
Hey, hey, Alistair.
Come on, buddy.
Don't bother me!
I sat in my trailer all night.
Waiting for the sweet sound of paws.
Knocking on my door.
But no.
All I hear.
Is the sounds.
Of loneliness.
What are you talking about?
Have you forgotten?
Already?
Do I mean so little to you?
It's time for guys chat
Just us on guys chat.
You blew off guys chat!
You blew it!
Oh man!
I totally forgot!
See, I was with Ursa and.
Well, you know how it is when you're all caught up and.
Look, Alistair.
Sometimes it's hard to find time for everything.
And everyone that's important to you.
Alistair.
Alistair.
You're right.
I've been a bad friend.
You might not believe this, but.
I know exactly how you feel right now.
And I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
Seriously?
That's what friends do!
Amigos!
Don't worry!
We're gonna have plenty of time for guys chat.
Once we get back to Russia.
Huh? Russia?
Oh, sure!
Oh, you're gonna love it there.
All the snow and the ice.
You're gonna love the way it pierces your skin.
And makes your...
Oh, I get excited just to think about it.
Plus, it's only 5,000 miles away.
So you can visit home every year or two.
Or three.
Maybe four.
You're gonna be a polar bear.
That's what you're gonna be.
Let's go, troops!
Look alive!
Uncle Boog never took us on a rescue mission.
Yeah, I know.
This is way cool!
You should go out of town more often, mother.
Elvis, I don't think so.
Release the emergency break.
We are moving!
Hang on to your little horses.
Steady. Steady.
Alright everyone, steady.
I can't see a thing!
- Why?
- Out of the way! Out of the way!
Steady. Steady.
Oh no! Oh no!
- They're gone! They're gone!
- What's gone?
- Turn left, right?
- Right!
No! Nine! I said left!
No! No!
No!
Oh.
I'm calling it a day.
It's worse than I thought.
They strap him to wheels and light him on fire.
Then point and laugh!
It's torture at its worst!
We have to rescue Boog before.
They make him wind into tiny, whiny rope of death!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Wait!
Their fortress is inpenetrable. it's hard to break into.
So here's what we're gonna do.
McSquizzy and Buddy, you work on the left flank.
Kids, you run the charging manoeuver on the right.
Ian, Giselle, you find a chisel, a toothbrush.
And as many maracas as you can carry.
- Then.
- Or. What about this instead?
Serge and Danny, you find the exits.
Mom and Ian, you stay and look out here and here.
While the rest of us sneak in here.
And rescue Boog.
Yeah!
That's ridiculous!
The tent's too big.
We need at least 6 more of us.
To pull that off.
Oh, my friends!
Mr. Weenie?
What are you guys doing here?
We are here to safe Boog!
- Kick some pals!
- So are we!
It's destiny.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I'd like to welcome you
To the great Moslova Family Circus!
Everyone clear about what to do?
- Yes!
- No problem.
Uh, what was the middle part again?
Dad ....
Everyone spread out and try to find Boog.
When you see him.
- Go get him.
- Alright, let's move it out.
- Be careful, girls.
- Okay, mom.
So. Come here often?
Don't even think about it.
Stop acting like such a troop.
I really missed you guys.
Yeah, me too.
A full house! This is fantastic!
- Are Ursa and Boog ready to go?
- They're ready.
Boog.
Where did the rest go?
You! You must be the new recruits!
Yeah, yeah.
That's what we are.
Come on, let's go.
- Any sign of Boog?
- No, I can't see him from here.
We need to get to higher ground.
Like that.
Man, I can't wait to get back and see Alistair.
Back to my own cart.
Home cooking. Three meals a day.
I don't know, Bob.
This expo is a bust.
When we head back to the air stream.
Did you hear that?
He's close by.
I can smell him.
Let me try the bathing call.
Big Foot!
Ladies and gentlemen.
The miraculous balancing...
Stanley! Do you see him?
I'm not seeing him.
Please. Welcome.
The juggling pugs.
Fifi! Do you see him?
Great!
Boog!
Come on.
Let's find a different spot.
You'd think we can't miss a 1,200 pound fat bear!
Ursa!
- Wait!
- Come on, Boog! Show them what you got.
I can't see a thing from back here.
Any sign of Boog?
Ursa!
You're doing great, Boog.
Oh, you see him? Good!
Let's get him!
Mika! You have returned!
Time to go back into space.
It's dark in here!
Let me out!
I'm coming, Buddy!
Mr. Weenie!
Look, Bob, proof aliens do exist!
- Keep up, handsome.
- Ursa!
Where are you, uncle Boog?
Hi Fifi!
Ursa!
- Pretty!
- Oh no!
I hate dogs.
Uncle Boog!
Tell dad he's right there!
Ursa!
- Ursa!
- Boog!
What are you doing?
You need to get to your place.
I need to talk to you about Russia.
It's so far away and.
- I'm not sure if I...
- Boog, we need to focus here.
It's almost time for the big lift!
- I know, but...
- Come on, Doug!
Please don't make this difficult.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Gesalital
Uncle Boog is right there!
What are you saying? Right? Left?
Left? Rig ht? Left?
Boog!
Elliot!
Wait, what are you doing here?
Thank goodness, I found you!
We're here to rescue you.
Elliot, I can't go!
Doug! Pay attention!
Ready?
Go, Doug, go!
Boog!
It's worse than I thought.
He's been brain washed.
And now, Ursa.
The great bear in disguise.
Featuring the flying nano plates.
Boog.
Are you sure you can do this?
I don't know.
Russia's a big step and.
No, I mean the lift.
I've never been able to do it before and... if you are not 100 percent sure you can do it.
I'll be ready.
Plan B.
Smash and grab.
Smash everything and grab Boog.
Don't bother with me.
Just another circus dancer.
You ready?
Come on, Ursa!
Go for it!
I got you!
Boog!
Okay guys, smash and grab!
Please hold me.
He did it!
Oh, she finally did it.
You got me.
Boog!
- Uncle Boog!
- You're safe! We're here to save you!
Rescue accomplished!
Yes!
What are you all doing here?
Come on, let's get moving before your captors return.
Hold up, Elliot!
I appreciate you all trying to rescue me, but...
I need to talk to Ursa.
Ursa?
Who's Ursa?
I am.
So. What?
She like your new best friend or something?
No, I am.
What?
You have 2 new best friends?
I canceled one guys trip and the next thing I know.
I've been replaced.
Twice.
Elliot, buddy.
I'm sorry.
You haven't been replaced.
You'll always be my BFF.
Are you apologizing?
Yeah.
I forgive you.
But only because you forgave me first.
Now, let's ditch the goat and the babe and hit the road!
I am not a goat!
I am a Lama.
Really? 'Cos you look more like an
Argentinian Carnelian.
And now.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The musical scaling of Alistair!
Come on, Boog.
- Without me?
- No.
We gotta get out of here.
- Elliot, Alistair.
- Do it!
- Guys..
- Come on.
Hold on, come on you guys.
- I'm not letting go:
- Alisa
Stop!
Everybody just hold up!
Ursa.
My beautiful Russian bear.
I came here looking for a place where I belong.
But what I found was so much more.
What I found.
Was you.
Oh, Boog.
Come with me.
Come to the forest, make me the happiest bear on earth.
Oh, Boog.
I really want to.
But I can't.
A Russian circus without a bear is like... no circus at all.
I could never do that to them.
You should go.
I can see that they are more than just your friends.
They are your family.
And family should always stick together.
Come.
I will help you move the carts.
Boog.
You should stay.
I learn something too!
That friends want each other to be happy.
So if she makes you happy.
Then you should be with her.
Elliot.
That was really nice.
You're awesome, dad.
Yeah!
I know.
These are tears of joy!
So beautiful!
Alistair!
You came back for me?
Oh, buddy! I'm glad to see you!
Oh, it's good to see you too!
I'd like to breathe.
Sorry, I tricked you, Boog.
Sometimes you don't know what you have until you've lost it.
I know exactly what you mean.
- Ursa.
- Doug.
Come on! We're late for our show!
And now!
Ladies and gentlemen.
The duet you've been waiting for.
Looks like the circus has a bear.
Looks like you do too.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!
Let them go.
But the circus!
The circus.
Will be fine.
Or try to work to Rome.
A place that we call home.
You sure you're cool with this?
Absolutely!
It's important to make time for your friends.
Even when you have a babe around.
Oh yeah!
Punch it in, baby bear.
Dinkleman, I didn't know you were a girl!
Have fun, Elliot!
And don't forget to keep an eye on Elvis.
Let's get move on!
Guys trip waits for no deer!
Or bug.
That's right, son.
You're old enough to take part in the sacred tradition that is... guys trip.
# On the road again #
#Just can't wait to get on the road again #
# I've always loved making music with my friends #
#And I can't wait to get on the road again #
He's not coming?
He's gonna join us later.
Maybe we'll get some answers, Bob.
Like if Mr. Weenie was probed or not.
# On the road again #
# Going places that I've never been #
# Seeing things that I may never see again #
#I can't wait to get on the road again #
Hey Alistair.
Aren't you glad to be going back to Russia?
Oh, truth said it, amigo.
I hope I get to see my girlfriend.
Carmen I'm coming for you!
# On the road again #
# Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway #
#With the best friends #
# it's now the world keeps turning our way #
#In Norway#
What is it?
It's just a little something we set up for you.
This is so sweet.
Thank you for making me feel welcome.
Alright, ladies. Look alive!
Oh, brother.
Oh, arrest me, officer.
- Got it.
- Shake it, shake it.
To the right. Two three four.
Who's up for the rabbit fight!
Yeah.
Look out, baby.
Guys trip!
It doesn't getting any better than this.
Just me and my best friend in the world,
- having a good time.
- You got it, Boog.
BFF till the end.

Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?
Justin!
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.
Justin, you get back here right now!
No, stop!
-No, no! Stop him!
-Go back! Don't climb!
Wait, wait.
Hold on. Easy, little boy.
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!
No, no, no! There he goes.
Justin!
I've got him! I've got him!
Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza had been stolen and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.
There is panic throughout the globe as countries and citizens try to protect their beloved landmarks.
Law enforcement still has no leads, leaving everyone to wonder, which of the world's villains is responsible for this heinous crime?
And where will he strike next?
I'm having a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Despicable me
Morning, Gru!
How you doing?
Hello, Fred.
FYl, your dog has been leaving little bombs all over my yard, and I don't appreciate it.
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.
Unless they're dead.
I'm joking!
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.
Okay. Yeah.
Steamrolling whatever I see
Despicable me
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Despicable me
You've got to be pulling on my leg!
Hello!
Cookies for sale.
Go away. I'm not home.
Yes, you are. I heard you.
No, you didn't. This is a recording.
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.
Goodbye, recorded message.
Agnes, come on.
Kyle!
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.
Gru!
Dr Nefario.
I know how you must be feeling.
I, too, have encountered great disappointment, but in my eyes, you will always be one of the greats.
What? What happened?
It's all over the news!
Some fella just stole a pyramid.
They're saying he makes all other villains look lame.
Assemble the minions!
Minions, assemble!
Okay. Okay.
Hey!
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?
All right.
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?
Hello, everybody!
Yeah, all right!
Simmer down. Simmer down!
Thank you, okay.
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard about this other villain who stole the pyramids.
Apparently, it's a big deal.
People are calling it the crime of the century and stuff like that.
But am I upset? No, I am not!
A little, but we have had a pretty good year ourselves, and you guys are all right in my book.
No, no raises!
You're not going to get any raises.
What did we do?
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!
Nice!
That's how I roll.
Yeah, you all like watching football on that, huh?
But that's not all.
We stole the Statue of Liberty, the small one from Las Vegas.
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you about this yet, but I have been working on something very big!
Something that will blow this pyramid thing out of the water!
And thanks to the efforts of my good friend Dr Nefario...
Thank you!
There he is.
He's styling.
Now, we have located a shrink ray in a secret lab, and once we take this shrink ray, we will have the capability to pull off the true crime of the century.
We are going to steal...
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
Hey.
Dave, listen up, please.
Next, we are going to steal, pause for effect, the moon!
And once the moon is mine, the world will give me whatever I want to get it back!
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes?
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers, and I really don't see how we can afford this.
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.
Hey, chillax.
I'll just get another loan from the bank.
They love me!
Edith, stop it!
What? I'm just walking.
-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
Hello, girls!
Anybody come to adopt us while we were out?
Let me think.
No!
Edith! What did you put on my desk?
A mud pie.
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?
-Yeah, I know.
-Good.
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?
Sort of.
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties.
Okay.
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.
Look at my face!
Do you still think it's a great sale day?
Eighteen coco-nutties.
I think we can do a little better than that, don't you?
Yeah.
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the Box of Shame, would we? No.
-No, Miss Hattie.
-No, Miss Hattie.
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.
-Hi, Penny.
-Hi, Penny.
Hi, guys.
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...
I just wanted to congratulate you on stealing the pyramid.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something that's very, very big, very important.
When you hear about it, you're going to be very proud.
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.
Gru to see Mr Perkins.
Yes, please have a seat.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.
Hey.
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.
It's a mathematical term, a quantity represented by an arrow, with both direction and magnitude.
Vector! That's me,
'cause I'm committing crimes with both direction and magnitude.
Oh, yeah!
Check out my new weapon.
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.
Do you want a demonstration?
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes, to get the piranha back inside of my...
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.
So, all I need is money from the bank to build a rocket.
-And then, the moon is ours.
-Wow!
Well, very nice presentation.
I'd like to see this shrink ray.
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.
You don't have it?
And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money?
Apparently.
Do you have any idea of the capital that this bank has invested in you, Gru?
With far too few of your sinister plots actually turning a profit.
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.
If we don't start getting our money back...
Get the picture?
Look, Gru, the point is, there are a lot of new villains out there, younger than you, hungrier than you, younger than you.
Like that young fellow out there named Vector.
He just stole a pyramid!
I've got it. I've got it.
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.
Suckers!
Suckers!
We got it!
What?
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!
No, no, no!
You!
Now, maybe you'll think twice before you freeze someone's head!
So long, Gru!
Quick! We can't let him get away!
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Fire! Fire, now!
You missed me!
Come to papa!
Take that.
How adorable.
Got you in our sights!
Like taking candy from a...
What?
Hey, Gru!
Try this on for size!
That's weird. What is going...
This is claustrophobic!
No, no, no!
Too small! This is too small for me!
I hate that guy!
...and please watch over us, and bless that we'll have a good night's sleep.
And bless that while we're sleeping, no bugs will crawl into our ears and lay eggs in our brains.
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.
And please bless that someone will adopt us soon, and that the mommy and daddy will be nice and have a pet unicorn.
Amen.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one
If they were really real
And they are
So, I bought one so I could pet it
Now it loves me
Now I love it
Don't you... What the...
Good luck, little girls!
Whoa! Cool.
Hi! We're orphans from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.
-I don't care. Beat it!
-Come on!
We're selling cookies so, you know, we can have a better future.
-Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
-Yeah.
Light bulb.
Dr Nefario!
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots disguised as cookies!
-What?
-Cookie robots!
-Who is this?
-Oh, forget it.
Well, it appears you have cleared our background check,
Dr Gru.
And I see you have made a list of some of your personal achievements.
Thank you for that. I love reading.
And I see you have been given the Medal of Honor and a knighthood.
-Me, me, me.
-Me, me, me.
Kevin?
You had your own cooking show and you can hold your breath for 30 seconds?
It's not that impressive.
Idiot!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
What in the name of... What?
Well, here's the dealio.
Things have been so lonely since my wife,
Debbie, passed on.
It's like my heart is a tooth, and it's got a cavity that can only be filled with children.
I'm sorry.
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?
Do I look like I speak Spanish?
You have a face como un burro.
Well, thank you!
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?
So, so excited!
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby.
I bet the mom is beautiful!
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.
I'm just saying it'd be nice.
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.
That's a Cheeto.
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.
Who's Debbie?
Your wife.
Hi, girls!
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.
He's going to adopt you.
And he's a dentist!
Yeah!
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.
And that's Agnes.
I got your leg, I got your leg!
Okay, that is enough, little girl.
-Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
-Higher!
-Higher!
-Just release your grip. Wow!
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?
Some nonstick spray?
Crowbar?
Okay, girls, let's go.
Oh, yeah!
Pretty impressive!
What are you looking at?
Boo-ya!
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!
Take that!
You done been shrunk!
Yello?
I got the shrink ray, all right.
No, I'm not playing with it.
Gru?
Don't make me laugh! No.
P.S., he is not getting the moon, and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him, he's gonna be begging for mercy.
Okay, bye.
Look at you, a little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby...
Curse you, tiny toilet!
Okay, here we are.
Home sweet home.
So, this is, like, your house?
Wait a sec...
You're the guy who pretended he was a recorded message!
No, that was someone else.
Can I hold your hand?
No.
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.
No, hey!
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.
Girls, this is Kyle, my dog.
Fluffy doggy!
What kind of dog is that?
He is a... I don't know.
Do you really think that this is an appropriate place for little kids?
'Cause it's not.
No! No! Stay away from there!
It's fragile.
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.
Hey! It's dark in here.
It poked a hole in my juice box.
As you can see,
I have provided everything a child might need.
All right.
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!
Somebody broke that.
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.
Rule number one.
You will not touch anything.
What about the floor?
Yes, you may touch the floor.
What about the air?
Yes, you may touch the air!
What about this?
-Where did you get that?
-Found it.
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.
Rule number three.
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart!
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?
Does this count as annoying?
Very!
I will see you in six hours.
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?
Question. What are these?
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!
Look at this. Watch me!
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.
Why are you so old?
Okay. I'm on it.
Hello?
TV!
What is that?
-Look at that!
-That is cool!
Come on!
I don't think he's a dentist.
We've been working on this for a while.
It's a anti-gravity serum.
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.
-Do the effects wear off?
-So far, no. No, they don't.
And here, of course, is the new weapon you ordered.
No, no.
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering under what circumstances would we use this?
But, anyway.
What I really wanted to show you was this.
Now those are cookie robots!
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!
We got bored. What is this place?
Can I drink this?
Do you want to explode?
Gru!
Get back in the kitchen!
-Will you play with us?
-No.
-Why?
-Because I'm busy.
Doing what?
Okay, okay, you got me.
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.
In real life, I am a spy.
And it is top secret, and you may not tell anybody,
-because if you do...
-What does this do?
Hey!
My unicorn!
You have to fix it.
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?
She's gonna hold her breath until she gets a new one.
It is just a toy. Now stop it!
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!
Tim! Mark! Phil!
This is very important.
You have to get the little girl a new unicorn toy.
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!
Go, and hurry!
What are those?
They are my cousins.
Jerry! Stuart!
Watch them, and keep them away from me, please.
-Wow!
-Wow!
It was your cousin's idea.
What?
Okay, bedtime.
Not you two!
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.
Just so you know, you're never gonna be my dad.
I think I can live with that.
Are these beds made out of bombs?
Yes, but they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up.
But try not to toss and turn.
Cool.
-Will you read us a bedtime story?
-No.
But we can't go to sleep without a bedtime story.
Well, then it's going to be a long night for you, isn't it?
So, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite.
Because there are literally thousands of them.
And there's probably something in your closet.
He's just kidding, Agnes.
It's beautiful.
Girls, let's go.
Time to deliver the cookies!
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.
Actually, we're going to have to skip the dance class today.
Actually, we can't skip the dance class today.
We have a big recital coming up.
-We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
-Yeah, Swan Lake!
That's fantastic. Wonderful.
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!
No.
No?
We're not going to deliver cookies until we do dance class.
Really?
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.
So if you want to go, you are going to have to walk yourselves.
What are you doing?
Walking to dance class.
Ya? Okay, fine.
You just keep walking, because I'm really not driving you!
Okay.
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!
And you had better be in this car!
Here we go! One! Two!
...three, four and five.
And lift, and stretch.
And one, and two...
-Here you go.
-What is it?
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?
Of course, of course.
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.
Pinkie promise?
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.
But he's a V.
You know, we're supposed to start with the A's.
Then we go to the B's. Then we...
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!
I was just thinking that it might be nice to deliver Mr Vector's first.
That is all.
Almost over. It's almost over.
Girls, welcome back to the fortress of Vector-tude!
Do you have my cookies for me?
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes, two caramel clumpies and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else order that many cookies.
Not likely.
Name one person who ordered more cookies than me.
That'll be $52.
Right.
Seven, eight, nine...
Tic Tacs! Where was l?
Seven, eight, nine...
Why are you wearing pyjamas?
These aren't pyjamas!
This is a warm-up suit.
-What are you warming up for?
-Stuff.
What sort of stuff?
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.
Like sleeping?
They are not pyjamas!
Here you go, 52 big ones.
Bye!
Come on!
What the...
Quiet down, fish!
Down, boy!
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!
But what about the other people who ordered cookies?
Life is full of disappointments for some people.
Don't do that!
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?
No.
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!
Don't care.
-Please?
-Please?
We'll never ask for anything else, ever again!
-Pretty please?
-Please?
-Come on!
-Come on!
Light bulb.
Come on!
Goodbye, have fun.
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.
What?
Oh, my gosh!
Look at that fluffy unicorn!
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!
You've gotta let us play for it!
No, no, no.
Come on!
How much for the fluffy unicorn?
Well, it is not for sale.
But all you gotta do to win it is knock down that little spaceship there.
It's easy!
Yay!
Again!
-Wait!
-Come on. One more time!
Just one more.
I accidentally closed my eyes.
-I hit it! I hit it!
-That was cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.
Hey, buddy, let me explain something to you.
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?
Do you know what that means, professor?
It means you don't get the unicorn!
Somebody's got a frowny face.
Boo! Better luck next time!
Okay, my turn.
Knocked over!
-It's so fluffy!
-Yeah!
That was awesome!
You blew up the whole thing!
Let's go. Let's try another game!
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?
Okay, girls, go play.
I got the shrink ray!
Cotton candy!
We have 12 days until the moon is in optimum position.
We can't afford any distractions!
Get me Perkins.
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins, but I figured that you would want to see this!
What?
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.
What?
Sorry. Sorry!
Could you excuse me for just one second?
I told you not to touch my things.
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.
Hey, can we order pizza?
Pizza? You just had lunch.
Not now, for dinner.
Dinner?
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!
Can we get stuffed crust?
-Stuffed crust!
-Stuffed crust!
I'll stuff you all in the crust!
You're funny!
Just don't come out of that room again!
All right.
Sorry about that. Where were we?
You were sitting on the toilet.
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.
I know how much you like to laugh inside. Now, I was saying...
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.
Believe me, I am completely focused.
-Hello!
-What?
That guy is huge!
-Are we on TV?
-What are those? Children?
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!
No, no, no!
Freeze ray!
Mr Gru?
Okay.
As I was saying...
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.
-But my plan...
-Is a great plan.
I love everything about your plan, except for one thing.
You.
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me landing on the moon!
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket out of macaroni!
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket based on the macaroni prototype!
I don't understand.
Let's face reality, Gru.
You've been at this for far too long with far too little success.
We're gonna put our faith, our money, into a...
Well, a younger villain.
But l...
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.
Now, I know there have been some rumours going around that the bank is no longer funding us.
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.
They are true.
In terms of money, we have no money.
So how will we get to the moon?
The answer is clear.
We won't.
We are doomed.
Now would probably be a good time to look for other employment options.
I know.
I have fired up my resume as I suggest that all of you do, as well.
What is it?
Can't you see that I am in the middle of a pep talk?
Yes!
Yes, we will build our own rocket using this and whatever else we can find!
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
Who needs the bank?
Let's go. Let's go!
Mom! What are you doing here?
And here he is in the bathtub.
Look at his little buns.
Mom.
Not cool.
And here, he's all dressed up in his Sunday best.
He looks like a girl!
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!
You're funny!
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!
Mr Perkins, your son is here.
Send him in.
Hey, Dad.
You wanted to see me?
-Yes, I did, Victor.
-I am not Victor any more.
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!
Sit down!
Do you know where the shrink ray is?
Duh! Back at my place.
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.
I guess Gru must just have one that looks exactly like it!
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!
Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be?
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime, and you just blow it!
-No, I didn't.
-Oh, really?
You just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon.
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!
There's a squid on my face!
Don't worry.
The moon is as good as ours.
Come on now, it's bedtime.
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.
You did not!
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!
-But we're not tired!
-Well, I am tired.
Will you read us a bedtime story?
No.
Pretty please!
The physical appearance of the "please" makes no difference.
It is still no, so go to sleep.
But we can't. We're all hyper!
And without a bedtime story, we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.
All night long.
Fine.
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.
Sleepy Kittens?
-What are these?
-Puppets.
You use them when you tell the story.
Okay, let's get this over with.
"Three little kittens loved to play, they had fun in the sun all day.
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?
Keep reading!
-Come on!
-All right, all right, all right.
"Three little kittens started to bawl,
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,
"'Fine, but at least you should brush your fur."'
Now you brush the fur.
This is literature?
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed!'
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,
"'Fine, but at least you should drink your milk."'
Now make them drink the milk.
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone, rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'
The end. Okay, good night.
-Wait!
-What?
What about good night kisses?
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging or kissing.
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.
I like him. He's nice.
But scary.
Like Santa!
Only 48 hours till the launch, and all systems are go.
About that,
I was thinking that maybe we could move the date of the heist.
Please tell me this is not as a result of the girls' dance recital, is it?
No, no, no!
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!
I just think it's kind of weird to do it on a Saturday.
I was thinking, maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?
Gru, you and I have been working on this for years.
It's everything we've dreamed of.
Your chance to make history, become the man who stole the moon!
But these girls are becoming a major distraction!
They need to go.
If you don't do something about it, then I will.
I understand.
Good.
Butt.
Butt.
Butt.
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together, we will make the "clink" sound with our mouths.
Ready? Edith?
-Clink.
-Clink.
There we go. And now we drink.
And Agnes?
-Clink.
-Clink.
Very good!
Excuse me, girls.
Come on!
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.
-Clink, clink.
-Clink, clink.
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?
I'm here for the girls. I received a call that you wanted to return them.
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.
I didn't like what you said.
But...
I will get the girls ready.
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!
Tell her you wanna keep us.
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.
I did it for your own good.
Come on, let's go get that moon.
Right.
What is this for?
The recital?
I am the greatest criminal mind of the century.
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.
And we are good to go in T minus 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
Oh, yeah!
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.
Boo-ya!
My flight suit.
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...
I've got it!
I've got the moon!
I've got the moon!
I can make it!
-Wait a minute!
-Kevin!
Come on, come on!
He's still not here.
Why would he come? He gave us up.
But he pinkie promised!
Girls, girls, places!
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.
Can we just wait a few more minutes?
All right. But just a few more minutes.
He's not coming, guys.
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!
Okay, okay. There's the library.
That's Third Street. The dance studio...
There! There! There it is!
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.
Over?
Vector, open up!
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.
-Mr Gru!
-Zip it, Happy Meal.
Now, the girls.
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them a little while longer.
No!
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!
Listen close, you little punk.
When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!
I'm really scared!
He is gonna kick your butt.
What? He punched my shark!
There he is!
Hang on, Gru.
Oh, no!
Vector has the girls. Go!
What happened to the ship? It's big again!
-Not as big as the moon is going to be!
-What?
The larger the mass of an object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off!
I call it the Nefario Principle.
I just came up with it now, actually.
Oh, no!
Did you see that?
-Vector! Help!
-Vector!
-Over here!
-Hey!
What are you girls doing back there?
The moon!
Watch out!
Get as close in as you can.
You got it.
-Mr Gru, up here!
-Mr Gru!
Okay, girls! Girls!
-You're going to have to jump.
-Jump?
Are you insane?
Don't worry, I will catch you.
You gave us back!
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.
But you have to jump now.
It'll be okay.
Okay, girls.
Jump now!
Margo, I will catch you.
And I will never let you go again.
-Not so fast!
-No!
Let me go!
Margo!
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!
I got you.
No!
Oh, poop.
This time, good triumphs, and the moon has been returned to its rightful place in the sky.
But once again, law enforcement is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder, who is this mysterious hero?
And what will he do next?
Okay, girls. Time for bed.
-Come on! We want a story.
-Three sleepy kittens!
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously.
Tonight we are going to read a new book.
This one is called
One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!
Here, watch this.
That's the horn!
This is gonna be the best book ever!
Not to pat myself on the back, but, yes, it probably will be.
Here we go.
"One big unicorn, strong and free
"thought he was happy as he could be.
"Then three little kittens came around
"and turned his whole life upside down."
Hey, that one looks like me!
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!
Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental.
"They made him laugh.
"They made him cry.
"He never should have said goodbye.
"And now he knows he could never part
"from those three little kittens
"that changed his heart.
"The end."
Okay, all right. Good night.
I love you.
I love you, too.
No, no!
All right.
Didn't I get you already?
They're very good!
I'm so proud of you, Son.
You've turned out to be a great parent!
Just like me.
Maybe even better.
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.
No, no, no!
Hey, Carl! Hey.
No, no, no.
Me, me, me.
John?
No, no. Me, me, me.
Oh, poop.
Oh, no!
Stop! Stop!
Hello, I am Gru.
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
English srt
Dan4Jem, ADMMX
Today marks three months since Batman's defeat of the Mutant leader...
... at the West River drainage site.
The Mutants have adopted
Batman's methods as their own...
... leading to a series of brutal attacks on criminals.
So psychopaths go after bad guys?
Who cares?
Why blame Batman, for chrissakes?
And in these strange times, people ask:
"Has Gotham traded one evil for another?"
This is the face of the future.
Let Gotham's criminals beware.
Gotham City belongs to the Batman.
That statement came from the self-named
Sons of Batman...
... shortly after the body of a known drug dealer was found murdered...
... in an East Side tenement.
One of several splinter groups that formed...
... from the Mutant gang after their leader was defeated by the Batman.
They're using his name.
He could at least release a clear statement against what they're doing.
The Batman doesn't exactly come out with statements to the press.
No, he can't, because he's an outlaw.
How are the Sons of Batman his responsibility?
- He didn't create them.
- He absolutely did.
They exist because
Batman broke up the larger gang.
And we're better off for it.
Would you prefer the Mutant leader still be running things?
This Sons of Batman thing is exactly...
... why we didn't want these costumed heroes around 10 years ago...
... and why Batman shouldn't have come back.
Because of their effect on our youth...
... on the public, on the media, you get copycats.
I see my favorite patient is up and about.
Just super to see how well you're doing.
- For years it seemed like you didn't have...
- A reason to go on.
Exactly.
- I saw you on the TV last night.
- Oh, that.
I get invited on the talk-show circuit now and then.
Must be wonderful to get to tell your side of things.
I know the world has every reason to hate me.
Don't say that.
I always say, "Hate never heals."
But it's so disheartening.
I wish Batman could go public, but the police...
I bet I could arrange an appearance for you on one of the shows.
The home would have to approve a day pass.
They'll insist I be right beside you at all times, even on-stage.
Oh, please.
No one wants to hear from me.
I think they'll fight for the chance to book you.
I'll make some calls right now.
What I think we should do is trust Batman...
... at least for the time being.
He's saved us before.
Public uproar over
The Dave Endochrine Show's announcement...
... that Joker will be appearing as a guest this week...
... while media analysts predict...
... it'll be Endochrine's highest-rated episode in years.
Meanwhile, the White House continues to decline comment on...
... the Batman's renewed activities...
... and the suggestion that his defiance is an embarrassment...
... to the current administration.
A White House spokesman only volunteered...
... that the president would deal with the situation...
... if and when appropriate and in his own way.
Son, you know
I like to keep you out of domestic affairs...
- ... what with all the ruckus you stir up.
- Yes, sir.
But, well, it's a ruckus...
... I'd like you to straighten out.
Involving a friend of yours in Gotham City.
It's all well and good to have a wild bronco on the ranch now and then.
Does the hands good to break him in.
But if the bronco up and kicks over the fence...
... and gets all the other horses crazy...
- ... well, that's bad for business.
- I understand, sir.
Now, I'm not asking you to put him down.
Not yet, anyway. But settle him.
Ride him around the yard a few times if you have to.
- You know what I'm asking.
- Sir, I can talk to him but...
I'd just hate for things to get out of hand.
You know, how to get in touch with him, don't you, son?
- He's not hard to find, sir.
- Good boy.
- What are you?
- We Bruno's.
We nasty.
Bruno? Who's he?
- Bruno is a she.
- Ha. Big she.
Kind of my nasty.
Aces, Don.
Bruno Joker's squeeze.
He billy berserkest ever.
Yeah. Joker king of the billy.
Eh. Maybe he make us Jokers.
You Mutant kids go from one boss to the next.
- Too young to make your own decisions?
- We not kids. We make decisions.
- You even old enough to drink?
- Course we drink.
We slicer-dicers. We prove it.
Guess you're Bruno.
Those two morons don't have a brain between them.
So I'm gonna give them yours.
All over their suits.
Thief! You're a thief!
Store on Seventh Street sells this for 2.50.
Lady spud mine, Rob.
I need the points.
Hey, Bats! Bruno's taking off.
Pull that trigger and I'll be back for you.
Pull that trigger and I'll be back for you.
Bruno's heading your way.
Lead her into the alley. Don't let her see you.
Violate that order and you're fired.
Oh, yes.
If you're lucky, Bruno, you'll end up in jail tonight.
But first you're gonna tell me what
Joker has planned for his TV appearance.
Somebody do something.
- There's a train coming!
- Do something!
There's one more. It's coming!
Tell me what Joker's planning.
No. Not him. Not now.
What is this? Unh.
- We have to talk.
- I'm busy.
My place, in the morning.
Until then, stay out of my way.
Was that him?
Soviet representatives stormed out of talks over the conflict in Corto Maltese today...
... calling American military presence in the region pure fascist aggression...
... and pledging total military commitment to ousting the U. S...
... from the Latin American island nation.
Well, all that sounds like to me is the bluster of bullies.
And we don't back down from bullies.
No, sir, we don't.
Mr. President!
How about that smartly dressed youngster in the front row?
Mr. President, what's your position on the Batman controversy?
It was our understanding the government reached an arrangement with him...
... and his colleagues years ago to cease their activities.
Doesn't his return defy that arrangement?
Well, can't say I know what arrangement you're talking about.
But as for what's going on in Gotham, it's not my row to hoe, now is it?
That's a matter for the state level, and they've got a solid...
... clearheaded governor there, yes, they do.
Sorry, guys,
I've got a whole state to run...
... and I trust the judgment of Mayor Stevenson on that.
My job is to administrate, not render moral judgments.
We've just appointed a new police commissioner...
... and I'm not about to interfere.
The job will officially change hands from outgoing Commissioner James Gordon...
... to incoming Ellen Yindel at a formal dinner this evening.
Neither has commented yet on Ms. Yindel's plans.
To try to quote Ellen Yindel's outstanding record in the time I have...
... would do her a disservice.
Instead I offer the new commissioner my sympathy...
... knowing the impossible job she is about to face.
The life-and-death decisions.
The city of thieves and murderers...
... and honest people too afraid to hope.
Recently, a man returned to the public eye...
... who refuses to do nothing while chaos runs rampant.
A man who shows us we can seize our city back from fear.
Many have asked how I can condone this man.
My answer is that we all have something, or someone, worth fighting for.
I have my wife, Sarah.
Any time I wonder if I'm doing the right thing...
... I think of Sarah, and the rest is easy.
Now it's Commissioner Yindel's turn to face this man.
She may make him her enemy, or maybe she'll learn from him.
Either way, I wish her well.
Thank you.
James Gordon dedicated his life to keeping this city safe...
... and I'm honored to share a stage with him.
But this office will no longer tolerate the actions of a criminal.
As my first official act as commissioner, on the charges of breaking and entering...
... assault and battery, and creating a public menace...
... I hereby issue a warrant for the Batman's arrest.
You cost me hours of work last night.
Then I'll get right to it.
You have to go back into retirement.
You're upsetting too many people.
Mm-hm.
Why do you always have to be like this?
You played right into their hands last time.
When the parents groups came after us, you're the one they pointed to.
You act like a criminal.
Heh, we are criminals, Clark.
We always have been.
You're still one too.
Only difference is you have a boss.
And you answer to no one.
You know, we almost had this talk 10 years ago...
... when you wouldn't go along with the deal we made.
Everyone else agreed.
Diana went back to her people...
... Hal left the planet.
And Oliver? Did he agree?
That's not how I wanted that to go.
He was all torn up about it too.
- He made it necessary. Like...
- Like I'm about to?
- Do you even remember why you retired?
- I remember.
Look. Either shut it down or one of these days someone with authority...
... is gonna tell me to come stop you.
- And when that happens...
- When that happens...
... may the best man win.
I have to go. We'll finish this later.
No hurry.
Brave American forces are now engaged in direct combat...
... with Soviet troops in Corto Maltese.
Now, those Soviets would like to see us turn our tails and run.
But we've got to protect our interest...
I mean, stand up for freedom...
... and the good people of Corto Maltese.
So don't you fret.
We've got God on our side.
Or the next best thing, anyway.
We got a sweet show tonight, folks.
Dr. Ruth Heizraumer...
... the wet hamburger bun contest...
... and a man who's brought a lot of smiles to the world.
See you then.
It was great to hear from you, boss.
Most of the other guys...
... well, they gave up on you.
But I knew you'd come back.
Oh, you look great. Anyway,
I whipped up the lipstick you asked for.
And Bobby and Mary, they can't wait to help.
Oh, I also made you these, special filters.
Wear them tonight and only breathe through your nose.
And all these years I just held my breath.
Really?
I could kiss you.
Robin's last class is about to end.
Go pick her up at school.
And if Miss Kelley should have something better to do with her evening?
There's nothing better.
Where you been all this time?
You're, like, gone.
Been busy.
You gonna make it to the fairgrounds tomorrow?
Opening day? Our tradition?
Ugh. It's this night job.
Details. As in more.
Just helping some spud. It'd bore you.
Gotta fly.
Hey, Alfred.
First two teams are with me on the roof, the rest of you are down here.
I'm not waiting for the Joker.
And you can bet Batman isn't either.
Neither of them is leaving here a free man.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, ma'am.
More on the eyes, please.
You want lipstick, handsome?
I brought my own, thanks.
Wonderful to see you showing such interest.
Okay, Bobby, Mary,
Uncle Joker's counting on you.
Go make him proud.
This is strictly an observation mission for you.
Stay in the copter and do not touch any of the controls.
If there's any trouble, just say "boosters."
The computer's all voice-controlled.
You don't need to understand a thing.
Figure I wouldn't anyway.
Joker's thought this through.
The publicity's brought the cops...
... and they'll keep me from him.
That a cloak?
Cool.
Commissioner, something's incoming.
- We can't get a lock on it.
- I don't see anything.
Everything's on auto.
Touch any of it and you're fired.
Cool, boss.
Keep at it! Do a channel sweep.
Holy...
- He can fly.
- Not for long. Hit the flood!
Batman, you are under arrest.
Fox, Stokes, rush him!
- Rush him?
- He's twice your age, son.
Find the nerve.
What can we say about our next guest that hasn't been said before? Frank?
He's a kook, Dave. A maniac.
No, I mean it, he's a nut.
Nothing like it, eh?
I always take this moment to say a little affirmation to myself.
So many faces. So few smiles.
Hey, now, no need to be nervous.
Just follow my lead and be yourself.
And our special guest, the Clown Prince of Crime...
... Joker.
Get a copter in close to blow this stuff away!
Freeze, Batman!
Fire weapons.
Do something!
Joker, you've asked for a chance to share your side of things.
I'm told you've killed about 600 people.
- How exactly does your side of that go?
- Stop right there.
This is a sensitive man, and I won't have him being harassed.
That's all right. I want people to get me.
All right, then.
That's why I'm gonna kill everyone in this room.
Okay.
I think that's a little more insight than we had in mind.
It's okay, he doesn't really mean that.
He's just trying to ease the tension.
Funny way to go about it.
You have to remember, this man isn't responsible for those killings.
He's merely a victim of the Batman's psychotic obsession.
I thought
I was Batman's psychotic obsession.
So you think the Batman's the real sicko here.
Without a doubt. He's an obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic...
... hero-complexed sociopath.
- I would love a shot at him as a patient.
- Do guests get to keep these?
Heh. Sure, you do whatever you want with it.
We got a closet full of them.
So long as you won't miss it.
Breathe, David. Breathe.
Billy close.
Ace the cloak.
Batman, land your vehicle now!
Been following on the radio.
It's over. Joker's gone.
- How many?
- Don't know. Lots.
You have five seconds to comply.
Boosters.
- Boosters!
- Peel.
Head back to the cave.
- I'm not fired?
- You're not fired.
The military has imposed a communications blackout...
... for the 500-mile area surrounding Corto Maltese...
... amid reports of severe weather affecting the ongoing battle.
While more locally...
... tragedy struck at today's taping of The Dave Endochrine Show...
... where Joker used his deadly smile gas to kill the entire audience.
Joker is now reported to be on the loose...
... as is the Batman, who tangled with police at the scene.
You never should have come back, Bruce.
You don't know how much the world has changed.
Selina.
I need your help. It's very important.
My help.
I made myself pretty for you.
You should say thank you.
Thank you.
That's better.
Ee. The years have not been kind, have they?
Anyhoo,
I have a little errand for one of your girls.
I think her name's Elsie.
She has a date with a congressman tonight?
The death toll in the wake of Joker's attack stands at 206...
... including host Dave Endochrine and Joker's own doctor...
... Bartholomew Wolper.
- How do you fight someone like that?
- Simpler than I've made it.
There's nothing wrong with Joker that I can't fix.
With my hands.
Both Joker and the Batman...
... who himself left dozens of police hospitalized...
... are now fugitives from the law.
Oh, Elsie.
There's something I need you to do, congressman.
- Will you do it?
- Yes, Elsie.
He'll want me to pick up his trail.
This is his game.
- He'll want it to go on.
- I'm sorry.
We're going now to Ben Derrick, live in Midtown...
... where a shocking story is unfolding.
Lola, I'm standing outside the Gotham Vista Hotel...
... where Congressman
Hector Alejandro Noches...
... has climbed out onto a 40th-story ledge...
... and is demanding a full nuclear strike against Corto Maltese.
You don't think they'll launch their nukes over this?
We have to strike first!
We're the most powerful country in the world.
Sir, please.
Lola, it's just confusion and one messy body down here right now.
Commissioner Yindel has arrived on the scene.
I'll see if I can get a statement.
Commissioner, any word on why the congressman...?
Get those cameras behind the line!
Commissioner. O'Halloran, 6th precinct.
- Lieutenant.
- Any way I can help?
This wasn't a suicide.
The girl upstairs has been drugged.
- Says she's from Kyle Escorts.
- That's Selina Kyle. My old beat.
- Shut it down and bring her in.
- Yes, ma'am.
Commissioner.
Lieutenant O'Halloran, ma'am.
Heard there was...
- Is something wrong?
- Stop that man!
All units to Kyle Escorts.
Selina.
Bruce...
... he's worse than ever.
He's using lipstick...
... mind control.
The police are going to be here soon.
Can you walk?
I think so.
Boss, found something.
Cotton candy.
The fairgrounds.
Thousands will be there.
Half my friends will be there.
- Fan out.
- Bring the Wing in close.
Don't take the girl.
- He'll...
- Don't worry.
On the ground. Now.
Good soldier. Good soldier.
Boss, something's coming.
- It's big. It's...
- Him.
He's there. Hold tight.
Children, do you know why all these people are so upset?
That bad man up there.
Bobby, you know what to do.
- Incoming.
- Wait, let it get closer.
Don't worry, Mary dear.
You two distract the little one, and I'll handle the bad man.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm through playing, Joker.
Be still, my heart.
Don't leave in such a rush.
- Unh.
- Aah!
You're the Joker, right?
Batman's gonna kick your ass.
He's gonna have to go through you first.
Let the boy go, Joker.
Oh, that's bad.
You should get that looked at when you have a chance.
He's got a gun.
Freeze, Joker.
Excuse me, sorry. Beg your pardon.
Coming through. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
Ooh, my bad. Excuse me.
No more.
All the people I've murdered by letting you live.
I never kept count.
- I did.
- I know.
And I love you for it.
It's finally here, isn't it?
The moment we've both dreamed about.
Oh, don't tell me you're gonna fall asleep before we finish.
You have gotten old, haven't you?
Not quite how I imagined it...
... but we can still end on a high note.
You're in trouble now.
Go ahead.
Say this has never happened to you before.
Shut up.
Make me.
Come on, finish me.
Doesn't matter. I win.
I made you lose control.
And they'll kill you for it.
See you in hell.
Keep going, down here.
There's another body.
Watch yourselves.
Witnesses saw both of them this way.
Down this way. Go right.
Robin, call the copter.
Locate my signal.
Don't touch him.
Freeze, you son of a bitch. Unh.
Cute gun.
- Move forward.
- Keep your heads straight.
How are we supposed to find him?
If it isn't a cop, shoot it.
- Over there.
- Clumsy.
Stop laughing.
Auto-pilot. Property damage.
- He gonna make it?
- Suture.
He'll live. He's far too stubborn to die.
Through this horrific murder and his attacks on the police...
... the Batman has revealed himself to be an unqualified menace.
I have asked the governor to place the state police at Gotham City's disposal...
... to hunt down this dangerous fugitive.
- No comment.
- Jim, you can't protect him anymore.
He's a murderer now.
If you've talked to him, you have to let me know.
He and I don't talk anymore.
I know everything I need to know.
Joker's death and Batman's fugitive status...
... have become more than local or statewide issues these days.
... and this morning,
White House spokesperson Melanie Endara...
... said the FBI was providing regular updates to the Oval Office...
... on the progress police are making in the hunt for Batman.
- The groceries? Now?
- Wanna eat tonight?
I'm going.
Be careful. And no cigars.
Another splinter group has emerged from the remains of the Mutant army.
Calling themselves the Nixons...
... the group is committing a spree of violent armed holdups...
We interrupt this program to bring you a special report.
We now go live to a statement from the president of the United States.
Well, folks, I've got some good news and some bad news.
The good news is that our brave American troops...
... were victorious in Corto Maltese...
... and the Soviets have completely withdrawn.
Bad news is, well...
... looks like those Russians are some mighty sore losers.
The warhead appears to be on a course for Corto Maltese...
... where 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed...
... along with the 2 million citizens of the small island.
But the larger questions on everyone's minds...
... are whether this is the first strike in a full-scale nuclear attack...
... and whether the U.S. has begun retaliation.
We are getting reports that the missile has changed course...
... and will now detonate over an...
What happened?
- What happened? Is he dead?
- No, he's quite alive.
Appears the whole city is having an outage.
Odd that the emergency generator hasn't kicked in.
Aces. My cheapo watch stopped too.
Figure I didn't just buy it.
- Boss.
- Show me.
Clark...
... you let them do it.
You idiot.
- What? What's happening?
- Sir, you have to rest.
A blackout, our generator's dead, and Robin's watch stopped.
It's an electromagnetic pulse.
In all likelihood, from a nuclear explosion.
You don't know that.
Oh, dear.
We're still here.
For the moment.
May mean the Soviets detonated a cold bringer.
Not meant to kill us, just cripple us.
- Ever ride a horse before?
- Don't think I've ever seen a horse before.
You're about to learn fast.
Not as fun as I thought it would be.
This is our moment.
Gotham is helpless.
We will take charge.
We will kill anyone who stands in our way.
No.
Tonight I am going to maintain order in Gotham City.
You are going to help me.
But not with these.
These are loud and clumsy.
These are the weapons of cowards.
Our weapons are precise and quiet.
In time I will teach them to you.
But for tonight, you will rely on your brains and your fists.
Tonight, we are the law.
Tonight, I am the law.
- Looters are gonna strip us dry.
- We need more cops.
- We don't even have phone lines.
- One at a time.
Commissioner, we got a problem.
Slice and dice.
- Hey, we need to put out the fires.
- Are you crazy? Let go of me.
Get out of my store, huh. Get out of here.
Listen up.
This is our neighborhood.
Our homes.
We're better than this.
The fires are spreading, and the fire department isn't coming.
So if any of you want roofs over your heads tomorrow...
... and the day after that, start helping.
I have buckets.
Let's get those hydrants open.
- All right.
- Yeah, right.
Let's do it.
- Here, let me help you.
- The drugstore has bandages.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...
... I'm here to appeal to your community spirit.
I know you've had your differences in the past.
Some of you will even argue that you can't work together.
That's fine.
Those people will stay tied up.
And it will not be a function of which group you're in.
What is this, the gestapo?
He lumps us together with criminals. Unh.
Shut up, man.
The rest of you can lend a hand to keep our city from falling apart.
You can lead by example.
Your choice.
I'm sure you're all eager to help.
- I'm suing.
- Good luck with that.
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.
He's too big.
- All right.
- All right, keep it going, guys.
- Come on.
- Keep working.
- Come on, guys. Have that.
- More water.
The fire is spreading to the East Side!
Jim!
Oh.
One week now that the U.S. has been blanketed in a cloud of ash.
Electricity is finally coming back online in parts of the country...
... but the impact on weather patterns is expected to last much longer.
It's high noon in Gotham City, and yet there's no sun...
... and it's the coldest day of the year.
I don't know what to wear.
Every major city in the country but one...
... has descended into riots, looting and other crimes.
The president has imposed limited martial law...
... but this has been seen to have little effect.
Only Gotham has maintained order...
... thanks to the vigilante gang being led by the Batman...
... adding to the massive credibility nightmare...
... being experienced by the president's administration.
- How are you feeling, son?
- Better, Mr. President. Thank you.
Sorry I haven't been able to help more.
Oh. This'll all blow over.
Don't you give it another thought.
So long as you're up to handling our other little problem now?
Of course, sir.
Though he'll never let me bring him in alive.
Well, you do what you need to do.
You always did do it wrong, Bruce.
Been five years since I busted out of jail...
... and you know I've been busy.
But I made it hard on them.
They had to cover up my escape...
... and now they have to cover up my work.
And it's a lot harder to frost me if they can't admit I exist.
You draw too much attention to yourself.
Always have.
I mean, sure, you play it mysterious...
... but it's a noisy kind of mysterious.
You, they have to kill.
What is it you want, Oliver?
A piece of him. The schoolboy.
I always knew it would come down to the two of you someday.
The world's not big enough for the both of you.
Doesn't have to be a big piece.
Just count me in, for old times' sake.
Still hurts when it's cold.
Lately, it's been cold a lot.
Good. Now take him into a canter.
No!
Crime Alley.
- You're not even close to fully recovered.
- Neither is he.
He doesn't need a walking hospital bed to keep his insides together.
I know you're not looking forward to your part in this.
I can't say it will be pleasant.
But it does fall within my duties.
One hour.
Army troops have evacuated the downtown slum known as Crime Alley.
No explanation has been given, and news coverage has been flatly...
Vehicle approaching from the west.
Something huge.
Let it through. Then close the hole.
He'll still be weak, between the nuke and so little sunlight.
Just how weak we'll see when he finds my first surprise.
Yeah, but how long you expect to last against him?
- Long enough.
- Boss.
I'm trying to get the plan here.
I mean, you gonna die tonight or what?
Figure I will.
I've got a visual. It's him.
Do not engage. Just monitor his position.
Wait, I lost him.
Don't worry. He can't hide from what's coming.
Isn't this a school night, young lady?
Clark.
This is between you and me.
- We don't have to do this.
- Sure we do.
Bruce, be reasonable.
You know what my orders are.
Your orders?
You say you answer to some sort of authority.
They only want me dead because I'm an embarrassment.
Because I do what they can't.
What kind of authority is that?
It doesn't matter. It's their world, and they won't stand for you anymore.
If it isn't me, it'll just be someone else.
Really? Who do they send after you?
We got the vehicle. Appears disabled.
- Unknown if anyone's inside.
- Roger that.
Approach with caution.
Bruce, this is idiotic.
That was three ribs, Bruce.
Don't make me do this.
Robin. This is a recording.
Clark should be too busy to listen now.
Here's the plan.
Anything good on?
What was that?
Who's up there? I want people on that roof.
Get ready.
What are you doing?
Do you want me to kill you?
Oh, you're not going to kill me.
Now.
It wasn't easy to make, Clark.
It took years and cost a fortune.
Luckily, I had both.
He's down here!
Eyes downside, spud.
Hi-ho freaking silver.
You're feeling it now, aren't you?
What the rest of us live with every day.
Your own mortality.
Don't worry, you'll survive.
The kryptonite will work its way out of your lungs soon enough.
Bruce. Your heart.
We got them. They got nowhere to go.
But I didn't have to go easy on you.
A different binding agent, a stronger mix.
I want you to remember that.
I wanted to remind you to stay out of my way.
In all the years to come, in your most private moments...
... I want you to remember the one man who beat you.
Bruce.
Don't touch him.
Funeral proceedings are underway today for Bruce Wayne...
... as Gotham City still reels from last week's spectacular revelation...
... that the world famous billionaire was the Batman.
All of Wayne's secrets, his methods and tools in his decades as the Batman...
... died with him as Wayne Manor burned to the ground.
The fire was apparently set by his butler...
... who himself died of a stroke at the scene.
Every penny of Wayne's wealth...
... all of his accounts and financial holdings, have also disappeared.
Amen.
You've got some nerve showing up here.
- I know who killed him, damn you...
- Selina.
Don't. It's no use. Let's go.
Were you a friend?
I think so. I honestly couldn't say.
Sounds about right.
- See that ledge? Get another lamp up there.
- Right, boss.
- And, you, one there too.
- Cool, boss.
There's a fresh spring under here.
I want our water supply set up in one hour.
- We ain't got forever, people.
- Sure we do.
Starting now,
I'm going to teach you everything.
All of my ways. All of my secrets.
You're going to be my army, operating in the shadows...
... keeping Gotham safe.
And we're going to take as long as we need.
Now, do what Oliver says and get to work.
- Right, boss.
- You got it, boss.
- Give me a hand here.
- Go. Come on, come on, come on.
Heard the schoolboy found you out.
It's all right.
I think the message got through.
As long as we stay quiet, he'll leave us alone.
- You gonna be all right with this?
- This quieter mysterious?
I spent 10 years looking for a good death.
This...
This'll be a good life.
Good enough.
There is a place.
A place that knows no sadness.
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.
A place inhabited by little blue beings three apples high.
It lies deep in an enchanted forest, hidden away beyond a medieval village.
Most people believe this place is made up, only to be found in books or in children 's imaginations.
Well, we beg to diff en
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!
I'm going in!
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!
Yes!
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!
Oh, yeah! So excited!
Now you see us, now you don't!
Three, two, one. Yeah!
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf plays their own special pad.
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro for the Blue Moon Festival!
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!
Clumsy! Help!
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!
Smurf on the loose!
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.
Who's clumsy now, huh?
Hey, what do you get when you cross a Smurf with a cow?
Blue cheese! I got you a present.
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!
But, wait! I...
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal for the Blue Moon Festival?
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.
Grouchy, it's right there.
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."
Clearly you two lack the verbal skills required
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy, the other Smurfs don't want to dance with you for fear of what are politely called
"fractures."
How could anybody think that?
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.
Watch it, there!
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.
As happy and as perfect as life in Smurf village is, even sunshine and butterflies must have their dark clouds.
And for all Smurfs, that dark cloud has one name.
Gargamel, the evil wizard.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
This is so wrong
"I'm Papa Smurf.
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people
"and live in the forest with 99 sons and one daughter.
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.
"And I betrayed Gargamel, and I don't even care.
"And everything is just sunshine and rainbows."
But all of that is about to change.
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!
That's your cue to pounce on the miserable beasts in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.
I simply can't stop thinking about the miserable beasts every single minute of every single day.
'Cause I need them!
It is only by capturing the little wretches and extracting their happy blue essence that my magic will finally become...
Not infallible.
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.
I shall become the most powerful wizard in all of the world.
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.
"O great one?"
Yes, lying, deceptive, horrible little Smurfette?
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching, how ever do you expect to find us?"
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.
For, you see, I have a magical map that shows me exactly where the smurf root grows!
I shall now use my formidable powers to magically transport us here!
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!
Alakazoop!
Great.
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?
We really need that Smurf essence.
Alakazamp!
Now tie it off right there!
That blue moon time of year again.
Time to smurf some magic.
Summon a vision and see what our future holds.
I must get the visioning potion just right.
The magic is always strongest during the blue moon.
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.
A dragon wand.
I got it! I got it!
Clumsy.
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!
Papa!
Clumsy, what have you done?
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?
Are you okay?
Yes. Fine.
Why aren't you rehearsing for the Blue Moon celebration?
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face, so I thought I'd make some smurf root mud packs to take down everyone's swelling.
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.
No! Those fields are too close to Gargamel's castle.
I'll get the smurf root.
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?
Okay. If you say so.
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.
Let's see, just a few more...
- Boo.
- Gargamel!
Help!
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!
A ball of yarn!
A nice, juicy bird!
So, that's it!
It's invisible.
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if it's safe.
Azrael?
Are you dead?
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?
Nothing apocalyptic, really.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Perfect. Another year we don't have to worry about that mean, old...
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.
No, no! Gargamel!
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta accidentally led him to the village.
Gargamel!
Smurf for your lives!
Everybody skedaddle!
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!
Sound the alarm, Crazy.
This is really bad!
Smurfs, that way!
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!
There you go, you nasty cat.
- This way!
- This is no joke!
- Look out!
- Papa!
Let go! Cursed nature!
Here comes papa, Papa!
Papa, your primitive little defenses, they're useless against me, sir!
I laugh at them.
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?
Maybe this will all blow over.
I can fix this. I just gotta think.
Yes!
Follow me, everyone!
Save yourselves!
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!
The one time we want him to trip and he's running perfectly!
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!
This is not good at all.
Clumsy!
Help!
Well, we tried. Let's go.
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.
Not the Smurf bridge!
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.
This is not a Smurf bridge, it's clearly a chain...
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?
Oh, no!
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!
- Don't let go!
- Help!
Help!
Look out for the hole!
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.
Smurf up! It's a hole.
Hold on!
Oh, no!
Looks like you got the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?
Now you belong to me!
Not this time, Gargamel!
What's wrong with you?
That was great! Let's have another go.
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!
We're not even wet.
What part of the enchanted forest is this?
My calculations indicate...
That's slimy.
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.
Oh, my.
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.
And can't we just go around the rock?
Oh, my smurf.
Where the smurf are we?
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle, that's where.
Well, at least they're not coming after us.
Oh, yeah. Really?
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!
- Run!
- Not again!
Azrael? Are you dead?
Must have Smurfs!
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!
- Guys, come on!
- Go!
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.
Hey, can we get the photographer over there?
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.
If you could not stand directly in front of the display, but over to the sides, it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.
Also, don't forget to smile.
Remember, you're working for a cosmetics company. That's it.
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!
Hello, Henri.
On top of everything with the campaign, Patrick?
Well, as much as I can be.
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.
Patrick!
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.
It's gonna be quite the gala.
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.
Can you give me what I want?
Is that what you're asking for?
How would I know what I'm asking for when I don't even know what I want?
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.
Exacto! I need you to create a new campaign for Jouvenel.
All digital, of course, so it can be ready on time for the launch.
Odile, that's two days.
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign, it's kind of tight.
But... No, two days is perfect.
God only needed six days for the whole world, right?
Fail me, and maybe you can go and work for him.
Where are we, Azrael?
What manner of freakish realm is this?
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?
Yes, yes, of course.
This day just keeps getting better and better.
So we're just gonna jump in the portal, get back to our village and everybody's happy, right?
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.
We're all gonna die.
Papa Smurf, how do we get home with the portal closed?
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight, the portal will open again.
Now, let's take shelter till dark.
All right, let's get smurfing.
Okay, but I'm not happy.
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!
Way to go, Smurfette!
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!
Smurf!
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!
Hey.
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.
Why don't we just go around the tree?
There you are. By all means, relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.
What? Where?
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!
Be careful, Brainy.
Hey. Hey!
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!
A jump from this height will Knock the blue out of us!
- My hip.
- Papa!
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!
Stop that carriage!
Never mind. Here it is.
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!
You've had that coming for about 30 years!
Smurfs!
Oh, wow.
Castles and palaces everywhere!
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.
And look at the giant princess!
This village is amazing, Papa.
Yes, and likely very dangerous.
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,
I need you all to stay close and do exactly as I say.
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.
You can count on us, Papa.
They can see us! Camouflage.
Blend in.
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.
We get to climb another tree.
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!
- Brainy.
- That's it.
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.
How are we supposed to find Clumsy in there?
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.
- Grace?
- Hello?
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...
Baby kicked.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Please say hello.
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.
This is the sound of my voice.
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.
Hello.
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.
Or the new VP of marketing.
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!
- It's...
- It's provisional.
If I wow Cruella de Odile, then I'll keep the job.
If not, then my head'll be on a pike next to the last guy.
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.
But I have two days.
- Yikes.
- I know.
What if I don't get them done in time?
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.
Unless...
Wait, the backup ads we have did fine in focus groups.
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.
Azrael, we've come so far, yet ever am I haunted by the same familiar riddle.
How to find the Smurfs?
If only I...
I'm sorry, is my thinking interrupting your vile hacking?
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.
Very nice. Are you done now?
I don't want to look at it.
What? What?
Is that... No. No, it can't be.
It is.
The tawny locks of Smurfette.
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!
With my skills, even this small trifle of smurfiness will yield me just enough power to catch them all!
I must find a laboratory with which to tease the magic from these precious little strands.
Yes. it's a bit small, but this should do nicely!
It's even got its own cauldron.
What died in here?
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!
Somebody's been working a dark and terrible magic in there.
What is that?
On, baby.
Daddy is home.
Come on.
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.
How are we gonna open a magical portal when we can't even find Clumsy?
Hey, I think I see something up there.
Oh, no.
Clumsy? Is that you?
Hello.
Help! Help!
Oh, smurf.
Hey.
"Berry Boom."
Patrick!
Elway. Elway.
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!
What is it?
No, no!
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.
Elway.
Elway. Did you do that?
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.
- I got this side.
- All together now.
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.
GO! Pull the lid!
Gross.
This is so...
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...
Did you just talk?
I'm not saying till you put down the giant spiky thing.
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?
- Get out of here!
- Look out!
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!
Kiss my smurf!
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!
- Over here!
- Get him!
Have you had enough? Tap out?
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!
Other way! Other way!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!
Run!
Elway!
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!
Grace! Run!
Stop bleating like a sheep and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.
Grace, we're being attacked!
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!
It's okay, it's okay.
They're friendly.
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.
I was about to make haggis with your innards.
This is it. This is it, Azrael!
Smurfette's hair goes in here, flows through the Smurf essence extractor, and finally, I have my Smurfilator!
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...
Would you care for a mint when you're done?
Yes, yes, yes!
With this precious elixir, my sorcerous spell shall be powerful beyond all measurable measurement.
This one tiny drop will give me the power to capture them all.
This is great!
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin
It's so obvious that what you're doing is wrong.
Oh, really? After you.
How crazy is this?
There are little blue people singing in our kitchen!
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?
Sorry.
Okay. It says here Smurfs are mythical creatures from Belgium,
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.
Documented by Peyo.
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.
It says they're mythical, Grace.
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.
Well, they look pretty real to me.
Come on.
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.
You guys come from a magic forest where you live in oversized mushrooms.
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.
And you like to use the extremely imprecise term "smurf"
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.
And you're all named after your personalities?
Do you get your names when you're born, or after you've exhibited certain traits?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
Yeah, whatever.
Master Winslow, there must be something about the blue moon on your magic window machine.
Just what is this magic searching device?
Right now, I'm using Google.
- Google.
- Google.
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.
"A figurative construct..."
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!
"But the moon itself doesn't appear to be blue."
- What?
- Not blue?
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,
I'll just have to smurf us a potion to invoke the blue moon.
You hear that, honey?
They're only staying till an actual blue moon rises.
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion, which, at this point, seems completely plausible.
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.
Of course, the stars will need to be perfectly aligned.
And when that might be is hard to determine without the proper instrument.
Master Winslow, might I borrow your stargazer?
My what-whatzer?
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!
Besides, Papa had a vision, and everything turns out smurf y.
Right, Papa?
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.
What does the temperature of this Lilly have to do with the finding of Smurfs?
- Take your meds, man.
- What?
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.
Pardon me, wise sir?
By any chance, have you seen any little blue men?
They're everywhere!
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.
I know.
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.
Great. We're gonna be here how long?
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.
Next, find a book of spells and then smurf a portal and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.
Bye, Elway.
Someone looks smurfalish!
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft, like a blacksmith's apron.
I wear it because it's what everyone wears at work.
What are you, you pasty giant?
I try to get people to buy things by analyzing market trend predictions.
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.
Look, I would love to explain but I am super late. I gotta go.
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?
You had one outfit on, and now you're wearing something completely different.
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette, she probably got the other one dirty.
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know, somebody wants a bigger mushroom.
But, then you'd be further apart.
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.
I've got a baby on the way, so...
Wait, wait. We can't just leave them here alone, without an adult.
I'm 546 years old.
Of course you are.
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.
- Love you.
- Okay.
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere if I were you.
Why not?
Our world doesn't do well with visitors from other places.
I mean, look what happened to E.T.
It's a movie. A moving picture.
Book. Just stay, okay?
Great. He's gone and we still don't have a Stargazer.
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller, he reads stars all the time.
Ergo, it's at his place of business.
Excellent work, Brainy.
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.
Clumsy, I think it might be best if you stay here. You know?
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.
Smurf away!
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?
Look, he's getting into the mechanical wagon.
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!
Goodbye, blue world.
Use your hat, you ninny!
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.
We're stopping. Hold on tight.
Not to me, Grouchy.
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.
Master Winslow, we really need your help.
- Hey.
- Right here.
What are you doing here?
What part of "we need a Stargazer" don't you understand, you numptie?
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?
If we could just have a quick look around in your predicting parlor...
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.
All of you. Trust me.
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.
I'm not going... Hey!
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.
All right, who smurf ed?
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.
I hope you guys like desk drawers, because that's where...
- You're late.
- Odile!
You were in my office.
It's my building, and we have much work to do.
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?
Close. I had a crazy morning.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.
Nervous energy.
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.
- I like it.
- Yep.
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.
Hey! Stop it.
- Henri.
- Make it work.
You have no idea.
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.
Are you crazy?
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?
I'm sorry, Master Winslow, but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?
It's not something people of this century just have, especially here.
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.
Well, perhaps we could sing to help things along.
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long
Stop.
La la la la la la
Stop!
Sing a happy song
Come on. None of you find that song just the tiniest bit annoying?
I find it annoying.
Well, what do you sing at work?
- I don't sing at work.
- What?
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.
I know. How about if we hum?
Please stop humming.
I need to hone my message here.
I've got a message.
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.
That's good. You should use that.
Or, "Dance and be happy."
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?
It's an embarrassment of riches.
They're giving you gold here.
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow, you'll know it's the right message if it comes from the heart.
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.
- You said it.
- Absolutely.
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.
I love emerging dramatically through the smoke.
It makes... It makes me feel so deliciously mysterious.
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.
What?
Where? Where?
What?
Curses! So close.
What?
Theirs is upside-down.
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.
- Hi.
- Hello.
What are you doing?
Just greening things up a bit.
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but, you know, I'm not so sure this stuffs gonna grow out here.
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.
So where is everybody else?
They went to get a Stargazer so Papa can smurf a blue moon to get us home.
And they went without you?
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?
- Hey!
- Sorry!
Why don't we come inside?
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that this new anti-aging cream can make any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.
Astonishing, really.
I see no transformation.
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish, if you ask me.
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.
How sad for you in 30 years.
Henri, escort this lunatic out.
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?
Alakazootiful!
How did you do that?
Yes, and seriously, me next.
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards never reveal their secrets.
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.
Please, señor Can you do that again?
You may attempt to persuade me.
What is it that you desire?
Riches?
Fame?
Fortune?
With my help, the whole world will know the name that is Garbagesmell.
Gargamel.
Yes. With my help, the whole world will know the genius that is Gargamel.
L.m
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone, on the bright side, I did land us all here in your little mushroom, and we got to meet you and Patrick.
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.
Well, I used to be.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So how long did it take you to...
Gosh.
Un-fumble your feet?
Well, about as long as it takes to realize that nobody's just one thing.
You can be anything you wanna be.
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.
Probably not.
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.
First, you put your...
Works every time.
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
This is a fascinating wind machine you have here.
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!
They are everywhere and they won't stop singing.
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill to get what you have in that ring.
Not if we Kill them first.
Let's see, we're going to need some knights, preferably in shining armor, some bowmen, poison arrows.
I like the way you think.
And some spikes to mount their heads on.
Well, it is all about the presentation.
And, of course, all of our testing would be animal cruelty-free?
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?
Get out of here.
You have a wicked sense of humor.
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!
Henri?
I said, get out of here.
Señor Gargamel, now you must assure me, darling, that you can recreate whatever it was that you did to my mother, but on a massive scale.
Do that, and the world will worship you.
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...
Heretic. Yes, thank you.
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon has gone straight to my nether regions.
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.
Now, to the matter at hand.
So do we have a deal, señor?
Not quite, my sweet maiden.
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!
Hit the deck!
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.
Can't everyone just slow down
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!
Wait for it.
I gotta get me one of those.
Oh, my gosh!
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!
When we get inside, spread out and find that Stargazer.
Come on, Smurfs!
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.
Grace, are you running?
No, no, I'm totally fine, but they need your help!
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna get themselves killed!
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.
Patrick, they need you.
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!
All right. Where are you?
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
You call that groveling, you fool?
Every village has an idiot. What?
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!
Smurf thief!
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...
So that's where all the unicorns went.
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.
Fine. Then hang on.
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.
Perfect.
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!
That'll put some air up your skirt!
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.
Predator!
Smurf droppings.
These are disgustingly tasty.
Hello.
Oh, creepy.
I hope they weren't looking for a stargazer, too.
Stargazers, stargazers...
Dresses!
You mean I can have more than one kind of dress?
What?
Papa, I'm telling you, we're never gonna find those...
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.
Hold still, stairs!
Look at the stair-climbing toy!
- Hey.
- What is that?
- Let me see it.
- Careful.
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.
Just say who you are and be who you say, right?
I can't seem to get it to scan.
My son wants one of those blue animatronic things.
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.
What aisle did you find this on?
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?
What? Ice Bat?
It comes in pink.
Smurf thief! Stop!
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?
You bet.
Smurf!
But I've got feelings.
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence on that old hag?
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!
I'm not a toy!
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?
- There she is!
- There she is!
Hey, this dress is mine!
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!
A giant's after me! She's huge!
Hey, that's mine!
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...
- Mommy!
- Really?
Don't ever forget that one magical moment our two worlds met.
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.
Hey!
That's one!
Technically, when loading cargo onto the head of a bear,
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.
Hold onto your knickers, boys, it's about to get grisly.
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!
Let's go, go, go!
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.
Two more!
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!
Grace, that's Gargamel!
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.
Bad kitty!
Oh, I hate that Cat!
Gargamel.
Smurfette.
More lovely than ever.
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.
Or not!
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...
Yahoo!
- Patrick.
- Hey.
- Impressive.
- Thanks.
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!
Or suffer the wrath of the great and powerful...
Let me... Let me see here...
How can you be the only girl in the village?
Well, see, I wasn't brought by a stork like the others.
I was created by Gargamel to trap the other Smurfs.
Wow. And then what happened?
Papa saved me.
He cast a special spell and then helped me become the Smurf I was meant to be.
No. Play it safe.
"Odile, pending your approval, it's ready to go to the billboard agency."
Well, here goes nothing.
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent, it's a whole new wager.
Without that blue moon, our giblets are gravy.
Well, it's off.
Time to either celebrate or file for unemployment.
Hey, what's wrong?
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. it's okay.
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.
I know the feeling.
Better yet...
I know the cure.
You just match the colors with the buttons.
You try.
Hey! Go, Grouchy!
- You're good!
- Nice one!
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!
Walk this way...
You sing.
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss
It's a rock face.
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?
Never mind.
- Like this
- Like this
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy
Little skirts climbing way up her knee
Not another single girl in the whole smurf in' world
And I can't believe she's lookin' at me
- it's a complete
- Surrender
- To the power of her
- Gender
So I close my eyes and make a wish
- I just want to
- Savor
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!
- Gutsy!
- Nice!
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
That was rare.
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Sorry, boys.
Yeah, that cools the giblets.
Nothin' like a cool breeze through my Enchanted Forest.
- It's approved.
- What?
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?
Well, she said "approved," so coming from her, that's love.
Oh, my goodness!
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!
Yeah.
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.
Do it, do it.
Go, go, go!
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard in New York City.
It's a go, laddie boy!
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.
But we are going home, right?
Of course. Just not tonight.
Now, off to bed.
I was hoping I'd be sleeping in my mushroom tonight.
I miss the other Smurfs.
Me, too.
I've never spent the night away from home before.
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Papa?
Do you really believe we're ever gonna get home to the other Smurfs?
Don't worry.
We'll be reunited with the others soon enough.
If only the stars would align.
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.
- Aye.
- Yeah.
He's always so nice, but when he leaves you feel bad.
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.
Oh, hello, little moth.
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.
Both of us meant to soar.
Go now, and bring back an army of mighty eagles to free me.
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.
Fly! Fly!
Fly!
Okay. Let's see here.
Hey.
I'm guessing you have a long night ahead of you.
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?
So tell me, that weird guy in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?
Not the smartest of sorcerers, but dangerous just the same.
Thank you.
Back home, I could hold him at bay with a spell or two.
But here, without my books and potions...
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?
Well, what are you gonna do?
I'll do anything and everything I can do to get my Smurfs home.
I won't ever give up. They're my family.
And you never give up on family.
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes having all those little guys depending on you?
I mean, what if you screw up?
How'd you know when you were ready?
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.
Yeah, right. Scratch that.
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you come for us today when your Grace called?
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.
Well, that's what being a papa is.
When it comes time, you just do.
And knowing what to do doesn't come from up here.
It comes from here, where it matters most.
My spleen?
No, your heart.
I'm trying to have a moment here, you whippersnapper.
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.
Come on, baby, stop playing.
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?
You know what happens to people who sit on my bench?
Be gone with you, behemoth, for I have instructed a moth to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles to free me from this confine.
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.
You see? You see?
The dungeon isn't built that can hold the likes of Gargamel.
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!
So long, scallywags!
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.
Wait, take me with you!
Wait! Wait!
To my castle for more essence!
Here they come, here they come.
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.
- There we are.
- Clumsy.
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.
I think there's too much pink.
Just because your name is Grouchy doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.
Yeah, it does.
- Smurfette.
- Hi.
- High five. High four.
- High four.
Great news! The stars have revealed a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!
- All right!
- Smurftastic!
I never doubted it for a second.
It has to be done tonight, between first star and high moon.
That's our only chance.
But we'll need a magic spell that works in this realm to open the portal home.
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.
Is there a place that sells spells?
No.
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.
How about old books?
Wait, there's an antique book shop right near where I work.
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.
Hey! Smurf hug!
Oh, I love you guys!
Bring it in, big fella.
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.
Hey, get up here.
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.
We've already got one.
- Really?
- What?
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.
That's the wrong ad.
What happened to my office?
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Someone sent this to the ad agency last night.
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta, just got me fired.
You sent the wrong file.
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.
I never wanted a house full of little people running around!
Blue. Little blue...
Okay...
Patrick.
What are you doing?
Going to try to save my job.
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!
There's no call for that kind of language, laddie.
See?
Okay, Patrick, wait.
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.
Just stop and listen to me for a second, please.
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?
And I hope that you can straighten that out.
But you are so not seeing the big picture here.
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.
Of all the people on the planet, those magical little creatures came to us.
They chose us.
Don't you see how absolutely amazing that is?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.
This is our blue moon.
And if you don't stop for just a second to see that, you're gonna miss it.
Hey, hey. Taxi!
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!
There's got to be some essence in here somewhere!
NOT DOW.
What? What?
Very, very well done, my little friend.
And to think, I almost ate you that time.
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick, the rouge merchant.
He will lead us to our elusive little blue quarry.
Don't you just have a switch or something to shut them off?
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.
Smurf me.
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?
According to the searching device, we take the F machine two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?
- What?
- Jump!
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.
That was great.
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...
For smurf's sake.
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.
Oh, it smells like butter in here.
Where do you suppose this magic bookstore could be?
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.
- It's closed.
- Figures.
We have to find a way in. Come on.
I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.
All right, everybody.
- Hey.
- Wow.
This place looks creepy to me.
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.
Let's just get the book and get outta here.
You're right. This book of spells is our ticket home.
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire, limitless power and world adulation.
Now why does it have to be so hard?
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.
Wherever did you hear that ear-damning squall?
It's your little blue men.
I saw them going into the bookstore around the corner.
You know, that song is really annoying.
Cautiously excited.
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.
Oh. Nearly there.
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.
Ah, yes.
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. ”
Peyo.
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.
- Look at that.
- Wow.
Well, I'll be smurf ed.
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.
You see all that in there?
Look here, at the patterns on this page.
Openous-lockicuss.
What?
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.
Oh, that's just plain naughty.
All that remains now is to return to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle, where your essence shall finally be mine.
- The dragon wand.
- No!
It's...
Oh, please, please, allow me.
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!
Wait for me!
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.
After all, what is the hunt without the thrill!
No!
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.
Let's get outta here.
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion and smurf the moon tonight.
It has to be tonight.
Me? Smurf the moon?
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?
- Papa, no!
- No!
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?
Come to papa, Papa!
- Just go!
- Papa!
- Papa!
- No!
Keep movin', lass.
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?
What's gonna happen to Papa?
Papa told us to smurf the moon, and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
Come on. We don't have much time.
"Come on"? Come on, where?
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?
We ride. Come on!
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.
And Smurfs. Let's ride.
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!
But I'm not sure I can do this.
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!
According to my calculations, this is dangerous!
It's getting dark.
Yeah. Yeah, I think we'd better go look for them.
Yeah.
Hi.
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.
Listen, Grace, I'm...
Hey, Odile.
Patrick...
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,
I know that the ads that ran weren't the ads I sent.
But they're the ads I should have sent.
The ads I almost did send.
But I didn't 'cause...
I second-guessed myself.
I gave you what I thought you wanted, instead of what I thought was right.
But this is right.
It means something to me and...
I don't know,
I think it's gonna mean something to others, too.
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.
"Once in a blue moon."
That means that there are only a few moments in your life when something truly memorable, truly magical, happens to you.
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid, you might just miss it.
That's what that image means.
Don't let those blue moon moments pass you by.
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.
I so smurf in' love you.
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.
We're outta control!
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.
Look! We got the incantation.
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.
- What?
- Oh, no.
He took him to some place called BellVeedaRay Castle.
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?
Belve... He's taken him to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.
To extract his essence.
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.
Papa said no matter what happens we're not to go back for him.
He's trying to protect us.
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.
No, no, no. We can't.
We promised Papa we'd do exactly what he said.
- That's right.
- I didn't.
I never promised him anything.
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.
I'm in.
Aye. Me, too.
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few
And steal their essence blue
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!
Oh, look at this.
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard yields me all of this essence.
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest from your entire family of Smurfs.
Alakazookas!
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!
No. No! The cages! No! No!
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!
I'll snip it from their hair.
You're a fool, Gargamel.
My Smurfs are well on their way home by now.
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.
Good luck, Gutsy!
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.
Brainy, what's happening?
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.
I don't think I can do it.
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.
I'll be smurf ed!
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.
That which doesn't kill you only makes me stronger.
- Yo!
- Huh?
Gargamel! Come out and play!
Oh, I think our tiny little guests have finally arrived.
- No!
- Ah, well.
Enjoy the ride, Papa!
And remember, keep your hands and feet
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!
Smurfs, run!
Smurfs.
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurf ed!
Yeah, what he said.
Adorable.
Two little smurfs come to save their beloved Papa.
Hey, Gargamel.
Make that three little smurfs.
And I went home and got a few friends.
MY, my, my!
I think the whole village must be here.
Whatever will I do with all this essence?
On me, boys.
Fire!
Let's get this hoedown started!
There comes a time when every Smurf must stand up...
Watch it, you little hoodlums!
For what is good and cute and blue in the world.
And on this brisk New York night, that time is now.
Hey! Seriously?
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.
Eat yolk, Gargamel!
Patrick, can you do it?
Go, go, go!
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.
You know, one bad apple can ruin your whole day.
Full smurf ahead!
Come on!
Hey, Gargamel, here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...
- Fire.
- Fire.
I'm too beautiful to die!
Oh, Papa.
No. No, Smurfette.
What did he do to you?
You shouldn't have come back for me.
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.
Smurfette!
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.
Charge!
Get him!
Grab the wand!
- Goin' in!
- Go!
Bombs away!
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!
Hang on, Papa.
Onions!
Get back, cat.
Here, kitty, kitty...
Smurfette!
Looking for me?
Play time is over!
Behold the awesome power of me!
Smurfette?
Had enough, huh?
You're mine, kitty.
I'm done smurfing around.
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!
What's happening, Papa?
No!
Gargamel!
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.
Oh, Papa!
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa is about to meet his little blue end.
No!
Upsy-daisy!
Oh, no. Papa!
Papa!
No! No!
You again!
Goodbye!
I'm really...
This ends here, this ends now!
Really going to enjoy this.
Gotcha!
Freedom!
Son of a smurf!
Come back here!
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!
Come back here right now with my wand!
Oh, no. Crikey.
I... I got it.
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.
I got it! I got it!
The vision's never been wrong.
I got it!
My wand! Give me back my wand!
How dare you!
How dare you defy the great and powerful...
Oh, my God.
Smurfs!
Are you dead?
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!
- Patrick.
- Hey.
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!
Clumsy, you're a hero.
I'm a hero?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.
Thanks, Papa.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
And now to get rid of this!
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.
I'm not one for long goodbyes, but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.
- Bye.
- Take care.
I hated this. So much less than I expected.
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.
I've never had a girlfriend before.
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.
High four.
High four, Grace.
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.
Hero? Stop.
Well, actually, you mind saying it one more time?
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.
- You saved me.
- So long!
You saved my whole family.
Actually I think it was the other way around.
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.
Your village has given me some ideas.
Come here.
Goodbye, Papa.
Goodbye, Papa.
Let's go home.
And so, the Smurfs left the strange city of New York, and I think they left it a little sweeter, a little wiser, a little smurfier.
And as that portal began to close for the last time...
Hey! Seriously, stop!
Bye, New York!
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.
Finally someone has given me what I want.
I think I'm not fired.
Wow!
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby, some unique new friends...
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.
Grace,
I smurf you.
Smurfs. Smurfs!
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.
What are you looking at?
MALE OVER RADIO: Scorch, Scorch, are you there?
Come on, Scorch, get back to me.
You haven't run off and done something reckless, have you?
Gary, we've got a problem!
GARY: That's my brother, Scorch.
As usual, he's in trouble.
How did he get into this mess?
For that, I have to go back a long, long time.
Forty-seven minutes ago.
Baby rescue mission. Planet Gnarlach.
GARY OVER RADIO: Quiet, Scorch.
Whatever you do, don't wake the Gnarlachs.
Hey, that's me, Gary Supernova.
I work in Mission Control, which means I control the mission.
Scorch doesn't see it that way.
Oh, relax, Gary, they're fast asleep.
GARY: And that is a Gnarlach.
- Scary, slimy...
- ...and surprisingly stinky.
GARY OVER RADIO: Uploading that to Blue Tube.
Gary, this place smells worse than the latrines at the BASA Academy.
Mmm. Thank you for that.
(MALE VOICE) Um, I was programmed at the BASA Academy.
The only thing I smelled there was progress.
Zip it, James.
The name's Bing, by the way. James Bing.
GARY OVER RADIO: All right, Scorch, let's find those babies
and get you out of there.
(WHISPERING) Bingo.
Spacecraft identified.
Good. Now proceed with extreme caution.
Negative.
Proceeding with style. (GRUNTS)
Not style again! Scorch! Shh!
Hah! Triple Star System into a Reverse Galaxy, followed by a Double Black Hole with a twist!
And he sticks the landing!
GARY OVER RADIO: Now proceed with caution.
OK, Scorch, the babies should be straight ahead.
SCORCH: Copy that.
No!
Bad news, little brother.
We're too late.
They've eaten the babies!
It's so unfair!
Scorch, they're right behind you.
- What?
(CHUCKLING) Oh.
Hi, little guys.
- Uncle Scorch is here to rescue you.
- Coochie, coochie, coo.
Yeah, Gary, maybe tell Scorch to keep his voice down in this situation?
- Just a thought.
- Scorch, quiet!
Gary, you should see them.
They're so cute. It's magical.
GARY: You're gonna wake up the whole neighborhood.
And this is not a good neighborhood.
- Peekaboo!
GARY: - Scorch?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, good, here we go again.
- Scorch!
Gary, we've got a problem!
Of course we have a problem.
You never listen to me.
You said there were 12 Gnarlachs, Gary.
No, I said 1200.
Uh, nope, I don't think you did.
- There are 1200 Gnarlachs down there.
- Got it.
- Twelve-hundred baby-eating Gnarlachs.
- Got it.
Twelve-hundred of our archenemies, the Gnarlachs.
- Twelve-hundred of 'em.
- Got it.
Nope. I think I'd remember if you said 1200.
(GRUNTS) - Now do your thing.
- OK.
Chasm of death in 20 yards and closing.
Deploy grappling hook in three...
...two...
...one.
Whoo! Oh, yeah!
- You see that?
Boom! That's what I'm talking about!
- Scorch me, baby!
Helpless babies, your chariot awaits.
In your face, Gnarlachs!
I got the babies! Ha-ha!
- Oh, no, no.
Guys, no, no.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
- No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
- Huh?
- Shh! Gary?
GARY: - I'm on it.
Ha! Take that!
(BOY) Supernova-9, you are clear for landing on planet Dad!
Hey! This is a no-fly zone, mister.
Very funny, Dad.
I'm serious.
This console's expensive, Kipper.
Console? I mean...
I mean, I'm right here. Unbelievable.
Can I have my spaceship back?
- Mmm... No.
- Dad, you never let me do anything.
OK, but be careful.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Ahh!
- It burns! It burns!
- Ohh!
- Sorry. Dad. Hey!
OK, let's play the game where you sit on your hands.
- That game stinks.
SCORCH: - Hey, Gary!
Be a pal, park this puppy, will ya?
Activating remote assistance.
Time to watch your old man bring in the Supernova-9 for a landing.
- Scorch is back!
I love you, planet Baab!
Whoo!
Boom!
Cool!
And that is how you do that.
- Gary!
- What? OK, that's terrifying.
Why do you always call me in jumbo-head mode?
We've received an SOS from an uncharted sector of the galaxy.
Prepare for Scorch's next mission.
Copy that, boss.
Where are we headed?
He's going to the Dark Planet.
Lena, are you crazy?
Let me... rephrase that.
They call it the Dark Planet because nobody ever comes back.
It's like going into a black hole.
He leaves in an hour.
Whoa! He's going to the Dark Planet?
Wicked!
Stay here. Don't touch anything.
And nobody's going to the Dark Planet.
We are going to the Dark Planet!
- Scorch!
- Scorch, one question!
No questions, just pictures.
Yeah, baby!
Excuse me, Scorch!
Scorch Supernova!
Yes, the beautiful young lady in the front row.
- Oh!
- Hi, sweetie. Welcome home.
- Gabby, we're live.
(GIGGLING) - Oh, right.
Hi. Tell us about the mission.
- The Dark Planet.
It's heroic, even for me.
- No one has ever come back alive.
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.
- Have you had time to prepare?
- Uh, no, no, we haven't.
- Gary Supernova, my baby brother.
- Uh, fact check: I'm older than him.
Gary works all the gizmos and bleep-bloops here in the nerd factory.
- I work in Mission Control.
We use a trans-inducified field matrix to...
Mmm-hmm. And that's today's edition of The Boring Report.
- Back to you, Gabby.
For BNN, this is Gabby Babblebrock, reporting live from BASA headquarters.
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- And I feel sorry for her.
Now, listen, we know almost nothing about the Dark Planet.
No one does.
We need to postpone the mission.
I would, but I've already contacted all my sponsors.
Dark Planet Cola!
Destroy your taste buds!
This is 800 percent sugar.
That's what makes it good for kids.
Oh. Hey!
Plus, I've already taken the photos for the new cereal box.
When?
♪ Scorchios ♪
- Just now.
- Scorchios?
- There's a surprise in every box.
- Ah!
- Whoa, I'm pretty good at this.
- OK...
- Come... Come on!
- I could do this all day.
- Whee!
- Knock it off!
- We need to think this through.
- I have.
Someone out there needs my help, and I am going to help them.
OK, but if you go now,
I can't help you help them.
You know, Gary, you're absolutely right.
There's no sense in rushing things.
Why don't you pull up the star charts in the briefing room, and we'll talk about this with the whole team.
You got it, partner.
That should keep him busy.
Let's fire up the ship!
Computer, load all information on the Dark Planet.
JAMES: All right, just a sec.
Scanning files, scanning files...
Here we are. The Dark Planet:
A remote M-class planet located 400 light-years
past the Taurus Molecular Cloud.
A strange and terrifying environment,
the only known world in which evolution is taking place in reverse.
It began with intelligent, attractive beings,
but was soon overrun by ugly, aggressive
and quite terrifying dim-witted creatures.
Yuck. Gross.
JAMES: As you can see, from gentle intelligence to savage stupidity.
They have a strange custom of dividing themselves
into what they call countries, whose boundaries they often dispute,
which causes them to go to war.
The pattern seems to be that the winner of the war then goes into decline
while the loser prospers.
We have also deduced that the people of this planet choose
leaders according to the oddity and profusion of their facial hair.
They worship money, soup, marker pens, something called dental floss
- and this man, whose name is Cowell.
- Oh, terrifying!
JAMES: He's known for his strange accent, being very, very rich,
showing off, wearing glasses indoors.
I like him.
One hundred and six advanced life-forms have landed on the Dark Planet...
- What?
- ...to attempt friendly fairst contact.
Not a single one has returned.
KIP: Uncle Scorch!
Hey, Kipper!
You were awesome out there.
Thanks, pal.
Does your dad know you're here?
I'm supposed to be waiting in his office, but Mission Control is boring.
I know. Isn't it? It's all...
(MIMICS BEEPING BUTTONS)
(LAUGHING) I'm more of an astronaut, like you.
Take me with you this time.
Wow. That sure would upset your dad, which is something I love to do.
But I'll tell you what, Kipper...
If I get into trouble, you come rescue me.
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kip,
Junior Adventurer, at your service!
Junior Adventurer, are you? Hmm.
- Well, what have we here?
- Blast tape!
Ready for a training mission?
OK, we've crash-landed.
We're surrounded by a tribe of slimy, green aliens, and they are closing in on us.
What do you do? You do this! Watch!
- Take that!
- Cool!
- Time to take out the trash!
- Awesome!
Scorch me, baby! (WHOOPS)
Oh, they got me! (GROANS)
- Kipper, it's up to you.
- Wicked!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Astronaut training.
Blast tape?
Kip shouldn't be playing with it.
He shouldn't even be looking at it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
GARY: - Sorry, Barry.
(ALL) Ooh!
- Back to my office.
- See ya, Uncle Scorch.
Scorch...
Mission Control, we've got a mad-dad situation here.
You're darn right I'm mad.
(STAMMERS) Why is this ship on?
Oh! (LAUGHS)
You sent me upstairs so you could rush off to the Dark Planet.
- Yep.
- Ah!
I thought we'd agreed to postpone the launch.
JAMES: Launch in T-minus 30 minutes.
It's too risky to send
Scorch out there. Please.
Drop it, Gary. I'm warning you.
I'm the mission controller.
Does nobody here care what I think?
- No.
- Not really.
- Nope.
- Then why am I even here?
It'll be fine, Gary.
He's done this a hundred times.
We've done this a hundred times.
We're a team.
I'm the brains and you're the brawn.
That's what you always said.
I said it to make you feel better, little brother.
Scorch, stop calling me that.
You've been trying to control me your whole life.
Isn't that why you joined Mission Control?
I'm looking out for you.
That's what brothers do.
Oh, please.
You sit around here pushing buttons while I am out there risking my neck.
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you do it without me.
Any time. Any place.
Little brother.
If you insist on going through with this idiotic macho stunt, you can count me out.
Buh... wai...
You're gonna quit?
Well, you can't quit!
You... you're fired!
You can't fire me.
Because I quit! Humph!
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, space ranger.
KIP: Come on, boy.
Let's go play flisbee.
- You're home early.
- Scorch fired me.
What? He can't fire you.
That's what I said, so I quit.
So you quit after you were fired?
Hey, whose side are you on?
I think someone should lock the two of you in a room until you figure out how to get along.
I hope he gets stranded.
What are you doing, Dad?
Uh... Oh, nothing.
Just working on the old rocket boots.
Cool! Can I help?
Following in your dad's footsteps, eh, Kipper?
Hey! That makes this an official father-son moment!
What's this do?
Whoa! Look out!
Aah! Ah, incoming!
GARY'S WIFE: Gary! Why is there a rocket boot in our bathroom?
ANNOUNCER: This is BNN.
GABBY: We are live as
Scorch Supernova investigates
a mysterious intergalactic cry for help.
Brought to you by Dark Planet Cola.
Dark Planet Cola!
Scorch is stepping off the Supernova-9 now.
Oh boy, is he looking good in that suit.
Mmm.
Oh! Let's go live to the Dark Planet's surface.
This is Scorch Supernova, live from the Dark Planet.
I'm here responding to an intergalactic SOS call,
and on the lookout for helpless victims.
Yeah!
Switching over to remote cams, Gabby.
Wish me luck.
GABBY: Our planet's greatest hero, risking life and limb...
He's so awesome. I'm gonna be just like Uncle Scorch someday.
Well, better have another kid.
- Gary.
- Just what every father wants to hear.
My son wants to be like my dim-witted brother.
Oh, relax. He's excited.
Besides, what could Scorch possibly give your son that you can't?
I dedicate this planet to my nephew, Kip!
I got my own planet? Awesome!
- OK, that's pretty hard to top.
There appears to be a light source coming from a light of some kind.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't do it!
Do not go into the light.
- Going to the light.
KIP: - Wow.
It's so beautiful.
- Oh...
Huh?
A victim! Commencing rescue op.
Greetings! We've heard your call for help and have come to save you.
I am Scorch Supernova.
Strange. On my planet we shake hands, but we can do it your way.
(CHUCKLES) That's humiliating.
Boy, you sure love to wave.
I love it, too, but my arms are getting tired.
- What was that?
What...?
Hmm...
- No!
No! Hang on!
Look at me. Look at me!
Don't you die on me, buddy!
No!
Moving in.
- Scorch!
- We got a blue one!
All he wanted to do was wave!
Peter, Jackson is down!
Man, what is it with aliens and this desolate roadside 7-Eleven?
MAN OVER BULLHORN: Halt! Alien! Do not use your advanced technology against us!
- Marty, Quentin, move it out!
- Scorch me, baby.
- Get out of there!
- Time to take out the trash!
Who's next?
Yeah! Look at him go!
Not now!
Scorch is in real trouble.
Aim for the space-suity thingy!
- Look out!
Uh... uh-oh.
Time to get outta here.
That's not good.
Gary, we better find another way outta here.
Gary?
Scorch.
(MUMBLING) OK, I take...
You know something?
I love you guys.
Welcome to Earth.
Tag him and bag him, boys.
The Baabian Aeronautics and Space Administration have confirmed
that all communications with Scorch Supernova have been severed.
At this point, we can only assume that our planet's greatest hero is...
...is dead?
(SOBBING) I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Oh, no.
- You said you hoped he got stranded.
You wanted this to happen!
I'm sure your father didn't say that.
Did you?
We've gotta get to the Dark Planet and find him!
GARY: Just hang on, Kip.
Come on. Come on, pick up.
Oh, hello, Gary.
I thought you quit.
This is important.
Scorch has been captured.
- We've got it under control.
- Come on!
Dad, Uncle Scorch told me to come rescue him.
- We can be the rescue team.
- Kip!
We're his family.
We need to go save him.
I'm doing everything I can.
You're not doing anything!
- You're talking on the phone!
Go to your room.
Kipper?
Kipper, I know you want to rescue him, and it's very brave of you.
Even though your uncle and I fight sometimes, we're still brothers.
And I will do whatever it takes to get him home, I promise you.
I love you, buddy.
Come on, give us a hug.
- Huh?
Kip? Kip!
Kira! Kip's gone! Kip's gone!
- What?
- The rescue pod.
(GASPS) We've gotta get to BASA before he does.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
We're using the rocket boots.
Are you crazy? The gyroscope is off, the thrust mechanism is broken.
They're not ready to fly.
I spent 15 years as a BASA test pilot.
It's not rocket science.
That's exactly what it is.
They're rocket boots!
Gary, turn off your brain and hang on.
This is staggeringly dangerous!
You're not even in a rocket boot lane!
Look out!
(GRUNTING) - Oh! Ah,
- Sorry!
- This is so emasculating.
- Do you want to drive?
- No, I want to live.
You're actually very good at this!
Look out! Look out! Look out!
- Sorry, Barry!
We're coming, Kipper.
- Where is he?
- Kip! No, Kipper, no!
- Kip, stop!
- Kip, up here!
- Kipper, please!
JAMES: Automated launch in T-minus 60 seconds.
Kip, up here!
Gary, look out.
(GASPS) This is a bad idea.
Mom! Dad! Are you coming?
No, honey, this isn't a game.
(GRUNTS) It's stuck!
KIRA: - Gary, do something!
I'll shut down the launch.
JAMES: Twelve, eleven...
You've chosen Terminate Launch.
- To confirm, say yes.
- Yes.
- You said "banana." Is that correct?
- No.
- You replied "no."
- Gary, hurry up!
Terminate Launch canceled.
GARY: - No! I mean yes!
- Ow!
- Is that a yes or a no?
- No.
- Did you say yes?
- Yes!
- Yes, you said yes, or...?
- Yes! Yes!
It's stuck!
Sorry, Gary. Did you say yes to Terminate Launch?
- Yes!
- Launch terminated.
JAMES: - That was close.
- Oh, Kip, you scared me.
I'm sorry. I promised
Uncle Scorch I'd go save him.
Don't you ever do that again.
No. Kip's right.
Scorch is my brother.
KIRA: - Honey?
- I've gotta go save him.
KIRA: Wait. What are you doing?
JAMES: Excellent.
Launch sequence reengaged.
KIRA: Gary?
- Dad!
- I love you guys!
- Dad!
KIRA: - Gary!
Lena, I need your help.
- Kira!
- Gary was on that pod!
(GASPS) Don't worry.
We'll make contact as soon as he lands.
No, no, no. You have to send someone after him.
I don't have to do anything.
You don't give the orders around here anymore.
Gary will never survive out there alone.
Please, bring my dad back.
Don't worry, little guy.
We're doing everything we can.
What can I do to help?
You're the one who wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.
So why don't you stay at home and let me do my job.
JAMES: Prepare for final approach,
Gary. Fasten your seatbelt.
Huh?
Oh!
(GROANS) I thought this movie was supposed to be in 3-D.
Shh. It is in 3-D.
OK, that's better.
JAMES: - Area 48.
Area 49.
Area 50.
JAMES: - Landing gear deployed.
JAMES: Landing gear destroyed.
JAMES: Please exit with caution, Gary.
Contents may have shifted during the flight.
It's all over the place, isn't it?
OK, OK, don't panic.
Remember your training.
The safest thing to do is wait in your pod.
JAMES: Self-destruct sequence initiated.
What? Self-destruct?
You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.
JAMES: - This one does, Gary.
- This is ridiculous!
JAMES: - Twenty-nine, 28, 27...
- Hey, anybody! Help!
JAMES: Is that your plan, Gary?
Panicking?
- Sixteen, 15...
- Come on!
JAMES: Ticktock, Gary.
Come on. You're running out of time.
- Water landing, monster attack... Aha!
JAMES: - Ten, nine...
- Foolishly trapped inside pod!
- ...eight, seven...
...six, five...
Time to panic.
...three, two...
- ...one. We're toast.
Ah... the technology in this suit is incredible.
- Now open it.
MAN: - Yes, sir.
Yuck!
Blubonium.
Ten thousand times more powerful than atomic energy.
Hey. How'd that get in there?
Oh, you're awake.
(GRUNTS) Let me go! Let me outta here!
Shh. Go back to sleep.
MAN: You're listening to Far-out,
Far-right Hour on C-Dub FM.
Let's go to the phones! Caller?
This is Hawk calling.
I work at 7-Eleven near Area 51, and after years of waiting, it finally happened!
MAN: You had a date with a girl.
What? No. A close-encounter, man!
We looked out the window and this blue dude was standing right there.
(CHUCKLES) - It was awesome.
MAN: - Hawk, Hawk, Hawk, listen to me.
If what you say is true,
they're here for one reason and one reason only: abduction!
- Huh?
It's OK, bro! We're friends.
- What are you doing?
- We gotta make a good impression.
We need a peace offering.
(CHUCKLES) Huh?
It's OK, little guy.
Welcome to Earth, blue buddy.
In an effort to avoid enslavement,
I offer you the finest chilled refreshment known to the human race.
MAN: He likes it!
Of course he likes it.
Where's your brand loyalty, man?
(BOTH) No!
(MUFFLED) You're gonna regret it!
Don't do it!
OK, OK, OK.
Calm down, blue buddy. It's OK.
It's called a brain freeze.
If you're gonna hang with us, you need to learn to sip.
Take him away!
- Put me down!
- Little blue buddy...
Ah!
GARY:
Stop this! Let me out!
Huh?

We hope this has been an informative look at our planet,
and urge you not to seek war against us.
Enjoy your stay here at Area 51.
Let's take a peek into that head of yours.
COMPUTER: Brain scan processing.
- Stupid. Simple. Dimwit. Average.
Smart. Genius. Genius. Genius...
MAN: We got ourselves a real genius!
Shanker's gonna want to meet you.
- Here's the brainiac, sir.
So... you're the genius.
What are you gonna do to me?
Probe me? Dissect me?
- Chop me up and eat me?
- Relax.
I'm a big fan of your work.
Scorch!
What have you done with my brother?
We'll get to him soon enough.
This is your design, isn't it?
How do you know that?
Well, color me impressed.
And I consider myself a connoisseur when it comes to alien technology.
I could use a man with your brain power.
You see, Gary,
I run a work release program.
You work, then I release you.
You are going to make sure my latest project goes off without a hitch.
I'm not doing anything until I see Scorch.
You can whine till you're blue in the face, but I call the shots around here.
- Hmm?
Everyone out, now!
Double-time!
Wait! Wait! We're not finished!
Where's my brother?
Hello, Shanky-panky.
Hello, my darling.
You look ravishing.
Oh, you always say that.
That's because it's true.
- Did you get my present?
- Yes.
- I did.
- So do you like it?
It's... OK.
Pookie, what's wrong?
Nothing, it's fine.
I just... I was expecting more.
Well, that was just a sample.
There's more coming, I promise.
I'm bringing enough so we can rule the universe together.
Hurry, my love.
Gentle, gentle.
Just set me down nice and easy.
Hello? Anyone?
You can't do this! I know my rights!
Ugh.
Hey! Hi there, roomie!
Hey, are you finished with the toilet?
Huh? (GROANS)
I'm Thurman. Pleased to meet you.
Hello. Oh, my goodness.
You're all covered in slime.
- Ugh! You're all dried out.
- Not anymore.
I'm from Zaddlebrok 475.
- Never heard of it.
- You've heard of Zaddlebrok 473.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
- It's two planets over.
Makes sense.
Anyway, you should settle in.
Throw your stuff on the bottom bunk.
I gotta get outta here.
Don't I get a phone call?
Oh, yeah.
A phone call? A big-screen TV?
Egyptian cotton sheets?
- This is Area 51, man. Wake up!
Keep it down!
I'm trying to get some shut-eye.
Oh, I get it.
Shut-eye. You've got one eye.
Are you making fun of my one eye? (ROARS)
Easy, Io. Remember the program.
GROANS: Just stick to the program, stick to the program.
I apologize for my outburst.
My name is lo, and I'm working through some anger issues.
She seems nice.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, great gal. I'm Doc.
- You're a doctor?
- Radio talk show therapist.
Same thing without all the training, credentials or qualifications.
So, Little Boy Blue, you got a name?
Gary. I'm here looking for my brother.
Have you seen him?
What's he look like? Blue like you?
Yes, exactly like me except with huge muscles
and a chiseled jaw and perfect teeth.
OK, so you're the ugly brother.
Oh, well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Oh, it's not a question.
Look, Scorch can bust us out of here.
He's got a ship. He can get us home.
There's only one way out of here.
Invent enough cool stuff and Shanker lets you go.
That's how Area 51 works.
He lures the smartest aliens from across the universe
and throws us in jail.
Take Thurman. He was a professor.
Those four hands invented touchscreen technology.
Or Io. She used to be a librarian.
She got so mad looking stuff up for people
that she invented the search engine.
And most importantly, me.
After my radio show got famous,
I invented social networking.
I've got five billion pending friend requests.
That's how Shanker bankrolls this place.
He rips off our technology and sells it to the world.
He's got deals with everybody.
Apple, Facebook, them Google guys.
You think humans could build this stuff?
I don't think so.
Who do you think invented the Internet?
Cell phones? Computer animation?
We did!
Thank you. I love tech history.
But have you seen my brother?
MAN OVER PA: Attention, aliens. Please report immediately to the cafeteria.
And remember, levitating in the passageways is strictly prohibited.
- What the heck is that?
There is only one creature in the universe that snores that loud.
- Scorch! Scorch! Wake up!
Space hero test today. Didn't study.
- What the...?
Needs a whole salad to sleep.
Ow! Huh? Gary? Hey, Gary!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to rescue you.
You're rescuing me?
(LAUGHS) I'm still dreaming.
I come 15 light-years out of my comfort zone to save you, and this is the thanks I get from my own brother?
Try ex-boss. I fired you.
No, I quit.
And your first mission without me, you wind up in jail.
- And where did you end up? Jail.
You two should make an appointment.
MAN OVER PA: Attention, aliens. Lunch is now being served in the cafeteria.
Please be mindful of the joes as they are unusually sloppy.
The launch station computer will tell us where Daddy is.
Locate Rescue Pod 13.
JAMES: Self-destruct initiated at 2900 hours.
- What?
- Self-destruct?
Play back in-flight camera.
You're a rescue pod!
Rescue pods don't self-destruct.
This is ridiculous!
Dad!
Only Mission Control can destroy a ship.
Somebody here had to give that order.
- Huh?
(WHISPERING) - Quick, get down.
Lena.
Keep still.
LENA: OK, that's good.
- Hurry up and get it loaded.
- You got it, boss.
KIRA: That much Blubonium could blow up the whole galaxy.
- Cool.
- No, no, no, not cool.
Very, very not cool.
We have to tell somebody.
LENA: - Tell somebody what?
KIRA: Lena!
Run!
- Go, Kipper!
- Hey!
Let me go! (GRUNTING)
Hey!
I gave you a chance to go home, sweetie.
You should've taken it.
Little rat got away.
LENA: It doesn't matter, he's just a kid.
- Tie her up and bring her with us.
- Wait! What about Gary?
(CHUCKLES) Gary? That coward?
He's never coming back.
Thank you.
Hit me with some jiggly cubes.
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
Hi, guys. Not sure if you guys are guys. (CHUCKLES)
Or ladies. Either way, no problem.
Those are the Greys.
No one knows what Shank has got on them, but they do his bidding.
So don't get on their bad side, understand?
What's up, eggheads?
Give me two of everything and one more of anything.
(LAUGHS) Hey!
Some things you just can't teach.
Uh, mmm...
What are... what is all this?
We have lots of alien delicacies.
Blorm, Phrebbish, Zumft, diet Zumft, free-range Zumft, non-dairy gluten-free Zumft.
And if you're looking for something a bit more refined, we got fresh plarbe.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Oh, hello.
Hi.
You know what? I'm not hungry.
- Oh. Uh...
- Aliens.
- After you.
Gary! (BURPS)
I've seen a lot of jailbreak movies.
All we need to break out of here is a diversion, a shovel and a blowup dummy of ourselves.
(LAUGHS) It's not that simple, Scorch.
Don't be reckless.
(WHISPERS) And from now on, let's whisper our escape plan.
That's your problem, Gary.
Always wishy-washy, never taking action.
That's what makes me the heroic brother.
You're some hero.
Without me, you're nothing.
Ooh, big words from a computer-loving mama's boy.
No, they're regular-sized words.
You're just too dumb to understand.
Good thing Kip's gonna be a hero like me, not a coward like you.
Ugh! You take that back!
Oh! Nice, Gary. Nice. Real mature.
- Whoa!
- Oh! Right in the kisser!
- Food fight!
We have a food-related disturbance in the cafeteria!
- Get him!
- Stop! Get back here!
- Come here, you little runt!
- How the tables have turned.
- Hey!
Well, that was lucky.
Stop this right now before somebody gets hurt.
All right, that's it.
- Bull's-eye!
DOC: Oh, it's on!
THURMAN: - Ugh! Now you've done it.
- Bruce, look out!
- Willis, run!
People, people, where are your manners?
You're the one talking with your mouth full of yourself.
Do you have to do that now?
Hey, practice makes perfect.
George! Lucas! Let's go!
- It's the fuzz!
- Get 'em!
Christopher! Nolan! On your feet!
Hello, my dear.
- Oh!
- Stop right there!
How dare you slap a commanding officer!
- Ah!
All right, alien...
- Scorch, behind you!
- Nice!
- Thank you.
- Guess who!
Let's get outta here.
Oh, yeah!
Ten-hut!
I'm king of the world!
You missed.
Ooh. I told these guys, "You'd better not food fight," but they did.
I'm gonna sweep this up.
Report to the peace shield, on the double.
DOC: This is the peace shield.
THURMAN: It's an asteroid gun.
Nothing says peace like a giant gun, huh?
It's overkill if you ask me.
But it's America.
They supersize everything.
You guys built this thing?
DOC: Took us almost ten years.
Now we're just waiting for one last piece: the power source.
Then we can go back to our home planets.
- Or sun.
- Or sun.
Seriously? You live on the sun?
Yep. You can't beat the weather.
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, even though you didn't work on it, you've gotta sign the floor.
Anything for a fan.
That's a lot of names.
Where are all those guys?
Shanker's been building this thing for years. He probably let 'em go.
- Get your hands off me.
- You'll never get away with this.
The beauty of it is, I already have.
With Scorch and Gary gone, who's gonna stop me?
Hi-yah!
- What the...?
- Time to take out the trash!
- Kipper, no!
- Scorch me, baby!
Come back here!
- Let my mom go!
(LAUGHS) - "Scorch me, baby."
- You monster!
- Aw, I wish I had my camera.
What a perfect family portrait.
Look alive! General's coming in hot!
Shh. Don't do anything stupid.
Soldiers of Area 51, the final piece of the puzzle has arrived.
(GASPS) That's a Blubonium reactor.
How did he get his hands on it?
Somebody smuggled that thing in my suit.
What's the big deal?
Do you have any idea how powerful that stuff is?
Prepare for test firing.
- You heard the man!
- Go! Go! Go!
My old friend, Halley's Comet.
Not back for another 50 years.
So... who's gonna miss it?
COMPUTER: Targeting Halley's Comet.
Preparing condolence card for Halley's family.
Target acquired.
Hasta la vista, Halley.
- Yeah, baby! It works!
We're going home!
- Yeah!
- Awesome!
Hot diggity!
- This is not good.
- Oh, yeah!
Boom!
Come on, guys, lighten up.
It's party time!
Get down with your bad self!
There's enough Blubonium in that thing to blow up a planet.
Well, are we gonna sit around
"Garying" this to death or are we gonna do something about it? Ha-ha!
- Scorch!
- Are you nuts?
- Put that down, now!
MAN: Get him!
- Ha!
- You're going down!
- James, Cameron, get the alien!
- Scorch me, baby.
MAN: Brace yourself, boys!
SHANKER: Stop him!
MAN: He's walking all over you.
Stop him!
How you like me now?
- No! My reactor!
Whoa!
Get him out of here!
- No, stop!
- Gary, stay out of this!
Bring the little one, too.
THURMAN: You got him right where you want him, Gary!
If you can't fix that reactor, nobody's going home. Ever.
His quiet anger is even angrier than his loud one.
Uh-huh.
You useless blue moron.
Do you realize what you've done?
I saved millions of innocent aliens,
'cause that's what heroes do.
You failed at your evil plans,
'cause that's what villains do.
And this crumb got stuck on my face,
'cause that's what crumbs do.
- Scorch.
- It's OK, Gary.
Do what you want with me.
I'll never help you.
I thought you might say that.
Whoa!
Scorch! No!
- Any last words?
- Yes.
Friends, aliens, countrymen, lend me your tentacles.
Don't think of me as a hero.
Think of me as a guy who acted heroically while full of heroism.
Have you been practicing this?
Gary, tell Gabby I love her.
Tell my fans I love them.
Just as a general rule, if anyone asks, tell them I love them.
Hey, Gary, I love you too, little brother.
- Goodbye, cruel galaxy.
- No!
Huh. Well, looks like
I've got time for a few more.
Tell the guy that waxes my ship... what's his name again?
It doesn't matter.
Just tell him that I love him.
And the people at Dark Planet Cola,
- tell them I love them.
- Stop. We get it.
No. Stop! I'm a BASA engineer.
I can fix the Blubonium.
Don't help him, Gary!
We did the right thing!
- No!
- No! Scorch! Let him go!
As soon as you fix my peace shield.
Oh, and one more thing.
If you tell any of the others about this, I'll freeze you all!
- Get in there, alien.
(CHUCKLES) You got some nerve walking in here after that stunt.
- I... (WHIMPERS)
- Where's your brother?
- Shanker's got him.
- Why'd he let you go?
- Because he thinks I can fix it.
- Can you fix it?
- Of course. I'm a BASA engineer.
Oh, thank goodness.
- But I don't think I should.
- Say what?
- I fix it, we all go home, right?
- Exactly. What's wrong with that?
Shanker ends up with the most powerful weapon in the universe.
So he's got a toy for shooting down asteroids. Big deal.
You saw what it can do.
Who knows what he'll blow up next.
What if it's your planet?
Don't be paranoid, Gary.
It happens to smart people all the time.
You start thinking too much and it gets the best of you.
(GROANS) You guys actually trust Shanker?
- We're kinda low on options here, Gary.
- What choice do we have?
We refuse to fix it.
Then what? Stage a silent protest?
Come on, man!
You want us to be stuck in here forever?
I don't know what to do, OK? Just let me sit down for a second and think!
You mean sit around and do nothing.
Well, we're gonna try to fix it.
Are you coming or not?
You know what? We don't need you.
Come on, Thurman.
- Cut the red wire.
No, no, no! Cut the green wire.
- Scratch that. I'm colorblind.
- Quiet! I need to concentrate.
My third eye, it's messing me up.
I can't do it!
So that's it? Game over?
Step away from the Blubonium.
(LAUGHS) My man!
Thurman, you're fired.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I scored a 12.0 on my galactic engineering exams.
Do you know what that means?
You had no friends in high school?
It means in a galaxy filled with nerds,
I'm their king.
I hope this works.
We're going home!
It's time to pay my parking tickets!
Uh, Gary? Is that normal?
- Come on, Thurman, don't be paranoid.
- OK.
- Whoa!
(ALL CHANTING) - Gary! Gary! Gary...!
Speech, Gary!
Pack your stuff and be ready to go.
I'm going to get my brother back.
- This one was asking for you, sir.
- Leave him with me.
I'm here for my brother.
Ah, Gary... finally a team player.
I did what you asked.
I fixed the reactor.
And just in time.
Imagine how powerful I'll be with all this Blubonium.
- What? How did you...?
- You call yourself intelligent life.
(LAUGHS) These are fun.
- I could do that all day.
Let us go! You got what you wanted!
Why let you go now, only to hunt you down later?
Hunt us down?
But we come in peace.
Nobody comes in peace.
I was six years old when they took my father from me.
Think about this, champ.
With that many stars out there, there just has to be intelligent life.
- Golly! Can I have a look, Pops?
- In a minute, son.
What? What is that?
Good gravy! It's a UFO!
(LAUGHS) Son, you wouldn't believe it!
This is the moment
I've been waiting for my entire...
(ECHOING) No!
Before you join your brother, there's one last thing
I'd like to show you.
Hey, don't ask, don't tell.
Not the hair, you idiot.
- Lena!
- Ugh. Hello, Gary.
I see you've met my fiancé.
- Fiancé?
- We met online.
Get with the times, Gary.
LENA: Your whole family has been meddling in my business.
- Time to say goodbye, Gary.
(GASPS) - Kip! Kira!
Lena, please, he's using you.
He's using all of us. (SCREAMS)
OK, he's just jealous he couldn't have you.
- Hmm?
- Ta-ta.
- How could you do this?
You think I'm actually in love with an alien?
When she leaves your planet with my Blubonium, I'm gonna blow it up.
- But Baab's just the beginning.
I'm gonna wipe out the alien infestation one planet at a time.
If you destroy every planet with intelligent life, you'll have no stars left in the sky.
My stargazing days are over.
Let me out! (GRUNTING)
Hey, congratulations. You're free! Not!
- No, you can't do this!
Please! Let me out of here!
I don't know if you can hear me, but... I'm sorry.
My plan was to get you out of here, not end up frozen beside you.
I failed you. I failed my family.
All the planning in the world doesn't amount to anything without a hero to make it happen.
I tried, brother!
I'm sorry!
Scorch...
(WHISTLES) So that's Gary's wife?
How'd he make that happen?
I know. Isn't he all like...
Oh, Kip, I told you to run.
You shouldn't have come back.
I couldn't leave you, Mom.
A Junior Adventurer never leaves a man behind.
Kipper, this isn't a game.
I know. I'm not a little kid anymore.
That's why I came to rescue you.
And you're very brave, but now we're both stuck in here.
That's because
I'm not done rescuing you.
Blast tape?
You let them catch you.
Mom, I'm gonna need you to be quiet.
- Kip, be careful.
I can't believe we're guarding a lady and a kid.
- It's embarrassing.
- Is this a daycare?
- Here goes nothing.
Hey!
Open the door! Open the door!
Hurry up!
(GRUNTS) Kip, look out!
Uh-oh.
Consider yourselves scorched! (GRUNTS)
(WHISPERING) Come on, we don't have much time.
I've gotta stop that ship.
You go hide in Mission Control and lock that door behind you.
Copy that!
JAMES: This whole villain thing, it's not you.
You know? And the stress is aging you, if I might be...
LENA: Shut up.
Don't you have a mute button?
- It's locked.
Our government thinks asteroids are Earth's biggest threat.
But some of us know better.
The biggest threat to planet Earth?
(WHISPERING) - Global warming.
- Mm-hmm.
- Aliens.
- Oh.
We will wipe out their planets before they come for us.
- Our first target? Planet Baab!
That's Gary's planet!
COMPUTER: Targeting planet Baab.
Target acquired.
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me, sir?
Sorry to interrupt.
Just wondering approximately what time you'll be sending us home.
- Is he really this stupid?
The only place you're going is the freezer.
Oh! I trust there'll be no more outbursts?
IO: - No!
COMPUTER: Danger. System malfunction.
(GRUNTS) Why isn't it working?
Gary?
No! It's a trap!
Shut it down! Shut it down!
- No!
COMPUTER: System overload.
Evacuate! Evacuate!
Seriously. Get out of here.
Everybody, out!
Scram. Gotta go. Uh-oh.
- Ooh!
- They're off! We're free! Whoo!
You're all gonna pay for this!
Freeze the aliens!
SHRIEKS: Io, get up!
It's time to get mad, girl.
- What about the program?
Forget the program!
MAN: - Tasers to full power!
- Yeah! Take that!
That's what you get when you mess with the Doc!
MAN: - Huh?
Uh, guys?
We might wanna get out of here!
Scorch!
Scorch, hey! Come on!
- Scorch!
(GRUNTS) Gary?
Oh, it's good to see you.
- Huh?
- Are you OK?
Of course I am.
Nothing can stop Scorch Supernova.
Whoa!
Ow! I'm having a bit of a leg situation over here.
You're still thawing out.
Gary, I'm too heavy.
Go! Save yourself.
Scorch, I couldn't.
I'm not serious!
Come on, put some back into it!
- Get me outta here!
I'm free!
- Ooh!
- A Snarkbeast.
Don't worry. They look mean, but they're completely harmless.
(LAUGHS) I'm free!
(MUFFLED) I'm not free.
Uh... Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
- Oh, dear.
- Yummy!
- Oh, no!
- I don't think so.
SNARBEAST: Got outta that place!
I'm starving here!
- Let me go!
Oy vey.
- Io!
Come on, now, you saved us.
We couldn't leave you behind.
Us aliens gotta stick together.
Whoa! Hello, talking rat.
Why you gotta disrespect me like that?
Gary, I could kiss your brain!
Destabilizing the Blubonium was brilliant.
I taught him everything he knows.
He's still frozen. Grab a leg.
I'm covered in slime. I can't do this!
Come on!
MAN: They're heading for the elevator.
- Locking it down.
- Leave them.
They're sitting ducks in there.
(LAUGHS) Alpha Team, they're headed your way.
Copy that, sir. All right, boys, set your freezers to ice cold!
Move! Move! Move!
So, Gary, what's the plan when we reach the top?
Uh, just give me a second, let me think.
You'd better think fast.
MAN: Here we go.
- Aliens, come out to play.
- Hmm?
- Huh?
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- I don't see 'em!
- They're not there!
They're gone. Huh?
- Now!
- Whoo-hoo!
Freeze 'em!
- Get 'em!
- Fire!
- Oh! Oh!
- There he goes!
- Find him! Find him!
- I'm out!
I can't believe you talked me into this!
- Shoot him!
- Don't freeze up out...
Hey, Gary, check it out!
The freezing wore off!
Aw, come on!
Huh?
Whoo! Did you see that? I am the man!
(MUFFLED, GRUNTING) - My lips!
- Come on, come on, let's go!
(MUFFLED) Ouch! My lips got stuck!
It's a simple binary lock circuit.
I'll just reconnect the main IC control switch...
Haven't I taught you anything?
- Got it.
- Yes!
- Freedom!
- Nice work, brother.
- Scorch, where's the ship?
Follow me! It's this way!
Actually, it's this way.
JAMES: I get it.
Being the villain can be lonely,
but you're looking for love in all the wrong places.
He's using you.
What's wrong with Zane in Sector 113?
- He's a lovely chap. Just...
LENA: - Shut up already!
Get me Shanker.
What do you want?
I'm kinda busy right now.
What's going on?
What happened to your hair?
Those blue idiots you sent ruined everything.
- Nothing's ruined.
- This is all your fault.
If you screw up this delivery, we're through!
No! I'll make it up to you, please!
- Turn this ship around.
(GASPS) Huh?
Kira? What are you doing here?
Let's go home.
I bet it makes you happy seeing me like this.
No, of course not.
How could I have been so stupid?
He used me.
It's never too late to do the right thing.
You're just like Gary.
So innocent. So naive.
Please! Lena, help me!
It doesn't have to be like this!
You thought you could stop me, didn't you?
Little Miss Housewife saves the day!
You've betrayed your people!
You've betrayed your planet...
...and you're not fit to wear this uniform!
What? You think just 'cause a chick has kids she can't dish it out?
- Pshh.
Computer, reset course to planet Baab.
Hurry up! The ship's down there!
(PANTING) Whoo!
I gotta lay off the burritos.
I cloaked it as one of their spaceships.
Come on!
- Sorry!
- Dude, don't you knock?
Hammer, get out here!
You're never gonna believe this!
Whoa!
- Awesome.
I'm going! I'm going!
Nope! Two down, a hundred to go.
Scorch, which one is it?
Blue buddy, what's up?
My brother cloaked our ship and lost it.
WOMAN: - Close the door! I'm changing!
- Nope! Ha!
No problem.
- False alarm?
- Yeah.
(BOTH) Tornado!
- Tornado?
- Out of my way!
MAN: - Take cover!
- Oh, my God!
- My cooler!
Come on, quick!
Aha! There it is!
Yes!
Hi, honey! I'm home!
- Sweet ride!
- There it is!
Wait! Aren't you going to abduct us?
Uh, we don't really do that.
- They come in peace.
- Awesome.
- Whoa.
- Fly, blue buddy! Fly!
(LAUGHS) - We're going home!
- Yes!
Gary, I love it!
Trashing bad guys, flying spaceships, we might be related after all.
You know, in some strange way,
I'm gonna miss this place.
- I hate this planet!
- We got company!
- Hang on.
(LAUGHS) Yee-haw!
Sweet flying, Gary!
I didn't think you had it in you.
DOC: Nobody panic! I mean nobody else!
I'll panic for all of us. (SCREAMS)
- Ugh!
I don't fly well.
When I feel queasy, I try breathing deeply through my nose.
PILOT: Careful with your warning shots. Shanker wants 'em alive.
(GASPS) Incoming!
- Oh, we're hit!
- Oh... no!
- What's going on?
- The computer's fried!
- Our steering's gone.
DOC: - Oh, no!
Oh, no! I've seen this in a movie!
It does not end well!
Mayday! This is Supernova-9!
We're going down!
(OVER RADIO) Mayday!
I repeat, we're going down!
- We're a dead stick!
- Huh?
This is the Supernova-9!
(GASPS) - What?
- We are going down!
- Dad?
- Kipper!
- Yeah, it's me, Dad!
- Where's Mom?
Put a grown-up on, bud, we're in trouble.
I'm the only one here, Dad.
Kipper, this is serious.
We're going down.
No, you're not. (GRUNTS)
Kip, what are you doing?
Supernova-9, you are go for remote assistance.
(GASPS) OK, Kip, this is just like flying your remote control ship.
What? This is nothing like his remote control ship!
- Just a little to the left.
(SCREAMS) Too much left! Too much left!
We got a student driver?
Every man for himself.
Ah! We're gonna hit that cliff! Pull up!
Take out their engines.
Let's force 'em to land.
DOC: - They're shooting!
- We're not gonna make it!
I've got this, Dad. Trust me.
Pull up! Pull up!
- Three...
GARY: - Pull up!
- Kip?
- ...two...
- Pull up!
...one. (GRUNTS)
Get out! Get out!
- Yes!
- We made it!
(LAUGHS) See ya later, suckers!
- Yes! Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.
Mission Control, that's some good flying.
- I told you, Dad, I got this.
SCORCH: - Way to go, Kipper.
Uncle Scorch?
Everyone is on board and accounted for.
- Hey, guys, say hi to my son.
IO: - Hi!
- What's up, little man?
- Pleased to meet you.
(GASPS) Dad, there's something coming up behind you!
- What?
SINGSONG: Gary,
I'm not finished with you!
- It's Shanker!
He's got my mission suit.
I made some modifications.
You like them?
What's going on?
Why aren't you moving?
We're caught in a tractor beam.
You've gotta get us out of it!
It's not working. We're burning up!
We gotta knock off that tractor beam.
Nice one, Gary.
How do we do that?
We take it out at the source.
(GASPS) You mean go down there?
Be logical, Gary. You're asking me to jump with no chance of survival.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
Gary!
- He made it!
- Come on, Gary!
Get your hands off my brother!
Whoa!
- Scorch, what are you doing?
- We're a team, brother!
- Don't you remember?
- Aah! Help!
Hey, pal, we're having a moment here.
- Ow!
SCORCH: Get your face out of my hand!
Let go of my hair!
SCORCH: Hurry up!
Oh!
I guess this is it.
We were a good team!
You know, I always looked up to you.
- You looked up to me?
- I'm serious.
Great wife, great kid.
I always thought
I could do that one day.
You would've been a great dad.
- Hey, uh, Gary?
- Yeah, brother?
I'm sorry for firing you.
Actually, I quit.
Huh? What the...?
- Gary!
- What...?
(GASPS) You! Thank you.
(BRITISH ACCENT) Don't mention it.
- You can talk?
- Of course.
- Occasionally.
- From time to time.
Why did you save us?
I thought you worked for General Crazy.
At first, we felt bad for squishing his dad.
Turns out he was a psychopathic megalomaniac bent on destroying every known form of intelligent life in the universe.
Who knew?
What are you gonna do with him?
- Can't say.
- It'll give you nightmares.
Huh?
You're gonna pay for this.
I thought I told you, we come in peace!
Ouch! Oh, wow.
- First punch-out?
- Yeah.
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, feels great.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Uh-huh!
That was amazing!
I would've jumped, too, but it looked like you guys had everything under control.
This little guy's great.
- Can we keep him?
- Put me down!
- Let's go home.
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!
Ah, it's good to be home.
Mission Control, bring us in.
KIP: Check your six, Supernova-Q.
- Hiya, honey!
- Kira? How did you...?
That's my wife!
Oh, Gary, how'd you hook that up?
I always thought you were a little...
What does that mean?
Everybody always says that.
- Beats me.
GARY: I've come to expect the unexpected working with Scorch,
but I don't think anything could have prepared me
for working with my family to save our planet.
I guess life's pretty unpredictable after all.
- Yay, Scorch, you're the best!
You're so awesome!
- Yay, Scorch!
I love you, planet Baab!
- Yeah, Scorch!
- Yes!
- Way to go, Scorch!
- You saved us!
(SIGHS) No more hero stuff for a while, OK?
Are you kidding?
I'm never leaving the house again.
- Dad! (LAUGHS)
- We love you, buddy!
Kipper!
Kipper, that was amazing.
We're so proud of you, bud.
You were awesome out there, just like your uncle.
You are gonna be a great astronaut one day.
Maybe even as good as me.
Thanks, Uncle Scorch.
But I'm more of a mission controller.
Like my dad.
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN, coming through!
Oh, it's good to see you!
Gabby Babblebrock, BNN.
Tell us what it's like to be the greatest hero in the universe.
You're gonna have to ask him yourself.
Give it up for my little brother,
Gary Supernova!
Hey, I'm older than him.
(CROWD CHANTING) - Gary! Gary!
- So Gary, we still a team?
(SIGHS) Somebody's gotta watch your back. Little brother.
GARY: That's my brother, Scorch.
He's in trouble, again.
Seventy-two hours later,
he was on the most terrifying mission of his life.
(WHISPERING) Scorch, do you copy?
Yeah, brother. I'm scared to move.
GARY: Remember your training.
You can do this.
- I'm not gonna make it, Gary.
GARY: - Don't say that.
I'll be by your side every step of the way.
My wingman?
Your best man.
(PIPE ORGAN PLAYS
"HERE COMES THE BRIDE")
And do you, Scorch Supernova, take Gabby Babblebrock to be your lawfully wedded wife,
- to have and to hold...
- Oh, lo, are you crying?
No, I just got something in my eye.
Let's never break up, guys.
And do you, Gabby Babblebrock, take Scorch Supernova
- to be your lawfully wedded husband?
- I do.
And so, by the power vested in me by the Intergalactic Association of Radio Talk Show Therapists,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
(ALL) Aww!
Let's party!
- Hey, Scorch, way to go, man!
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Yeah!
(GASPS) No! You're OK!
I can't believe you made it!
Nice to meet you.
(SIGHS) Here we go again.
Yeah! That's it, that's it!
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Come on, Gary.
Well, this is humiliating.
GARY: You know, you don't have to travel millions of light-years
and defeat a deadly intergalactic enemy
to find out that the greatest story of all is right here on your home planet,
with your brother, and your own family.
(LAUGHS) Love you guys!

MAN 1:
Doomed planet.
MAN 2:
Servo cells are out. We're dropping.
MAN 1:
Desperate scientists.
MAN 2: Approaching photosphere.
Increase stabilizers.
MAN 1:
Last hope.
Pressure index, 55 up.
MAN 1:
Kindly couple.
Superman.
MAN 2:
Gravity shields are failing, Dr. Quintum.
We're falling directly into the sun.
When we hit the convection zone, the temperature will reach 40 million degrees.
QUINTUM:
I'm not ready to die just yet.
Pity.
[SCREAMS]
You killed your brother.
- I did.
- That should be impossible.
I genetically engineered you myself.
Your code has been modified by a superior intellect.
- Now I'm a biological time bomb.
QUINTUM: But--
I'm death, courtesy of Lex Luthor.
WOMAN:
How big is it?
From where I'm standing, one can only hope it's proportional.
"Superman saves mission to the sun"?
We don't know that yet, Lois.
I always write Superman stories before they happen.
If you don't know how big the sun is, go away.
It's 333,000 times the size of the Earth.
Uh, uhh-- Uh. Wuh.
I looked it up on my Superman signal watch.
Thanks, Jimmy.
It's like a hundred billion nuclear bombs exploding every second.
You working undercover on a story?
No, why?
MAN: Lex Luthor told the world he'd reformed.
And despite our best efforts, the world believed him.
That's not exactly breaking news, chief.
No, but this is.
Luthor's been investing heavily in water rights.
Kent's boring story.
The devil's in the details, Lombard.
Luthor planned to cash in on a global water shortage...
...a shortage he intended to create by somehow tampering with the sun.
This is tomorrow's front page.
We finally got that son of a bitch.
LUTHOR:
I'm approaching critical mass.
Lex, I just got a call from Media Relations.
The Daily Planet's asking for a comment.
Fusion will occur in 30 seconds.
Are you talking to yourself again?
I'm remote-controlling a weapon.
The signal takes nine minutes to reach the sun.
I have to coordinate my transmissions perfectly.
The sun?
You were released from jail to work for your country, not on your own--
I know I promised not to waste my intellect on elaborate super deathtraps.
I know that.
Magnetic seals are decoupling.
The ship's coming apart.
I'm approaching critical mass.
Somebody help us.
But I looked in the mirror one morning and realized something.
I'm getting older, and he isn't.
Something's gotta be done about that.
Don't you think?
Fusion will occur in 30 seconds.
SUPERMAN:
Not in here, it won't.
Quintum, blow the hatch.
[YELLING]
- Where's that shield coming from?
- It's Superman.
Somehow, he's extending his own bioelectric field.
SUPERMAN:
It seems impossible.
QUINTUM: But it isn't.
You're lifting 200 quintillion tons.
Even allowing for the one-sixth normal gravity...
...here on my moon base, that's three times your record.
I feel like I could do more.
QUINTUM: No doubt, but that's the heaviest apparatus known to man.
Add to that the new super-power you exhibited when you saved me...
...and it's obvious your body is changing radically.
Superman, I'm not sure how to tell you this.
Tell me straight.
Your trip to the sun overexposed your cells to solar radiation...
...more than even your body can metabolize.
I see it, like tiny fireworks beneath my skin.
Your cells are oversaturated with power.
They're bursting from within.
I'm dying.
I'm sorry, Superman.
If I hadn't tried to steal fire from the sun, none of this would have happened.
Don't apologize.
- You couldn't have known.
QUINTUM: But he knew.
It was his plan all along.
Luthor used me to kill you.
We engineer new forms of humanity here for the eventual betterment of mankind.
You're our inspiration, Superman.
And I promise, we'll find a way to save you.
- I need a favor, Dr. Quintum.
- Anything.
My condition. Don't tell anyone, not yet.
There are some things I have to do first.
PERRY:
Great Caesar's ghost!
"Wait," he says.
"Exclusive interview," he says.
If Clark Kent doesn't show up in the next five seconds, he's fired.
Five, four, three...
...two, one.
Hold the presses-- Oop!
Where the hell have you been, Kent?
Uh, working on my suntan?
Freeze. Hands above your head.
Lex Luthor, you are under arrest for attempted murder...
...and crimes against humanity.
By all means, boys, take me away.
He was smiling when they nabbed him.
Said something about friends in high places.
- That does seem odd.
LOIS: The Court of International Justice...
[CRACKING]
...is talking about reinstating the electric chair just for him.
Do you ever think about death, Lois?
LOIS:
Don't be morbid, Smallville.
I'm so sorry.
Idiot. Your boyfriend's an idiot.
How dare you? And he's not my idiot.
Why, thanks, Lois.
I don't know where my self-esteem would be without you.
Alone, in front of the TV.
Come on, Clark.
Thanks for carrying all this stuff.
Lois, there was something
I wanted to tell you.
If it's about the trial coverage, it can wait till tomorrow. I've gotta fly.
Lois, I have something to tell you.
You're Clark Kent?
SUPERMAN:
I'm Clark Kent.
LOIS: Sorry, Superman, but you've got to admit, that's very hard to believe.
All the years I spent trying to prove you were Superman--
SUPERMAN:
You almost had me a couple of times. and you turn around and just tell me?
What happened to that big golden key you used to have?
Didn't think it was secure enough.
ROBOT: Good afternoon, Superman.
May we be of assistance?
Please bring Miss Lane's car inside and repair any damage from the flight.
That key can't be safe.
Why don't you give it a try?
[LOIS GROANS]
I carved it out of a piece of dwarf star material.
It weighs half a million tons.
LOIS:
So you're the only one who can lift it.
I work pretty hard, Lois.
It's important to have someplace private to relax.
How's the water?
LOIS:
Mm. Perfect.
- You're not looking, are you?
- Lois.
Well, to be honest, if the situation were reversed--
I'd never take advantage, Lois.
So is this a date?
I mean, is all this for my birthday, or are we about to get serious here?
Superman?
These are for you.
I picked them on Alpha Centauri IV.
[FLOWERS HUMMING]
They sing.
I didn't know you collected modern art.
SUPERMAN:
Actually, I do, but this is the armory.
I've confiscated some incredibly destructive weapons over the years.
There are things here that can even hurt me, like this Kryptonite laser or this gravity gun.
I hope none of your enemies find out about this place.
They'd do anything to kill you.
That's not a problem, Lois.
My fortress is only for the people closest to me.
Come see my new Time Telescope.
What's it do?
Lets me talk to my descendants in the far future.
That's Kal Kent, the Superman of the 84th century.
We fought the mad god Darkseid in the year 8315.
I'm still working out the bugs...
...but someday, I'll be able to use it to stop threats before they happen.
He looks a little like my dad.
KAL:
-- a thousand warriors, valiant and true.
SUPERMAN:
And this is a Sun-Eater.
I found it wandering in orbit near Jupiter.
Poor thing would have starved.
- Ech. What do you feed him?
- Suns.
Little ones I make here on my Cosmic Anvil.
He's just a baby.
Here you go.
What's in here?
What the hell?
- Lois, stay out of there.
- I didn't mean to.
You can go anywhere in the fortress except for this room.
It's off-limits.
It's not too early for dinner.
Why don't we eat?
What do you think?
I've been restoring it in my spare time.
It's good to have hobbies, I guess.
What are you wearing?
Traditional Kryptonian formalwear.
I made it myself.
Shipbuilding, fashion design.
You're a man of many talents.
I just feel like trying things.
My trip to the sun, it not only tripled my strength...
...it tripled my curiosity, my imagination, my creativity.
Did it triple your honesty?
Is that why you're suddenly telling me the truth about your secret identity?
No, that's not why.
But you are telling the truth.
Yes.
Okay, how do you explain the time
Clark was a witness...
...in the Boss Grimaldi trial and you were his bodyguard?
Batman was standing in for me.
And when Clark presented you with the key to the city...
...that was Batman too?
A robot.
Lois, whenever I misled you, it was for your own protection.
But now I'm telling you the truth.
Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same.
If you're telling me the truth now...
...doesn't that mean you've been lying to me for years?
LOIS: For the first time,
I see our whole freakish relationship...
...in stark black and white.
And I have to ask myself, why would he lie to me?
Thirsty.
All these new powers and his new super-intellect.
What if he's grown tired of his little game...
...fooling people who love him just to feel superior.
What if he's brought me here for some experiment...
...that he's planning in that secret room?
I need a weapon.
It all makes sense now.
He's brought me here to be the mother of a race of super-children.
Can't let that happen.
They'll grow up and lie to everybody.
May I be of service, Miss La-- ?
[LOIS SCREAMS]
He knows I'm here.
Gotta stop him.
God forgive me, I've gotta stop him.
[SUPERMAN GRUNTS]
[SIZZLING]
Huh. Tickles.
What have I done?
For one thing, you've confirmed my suspicion that I'm immune to Kryptonite.
- I'll take that, if you don't mind.
- I don't understand what's happening.
Robot 7 seems to have malfunctioned.
I'll check him out later.
In the meantime, he left the door open while I was synthesizing some chemicals.
They can cause visual distortion and paranoia.
I saw a dissection machine.
A sewing machine, for weaving indestructible thread.
The paranoia should pass momentarily.
I am feeling better.
I'm sorry I kept leaving you alone, but I was making your birthday present.
And it took me longer than I thought to read and memorize...
...the 8 billion characters in your genetic code.
- What are you talking about?
- I guess the surprise is already spoiled.
This serum is keyed to your genetic code.
It will give you powers just like mine for 24 hours...
...without my vulnerability to Kryptonite or red sunlight.
Happy birthday, Lois.
Well?
I feel different. Better.
Is it working?
MAN: Lex Luthor, your insane schemes have endangered the lives...
...of every man, woman and child on this planet.
Before I deliver the verdict of this court...
...do you have anything to say in your defense?
Superman made me do it.
He's the one that should be on trial.
- What?
- Superman on trial?
Order.
Get this farce over with, you pompous, senile toad.
You're an amoral sociopathic predator...
...driven by jealousy, greed and delusions of grandeur.
Alexander Joseph Luthor...
...this court finds you guilty on all counts of crimes against humanity.
- Yes! Justice is served.
- It's about time.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Does the costume I made for you fit?
Only a little better than my own skin.
Funny, I never noticed you taking my measuremen--
[BEEPING]
Ah! What's that noise?
It's Jimmy's signal watch.
And I can already see why he's calling for help.
Sorry, Lois.
The last thing I wanted on your special day was a reptile invasion from the Earth's core.
I'd have felt cheated if there weren't monsters.
Come on, let's save Metropolis.
I think we're a little late.
[PEOPLE GASPING AND SCREAMING]
Metropolis, Krull will eat your children.
How about you eat this?
LOIS:
Ha! Look who it is.
Samson.
Superman. Yo-ho.
[KRULL YELLING]
He won't be bothering Metropolis again for a while.
His lungs just burst. Excuse me.
Always a joy to see you again.
Why are you here, Samson?
I thought you and your no-necked partner were busy time-traveling.
[CRASHING AND GRUNTING]
That we were, fair Lois.
Only your loveliness could tempt me back to this backward century.
SUPERMAN:
Atlas too.
- Why are you here?
- They think this is a singles bar.
Sorry, gentlemen, the lady's with me.
That's the lady's decision, is it not?
That's it.
I propose a challenge of the ages.
We'll each perform a super-feat in the lady's honor.
Yes, and the most incredible feat wins her.
Wins me?
Single girls with brains, beauty and super-powers...
...are rare in any century, Lois.
SAMSON:
My super-feat is obvious.
I defeated Krull in single combat, foiling his war on Metropolis.
And I subdued his entire army.
There doesn't seem to be much left for you to do, Superman.
How about we get these would-be conquerors...
...back to the center of the Earth where they belong?
The subterranosaur people have ever feared...
...and respected you, Superman.
My son will punished be for his crimes.
But Krull speaks of him goaded be into his attack...
...by man Samson.
I suspected as much, Your Highness.
Please allow me to deal with it.
Can you imagine?
A race of dinosaur men who escaped extinction...
...by moving to the center of the Earth.
Come with me, and I'll show you wonders far beyond what you've seen.
A small token of my affection.
The radioactive crown jewels of the Ultrasphinx.
SUPERMAN:
Careful, Lois.
Plutonium-240 is lethal.
Not for the next 24 hours it isn't.
Look, guys, I'm flattered.
But you'd have to go a long way to outdo Superman.
You would spurn my affections for a dalliance with this-- ?
Careful.
If I win your heart...
...I'll make the Titans kneel before you and give testimony to your loveliness.
I'll crush diamonds in my mighty fist and make them into sparkling wine.
Wow.
That's day one.
Lois, a moment, please?
Why are you flirting with them?
Maybe I'm teaching you a lesson for impersonating Clark Kent.
I'm not impersonating Clark Kent,
I am Clark Kent.
Anyway, you can win any contest those losers can dream up.
Why don't you humor me?
It's my birthday.
I don't like you much, Samson.
Trouble always seems to follow you.
What do I have to do to make you keep your hands off of my girl?
I'm a time traveler, and I happen to know she won't be your girl for much longer.
All's fair in love and war.
Anyway, pretty soon, you'll be too busy with your challenge...
...to even think about dating.
Forget it, Samson.
Lois and I are going to a party in Atlantis in less than an hour.
I sincerely doubt it.
What's this, Atlas, part of my birthday surprise?
Since we, uh, borrowed that necklace from the Ultrasphinx...
...he's been hounding us like one of the Furies.
Chasing us throughout time and space.
Legend has it that just before your death...
...you performed the most amazing feats of your career.
Some scholars say that among them, you answered the unanswerable question.
What are you talking about?
The Ultrasphinx is here.
Return what was stolen.
Lois.
ULTRASPHINX:
Halt.
She exists now in a condition of quantum uncertainty.
Both alive and dead.
The universe asks you an unanswerable question.
To answer correctly is life.
Failure to answer correctly is death.
This is my judgment.
You stole that necklace.
Don't you see?
We couldn't fight the Ultrasphinx without help, so we let it chase us here.
But we meant no harm to Lois,
I swear to living Zeus.
And I swear too.
If she dies, you're both going to the Phantom Zone.
Ultrasphinx, let's hear it.
Question:
What happens when the irresistible force meets the immovable object?
They surrender.
Response acceptable.
Superman.
I was alive and dead at the same time.
My God.
It's okay, I've got you.
Come on, we're going dancing.
Wait a minute, what about our contest?
Answering a riddle is hardly what I'd call a feat of strength.
I agree. How about I wrestle you for her?
Or is the mighty Man of Steel a coward?
Even the shield on his chest is yellow.
Okay, that's enough, both of you.
Then we have a deal?
If I win, you both leave the 21st century right now.
I'll be leaving, all right, with the beauteous Lois Lane on my arm.
Not if I beat him first.
I'm sorry, have you two already started?
Today was perfect.
We did everything I ever wanted to do.
You know what I've always wanted to do?
I mean, from the first day we met.
What?
LOIS:
My birthday gift's wearing off.
I can't see radio waves anymore.
I can't hear the stars singing.
I'm tired and sore all over, like I've been dancing all night.
Thanks for letting me spend a day in your world.
You know, I do other things.
I mean, besides being Superman.
You do a great Clark Kent imitation.
You almost had me fooled.
Wait till I tell him about all this.
Lois?
[CLEARS THROAT]
I was aware of your lumbering presence, Kent.
Just finishing work on my Bibliobot, a roving library.
Read A Tale of Two Cities.
BIBLIOBOT:
It was the best of times, it was the--
Call it off.
- It was the age of wisdom--
- Watch your step, you clumsy ox.
You write like a poet, but you move like a landslide.
I'm sure I had my dignity when I came in here.
Your clumsiness appears to have saved me from electrocution.
Albeit temporarily.
Probably my rubber-soled shoes.
I saw that "Da Vinci of Crime" headline.
It seems like a compliment, but there's a sneer behind it.
Reporters don't write the headlines to their stories, Lex.
Hmm.
You coming, Kent?
He sickens me.
That insipid boyish grin, the smug self-regard.
Tell the truth.
Doesn't his very existence diminish you?
Diminish us all?
Our jobs don't really overlap.
What are you writing about me?
Give me that.
Code? I'll decipher it in less than a minute.
- I--
- It's shorthand, Lex.
What kind of ridiculous affectation is that for a man?
Can you imagine a better world, Kent?
That's all I've ever asked.
In a world without Superman, the unattainable Lois Lane...
...might have noticed good old Clark, pining away in the corner.
You keep talking about me, but I'm here to interview you.
I'm just saying.
A strapping farm boy with brains, integrity, no discernible style of his own?
You're a prize catch for a cynical city girl.
Why haven't you filed an appeal?
But with him around, you're a parody of a man.
A dullard, a cripple.
Next to Superman, even Lex Luthor's greatness is overshadowed.
Are you trying to intimidate me?
I'm trying to educate you.
We all fall short of his sickening inhuman perfection.
Feel that, Kent.
Real muscle.
Not the gift of alien biochemistry.
The product of hard work.
You don't really act like a man facing the end of his life.
No, I don't.
So how's Superman these days?
Pale? Tired?
- Weak?
- He seems fine.
Ah. But he's not.
[BUZZES]
What would you do if you had his powers?
- Help people.
- You probably would.
You lack the imagination to see the alternatives.
Alternatives?
To truth, justice and all the other things you can't weigh or measure.
To every abstract notion he personifies.
PARASITE:
I'll kill you, Luthor.
Suck you dry.
Kill you.
You don't scare me, Parasite.
Brain beats brawn every time.
That glass isn't leaded.
Power.
More power than I ever had.
Look out.
[THUDDING]
MAN 1:
What the-- ?
Find the power.
[BEEPING]
MAN 2:
Fire.
Get them.
Gotta get away from him.
What's the matter, Kent?
Afraid he'll absorb your cowardice?
- Come on!
- Get them!
Let's go!
MAN 3:
Incoming!
PARASITE:
Find the power.
That's tear gas, you idiot.
There you are.
If you wanna survive this, stay with me.
MAN 4: Get them.
- Run.
MAN 5: Yeah, let's go.
MAN 4: Come on.
I should have left you to those animals,
Kent, but I need you alive.
I need you to tell my story.
The story of a man who refused to bend his knee to the alien invader.
Look out, he's coming right at us.
Power, like the sun.
That won't stop him, he's absorbing the kinetic energy of the bullets.
Pray to Einstein for a miracle, Kent.
Earthquake.
Attack me?
You know what happens when you take on Lex Luthor?
[GUN CLICKS]
The same thing that's gonna happen to Superman.
I've always liked you, Kent.
You're humble, modest, comically uncoordinated.
Human.
In short, you're everything he's not.
I'm going to give you a present.
Did you know that Moby-Dick can be recited at a frequency so high...
...that it becomes a sonic drill capable of carving through solid rock?
BIBLIOBOT:
Call me Ishmael.
[SPEAKING MORE QUICKLY] Some years ago, never mind how long precisely...
[BIBLIOBOT WHIRRING]
Stop.
[WHIRRING STOPS]
You can escape any time you want.
I don't want.
I'm going to the chair fulfilled, knowing that I killed Superman.
Poisoned him with an overdose...
...of the same solar rays that give him his powers.
You can't prove any of this.
It's the truth, Kent.
My gift to you.
He doesn't want the world to know he's dying, of course.
So break the news gently.
A tasteful 140-point headline should suffice.
This is as far as I go.
My lovely niece, Nasthalthia, will take you the rest of the way.
Mr. Kent.
She's 18, speaks 30 languages and aspires to someday rule the world.
I may let her, after I'm done with it.
It's such a waste. You and Superman could have been friends...
...and instead you're going to die.
Ah, but he'll die first.
NASTHALTHIA:
Where to now, Mr. Kent?
CLARK:
Deep space.
Why?
Do you know what this is?
It's the bottle city of Kandor.
One of your enemies stole it from Krypton, before it exploded.
Brainiac. He used his technology to miniaturize the greatest city...
...of my home world.
I've been trying to restore the thousands of people who live there...
...to regular size.
You've found a way.
No.
But I have found a suitable planet for them to colonize.
And I'm taking them there.
The thing is, it's very far away.
Even under normal circumstances...
...it would take me three weeks to fly there and back.
In my current condition, it'll take longer than that.
Maybe longer than I have.
I don't understand.
It's what I've been keeping from you.
I'm dying, Lois.
You won't die.
You'll find a way out of this.
We'll be together. Our children will go flying in Metropolis Park.
Promise me.
We can't have children.
Our biology is too different.
Whatever happens, we'll never have more than this.
What do you always say?
"There's always a way."
I'm sorry, Lois.
The work doesn't stop just because I'm dying.
Take your people to their new home.
When you get back,
I'll be right here waiting.
Look, up in the sky.
Sorry if I startled you.
It's been a long trip and I'm feeling a bit under the weather.
What happened to Metropolis?
PERRY:
Great Caesar's ghost.
Kent, where have you been for the last two months?
I went to your funeral.
I was accidentally buried underneath
Stryker's Island during the prison riot.
Lucky for me, there was a fully stocked bomb shelter down there.
To make a long story short,
Superman heard me calling for help--
Superman's alive? I knew it.
Has he seen this?
Refreshing.
LILO:
And beautiful.
BAR-EL: A fitting spot for the capital of new Krypton.
I think we could just as easily clear the apes out of Metropolis...
...and build there.
If you prefer, my love.
SUPERMAN:
Hello there.
- Did you hear something?
- The wind?
Bar-El and Lilo. I just read all about you.
Astronauts from Krypton who were lost in space for decades.
It's an honor to meet you,
I'm from Krypton too.
We know who you are, Superman.
We found Earth by tracking the warp signature...
...of the vessel that brought you here.
I don't know why you bothered to return.
This planet's my home, I was raised here.
But my Kryptonian name is Kal-El.
I'm the son of Jor-El.
We're probably related.
I remember Jor-El. A weak man.
An ineffectual dreamer.
The son follows the father.
You could have built a new Krypton in this squalor.
I don't have any right to impose my will over--
You just moved into my fortress?
LILO:
Shouldn't have left the key lying around.
BAR-EL:
We had every right.
The powers that we gain from this world's yellow sun.
The superiority of our Kryptonian culture.
LILO: You were remiss not taking similar liberties with the rest of the planet.
You tore down the statue of my parents.
We celebrate the life of Krypton, not her death.
This whole place reeks of morbidity.
Even Krypton's criminally insane, forever trapped in the Phantom Zone...
...evidence more nobility than the best of the human apes.
You should be ashamed.
I was thinking maybe you could replace me after I'm gone...
...but you don't have the best interests of this planet's people at heart.
And this is you puffing up your chest at me, is it?
You've gone native.
It's disgusting.
[SUPERMAN GRUNTING]
[GROANING]
You've broken the moon.
I think you looked better in the dress.
I didn't realize Kryptonian fashion was so popular.
Kryptonian everything.
It's a new world, Mr. Kent.
I know you're behind me, Steve.
So whatever you're doing, just sto-- Ah!
[LAUGHING]
I missed you, Kent. You're comedy gold.
Your hairpiece is on fire.
I don't wear a-- Ah!
That's gotta be a little embarrassing.
So this is where Superman hides.
It's worse than I'd thought.
You choose to disguise your greatness...
...and cavort with the apes as one of their own.
Have you no dignity?
I'm loaded with dignity.
I can see how you'd make the mistake...
...but, despite this great bod,
I'm not Superman.
Call Superman with your signal watch.
- Where are you going?
- Nosebleed.
Enough.
This degrading impersonation will cease.
- Reveal your Kryptonian colors or--
LILO: Bar-El.
I feel so-- Uh.
No.
I've got her.
BAR-EL:
Take your naked hands away from her.
I can't fly.
I'm so weak. Why do I feel so weak?
You said you retraced the path my ship took to get to Earth.
That means you passed through
Krypton's debris field.
The minerals in your bodies have been slowly turning to Kryptonite.
I don't need help. Not from you.
LILO:
Bar-El.
I can't see.
SUPERMAN: I've done what I can to make her comfortable.
But I can't neutralize the Kryptonite in your bodies.
Not in time.
After everything we've done, you still show us kindness.
My Earth parents taught me forgiveness.
Humanity has a lot to teach us.
Perhaps.
Kal-El, son of Krypton,
I'm proud to call you my kin.
Our greatness lives on in you.
SUPERMAN:
We don't have much time.
There's a way to save us both.
Surely you've thought of it.
Yes.
But it has to be your choice.
I'll try to find a way to cure you.
But your own time is short.
Do what you must.
Send us to the Phantom Zone.
Forgiveness.
You win, Luthor.
I'm dying.
The world is yours...
...at least for the three weeks you have left before they execute you.
So here's a challenge.
All the things you said you would have done to benefit humanity...
...if I hadn't been in your way?
Now's the time to prove it.
Lex, I know there's good in you.
You showed me everything
I needed to know...
...so I could go on without you.
I just hope I've shown them the same.
MARTHA:
Clark?
You weren't going to sneak in and out without visiting your mother?
Of course not.
I just wanted to leave a flower.
It's Kryptonian, it'll never wither.
You look thin. Are you sick?
Ma, I'm Superman.
And I'm your mother.
You take better care of yourself.
Yes, ma'am.
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.
But his spirit is always with us.
So you have time to eat, or do you have to go save the world?
I love you, Ma.
I love you too, son.
Ah.
Through this holy anointing...
...may the Lord, in his love and mercy, help you--
Get away from me, Padre.
You stink of the irrational.
Typical.
Superman doesn't even bother to show.
I'd planned for him to be here to see this.
I'm sure he'll hear all about it.
[LAUGHING]
LUTHOR: You knuckle-dragging morons.
It was almost too easy.
My last request?
That cocktail was a 24-hour super-power serum.
[OFFICER YELLING]
[GUN CLICKS EMPTY]
My turn.
ROBOT: I'd be pleased to clean the Sun-Eater's pen for you, Superman.
Just my way of saying goodbye to the little fella.
He might be one of the most dangerous creatures in the universe...
...but I'm still going to, mm...
- ...miss him.
- Are you all right?
SUPERMAN:
Superman's journal, final entry.
My cells are breaking down at an alarming rate.
I'm running out of time.
I have few regrets.
My life has been a wonder.
I've traveled across space and time, seen and done things beyond imagination.
I had parents who loved me, good friends like Pete, Lana and Jimmy.
I got to help people, while living an incredible adventure.
I loved a good woman.
And she loved me back.
I'm tired.
But I still have one more job to do.
[GUNFIRE ON TV]
[THUDDING]
That was uncalled-for.
Couldn't resist.
I've got his super-powers for 24 hours, courtesy of a serum he created.
- How?
- His fortress is less than entirely secure.
NASTHALTHIA:
Cool. When do I get my super-powers?
LUTHOR: The same day that I can trust you with the car keys.
On your feet.
I've set the scum on Stryker's free.
They'll keep the police busy with their rioting.
And so will you.
Remote control for my terror weapons.
Have fun.
If you have all his powers, why bother with all this?
You wouldn't ask if you'd ever seen him in a fight.
And I have fought him plenty.
That's why I've made arrangements for a little extra insurance.
Unlike me, Superman loses his powers under red sunlight, right?
Friends in high places.
SOLARIS:
Where is Superman?
Do you fear the tyrant sun?
Face the scourge of worlds.
SUPERMAN: Luthor's secret ally has finally revealed himself.
My last adventure is about to begin.
This is Superman, signing out.
ROBOT:
You will not stand alone.
One of us will remain behind, to maintain your fortress for posterity.
The rest of us will fight by your side.
I couldn't ask for greater loyalty.
Solaris is a living solar computer.
He poisons healthy stars, making them emit blue light that he can metabolize.
Set your receivers to 430 terahertz, and you'll be able to hear him.
SOLARIS:
Impossible, I made your sun red.
You should have no powers.
I see now.
Your covering protects you from red sunlight.
But it cannot long survive this heat.
It should work long enough for me to take care of you.
SOLARIS:
No, your sun is dying...
...but I kill you first.
Stop this.
Whatever Luthor offered you, he'll betray you.
SOLARIS:
I betray Luthor first.
I will eat your sun, and replace it in the sky.
Your people will pray to me, or die in the cold dark.
- Save yourselves.
ROBOT: No.
Solaris overrode Robot 7's program.
Robot 7 stole super-serum for Luthor.
Robot 7 must atone.
Forgive me.
SOLARIS:
What is this?!
The natural enemy of a rogue sun.
Meet my pet Sun-Eater.
SOLARIS:
Abomination! Ohhh!
Give up, Solaris.
You can't beat him, there's no need--
You killed him.
[SOLARIS YELLING]
LOIS:
The sky's normal again.
Superman must have--
Get out of the car, Miss Lane.
Everybody, now.
NASTHALTHIA:
Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, right?
You two are so postmortem.
SOLARIS:
Mercy.
I don't think I have any left.
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't vaporize you.
The front-page story we're gonna write about you for tomorrow's Daily Planet?
Hmm.
Kent, what's the matter with you?
You look like hell.
CLARK:
I saw the whole thing, Perry.
I've got tomorrow's big story.
Just finished it.
Clark.
- He's not breathing.
- No.
STEVE:
He doesn't have a heartbeat, Lois.
MAN:
Look at that.
He's the least of your worries.
PERRY:
You get the hell out of here, Luthor!
That's no way to talk to the future savior of the Earth.
Who, by the way, you sent to the electric chair.
The truth sent you to the chair.
I don't believe in truth.
You can't measure it or hold it in your hands.
I mean, what is truth?
Lex, stop it.
I know what the power's like.
It's intoxicating, but there's more to it.
Use those super-senses.
Just think for a minute.
You can stop trying to stall me.
Ah!
And you won't be needing that infuriating signal watch any longer.
Superman won't be coming to the rescue.
Too bad, because without him, we're screwed.
Look at these pictures from our
Singapore desk, the sun is turning blue.
Don't you get it? Solaris double-crossed you and poisoned the sun.
You vain, stupid little man.
Stupid?
[YELLING]
Lois.
Anyone else feel like acting out against the most powerful man on Earth?
CLARK:
I do.
What are you trying to hide from me?
Gravity gun.
Clark?
I told you, Lois.
Superman.
Did you ever think that it would end like this?
Me looking down on you?
SUPERMAN: Actually, I had the whole thing figured to end pretty much exactly like this.
I've been on to you since Robot 7 first malfunctioned.
Hard to stay in the air?
I just increased your personal gravity 500 times.
That's not why I used the gravity gun, I--
No.
If I die, you die first.
[SUPERMAN YELLING]
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING]
[SIREN WAILING]
Look.
Welcome to the new world.
Lay down your weapons and you won't be hurt.
I'll be moving into the White House later today.
I'll make my formal declaration then.
NASTHALTHIA:
Ooh.
Can we have a show trial before we put these traitors to death?
- Are you okay?
- Better than okay.
I can see the entire electromagnetic spectrum...
...and those must be atoms, little clouds of possibility.
Einstein couldn't connect the gravitational force to the other three...
...but if he could have seen this...
It's so obvious.
Uncle Lex?
The fundamental forces are yoked by consciousness.
Everything's connected.
Everyone.
And this is how he sees things all the time.
Every day.
I don't know if I should be worried or mortified.
It's a cruel joke.
The mechanistic clockwork of reality...
...hinging on a precious impossible defiance of entropy, on life.
And the clockwork doesn't care.
It's like-- Like it's all just us, in here together.
We're all we've got.
You are embarrassing me beyond therapy.
SUPERMAN:
You'll have to forgive him, Nasthalthia.
He just figured out how everything works.
Gravity warps time.
Superman trapped me in a relativistic conundrum.
He's trying to say his 24 hours of super-powers just ran out.
But it's only been a couple of hours.
Relative to us.
The gravity gun sped up his clock a little.
You think I didn't make more of the-- ?
Looking for this?
Give it back. I saw everything.
I saw how to save the world.
I could have made everyone see.
If it wasn't for you,
I could have saved the world.
If it had mattered to you, Luthor...
...you could have saved the world years ago.
You're right.
Oh, your poor face.
No one can repair the sun but me, Lois.
I'm turning into pure energy...
...and I only have one chance to save the world.
That's all you've ever needed.
I love you, Lois Lane...
...until the end of time.
Are you sure you don't wanna speak at the memorial service?
Thousands of people are there paying their respects.
He's not dead.
He's up there fixing the sun.
And when he's done, he'll be back.
And I'll be here waiting for him.
Doomed planet.
Desperate scientists.
Last hope.
Kindly couple.
Superman.
QUINTUM:
We all know the story, Luthor.
Why did you ask to see me?
If this is an escape attempt--
I'd already be free.
No, I've already accepted my imminent execution.
This is a confession.
Forgive me, doctor, for I have sinned.
A lot.
You killed him.
And my deathbed claims that I've seen the error of my ways can't change that.
But there is one thing that I can do to honor his memory.
QUINTUM:
"A-A-C-C-A-T-T-A"...
- Is that-- ?
- A map of Superman's genetic code.
I reverse-engineered it from his 24-hour super-serum.
I also finally figured out how to replicate it.
No.
Of course, it will require an ovum from a healthy human woman.
They always said they wanted children.
LOIS:
He's not dead.
He's up there fixing the sun.
And when he's done, he'll be back.
This blade has a dark past.
It has shed much innocent blood.
You're a fool for traveling alone, so completely unprepared.
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.
Thank you.
So...
What brings you to the land of the gatekeepers?
I'm searching for someone.
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?
A dragon.
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.
I've been alone for as long as I can remember.
We're almost done. Shhh...
Hey, sit still.
Good night, Scales.
Get him, Scales! Come on!
Scales?
Yeah! Come on!
Scales!
I have failed.
You've only failed to see...
These are dragon lands, Sintel.
You are closer than you know.
Scales!
Scales?
Scales...
- Who is it?
- Room service.
Ls it eggs?
I don't know, sir. I didn't order it.
You want some water with that?
No, no. No, I don't.
Looks like you had a night.
They look perfect.
Get out.
I intended to bring that to the attention of a member of staff.
I had some difficulty getting it to open.
It's the little key on the door key, sir.
Right.
I was looking for some nuts.
I tend to avoid alcohol.
When I can.
I don't speak Spanish.
Cuatro cincuenta. No change.
No, no, no, no, you're not listening.
I said the Pirates, not the Yankees.
It's going to be Roberto's year, I'm telling you.
Looking for Mr. Lotterman.
End of the room.
No, no, the Pirates.
You guys are going to be all over.
It's Roberto Clemente, man.
And by the way, I want to talk about...
Not now!
He's having the Friday crisis.
- You Kemp?
- Yeah.
He was expecting you yesterday.
We had some weather.
Yeah, I heard.
Big snow in New York.
He's still on a call. You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
What's all the fuss out front?
You came in the front?
We don't use that door.
Not when losjibaros pitch up.
What do they want?
I don't know.
Some fucked idea of a living wage.
They've been out there on and off for months.
By the way, my name's Sala.
Bob Sala, staff photographer.
Pleased to meet you, Bob.
Yeah.
He's off.
You might want to try another subservient knock.
Yeah.
Kemp.
Don't notice the wig.
Yeah. What?
If you're who I think you are, you better sit down.
You find it a little bright in here?
I'd take them off, but I have a medical condition.
What do you mean, you're blind?
Conjunctivitis, sir.
The old red eye, huh?
You arrive at a very, very trying time, Mr. Kemp.
One of those days stacking up.
So, why don't we cut through the niceties and just get right to it, huh?
That's how I like to proceed.
Okay. Your resume here.
Very impressive CV.
Yeah.
You worked your way up some interesting titles.
I really like the "fluent Spanish."
Wow.
This CV is a bunch of bullshit.
Ls it?
This is two days on the wire.
A day dead. We don't have it.
What is the matter with Moburg?
He's about as useful as a dug-up body.
You see, the problem with this newspaper, Mr. Kemp, is that I am among many who don't enjoy reading it.
We have an ailing circulation, and I just have to look around this building to understand why.
Lack of commitment and too much self-indulgence.
So what I'm looking for is some enthusiasm, some energy, some fresh blood.
And the question that I'm asking myself is how much alcohol is usual in yours.
My fresh blood?
How much do you drink?
I suppose at the upper end of "social."
I'm poised to give up.
Well, Puerto Rico may not be the best place on Earth to do that.
Don't look so anxious, Mr. Kemp.
I wouldn't have paid for your hotel if I hadn't already hired you.
But this is not the Last Chance Saloon, and I do not need another heavy drinker.
Which I perceive, from the condition of eyeballs behind glasses, that you might very well qualify as.
This is a medical condition, Mr. Lotterman.
I know it might look like something else, but this is a...
Looks like a fuckin' hangover.
Does it?
Come here.
That's the kind of commitment I like to see in a man.
Determination, balanced with appropriate humanity.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Which side do you dress, Kemp?
I beg your pardon?
Politics.
I kind of hang in the middle.
This is a schizoid society, Kemp.
They got two languages, two flags, two loyalties, two anthems.
We bring them stuff they never had.
They either hate it or they want more of it.
It's a reluctant part of America.
It's like an England with tropical fruit.
Bob.
Just the man I wanted to see.
This is Paul Kemp.
He's joining us from New York.
Yeah, yeah, we already met.
That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.
And this is Mr. Hubert, accounting.
Listen, do me a favor, will you?
Show him around, the dos and don'ts.
Introduce him to some of the guys.
I'll take him up to Al's.
The hell you will.
You take him to the library.
You pull out some volumes.
I want him to get a sense of the paper.
You know, make some notes, go back a few years, paying particular attention to bowling alleys.
There's bowling and bowling alleys.
Very big here. They're up like mushrooms.
A new one premieres every week.
- Been to Puerto Rico before?
- No.
You're going to fall right into it.
There's a boom on here, Kemp.
It's an open door.
You play it right, you can surf the place.
What do you know about horoscopes?
Nothing.
Well, if I can write one, you can.
So it's every day with a special "Star's Star" featured Saturday with Betty Grable and Neil Sedaka, things like that.
So here, everything you need is right there.
It's called "Madam La Zonga Predicts."
What happened to Madam La Zonga?
He got canceled.
What do you mean, fired?
They raped him to death.
They raped him to death?
There are very few places on this island
I decline to visit, but the toilets frequented by sailors on the west side of Candado Pier is one.
They raped him to death?
La Zonga died in a cubicle.
Say, you're not artistic, are you, Kemp?
Oh, no.
You might want to rethink those menthol cigarettes.
They don't do a thing for you.
Come by the house.
I will.
I like your stuff.
The cuttings you sent to Lotterman.
It's good writing.
Thanks.
We'll talk.
One more floor!
They put in automated packing machines about six months ago.
They mechanized almost everything.
There used to be 50 guys down here.
Now there's five.
Hence happiness in the street.
Souvenir, day one.
Here's to pretty women with filthy thoughts.
- Want a burger?
- No.
- Burger?
- No, thanks.
Try it. Dos.
So how was the induction?
Somewhat fraught.
No disrespect, Paul, but he didn't have a lot of choice.
You know how many people applied for the job?
One. You.
Ls that right?
Even then, I thought I'd blown it.
Zeroed in on my weakest spot.
Which is what?
Two and a half unpublished novels and references of equal fiction.
You're a novelist.
In a manner of speaking.
Can't even get read.
So I figured I'd do some words for money, see how it's looking in a year or two.
At El Star?
Hate to tell you this on the way in, but this publication's on its way out.
And as far as I'm concerned, it can't come soon enough.
Not going to happen.
You like a little vonga on that?
I'll give you 1 3 to 2 this thing's over by June.
They're going to cut the cord.
Then why put in all the new machinery?
Precisely my point, and he can't answer it.
Well, like I'm tired of arguing the obvious.
Come on. Let's eat.
Now, I got to go and see a man about a horse.
Good to meet you, Paul.
Another night unfolds over Old San Juan.
You been here long?
Too long.
This place is like someone you fucked and they're still under you.
Why don't you quit?
Life's full of exits.
Because I'm waiting for it to collapse so I get the payoff.
Three grand redundancy puts me in Mexico.
Don't look left.
That's an introduction you don't want to have.
Who's he?
Living example of everything that's wrong with this paper.
His name's Moburg.
Our Crime and Religious Affairs correspondent.
Lotterman can't fire him because he never sees him.
He's rarely out in daylight.
Looks like he enjoys a drink.
The entire substructure of his brain is eaten away with rum.
I'm telling you, this enterprise is doomed.
There's maybe three or four professionals in the building running the entire show.
Wait a minute. Who is Hal Sanderson?
In the library. Who's he?
He used to work for the paper.
Now he's what he says he is.
A PR consultant.
Selling this place street by street to the Yankees.
Keeps a greasy little bastard of a contact called Segurra.
I saw him. We didn't meet.
Wouldn't bother.
Piss on the make.
The boy, Segurra, is at the property wickedness.
I'm not sure where Sanderson fits.
But Sanderson's worth cultivation.
He's got some good connections.
He's good for some freelance.
This place is depressing me beyond belief tonight.
You're at Plage Xanadu, right?
Come on. I'll give you a ride.
I was thinking, if you need somewhere,
I got a room for rent.
Not the best address in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.
60 a month.
Sounds inviting. I might remention that.
Meanwhile, bleed it dry.
Sir...
I was hoping for a swim.
The pool is closed tonight.
Really? Why? What's going on?
It's a Union Carbide party.
It's a private function.
Sorry.
I didn't realize anyone was there.
I thought it was just floating.
Lt is just floating.
You doing what I'm doing?
I don't think so.
What are you doing?
Escaping the dreadful party.
I just snuck out and unzipped.
Well, that's very courageous of you.
I thought maybe you were a mermaid.
They tell me the coast is infested with them.
I'm from Connecticut.
My boyfriend's making a speech.
Takes exactly 21 minutes.
Well, then I guess it's pointless, me inviting you for a drink.
What you got?
No, I mean at the bar.
Pointless.
I'd better go before they wonder where I went.
Wait a minute. What's your name?
Let's keep that a secret.
I don't even know it.
Well, then you'll keep it even better.
What about your star sign?
I'm an experienced astronomer.
Could try Pisces.
The fish.
Oh, God.
Why did she have to happen?
Just when I was doing so good without her.
What would you say you like most about Puerto Rico?
The bowling alleys and the casinos.
Course, she likes the duty free.
Well, the more you spend, the more you save.
Have you seen a lot of the island?
We don't leave the hotel.
Lt isn't safe.
But you're having fun?
Oh, yeah! A lotta, lotta fun!
Have some fun with a fucking Luger.
These alleys are magnets to the glutton.
They come off the boats like locusts.
Beasts of obesity.
Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow.
The great whites.
Probably the most dangerous creatures on Earth.
There's your baby.
Walt and his woman.
Bowling alleys isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Tread it till the snow melts, then join the exodus.
Red light!
Looking for Kemp.
Too many adjectives, too much cynicism.
Nobody wants what's wrong with the place, they want to read about what's right.
- It's a rewrite.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.
And while you're at it, you might want to rewrite the title and call it
"Ten Things That I Love About Puerto Rico."
So, how's the sobriety coming along?
I'm cutting down.
By that,
I assume you mean the size of the bottles.
How does anybody drink 1 61 miniatures?
You're averaging 93 miniatures a week.
What, do they stock the place four times a day?
Are they not complimentary?
No, Mr. Kemp, they are not.
And neither is wine and long-distance phone calls.
So, as of Monday, you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.
And what exactly brings you into the building?
Don't hazel me.
I got the X-rays back.
I got less than a week to live.
Hazel you? What are you talking about, you Swedish twerp?
You know, it may have crossed what's left of your mind that I have a newspaper to run here, that we have something called news going on out there.
But as far as you're concerned,
I might as well look out of the fuckin' window!
What are you doing here?
This is a newspaper.
There's nothing here for you.
Two of the best scoops you ever had came out of my brain.
And you better moderate your language or I'll go elsewhere.
Elsewhere where?
You couldn't get work as a fly repellent.
You're worthless, Moburg.
The last onion in the jar.
Don't push me, Lotterman.
I'm dangerous when pushed.
I know why you're here.
It's payday.
But in your case, deferred on a permanent basis.
You're fired!
You can't fire me.
You owe me money.
And you better pay it, or I'll come through the roof and turn this place into an insurance claim.
Are you threatening me?
Hey, guys, let's take it easy.
You want to suffer some voodoo?
You twerp!
Eat the death pill, Lotterman!
Come on, we're walking.
Did you hear what he said to me?
This guy's my blood pressure.
This guy's going to kill me.
And I want the negative of that picture destroyed!
I don't want that animal in this building again.
He is hygienically unacceptable.
Did you see the side of his nose?
Blackheads like Braille.
They should have him put down.
Moburg is history.
He's out of here at the earliest opportunity.
And the earliest opportunity is you.
You understand what I'm saying, Kemp?
I think I get the drift.
I want you to immerse yourself into this paper,
'cause you got the talent and I think you got the will.
You make it grow and you grow right along with it.
I'm not best placed to do that.
You think it's my intention to keep you on horoscopes and rewrites and bowling alleys?
Matter of fact, I'm gonna move you right now.
Take a cab to the airport.
The mayor of Miami's coming in.
Make him sound nice.
I want a picture and an interview.
Make it work, Paul.
You leaving us already?
I'm moving into an apartment if this mayor guy ever shows up.
They keep changing "delayed" to "delayed."
You want to have some breakfast?
Little lobster on the beach?
Twenty minutes away.
Sounds inviting, but I got to wait for the mayor.
Isn't coming.
Canceled.
That's not what it says on the board.
Lt will in a minute.
I just called Miami.
Come on, let's have some breakfast.
I got a couple things might interest you.
I better call in.
You can call from the car.
All right. Yeah, thanks.
There's only two of those on the island.
Maybe three.
No one told me it was so pretty here.
God's idea of money.
You know what makes this place a gold mine?
Something that doesn't exist.
How's that?
Land.
There isn't enough of it.
Those who know how to get it get the gold.
Chenault?
Paul's joining us for breakfast.
Looks like it's gonna be a lunch.
This is Chenault.
You two know each other?
I don't know,
I thought maybe we met on the plane.
I don't think so.
I flew Boyfriend Airlines.
Tell me, do you like lobster, Paul?
You know what, I might not have time today.
I didn't realize the drive was gonna take so long.
How much time you got?
In 1 5 minutes, I'm late.
I'll cut up a pineapple.
You might want to put on some clothes.
She sunbathes in the nude.
A few of the over-tanned locals tend to treat it as a tourist attraction.
Doesn't surprise me.
I mean that in a very tasteful way.
It's a private beach.
They shouldn't be here.
Sit down, Paul, sit down.
We'll grab you a cab.
His name's Harry.
Got the idea from a book.
Paul, I wanted to talk, because I'm looking for someone who can assimilate contradictory points of view and make them into one voice.
You're a novelist, right?
Who told you that?
Oh, please. Newspapers are full of gossip.
I'm looking for someone who's good with words, next day, you turn up.
And 'cause I believe in good luck,
I thought maybe you were it.
What I need is someone with the right kind of eyes.
For looking at what?
Looking at that.
An ocean of money.
Hey, you made it.
Door at the end.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey. Just give me two minutes.
Walk right in.
All right.
I was trying to get the place shipshape before you arrived.
Adolf Hitler Speaks?
Not mine. Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.
Moburg lives here?
He keeps his uniform here.
I never see him from one month's end to the next.
So, you can see, it's quite spacious.
Don't look in the kitchen.
The water's off.
There's a problem with the valve.
Thought you said you had a TV.
I said I kind of have a TV.
The guy across the alley has a TV, I have binoculars.
His wife's deaf.
With the window open, you hear every word.
Here it comes.
Water's coming up.
I noticed you had some chickens in the bedroom.
Cockerels.
Yeah, I'm sweating the grease out.
Don't worry about them,
I'm moving them to my room.
What do you do with them?
- You eat them?
- Eat them?
Nah. I don't eat them.
Come on, baby, come on!
Get in there, get in there!
Come on!
Hey, on a trade wind, my boy!
On a trade wind!
Come on, bump it up, there, Bobby.
Bump, bump, bump, bump. Yes, sir!
Hey. They call him El Monstruo.
Say he's never lost a fight in three years.
Come on, we're out of here.
Come on, rapido, rapido.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Come on. Go on.
I tell you, we were on a roll til that thing turned up.
That's $21 7.
Not bad.
$21 7 is a shitload of money.
Relatively a shitload.
They're expensive to train.
I've seen guys win 2,000, ten on North Beach.
Why didn't he take El Monstruo down there?
You're talking the environs of the Hilton Hotel.
They wear bowties and shiny shoes.
There's no hope for his kind of hat.
The question, again, is not one of goals.
We're for those goals.
It's one of means.
Were you claiming that the Eisenhower administration...
How long can this blizzard of shame go on?
Look at this ingrate besotted with his own righteousness.
Black is a very dark shade of white.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Nixon.
I can't listen to any more of this.
Lies like he breathes.
Imagine spending your entire life lying.
Holy Christ.
Never got worse.
The only eventuality worse than him is you know that one day, some filthy whore-beast is gonna show up, make him look like a liberal.
The only upside with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.
He's got the grin.
He ain't gonna win.
Irish guy's going to win.
But they'll never let him live.
How do you know that?
I do "horror-scopes."
Thought you said he never came here.
He's got filters.
What filters?
He goes over the wall at the Barcardi plant.
These filters are the last in line in the distillation process.
They contain more ethanol than rocket fuel.
What's it like?
A hand on the brain.
Off the scale.
470 proof.
No such thing as 470 proof alcohol.
Certainty you might be required to moderate.
No smoking in the extraction area, if you please.
Don't be ridiculous.
Not for the social drinker.
You want to quaff?
No.
Not right now. I got to write.
I got a deadline.
What's he writing?
He's lifting the stone on the American Dream.
Guayanilla Bay.
Oh, yeah. It's bad down there.
You might find such a topic attracts a limited readership.
Only need one.
Taking it to Lotterman.
Yeah. Did I hear somebody say "good luck"?
Yeah, I went down there this morning, he unfired me on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.
I'd like to bring something in to Lotterman.
Like a slide-action, "fuck you" gun.
Don't drink that here.
Just a nipperoo, old boy.
Quality test.
Man, slow-motion murder, just like they do in the movies.
See him flying back, fuckin' arms flapping in the air.
Okay, mother.
Look upon the last face you'll see this side of hell!
Bam!
Down he goes, morsels of vital organs spinning off into flesh orbit.
Bam!
There goes his asshole.
Bam!
There goes his dick.
Bam! Bam!
Fuck you, Lotterman!
You're in a B-fucking movie, and I am the death machine!
Shall we have some Adolf?
Definitely not.
On your way, on your way, Moburg.
Hey, we're expecting guests.
I thought you said he was writing a book.
Said I was writing an essay.
And it requires some shut mouth.
Don't waste your time on those junkyard losers.
This country was built on genocide and slavery.
We killed all the black guys that were here, and then we shipped in new black guys of our own, and then we brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.
Let's go.
You know it.
I am the religious correspondent.
Fuck off with your Jesus Police!
If the Bible's God's book, why didn't He give it to everyone?
"We give more money to parking meters than we do to kids to eat."
Don't read me like that.
I've done the research.
1 2,000-ton rust bucket went down in the bay full of hydrochloric acid.
Killed off everything in the sea.
Killed off the fishermen.
Their kids are picking garbage.
All right, don't get angry.
It's hot outside.
You want a Scotch?
Yeah.
Ten years ago... Five. Five years ago,
I might have said go after it.
Now I say go with it.
There's nothing you can change.
Sometimes you just got to spew over the side and keep rowing.
Lnto a nut brown sunset.
It's the land of multiple outrage.
Thousands trodden on before you wake up for breakfast.
That isn't news, it's a commercial reality.
And providing it isn't their sunset, nobody gives one-fifth of a fuck.
You underestimate your readers.
I don't think so.
You underestimate me.
You told me to make it work, that's what I want to do.
Wind down this La Zonga crap and make a newspaper.
Let me tell you some home truth.
This paper's been on its knees to a bank since the day it opened.
And like most every other newspaper on Earth, it's financed by its advertising.
And without advertising, not only is there no La Zonga, there's no paper to put it in, so, thus, there are one or two things that we don't write about.
In other words, nothing at all.
In one other word, discretion.
You're not a foreign correspondent in some far-flung foreign land, this is America.
This is Puerto Rico.
This is America.
You think some plumber from Normal, Illinois, saves up for 25 years to come here on a cruise ship to read about bad times in the sugar plantation?
They don't give a fuck!
The average guy don't rock the boat,
'cause he wants to climb aboard it.
And our readership is vividly average.
They don't care who the losers are.
They want to know who won.
Who won the bowls, who won the races, who won the pot at the slot machines.
Look at me, Kemp.
You're not sleeping, you're wide awake.
And this is the American Dream.
So many hotels, you can't see the sea.
You can see the sea by checking into the hotels.
Pay to see the sea?
What's the matter with that?
You're paying to be in the dream.
There's a thin veneer, Kemp, between the dream and the reality.
You wake them up and the people might start asking for their money back.
You're the boss.
Not quite.
The editorial policy of this newspaper is owned by the dream.
Oh, God.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, God, look at that.
Oh, God!
Hal?
No, no, I'm a friend of Hal's.
I was looking at his boat.
She's a sweet little beauty.
You been aboard?
No.
Great little island hopper.
We've all been down on her.
It's a wonderful experience.
You two are early.
You got lucky.
Yeah.
Did you meet?
Yeah, we got first names.
Art Zimburger, late of the U.S.
Marines, great friend of mine.
This is Mr. Paul Kemp, New York Times.
You're the writer.
Paul's a novelist.
New York Times?
He don't know one from the other.
Just go with it. This guy's key.
Key to what?
Key to the discussion we're about to have.
Look at those mothers.
Come with me, Kemp.
This is a private beach.
We are not on it.
No, but we are!
And what we do is private!
Now get the fuck gone!
Get the fuck out of here!
I see your face again, you're gonna have a 1 2-gauge shotgun telling you what to do.
Talking about Satan...
If there ever was a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.
The only way to come to terms with Communism is to destroy it.
Hit it before it hits us in a devastating democratic strike.
No more for the major.
They're looking for a man to push that button,
I am that man.
Yes, you are, honey.
You look ravishing, Chenault.
Thank you.
You need rescuing?
Don't take him away.
He's very entertaining.
We were discussing Cuba and, I don't know, we kind of veered off, didn't we?
Paul presents us with a somewhat liberal point of view.
There is no such thing as a liberal.
A liberal is a Commie with a college education thinking Negro thoughts.
Well, here's a fact for you.
76.4% of all Negroes are controlled from Moscow.
That's why Castro gets such an easy ride.
In my view, we ought to bomb
Cuba off the face of the Earth,
- let its people live in peace.
- Art.
Hey. Come on, let's eat.
Come on.
Who's the guy in the shades?
Segurra's Daddy.
It's who you're waiting for.
Thank you for my roses.
I didn't think you noticed.
Of course I noticed.
Paul, would you mind joining us?
How do you do, sir?
- Mr. Kemp.
- Nice to see you.
Mr. Kemp.
Okay.
Let me just start by saying this is a purely informal meeting.
And, incidentally, you don't worry about Lotterman, okay?
Lotterman?
What the hell's Lotterman got to do with The New York Times?
Mr. Kemp subs for a variety of newspapers.
Occasionally, he writes for the news.
What he does in his spare time is his affair.
That's how I like it.
We'd like you to do some writing for us.
So I gather.
About what?
In a sentence, we want to set something up, and have the public as our friends.
And there are a variety of ways we can do that.
Let me tell you how this kind of thing works, Paul.
Suppose, by way of example, you wanted to put up taxes by 5%.
The smart way of doing it is to float the idea of a 10%¤ hike.
Let them all shout about it, get themselves in a fuss, then you offer concessions.
"How about 7%?" "No way," they'll say.
"All right, let's stay friends and make a compromise at five."
Bingo.
They think they won something, you get the 5% you wanted in the first place.
Same thing applies to real estate.
You want to build five houses, you put in a planning application for 50.
How many do you want to build?
None.
We want to build one hotel.
Well, looking around this place,
I don't think anyone would notice.
Lt isn't in this place.
It's an island.
Sensitive for a variety of reasons we don't want to get into now.
Nobody wants a paradise choked with hotels, but everybody will be pleased to compromise at one.
This is going to require some clever writing in various carefully placed articles.
Isn't that kind of thing illegal?
If I may say, Mr. Kemp, that's an inappropriate comment.
Where's the island?
Can't tell you.
Not yet.
Discretion is paramount, Mr. Kemp.
If you want to join us, you'll have to sign some papers.
We're having a meeting tomorrow in Hal's office.
If you want to be part of what will be a very exciting project, come along.
There's a man outside in a funny little car for Paul.
Oh, yeah.
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.
I have to run.
Can't stay?
I hear the mermaids come out in the moonlight.
From the moment we met, I knew there was going to be something between us.
It's called her fiancé.
God, I'm so hopelessly and progressively in love.
Do not confuse love with lust, nor drunkenness with judgment.
You want my advice?
No. If it involves her, no, I don't.
Stay away from her.
And stay away from Sanderson.
You're way out of depth.
I got no brief for Sanderson or his pissy rip-off island.
I just want some apple blossom lipstick and fucks.
You are in total denial.
She's fucking someone else.
And as I understand it, about to be married to him.
You won't even make an invite.
I don't believe this.
We're right back where we started.
That is the same Cabrones we passed ten minutes ago.
We need directions.
Let's get in there and get something to eat.
No.
Please, no.
I haven't spent all day on a beach munching lobster with criminals, and I'm starving.
Two beers, two rums, one steak.
The kitchen is closed.
All right then, two beers and two rums.
And one steak.
Cerrado, Mister...
Yeah, but let's not bother me with that.
You got a sign down there saying, "Food til midnight," and I want a steak.
Girl of the swamp.
Which reminds me, we need a map.
You know what I think?
I think we're drinking too much rum.
There's no other way.
I'm getting double ashtray and double salt pot.
You got a Moburg bifocal.
Christ, this is heinous.
Imagine what it must be like to be an alcoholic.
You pay and you go.
I don't see a steak.
No steak.
What do you mean, no steak?
I think he means no steak.
The kitchen is closed.
I got no way of serving you.
Listen, you don't want to hear about my bad day, and I don't want no grave side out of you.
If you can't cook it, bring it like it is.
I'll eat it raw.
Two dollars, you pay and go.
Don't bother me.
You pay now, or I call the cops.
If you have no intention of serving me steak, why don't you do your best to fuck off.
Lt seems to me there's a bad vibe developing.
There are one or two oddities giving us the eye.
Don't get paranoid.
He's on the phone.
For what?
Ordering food in a restaurant?
Let's hope he's through to the FBI.
What's the matter?
What are you smiling at?
I'm not smiling.
I'm maintaining a casual face.
A man just walked in and has good reason for regarding us in a negative light.
- Us?
- Me.
And he's just seen me.
And he wants revenge on the white man.
The fuck are you talking about?
How about the one with the dent?
The one with the eye?
The very same.
Do we walk or run?
Walk.
I'll push the car.
Let's walk and hope he's happy.
Hey, Yankee.
Yankee!
Don't let me see headlights.
Please don't let me see headlights.
I just seen headlights.
Put your foot down.
Where exactly do you think I got it?
Can you go faster?
Going fast as I can.
Jesus Christ, man.
We're gonna be killed!
We're gonna be killed!
Hey!
Get ready to run.
Run in opposite directions.
Give me the brew!
Give me the fucking brew!
Paul!
Piece of luck. I just saw Moburg.
At least I think he saw us.
They got some kind of night court going.
He says we were animals on a rampage of drunken anarchy, poured gasoline on one of his cops.
Oh, my God, we're doomed.
You have something to say?
Yes, Your Honor, I do.
Firstly, this guy handcuffed to me, I never seen in my life.
And second, we'd like a translation of the charges.
You heard what they said?
With respect,
I heard people speaking Spanish.
What kind of language do you think we speak in this country, Mister?
He's not with us.
The cops attached him to get a conviction.
Did you leave the Café Cabrones without paying?
Did you set fire to the police officer, yes or no?
Unfortunately, Your Honor, he got in the way of our flame.
That's right.
No way did we pour gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.
Lt wasn't like he said.
Like he said?
Like you say you don't speak Spanish.
Mr. Kemp doesn't speak Spanish.
Well, he will have plenty of opportunity to learn.
The charges against you are grave.
Resisting arrest carries a tariff alone of one year in prison.
Never mind assault with a deadly weapon.
I'm going to refer this case to a higher court.
Meanwhile,
I remand you both in custody for 30 days.
If I may, Your Honor.
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Lt isn't my purpose to interrupt proceedings, but if the intention is to remand these gentlemen,
I would respectfully ask for a brief recess to allow me to contact their counsel.
Who is who?
Alfredo Quinones.
Lt would necessitate getting him out of bed, of course.
But given the importance of these gentlemen to various interests,
I'm sure that he would be as pleased as I to come down here at 3:00 in the morning.
How much did we cost him?
About $1,000 apiece.
I can't thank you enough.
Don't be late.
Mother of balls!
We got to rescue the car.
Not now. We'll do it later.
I've got a meeting.
We do not have later.
They've already had it 1 2 hours.
I know how these bastards work.
They can strip a train to axles in 1 2 minutes.
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.
How long is this gonna take?
How would I know?
I can't be late.
I don't know why you're going at all.
That guy is bad company.
He's a manipulative prick.
He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?
Now he fucking owns us.
I got a tongue like...
Like a towel.
Want a beer?
Do I want a beer?
No, I do not.
I am never gonna touch alcohol again.
What fresh hell is this?
Front seat's gone.
That's a write-off. Isn't it?
You know what, I've got a brilliant idea.
What's that?
There's too much weight on the axle.
Try and move forward a bit.
Gonna be late.
I'm gonna be a week late.
What are you doing, Sala?
I suddenly realize how much I like you.
What do you mean, what am I doing?
There's something wrong with the axle.
Oh, my God, it's the cop we set on fire.
Try and look normal.
Make a right! Make a right!
- What right? There is no right.
- Any right!
There he is. Paul, come in.
Sorry. There were unexpected developments.
I had to go home and start the day again.
Tell me about it.
Some days are two sizes too small.
Well, I'm afraid some of us had to leave.
But, Mr. Zimburger you know.
And this is Mr. Green of First National Maritime Bank.
You want some coffee?
I think we should move right along, Hal.
- l gotta go.
- Sure.
Sit down, Paul.
As you may know, Mr. Kemp, the island is owned by the U.S. government.
Part of it presently used as a target range by the Navy.
We know from internal sources... ls that what you're calling me?
That the government is preparing to relinquish the lease, and this place wakes up as 32 square miles of magnificent and untouched real estate.
Knock your eyes out.
No prettier beaches in the Caribbean.
Orientated around one hell of a beautiful marina.
Thought it was one hotel.
We start with one hotel.
It's a foot in the door.
Once we're up and running, we're servants of a market.
- Like here?
- Like here.
You look worried, Mr. Kemp.
He's not worried.
Paul and I shared a tricky little night.
Right, Paul?
Neither of us got much sleep.
I gotta go, guys.
Well, we'll leave you gentlemen to it.
Has Mr. Kemp signed the papers?
Doing that right now.
What am I actually signing?
Just a confidentiality agreement, affirmation of trust.
Just so we're all sitting in the same Jacuzzi.
In case a turd floats up, if you know what I mean.
Come on, Paul, let's go over here.
Here you go.
It's just a technicality, Paul.
Means you promise not to talk to anybody about the project.
How's the head?
Unpleasant.
Gotta thank you again for putting up the bail.
It's held on my cognizance.
And I think it more than likely to slip various minds.
This place is a sea of money, Paul.
Unbelievable money.
Practically every major corporation hides its cash offshore.
No, thanks.
And that is good news for us, because we are the shore.
Not one dollar that wings its way into Puerto Rico pays a cent in tax.
- Nothing?
- Not penny one.
That includes chemical companies, oil companies, mining companies.
There's $1 2 billion worth of copper in mountains less than 20 miles from here.
A dozen billion dollars.
And there's people like me who know how to get it out.
So, putting it into context,
I don't envisage the breaking of bones to get at a thousand bucks.
Because you weren't here,
I agreed to an itinerary with Zimburger on your behalf.
You'll be traveling down in the morning.
Hope that's okay.
What do you need, Paul?
Well, just in the context of this Zimburger thing, do you think there's a possibility of an advance?
I don't like to ask, but Lotterman's pretty erratic with the paycheck, you know.
Need to get a hold of a car.
You don't have a car?
Nothing too reliable.
Plus, sooner or later, I'm gonna have to find a decent place to live.
Well, we can help you with that.
When you get back, we'll sort you out something with a view.
Carol, what do we have in the garage?
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you.
Got you a car.
She'll give you the keys on the way out.
Feels like 500?
Yeah. Thanks.
Paul...
How's your afternoon?
A half-written horoscope.
Do me a favor, will you?
Drive out to the beach and pick up Chenault.
I need her downstairs by 6:00.
All right.
So, this one?
Or...
This one?
What are these for, a party?
It's for carnival.
Didn't he say anything to you about it?
- No.
- You've got to come.
We're all going down on the boat.
He didn't invite me.
Well, it isn't his carnival.
This one.
I like the other one.
Yes.
Love this car.
Did he give it to you?
I wish.
Fast.
You want a little bet?
A bet about what?
That you scream before I do.
That I scream before you do, in relation to what?
Well, how fast does it go?
I don't know.
That's the bet.
I already crashed one car today.
It's okay. I'll just go sit in the foyer and wait for him.
What do I get if I win?
I'll let you know if you do.
Come on, I'll take you back.
Christ, where'd they get this?
I don't remember.
I've been slightly avoiding Lotterman.
You have me to thank for your freedom.
Thanks.
I got a feeling of total anxiety trying to put my anxieties together in a single, coherent lump.
I'm fucked without a car.
I got us a car.
It's the Chevy downstairs.
Lt belongs to Mr. Sanderson.
So what?
I gotta go type this up.
I don't know what's going on.
He's freaking out and we're down 1 2 pages.
You better frigging do it!
I see your filthy animal face in here again,
I'll have you locked up!
What part of the building are you creeping towards, Sala?
- Darkroom.
- Cops are looking for you.
- Looking for me?
- Looking for you.
And it ain't just your mug in the paper!
What a day.
What a week.
I tell you, I'm out of here.
One way to friggin' Mexico.
Listen, I got a trip tomorrow.
Sanderson's island.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, dear.
It's green money, and I'm thinking of cutting across for the carnival.
You know they got that carnival in Saint Thomas.
I know.
Why don't you come with me?
Give the cops a few days to forget.
Yeah. Fun.
Our guys. 1 2-inch Naval, 14 miles out.
Nobody lives here?
No one who's staying.
Lazar!
Mr. Zimburger.
This is Mr. Lazar, our much put-upon site architect.
- How do you do.
- Hello.
Mr. Monk, I think you know.
I assist Mr. Green, First Maritime Bank.
This is Mr. Kemp from The New York Times.
What did you say your name was?
- Bob Sala.
- Yeah, Sala.
From American Travel Writers Association.
Mr. Kemp is preparing our brochure.
"Wish you were here."
Beer in the cooler, gentlemen.
I have everything next door.
This and this are the main hotels.
22 floors.
Guardians of the bay, so to speak.
Why the different colors?
Blue is for public dissemination, red is for the investors.
Yeah. Hill villas, ocean condos.
Marina.
Parking for 2,000 cars.
There's no roads.
Damn it, Lazar, you forgot the roads!
We're building them. We're building them.
Let's have some lunch.
1 0,000 waiters, maids, bellhops, janitors, clerks.
Plus, whores for the fat man.
Hard to believe they'd do it.
I was talking to that architect kind of guy.
He's going to Saint Thomas, if you want a ride.
When?
How do I know when?
When he's finished here.
You know what Oscar Wilde said?
"They know the price of everything,
"the value of nothing."
Two rums.
I thought you'd given up.
Finally beat my willpower.
Come on, let's go here.
Hey, mi amigo!
Hey, Rosie's a singer.
Paul!
Where's Hal?
- Boat.
- Boat?
Help me find my girlfriend.
Hey! How are you?
Watch your step.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Look at you.
Good. Grab some champagne.
Hey, Captain.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you take Sala to the island?
You shouldn't have done that, Paul.
It's why we have a confidentiality agreement.
He isn't interested.
He's got a mouth like an AP wire.
I just don't know what he was doing there.
And I sure as shit don't know what he's doing here.
Not going glum on us, are you?
Just thoughts.
What's the book?
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.
Lt was written in 1 797 by a junkie called Coleridge.
He wrote that when he was 25 years old.
I've been dragging a typewriter around with me for 1 0.
I've written nothing.
You've written some books.
Nah.
They had no voice.
I don't know how to write like me.
I resent that.
No, I really have to say he's all right.
I have to admit.
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.
Thank you for the afternoon.
Maybe we'll see you in town.
Where you going?
Her friend's playing in a band.
We're gonna go check it out.
We want to come.
I'll rephrase that.
We don't want to come.
Yes, we do. Us girls want to dance.
You're dancing tomorrow.
What's the point of going to carnival if everything is preplanned?
I want to dance, and if you're not going to take me,
- I'm gonna go with them.
- She's got you trumped, Hal.
Sit down. You're drunk.
So what? So is everyone else.
Come on.
Come on, let's do it. lt might be amusing.
Oh, cuidado. Careful.
Here we go.
Yeah.
We're done. We're spent.
- You're gonna go?
- Yes, we're gonna leave.
You're done?
I can't dance no more. Really.
Hold on. You know what? I'll be out.
Let me just get Chenault.
You want rum or beer?
Both.
Dos rum, dos cervezas.
- Whoa, whoa.
- We're gonna go.
- Hey.
- We're gonna go.
- What?
- Natalie's leaving,
- so let's go.
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no.
Chenault, come here. We're leaving.
- Chenault.
- Stop it!
Chenault!
Chenault, come here! Chenault!
Get your hands off me, you motherfucker!
You want to fuck with me?
You know who I am?
You motherfucker!
You know who I am?
- You're a dead man!
- Go! Go!
Get your hands off me.
- You're a dead man!
- Go!
Forget it.
- We'll call you a cab.
- Fuck off!
I gotta get the girl.
She's having a good time. We closed.
You deaf?
I said we closed.
No way, Paul.
No way.
I looked everywhere.
I went to the gendarme.
And?
We went up there.
Nothing. Nobody there.
But an old woman with a mop.
She was more help than the cops were.
"What can I do if your girlfriend likes someone else?" he said.
He's right about that, Paul.
She's not your girlfriend.
Maybe she went back to the boat.
Did you try the boat?
No.
I don't think he'd let her back on.
Ls she with you?
Why don't you mind your own goddamn business?
I want the keys.
The Chevy.
You blew it, Kemp.
It's all rust.
I've seen better tires hanging over the side of a tug.
You want it or not?
Yeah, we want it.
Everyone turns up for their Friday check, right?
No check, no Lotterman.
So I go around to see that unforgivably ugly wife of his.
She tells me he's gone to Miami.
For what?
You don't know, I don't know.
But the scabs are back.
Since Morell went, the paper took a turn for the worse.
Ls there anything in the spinner?
We need a fresh sack.
Well, maybe I can interest you gentlemen in something else.
Like what, death?
Like the most powerful drug in the history of narcotics.
I'm not at liberty to discuss or disclose.
All I can tell you is this stuff is so powerful, they give it to Communists.
Who does?
The FBI.
Why would the FBI get Communists high?
That I can't help you with.
You take it like eye drops.
In the eye?
So I understand.
Lt makes the eye see things.
You see a different reality.
What do you want for it?
I'll throw it in with the bike if you do me a favor.
What's the favor?
I want you to come to the bathroom with me.
He's your man.
- $50, right?
- Yeah.
He wants me to look at his dick.
I flatly refused.
What does he want you to look at it for?
Says there's something wrong with it.
It's a gentleman's matter.
I'm not looking at it!
All right, give me the drugs back.
No! Wait.
I'll look at it.
I'll view it in the mirror.
Ls it clap?
A standing ovation.
You see anything?
No.
Neither do I.
We'll give it another five minutes.
Trouble making ends meet?
- Then, you need the Lending Man.
- Right.
Call the Lending Man now.
How long since we took it?
I don't know.
A while.
Bullshit, isn't it?
Ls it bullshit?
Jesus.
Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet.
For Christ's sake, keep it out.
What are you talking about?
Your tongue belongs to Satan!
Are you out of your mind?
Keep it out!
If it goes back into your mouth, it'll kill you.
We've got to get it into the sink!
You're giving me fear.
Stop it! I've got fear!
Fuck you. So do I.
You're high, you fool.
Drink some rum.
I thought I was losing grip in there.
What did we take?
I don't know.
We need to get some more.
That explains it.
Doesn't it?
Explains what?
The world.
And us.
I wonder what it is you might think about our different worlds.
He looked at me kind of sideways and said,
"Human beings are the only creatures on Earth
"that claim a God.
"And the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.
"Does the world belong to no one but you?"
And when he said it, I was taken aback.
Not because of who was doing the talking, because I finally understood the connection between children scavenging for food and shiny brass plates on the front doors of banks.
Gotta go.
Come in.
We gotta go.
Give me a minute.
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.
How nice of you to drop in.
I was covering the carnival.
That's not what I heard.
I heard you were in the moonlight for Sanderson.
I was what?
Moonlighting for Sanderson.
Where's Segurra?
Mr. Segurra's no longer with us.
I got a story for you.
Yeah, you may have noticed that I'm somewhat busy.
This is real important, involving
Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.
I'm gonna tell you how important it isn't.
I got 21 jobs on the line and a newspaper going under.
Print this, and you'll sell it.
A planning scam.
Literally despoliation of a paradise.
A thousand people will be swept into the sea like garbage.
You are weird, Kemp.
It's not what it's doing to them, it's what it's doing to you.
It's called journalism.
Make me laugh.
I asked you to tidy up the booze, you couldn't even sweep out a room.
Why do you think you're working here?
'Cause you're everything that's wrong with a journalist.
And you're everything that's wrong with this insult of a newspaper.
Unanimously agreed.
Why don't you shut it, Moburg?
You are a waste of human sperm.
Die a prolonged and relentlessly agonizing death!
Enjoy her.
Made you some tea.
You should try and sleep.
I stole your bed.
It's okay.
I'm going to write.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry.
You did me the best favor I ever had.
There is no dream, Chenault.
Just a piss puddle of greed, spreading throughout the world.
I want to make a promise to you, the reader.
And I don't know if I can fulfill it tomorrow or even the day after that.
But I put the bastards of this world on notice.
That I do not have their best interests at heart.
I will try and speak for my reader.
That is my promise.
And it will be a voice made of ink and rage.
Sit down. I made you coffee.
Thanks.
One for you and one for me.
Oh, man, I would rather not start the day with this.
- What is it?
- It's a writ.
Means we're going to court.
Lt means they can arrest us, should they so desire, any damn minute they please.
We need to speak to a lawyer.
We don't even have a phone.
I know an old guy, Spanish Advocate.
Kind of owes me one.
You should get dressed.
We'll go down there.
Water ran out. I'm covered in soap.
Fuck it. See what I can do.
What's it for?
It's Hal.
He put up a bond for us on this thing, and now he's pulled it.
Here.
You know he's a crook, Paul.
And we get the writs.
What is it?
It's Hitler.
It's over.
What is?
They shut us down.
He just stood there and lied to us.
He hasn't got the morality of a clapped out cash register.
I hate to tell you this, guys, but it was to avoid severance.
We all know what it was for, Charlie.
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.
There's nothing we can do, except report him to the labor board, which is the same thing as doing nothing.
I disagree.
We gotta strike back and nail this bastard to his own front door.
And how, pray, do we do that?
By printing the paper.
We got tons of stuff on Lotterman.
Every happy maggot with his hand in the till.
Lt may be the last-ever issue, but we go out in a blaze of rage.
What are you talking about?
Lt costs $2,200 a shot.
We bring in the scabs.
They're picketing for money.
You're through the looking glass.
We haven't even got enough money for drinks.
It's not worth the fight. This has been coming down the pike for a long time.
You got to know it's over when it's over.
This lousy little Caribbean rag is nothing but a wrapping for fish heads.
Plus, it's a lockout.
Fuck the locks.
I say we just walk in.
Anybody with me?
Bob?
You know I'm with you.
We didn't pay the bill.
Where's Chenault?
She's gone to New York.
She left me $1 00.
I don't believe it.
She didn't have any money.
You should use it to go with her.
Red-eye for 50 bucks.
No.
I'm not going anywhere.
By some means or another, I'm gonna put the paper out.
Print the bastard, then we're gone.
Face the reality, Paul.
There's no job, no money, no girl, and a warrant out for our arrest.
There's no contest.
Donovan's right, it ain't worth the fight.
I'm not Donovan!
And I'm not like the others.
I'm telling you right now, next time some greasy moron starts bullshitting me,
I'm going after him.
All the way up to the president of the United States.
I just want to win one once.
One sheet.
You ain't gonna get far on $1 00.
Some of the scabs will do it for nothing.
We're gonna need 20 guys, plus vans.
No, no, all you need is two grand.
We're out of rum.
It's as if God, in a fit of disgust, has decided to wipe us all out.
Yea, the cock crows thrice.
What about El Monstruo?
Bet the $1 00 on El Monstruo.
How do you know he lives here?
I saw him come out.
You better let me do this on my own.
If he gets it, we should bring it to Papa Nebo.
Who's that?
My witch doctor.
She's a hermaphrodite.
Stop here! Stop here!
By day, she drives a garbage truck.
By night, she becomes Papa Nebo, the hermaphroditic oracle of the dead.
When permission is granted from Papa Samedi, the keeper of the cemetery, she'll visit, and she'll dig up a corpse.
Certain organs of the disgrounded stiffs are indispensable for use in ouangas.
This is horse shit, isn't it?
She cured my prick.
She wants to know what you want.
We want her to empower this fowl.
We want it blessed and anything that tries to fight it, dead.
Bring forth the fowl.
She says that no fowl on Earth could challenge this cockerel and survive.
Great.
How's she off for curses?
Pretty good.
Let's have a curse on Sanderson.
Make his dick fall off.
And that fucker at the bank, Green.
Mr. Green.
Jesus!
Curse active!
Okay, come on.
One down, two to go.
Okay. I'm gonna call Moburg.
Okay.
Come on. Come on.
He isn't there.
He has to be.
He isn't there.
- Where have you been?
- Sorry.
I never heard the phone.
How's it going?
Winning, man. We're winning.
Ls everyone there? ls everyone there?
Yeah, everyone's here.
What about the vans?
What about the vans, Moburg?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, vans.
You hear that?
We're on our way.
What the hell is going on?
He said he had the men.
"All claims against the former owners will be..."
"Signed on behalf of First Maritime Bank, Miami."
Sanderson's pal, Mr. Green.
Sorry, Paul.
I didn't know how to say.
They took all the machines out.
Not everything, but just the parts that matter.
I'll let you in.
All I wanted was a front page.
Probably for the best.
Probably would've never pulled it off.
How much did you guys win?
Just under six grand.
Oh, yeah, well, you...
At least you can pay off the bond now.
Screw the bond.
We're out of here.
It's over with.
There's a midnight Pan Am.
I'm not risking the airport.
No.
I figure this island owes us a boat.
And I'm fuckin' taking one of Sanderson's.
You smell it?
It's the smell of bastards.
It's also the smell of truth.
I smell ink.
I got to take the hen back.
Find yourself a trade wind.
<<<<<<Subs By SIVACHERRY>>>>>>
[Laughter]
- [Tyres screech]
- Hey, move out of the way you crazy turtle!
Humans, huh...
..seems to me like they're always in a hurry, but they have nowhere to go.
That was my old mate Ray back there.
He almost got himself run over.
Huh!
We were born on this very same beach, some fifty years ago, and we've been mates ever since.
Today is a special day, we're both going to be granddads. Imagine that!
'It could take awhile before the little ones hatch though,
'so, let me take you back in time,
'and tell you about our first encounter with the humans.
'There was a time when this beach was practically deserted.
'Nothing out here but us turtles,
'and the sound of those beautiful waves.'
Ohh!
[Seagulls screeching]
Oh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Hey, come on, you need to hustle a flipper!
I can't get out!
Let's go... to the water.
We're wasting time.
See you in 30 years!
Or not!
Ohh!
Oomph!
Ohh!
[Sighs]
[Seagulls screeching]
Hello... hello?
Is anybody up there?
'I was only five minutes old and already I had the sinking feeling
'that I was not going to make it.'
[Screeches]
Ahh!
[Squawks]
Help, let me go!
Ah!
Oh!
Ohh!
Oh-ho, oh!
Hi there!
Watch out!
Ahh!
WOO!
That was well cool with those birds, eh?
It was as if we were flying!
- [Groans]
- You know, you don't look too good.
[Groans]
- Can you move?
- Huh?
We have to get going.
We've got some good waves coming in now.
Come on, we gotta go, Shelly!
Birds are everywhere!
Wait, we have to help him!
Come on, Shelly.
There's nothing more you can do for him.
Shelly?
Oh!
Come on, don't give up.
You can still make it!
You have to try.
Get up, I'll help you.
[Screeching]
Ah, let go!
Help me, help!
Shelly?
[Gasps]
[Sighs]
Oh!
'And so it began for me.
'A little nudge to start me off.
'Nonetheless, I was on my way.'
# Let this love be a fading sky #
# We could drift all night
  to the new sunrise #
# Because we'll be free #
# I know you know you're free #
# Feels so good to be free #
# Mm-mm, baby #
# Free #
# There's nothing in between #
# What we are, what we've seen #
# What we are #
# We are just free #
# Free #
# Free... #
[Grunts]
Oh! Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh, hi there, new to the current?
Hatched yesterday.
You're awful young to be alone out here.
It can get really scary.
Scary?
It is a big pond out here, in case you hadn't noticed!
Lots of creatures out to get you, as you'll find out soon enough.
- Find out what?
- Where do I start?
- Well, what about barracuda?
- Barra what?
Cudas, fastest predator in the ocean!
- And you got your Great Whites!
- White?
Faster than the fastest, they are, and big teeth, too.
Oh, never mind them.
Just go with your instincts, and you'll be fine. No reason to be scared.
I'm not scared.
Well you should be!
You're not even a snack for most creatures out here!
Just follow your instincts, and good luck on your journey.
What am I supposed to be looking for?
When you find out, let us know!
And watch out for the nets.
If they get you, you're turtle soup!
And watch out for the plastic.
Seaweed good, plastic bad.
OW!
What did you do that for?
Do I look like food to you?
Oh, crazy fish!
What a way to start the journey.
Hmm.
Ah!
How's it going, guys?
Looking mighty cosy up here.
- Get off, you big oaf.
- [All] Yeah!
Who put a dent in your shell?
He's gonna eat all our food.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Get out of here!
- Yeah.
Go! We don't need some eating machine hanging around! Sling your hook!
I wouldn't ride on your stupid whatever, if you were the last turtles in the ocean!
- Good!
- Go away!
Hiya, fellas.
Hoy-oy-oy, don't even think about it!
Beat it!
All right, I'm not one of your kind.
Got that right!
- Hey, watch out!
- Ow!
Ah, this is not my day!
Now why'd you whack me upside my head?
But, I...
Lucky I didn't pass out!
Look at that!
Got a bump the size of a barnacle.
Probably get bigger, take over my whole head.
I, I, I don't think it will...
You ever seen them barnacles?
You let 'em hitch a ride with you, they never leave, bunch of freeloaders!
Hello?
Oh! Goodbye.
What is that thing you're on anyway?
You make it?
Oh, I fell on it.
It's a long story.
How's your bump?
Ah, no worries.
Us Leathers got heads like rocks.
The name's Ray.
Sammy.
Pleased to meet you.
How long you been on the journey?
- Just one day.
- Me too! Caught the drift up north.
- So did I!
- Say!
We have a lot in common, you and me.
- Would you like to hop on?
- Nah, I'm OK.
Oh, OK.
It was a joke!
You know, seeing how we're supposed to be floatin' around until we grow up and all, this little raft of yours could come in handy.
This ain't bad.
Now, you're sure about this?
I don't wanna get all friendly like and then you go crackers on me one day,,
- and wanna kick me off.
- I wouldn't do that.
Besides, we were hatched on the same day, probably on the same beach!
We're practically brothers.
Brothers...
I like that.
Ah, the sun feels good, doesn't it?
I like laying out in the sun. it's good for my skin, cos you know, when a turtle, you know, gets all dried up, everything gets all ugly and flaky, but I like that.
I like that, it's good to have a turtle tan.
'And that's how I met Ray.
'He was definitely a character.
'Always fun and never at a loss for words.
'For ten years or so our life in the open sea,
'consisted mainly of floating and waiting.'
You should try some. it's good!
You've got to be kidding. My taste buds are a little more refined.
[Laughs]
That's what you call refined?
Hoo, I love 'em!
[Burps]
They do gimme gas though.
[Laughs]
# I'm feeling happy #
# And warm all over #

'It was a pretty great life out here.
'Time just seemed to fly by.
'Before we knew it we had...
Well, we had grown up.
'Well, almost grown up, that is.'
Oh, this is the life, my friend.
No gas problems today, Ray?
I'm feelin' pretty good.
By the way, did you notice those two cuties leaving
- when we were comin' in?
- Nope, didn't see them.
Come on, they were checking you out!
- No, they weren't.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, do you think we'll be pals forever?
Of course, forever and ever.
- Don't you?
- Definitely.
But, at some point, now I'm not saying now, but, some time in the future, well, we're gonna have to choose a mate, right?
OK. So?
Have you ever thought about finding that someone special?
I suppose.
So, what's your type?
- I don't know.
- Come on, everybody's got a type.
For me, she's gotta have a great laugh, and of course, share my thing for jellyfish.
Of course.
You still haven't told me what your type is?
Actually, I met someone once that I think could be my type.
Oh, really?
Well, come on, come on, this is major! You gotta tell me!
You're gonna make more of it than it actually was.
You already made more of it!
OK.
- Her name's Shelly.
- Go on.
She was... she was kind of sweet.
Mm.
Where'd you meet her?
She was um... an important part of my early life.
What?
We met a day after you hatched, been together ever since, and she's a big part of your life?
- She is!
-Mm?
- Was.
- Well, OK, I want all the juicy details.
There are no juicy details.
Start talkin' or I don't stop bugging you.
OK, OK, fine.
- Come on, I'm listening.
- [Laughs]
Wow, that was some story.
You saved her life.
It was more of an accident.
The birds collided.
You spit sand in that bird's face.
You saved her life!
I don't even know if she made it.
There you are, you never know.
It's a small ocean out there.
Maybe someday me and you'll run into her.
- Maybe.
- [Both] Ah!
- Whoo!
- Ha-ha, is this great or what?
Better than great!
'Ray was truly the best friend
I could have hoped for.
'He was always fun.
'Always good humoured and always looking for new adventures.
'One thing though, I could have done without his stinky jellyfish.'
[Crash]
[Groans]
[Alarms]
[Crash]
'Come on, don't give up.'
You can still make it!
You have to try.
Get up!
- Come on Sammy, get up!
- Oh!
It's about time you woke up.
What?
Oh.
What have you been doing?
Exploring! Made friends with a cool old octopus.
You gotta check him out.
Have you eaten yet?
I'll get something on the wing.
Picky, picky, picky.
Where are you taking me to?
You'll see, we're almost there.
Hey, Slim!
Well, hello!
Grab on, boys!
Come on, Sammy, you're not scared, are you?
No, of course not.
Come on then! it's gonna be fantastic!
- Welcome aboard.
- Here we go!
Pick a tentacle, any tentacle.
Fasten your seatbelts, it's going be a bumpy ride.
Here we go!
Round and round and round.
Love it!
I Teach you to carry on
I Watch now, but now it's gone away... I
Oh!
Woo-hoo.
So was that fun or what?
My head's still spinning.
- Where's everybody going?
- Whoa, we've got a situation here!
What's going on?
It doesn't look good.
- Smells bad too.
- Oh!
What is this stuff?
It's all around us!
We'd better take cover!
We'll be safe in here... I think.
Slim, you ever seen anything like this?
No, not like this.
However, I do remember a cargo ship once ran aground on some rocks, and dropped a whole batch of Icelandic bananas!
These aren't bananas.
Most certainly not.
Oh.
Good lord, that's disgusting!
I'll wager a guinea that that ship is rammed to the gunnels with the stuff.
You chaps should head out, it's not safe staying around here.
What about you, Slim?
Oh, Slim'll be fine.
I like staying put.
I'm a hermit, not the crab, you understand.
But anyway,
I've got a lot of cleaning up to do.
Take care my turtle friends.
- Thanks.
- Take care of yourself!
This looks horrible.
It was so beautiful here.
Why would anybody do this to us?
I don't know, it doesn't make any sense at all.
[Helicopter]
'Humans were strange creatures.
'Some made a mess, while others cleaned it up.
'That was our first contact with humans.
'It wouldn't be our last.
'Over the years, I learned that many things would change,
'but one thing was always a constant.
' People would affect our lives
'more and more.'
[BANG!]
Wow, what was that?
That hurt my ears.
Look at that!
What is it?
Some kind of aliens?
No, humans.
They're everywhere.
I think we need to get out of here.
This is a little too close for comfort.
Hey!
What did ya do that for?
There's no room on here, especially for your stinky jellyfish.
What are you talking about?
We can't even move on here any more.
Maybe I should just take my jellyfish and hit the current myself!
Then you could stretch out and have all the space to yourself.
- I wasn't saying you had to...
- Whoa...
Uh-ooh!
Well, there you go.
I guess we won't have to worry about being crowded any more, now will we!
Look, Ray, I...
What?
What's the rush, guys?
Oh, Ray!
The net, it's got me!
Hold on, I'll get you out of there.
Don't panic.
I'll tear this thing up.
I already tried.
It's too hard!
I can't bite through it!
Ah!
- Ray!
- Sammy!
Wait for me here! I'll find a way out.
I'll be right here, Sammy!
You hear me?
Right here!
Ah, they got me.
- Sammy?
- Ray?
We'll get out of this.
'That was the first time that I saw real fear on Ray's face.'
- Sammy!
- 'I was pretty scared myself]
Sammy!
Oh!
Ohh!
[Grunts]
Ohh!
Oh!
Whoa!
Oh!
Ah. Oh!
Ahh!
[Grunts]
[Sighs] Oh, Ray.
'This was one of those times
I could've used a little luck,
'one of those little nudges.
'I had the feeling
I was never going to see Ray again.'
Gotta be thirty degrees out here.
Away with you, I'll give it 35.
What you got there then, boy?
It's a little greenback.
Think we should we make some soup?
- [Both laugh]
- That little boy's overcooked already!
Chuck him!
[Both continue to laugh]
[Groans]
# Oh-ho-ho #

  are supposed to do, oh, yeah... #
Hey, what's this?
Oh, isn't he a cute little turtle?
See turtle, Fluffy?
- See?
- He looks so scared, doesn't he?
We'll get him some food, and we'll take real good care of him.
OK?
Fluffy, turtle eat food.
And it's time for your dinner, too.
[French accent] OK, let's get one thing straight, little turtle.
-these are my humans.
- I didn't ask to be here.
Your humans brought me here.
If I may suggest, you should plan on getting your little shell out of here as soon as possible, unless of course, you prefer to end up like my ex-amis, ze chicken.
- Chicken?
- Absolument!
Whose playpen do you think this was?
They eat animals?
But she seems so nice.
Do not let the mumsy-wumsy attitude fool you.
She will stuff you like a goose, then, it is r-r-r, pâté for everyone.
Shh, here she comes now!
Here you go, little man.
You are so skinny.
We need to fatten you up, don't we?
Come here, don't be afraid.
Do not forget.
You have been warned.
Bon appétit!
"You have a strange way, Ralph,
"of proving that the world has grown smaller.
"So, because you can go round it in three months..."
"In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg.
"That's true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan.
"Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad,
“on the Great Indian
Peninsular Railway, has been opened.“
So, have you given any more thought to your escape?
You are starting to look like ze fat goose more and more every day.
Ze time will come. it's a sure thing.
You and your chicken stories!
Is it true? Can you really go around the world?
But of course you can!
I myself have travelled all over with my humans.
Since they rescued me from the murky waters of the Seine in Paris, oo-la-la, it has been magnifique!
So, wait, there are other oceans out there?
'One day, Snow found a female turtle.
I think she wanted us to...'
Mate!
You've got to be kidding!
I suppose she wants more turtles.
I know what mating is.
That is so not happening.
And who's your hairy friend?
That's Fluffy.
These are his humans.
Exactement! You just stay away from my humans, sister.
Oh, you can keep your humans as far as I'm concerned.
Bunch of wack-a-doodle-doo creatures!
The further away from them I am, the better.
Tell me, sugar, how long have they been holding you prisoner?
I'm not a prisoner.
Really, then why are you still here?
This is the same question
I have been asking for weeks!
Back off, whiskers.
Let me break it down for you.
Where I come from, this here fence looks a lot like a prison, but, OK, believe what you will if it makes you feel better.
Fluffy!
Dinner calls! À bientôt!
- I'm Sammy.
- Vera.
Speaking of dinner,
I am starving!
Do they just feed hairball or us, too?
Yeah, when the sun goes down.
Beautiful!
Don't make any sudden moves on me.
Go ahead and give us a wake-up call when it's time to eat, will you?
[Yawns]
[Sitar music plays]
There you go.
You'll be our little peace ambassador.
Merry Christmas, little man.
Hey, what did she paint on my shell?
Turn around, let me see.
It is zat, stupid... ze sign!
What can I say.
I have told you.
You are marked, mon ami.
Oh, there you go again with the chicken and the funny words routine.
Never mind him, Sammy.
It looks cute on you.
Why do you think they dress up like that with those silly hats?
Incroyable!
You really don't get it?
Because it's Christmas!
You get presents.
Hey, maybe this mark is Snow's present to me.
Doubtful.
In any event, don't get any ideas,
Monsieur Hard Shell.
She is only being nice because it's Christmas.
? Jingle bells
? Jingle bells
? Jingle all... ?
'I still don't know if Fluffy's chicken story was true or not.
'I wanted to believe Snow was a kind human and wouldn't do that to me.
'But you never knew, when it came to humans.
'It didn't take long before the hippies realised,
'Vera and I weren't going to mate.
'They said we had different karmas...
'or auras - whatever they were.'
Zat should be you out there.
Hold on, I thought you liked Vera?
Vera's too old and too tough for turtle soup.
But you...
- Ow!
- ..I'd say you were just about right!
Vera!
[Man] None of you kids belong on this beach! I want you all off here now!
Snow, they're taking Sunshine away!
[Sirens]
The cops! The army!
They're shipping them out to Vietnam!
[Man] You with the love beads, start that bus up.
Vite, vite, go, go, go!
What's going on?
You, you're coming with us.
This is it, it's chicken time.
You have to hide now!
They did the same thing before.
They... you know what I mean.
Stay put, and don't move.
You don't want to end up as fricassee, do you?
[Man] All right, shake a leg.
Come on, get out of it.
[Young man] We have rights, man.
[Snow] Wait.
Where's the little man?
Has anybody seen him?
I can't find him.
Quiet.
[Man] Right, you horrible lot, everybody get off this beach.
Get your stuff and move out!
[Sirens]
Have a good life little turtle!
Peace.
"The whole time I was with the humans,
Fluffy wanted to get rid of me",
"but in the end, it was them who left".
"I never quite understood what happened".

You wouldn't know where I could find some food, sea weeds?
[Sighs]
'At that point I thought, maybe
I wasn't meant to go on this journey.
'Maybe I'd spent too much time with the humans.
'But there was no turning back now.'
Oh!
[Grunts]
Argh!
Well, well, well, look what the trash brought in!
Vera!
I see you escaped one prison and got yourself all tangled up in another.
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah, lots of rubbish out here.
Got to be careful.
What brings you here?
- Food.
- Yeah!
Follow me.
What did I tell you?
This is just what I needed.
[Faint] Help!
Hold on a sec, what's that noise?
- I didn't hear anything.
- [Faint] Oh, oh!
- This is so tasty!
- [Screams]
Shh!
Ah-ha! Shark!
Help! Help!
[Screams]
Oh!
- Are you hurt?
- He bit me pretty hard but I'm fine.
He's coming back.
Quick, this way.
Hurry, he's gaining on us.
Quickly. Here.
- [Screams]
- Oh!
Quick!
In here.
. Oh!
. Oh!
Ohh! Quick, no!
- Keep going!
- Oh!
Faster, faster!
- Ohh!
- [Screams]
Come on, keep going!
[Both gasping]
Keep going! Down here!
Ohh!
That was close!
Too close.
[Screams]
Leave us alone!
Hey you, big teeth!
That's right, hot shot!
I got your scaly botty on my radar!
You picked the wrong turtle to be messing with!
Ohh, you want some of this?
[Grunts]
Is that all you've got?
I'm gonna call you the Great Wimp not the Great White! Ah!
- Oh, no!
-Vera!
Hey, you think that hurts?
What?
Please!
That's all you got?
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna make cat food out of you, pal!
Look at you,
I've got one tough shell, fish breath!
You heard me.
And don't make me swim after you!
Woo, that felt good.
No need to worry about mister shark any more.
You were incredible!
Are you two related?
No, we're just friends, well, sort of.
Well, got to go.
Feed the boy, cos, a fat turtle is a happy turtle.
Take care you two.
You know, you don't look too good.
Are you OK?
'Don't give up.
You can still make it! You have to try.'
[Gasps] You're...
Wait, you're... you're Shelly!
How do you know my name?
Is this a dream?
No, I, I don't think so.
Are you the same "fell out of a bird's beak when you were hatched," Shelly?
Just a minute.
[Gasps]
I knew you looked familiar, too!
You saved my life - twice!
What? No!
The first time was an accident.
That was no accident, that was fate.
You know,
I don't even know your name.
Sammy.
Well, Sammy, this is incredible!
It is, isn't it?
How's your shell?
It's just a scratch.
Are you as hungry as I am?
Famished!
'Life is strange.
'Just when you thought the going was pretty tough,
'out of the blue things happen,
'and everything's suddenly great again.'
Hey, Shell, you ever get bored just drifting, going round in circles?
It's what we do.
I know, but wouldn't it be great just to travel around the world?
What do you mean?
This is our world.
I think there's a lot more than these waters.
For instance?
Well, the humans talk about ice oceans and strange islands.
I want to see them!
You're definitely a different type of turtle.
- I guess that's why I like you.
- [Gasps] You like me?
What's not to like?
So, just how exactly do you plan on seeing the world?
Have you ever heard about a secret passage?
You really think one exists?
- I do.
- The humans again?
Maybe they made that whole thing up.
Maybe, but I want to do something no one else has done.
I want to see the world, ice oceans!
So, you wanna come along with a weirdo turtle like me?
Is this a proposition, Sammy?
Yes, I suppose it is.
- I'd love to go with you.
- [Gasps] Really?
It's not every day you get a chance to see the world, right?
How do we find this secret passage?
I'm not sure.
Let's head south, we'll ask around.
'Everything suddenly fell into place.
'I had a purpose, a journey.
'And best of all, someone to share it with.'
? Destiny is a funny thing
? We hear people say things are meant to be... ?
All I know is that I see a lot of ships heading that way.
A secret passage?
That, I couldn't tell you.
I stay as far away from those humans as possible.
That must be the way! I feel it!
I feel it, too!
Good luck!
? Never to feel love
? And you will see that nothing at all is impossible
? Because love will find a way... ?
There's loads of boats.
I don't see any secret passage.
Let's move on.
Of course he's not crazy!
We have a plan.
We want to see the world.
Thanks anyway.
This is not as easy as I thought.
Wait! Over there!
? Because mountains and valleys may come between us
? But time nor space will ever defeat us
? And you will see that nothing at all is impossible... ?
This is not the secret passage.
Look at all this nasty stuff around here.
This can't be it.
I think you're right.
[Birdsong]
Taste the water!
- It's sweet!
- Wait!
I remember the humans mentioned something about sweet water
- flowing through the secret passage.
- Do you think we're close?
Yeah! This must be it.
Let's check it out.
It's so different and so beautiful.
It's amazing!
[Bird call]
Wow, did you see that?
There's birds everywhere!
We've got to be careful.
Look at that! I've never seen a snake that big in the ocean.
Maybe he's the guardian of the secret passage.
- [Hisses]
- Let's keep going.
That is one strange looking beast.
It looks like a real monster.
[Gasps]
Did you see that?
- What?
- I'm not sure.
I feel like we're being followed.
[Gasps]
Sammy? Ohh!
I don't think they're anything to worry about. They're not that big.
OW!
Ah!
True, unless you count the fact they have a whole lot of nasty teeth...
There seem to be quite a lot of them.
[Growls]
- [Growls]
- [Scream]
See, I told you they were...
- Ah!
- Sammy!
Let me go!
Ahh! Ahh!
[Grunts]
Why did you bring me up here?
- [Cheeping]
- Ow!
OW! Ow!
Stop it!
Ow! Cut it out!
[Gasps]
- [Cheeping]
- Ahh, cut it out!
[Chainsaw]
[Screams]
Great!
Now how do I get down?
Oh!
[Ship horn]
[Sawing continues]
Ohh!
[Screams]
Oh!
Sammy, I was so frightened!
I thought I'd lost you forever.
[Gasps] Duck!
Maybe looking for the secret passage is a bad idea!
I think I know where it is!
When I was up in that tree,
I saw all these big ships heading towards a place in the distance.
I think we're close.
Really close!
[Ship horn]
We made it!
You were right!
Yeah, and getting through is gonna be another story.
Sammy, you're too close!
Follow me!
We've gotta get ahead of the ship!
Maybe we should go back!
They already closed the door behind us.
We've come this far!
We can make it!
Oh!
Oh!
- Sammy!
- Shelly!
I can't hold onto the rope!
Hold on, I'm coming to get you.
- Sammy!
- Stay! Stay!
Hold on. Just hold on!
- [Screams]
- Shelly!
- Help!
- No, no, no!
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, where are you?
Shelly?
Shelly? Shelly?.
Oh!
Shelly! Shelly.
Oh!
Ohh!
Argh!
Oh!
Ohh!
Ahh!
[Gasps]
Ohh!
Oh, Shelly!
'Losing Shelly was all my fault.
'My big idea to see the world, and now here it was.'
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? it's not warm when she's away
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away... ?
Yo, what's up with you?
- Nothing.
- Is you lost?
I suppose I am.
? ..when she's gone
? Wonder if she's gone to stay
? Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
? And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
? Anytime she goes away
? Mm-mm-mm-mm
? And I know, I know, I know, I know
? I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know... ?
- Well, hello there, young turtle!
- Hi.
What's that funny looking mark on your shell?
Humans painted it on me.
Oh, you poor thing.
No, it's not what you think.
You're the second turtle we've met with a strange mark on its shell.
A shark bite?
Yeah, I think that's what she said it was.
Yes, I think you're right, dear.
Oh, she was a lovely female, too.
A bit strange though.
Sure was! Told us some crazy story about going through a secret passage, heading for the ice oceans.
You sure she said secret passageway?
Heard her plain as day!
Indeed we did.
She was going on and on and on about sweet water, giant ships...
That's Shelly!
Why, I do believe that was her name.
Shelly's alive! She's alive!
Oh, thank you, thank you!
You just made me the happiest turtle in the whole ocean! Thank you!
Good luck, dear.
We truly hope you find your mate.
Oh, to be young and in love again.
'I searched everywhere.
'I talked to anyone who would listen.
'For a long time, Shelly seemed to have vanished without trace.
'But, once in awhile,
I'd come across turtles who'd seen her.
'They gave me hope, fleeting as it was,
'because every time
I was close to finding her,
'I'd lose all trace of her again.
'If only she had known
I was looking for her.”
? I've been searching
? Across the lonely water
? Arms wide open to take you
? Seems like forever
? Since we last were laughing
? Do you remember it the way I do?
? Just know you never are alone
? We just need to find our way back home
? You're not alone
? We just need to find our way... ?
Hey there, turtle!
What's that crazy do-malarkey on your shell there?
Helipad or something?
It's a human marking.
- A peace sign.
- Peace sign?
Where have I heard that before?
Thinking, thinking, och aye, that's what she called it.
- Who?
- Oh, a cute little greenback like you.
Big talker she was.
Going on about sweet water, a secret passage, and propellers!
You saw Shelly?
I sure did!
She had to go to the ice ocean.
Made no sense to me, but then again what do I know, I'm just a bird,
- you're the turtle.
- I've gotta get there, fast!
Hold on, it's mighty cold there.
Please, just tell me how I get there!
This current you're on will get you there in no time.
- Wouldn't stay there too long, though.
- Ow!
Frozen stiff ain't too attractive, if you know what I mean.
[Laughs]
Gotta fly, got a date with a pelican.
'Funny how things had a way of repeating themselves.
'I guess it was all a matter of circumstance and how you looked at it.
'This time around, strangely enough,
I was really happy to see a bird.'
[Thunderclap]
[Thunderclap]
[Wind howling]
I say, little man, what's that you're riding on?
I don't know.
The humans threw it away.
I think it's some kind of boat.
Looks pretty seaworthy.
What brings you to these waters?
You're a long way from where you should be?
I, I know. I'm freezing.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for...
Look out!
Oh!
Put down your weapons!
You cannot do this!
You're in violation of the law!
The world is watching!
- Hey, look at that! It's a green turtle!
- Give me a hand.
Pull him up here.
- You found another one?
- Yeah, you believe that?
What are they doing in this part of the world?
I know the climate's changing, but turtles in Antarctica?
That's crazy.
Shelly?
[Barks]
[Barks]
[Chattering]
[Trims]
[Trims]
Here you go, my friend.
[Man] Her vital signs are good.
She's made a remarkable recovery.
We'll give her one last check up when we get back to base, then we'll tag her and she's good to go.
Yes, I was right, it is you!
I've got to get out of here.
[Bangs wall]
Open! Open!
Shelly? Oh.
Oh!
- Shelly!
- [All chatter excitedly]
Sammy?
[Mimics] Sammy!
[All chatter at once]
Hey, easy! You're gonna hurt yourself if you fall off there.
All right, all right everybody.
Shush!
Shelly, is that you?
Not today.
Sorry,
I thought you were someone else.
Do you know what's going to happen to us?
I heard the humans talking about this place.
They're gonna take good care of us, put some kind of tag on us, and release us back into the ocean, man.
I say, "Relax and enjoy the food.“
I heard they got good cheese Fritos, man, and that stuff is good.
OK?
Level
Easy.
Sacré bleu!
Well, look who it is!
You are so fat, mon ami.
Oh, it's you, Fluffy.
But of course it's me! Don't I look just as fantastique as ever?
I should be mad at you for tricking me that day on the beach.
Oh, yes, ze chicken story.
Well, you got me zere.
I made it all up.
I was a little more insecure back then.
You're not going to hold a grudge, are you?
No. it's good to see you, Fluffy.
You, too, mon frére.
So, how did you end up in here?
I practically got myself frozen in the ice ocean.
Really?
So you did it, you went and saw the world after all?
Yes.
But you do not sound too happy about it. Pourquoi?
It's a long story.
Oh, mon dieu, speaking of stories,
I have to admit I did miss you, whenever Snow started reading her books to me.
Snow's here?
Mais out! Somewhere.
- Shelly!
- Shelly? Who is that?
Never mind! You have to help me get out of here, now!
OK, OK. For being so slow, you turtles are always in a hurry.
Fluffy!
What do you want me to do?
I need you to get the door open.
Certain.
What are doing in there bothering the animals, again, Fluffy?
Oh, I don't believe it.
Fluffy, you recognised him?
It's our little peace ambassador.
Look at you, little man, all grown up.
What happened to you?
How did you get here?
I was afraid you wouldn't make it after I dumped you on the beach.
It's so good to see you.
I know, I know, you're in a hurry to get back to the sea, aren't you?
Well, we're gonna get you out there soon enough.
First we have to tag you. I need to get some more from the other building.
It's so good to see you, little man, isn't it Fluffy?
Back in a jiffy.
Fluffy, hurry!
All right, stand clear,
I will get ze door open!
Oy, oy, oy, stop that.
Come on, outside, Fluffy, come on, outside and play.
Leave the animals be.
Sorry, mon ami.
OK, here we go.
You find yourself a mate, little man.
And stay away from the cold water, OK?
Bye-bye.
'For a sea turtle, the odds of surviving in the ocean are pretty slim.
'Shelly and I made it through some tough situations,
'with, at times, a little help from the humans.
'But somehow, no matter how hard we tried,
'fate was determined to keep us apart.”
- You have to help us!
- What's wrong?
He's trapped! He's gonna fall over!
- Who?
- Hurry! Follow us!
We found someone to help you!
Good, cos this thing's about to go!
Hold up, hold up, is that all you could find?
You might as well have brought me a shrimp.
He's too small!
What's he gonna do?
How's he gonna help me?
Stop moving! You'll send yourself over the edge, and you're done for!
Wait a second.
You sound familiar.
Come here.
Come on, come closer.
Let me get a better look at you.
Well, twist my shell cos I can't believe this! Sammy?
Sammy, is that you?
Ray?
I thought you were...
Go ahead, go on say it- turtle soup, huh?
[Laughs]
How did you ever get away?
Ah, it takes a lot more to stop old Ray here. You know that.
It took me two days.
This kid, a first-timer on the boat, found me, tossed me in a bait bucket.
- Hoo.
- Good thing, too, cos I was starving!
After I ate all the bait,
I jumped overboard.
By then we were miles away from each other.
I blamed myself for us getting separated.
No, Ray, you...
Whoa!
He's gonna fall over if you don't get him out of there!
I can do this.
How did you end up in this thing anyway?
OK, let me tell you about it, right?
It was full of frozen squid when I found it!
It was gonna be an easy in and out, but it slipped and I got trapped, so I just started eating them one by one, cos they thawed out real slow.
But as I was eating, I started getting full, then I started moving slow, then I couldn't move and you know me
I got the trots.
OK, OK, no more talking, it's time to get you outta there!
[Grunts]
No, no, no!
Easy, Sammy.
Don't move, Ray, stay still.
No! Ray!
Sammy, can you get me out of here?
Get me out of here!
-Ahh!
-Oh!
Ahh!
[Grunts]
Whoo! I knew you had my shell all the time, my friend. Whoo!
Ladies, my heartfelt gratitude goes out to you.
Your bravery is only exceeded by your collective beauty.
[Both giggle]
Good line, Ray.
Isn't it? Aside from the obvious reason, it's really good to see you, Sammy.
It's been a long time.
So what are you doing out here all alone?
It's a long story.
- Now where have I heard that before?
- I need your help, Ray.
Hey, we're practically brothers.
What do you need?
I have to find someone.
Someone very special to me.
The trick is to know where to look.
And this time of year, there's only one place she would be headed.
That would be the magical place.
Look at this. It shines like this all day.
You never want to leave.
This is amazing!
If you're looking for a mate, this is where you wanna be.
There's Rita! Hey, Honeybee!
- Rita, I'm back!
- Huh? What?
[Gasps] Ray!
What took you so long?
Oh, shnookums, I was... entangled, so to speak, OK?
And then I swam into my very old friend.
Honey, sugar pie, this is Sammy.
[Gasps] Sammy? For real?
The one and only.
Hi, Rita.
Very pleased to meet you.
I thought you was dead?
I mean, Ray always thought...
I know, turtle soup.
I'm glad you finally tamed his wandering ways.
[Both] He's cute.
Hey, hey, hey, relax, girls, he's got a mate already.
Well, where is she?
I'd love to meet her.
- I wish I knew.
- That's why we're here.
See, we need to find her.
They were separated quite a while ago.
Oh, you poor dear.
They've been looking for each other ever since.
[Both] Oh, how romantic.
She's got a shark bite on her shell.
- Anybody seen her?
- I believe I did. What's her name?
- Shelly.
- Yes, that's her!
Where did you see her?
Where did she go?
I'm pretty sure she went in there.
What are you waiting for, buddy?
Let's go find her.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, but sugar bee...
You stay right here.
Sammy needs me.
You brought him here, now it's up to him.
Oh, OK then.
I'll be right here if you want me.
[Both] You'll find her, Sammy.
Love always finds a way.
Yeah.
# Always finds a way #
# I know you're somewhere out there #
# - Somewhere far away
- Shelly? #
# - I want you back
- Shelly? #
# I want you back #
# - My neighbours think I'm crazy
- Shelly? #
# But they don't understand #
# You're all I have #
# At night when the stars light up my room #
# I sit by myself #
# Talking to the moon #
# Trying to get to you #
# In hopes you're on the other side #
# Talking to me too #
# Or am I a fool #
# Who sits alone #
# Talking to the moon? #
# Oh-oh-oh #
# I'm feeling like I'm famous #
# The talk of the town #
# They say I've gone mad #
# Yeah, I've gone mad #
# But they don't know what I know #
# Cos when the sun goes down...? #
Shelly? Shelly?
Oh!
[Grunts]
Shelly?
Oh!
What's wrong?
You didn't find her?
She's here all right.
She's got a mate.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I saw them together behind the boat.
Oh, no.
I'm really sorry, Sammy.
What are you gonna do now?
I know, I know you're probably not thinking this way, but there are lots of other turtles out there.
Stop it, Ray.
That's not what he wants to hear right now.
Hey, Ray, you's back, how's it going?
- Could be better.
- Ooh, hi, Rita.
Robbie,
Clara's been looking for you.
Well, that figures. With all the good-looking gals out here, she does not want me to be wandering around too much.
- [Both giggle]
- Well, I better get going.
And later.
You too, manana banana, you know what I'm talkin' about.
- Who's Clara?
- Robbie's mate.
I thought... Shelly and...
Robbie were...
Mates?
[Laughs hysterically]
Yes, that's the way it looked to me.
Robbie?
Oh, oh, he'll flirt with any gal that says hello, and that's why Clara keeps him on a tight leash.
That... would be Robbie.
I should do the same with you.
Me on a leash?
Oh, sugar, you know you're my baby bee.
So that means...
Shelly may not have a mate after all.
You might be right.
What do I do?
I wouldn't be waiting around here.
But what if she doesn't...
Doesn't what?
Duh!
Want him as her mate.
Oh, yeah,
OK, hold on, hold on.
I got it! I got an idea.
All right, listen to me, this is what you're gonna have to do,
You're gonna need to make a big entrance, Sammy.
Is Albert still hanging around?
He is.
What crazy idea are you trying to pull off this time?
Trust me, eh!
Ohh!
[Screams]
Help!
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
You were so brave.
I suppose I was finally in the right place at the right time.
Sammy?
How did you find me?
Look out! Behind you!
It's OK... he's a friend.
What?
What, what's going on?
I knew this was a bad idea
Oh, I see.
After what happened at the secret passage, I wasn't sure if...
If what?
If you and I were meant to be.
Come here, silly.
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
J Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-bi-do!
Yeah!
I - Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
- [Both] Whoo!
? Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
? I was born, by a mother at the school of understanding
? And raised, by a sister, who taught me I could be standing
? At the age of seven,
I fell in love with Blackie
? And nothing could come in my way
? When women go smiling
? I start running
? When women go talking
? I start blushing
? When women start asking
? - Why I keep on falling
- Keep on falling
? I can't stop running away
? They call me little love child with a thorn in my side
? You shouldn't be talking to me
? They call me little love child with a thorn in my side
? You shouldn't be talking to me
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-bi-do
? Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
? I soon turned eleven
I was lost and separated
? It was head over heels that got me stimulated
? Like John McEnroe, my sky kept on falling
? I knew I had something to say... ?
Look, I'm getting all blubbery and soft-shelled.
Oh, you poor dear.
Next thing you know I'm gonna put a little pink pom-pom on my tail.
Oh, I'm so sensitive.
? Asking, asking, we're falling, we're falling... ?
'The day I was born, the odds were
I wasn't going to make it,
'and I didn't have a clue as to what I was supposed to do.
'Ray showed me how to have fun and the meaning of true friendship,
'and then I met Shelly.
'She made me complete, gave my life meaning,
'and that, by any measure, is pretty great.
'As for humans,
'I must admit, we're going to need their help more and more,
'to protect us and keep our oceans alive and beautiful.'
Looks like the little ones made it out pretty good this time.
Well, looks that way.
So, where did we say we're supposed to meet the women again?
Tristan da Cunha.
Tristan da what?
It's in the middle of nowhere.
- Any humans?
- What can I say?
You know they're everywhere!
Hello?
- I've got this one.
- Go for it.
Hello, hello, is anybody up there?
Hi, there.
Uh, hi, I can't get out.
Could you help me?
I know exactly how you feel.
Let me give you a little nudge to get you started.
The first steps are always the hardest.
What exactly am I supposed to do?
Just put one flipper in front of the other and you'll be all right.
# OO oo oo #
# OO oo oo #
# Sometimes I get my head in a dilly #
# Feeling so lost, ticking you off #
# Now, boy, you know me well #
# Said, I'm that kinda filly #
# That kind of soft, that kind of silly #
# But when I'm in doubt,
I open my mouth #
# And words come out, words come out like #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# There's something underneath my bed #
# Oh, please believe I said #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# I caught them barking at the moon #
# Better be soon #
# High in the sky, the song that I'm singing #
# A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry #
# Rabbit out the hat #
# Yes, that's what I'm bringing #
# Got some tricks up my sleeve #
# For noticing me #
# Oh, yeah #
# I wouldn't cause you any harm,#
# I just want you in my arms #
# I can't help, I can't help myself #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water #
# There's something underneath my bed #
# Oh, please believe I said #
# Baby, there's a shark in the water, water #
# I caught them barking at the moon #
# Better be soon #
# Better be soon #
# Right is right
Rules are rules #
# This is more like April fool #
# I'm just winding you up I #
Money, money, money. Hey!
You got a date with justice, one-Eyed Bart.
Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man.
One-Eyed Betty!
I think you dropped something, mister.
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!
You've reached the end of the line!
I always wanted to go out with a bang!
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
Hold him steady!
Woody, hurry!
No!
Glad I could catch the train!
Now let's catch some criminals.
To infinity and beyond!
Reach for the sky.
You can't touch me, Sheriff!
I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs.
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"
"You're going to jail, Bart."
"Watch out!"
Mom!
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I 'm not here.
Oh, no, Molly!
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.
Happy birthday!
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!
"I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"
"Got it, Woody."
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
"Good work, Buzz."
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.
Wait! I can't find my other eye.
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind squeezing next to you?
Is it hot in here?
Here they come!
Sarge, you got it?
Mission accomplished.
Hooray!
Careful. Careful!
All right, guys. We got one shot at this. Everyone ready?
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.
Target is on approach.
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.
Hello?
Hello? Anyone there?
Molly, stay out of my room!
I wasn't in your room.
Then who was messing with my stuff?
It wasn't me.
Well, that went well.
He held me! He actually held me!
This is just sad.
Who we kiddin'?
The kid 's 17 years old.
We ain't ever gettin' played with.
Guys, hey, hold up.
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!
Not again!
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.
We are gathered, Woody.
Okay. First off, we all knew operation Playtime was a long shot.
More like a misfire.
But we've always said this job isn't about getting played with. It's about...
Being there for Andy. We know.
But we can try again! Right?
I 'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.
What?
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.
We're going into attic mode, folks.
Keep your accessories with you at all times.
Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition.
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.
Yeah, but now it's here.
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.
- Moving on?
- You're going AWoL?
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.
And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go.
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.
You're gonna need it.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.
How do you know?
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?
- I thought we were goin' to the attic.
- I hate all this uncertainty!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.
I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way.
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?
Yeah. Even Bo.
All good toys who've gone on to new owners.
But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!
He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here.
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm...
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!
There's games up there, and books, and...
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.
And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right?
Yeah.
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.
And he'll play with us then, right?
We'll always be there for him.
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready, and go out on a high note.
I 'd better find my other eye.
Where'd you leave it this time?
Someplace dark. And dusty.
Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay.
Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. I guarantee it!
You guarantee it, huh?
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?
Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together.
For infinity and beyond.
- Can I have your stereo?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I 'm taking it with me.
- Can I have your computer?
- No.
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.
Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash.
- Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.
Why do you still have these toys?
Molly, out of my room!
Three more days and it's mine!
Molly, you're not off the hook either.
You have more toys than you know what to do with.
Some of them could make other kids really happy.
What kids?
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.
What's daycare?
- Mom.
- No buts.
You choose the toys you want to donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside.
Poor Barbie.
I get the Corvette.
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.
Like what?
Like what are you gonna do with these toys?
Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.
- Maybe sell them online?
Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys.
They're junk.
Fine. You have till Friday.
Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.
That's what's happening.
- You need a hand?
- I got it.
Here.
So, you gonna miss me when I 'm gone?
- Lf I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.
Then, yes, I 'll miss you.
I can't breathe!
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?
Andy!
That's not trash. That's not trash!
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!
Okay, boy. To the curb!
No, Buster! No!
Get up. Buster!
- We're on the curb!
- I knew it would come to this!
Pull, everyone! Pull!
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!
It's triple-ply, high-density polyethylene!
There's gotta be a way out!
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?
Point. Point. Point!
Push! Push!
I can hear the garbage truck!
It's getting closer.
Buzz! Jessie!
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?
This doesn't make any sense.
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!
Fellas, I know what to do.
What the heck?
- We should 've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.
Now we need to go!
You're right. Come on.
- Buzz?
- Woody!
What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated?
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.
We're going to daycare!
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.
Attic? So how did we end up on the curb?
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.
And called us junk!
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.
Sure thing, college boy!
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.
Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone.
Great. Great! It's gonna take us forever to get back here.
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.
Well, Molly and I have been growing apart for years.
It's just... I can't believe she would throw me away!
- Welcome to the club, toots.
- Okay, everyone, listen up.
We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.
We'll hide under the seats till we get back home.
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.
Andy doesn't want us anymore.
He was putting you in the attic!
He left us on the curb!
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.
Just wait till you see what daycare's like.
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place for washed-up old toys who have no owners.
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.
As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home.
Can anyone see anything?
- There's a playground!
- Wow!
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!
So much for sad and lonely, huh?
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.
Perspective? This place is perfect.
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.
- Hey there!
- Wow!
Haven't seen you in ages.
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.
- What?
- Can you believe it?
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?
- Look!
- Wow!
What? What is it?
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I can't see!
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!
- So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.
Careful. These toys might be jealous of new arrivals.
- I want to see!
- Hey!
- Rex!
- It's my turn!
New toys!
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.
Buzz Lightyear at your service.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Thank you. May I?
The claw!
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I 'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.
But please call me Lotso.
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...
First thing you gotta know about me,
I 'm a hugger.
Look at you all. You've been through a lot today, haven't ya?
It's been horrible.
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.
We been dumped, donated, yard-saled, secondhanded and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait, you'll find being donated was the best thing that ever happened to ya.
Mr. Lotso, do toys here get played with every day?
All day long. Five days a week.
But what happens when the kids grow up?
Well, now, I 'll tell ya.
When the kids get old, new ones come in.
When they get old, new ones replace them.
You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten.
No owners means no heartbreak.
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.
Because we're Andy's toys!
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?
Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying.
Folks, if you want to step right this way...
Hi, I 'm Ken.
Barbie. Have we ever met?
I would 've remembered.
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.
Folks, if I can share, here at Sunnyside, we've got, well, just about anything a toy could ask for.
Spare parts, superglue, and enough fresh batteries to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.
Well, stop your worryin'.
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, puffed, and lightly buffed.
And this, well, this is where I live.
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.
And a whole room just for trying on clothes.
You have everything!
Everything except someone to share it with.
You need anything at all, you just come talk to me. Here we are.
Well, thank you, Big Baby.
Why don't you come meet our new friends?
Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him.
Abandoned by the same owner.
But we don't need owners at Sunnyside.
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.
We control our own destiny.
Watch out for puddles.
And here's where you folks'll be stayin'.
The Caterpillar Room.
- Look at this place.
- Wow!
Holy moly guacamole.
Jackpot, baby.
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
It's so beautiful!
What the... Hey, little guy.
How long 's it been since you all got played with?
It's been years.
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring, and you'll get the playtime that you've been dreamin' of.
Play! Real play! I can't wait!
Now, if you'll excuse us, we best be headin' back.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.
- Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.
- Will I see you again?
- I 'll see you tonight in my dreams.
Ken, let's get a move on.
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe, but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...
- Made for each other.
...made for each other.
- Yay!
- Yes.
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.
This is so exciting!
Sounds like kids to me.
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?
How many you reckon are out there?
They sound so sweet.
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.
But we need to go home.
We can have a whole new life here, Woody.
A chance to make kids happy again.
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!
And if he wants us at college, or in the attic, well, then, our job is to be there for him.
Now, I 'm going home.
Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz.
Buzz?
Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody.
What?
And what's important now is we stay together.
We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy!
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.
Whose name is written there?
Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore.
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.
You can't just turn your back on him now!
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!
Okay, fine. Perfect.
I can't believe how selfish you all are.
So this is it?
After all we've been through.
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"
Look,
I don't want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay.
Bonnie?
I gotta go.
Bonnie, you in here?
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.
What... What the heck?
Now, that's better.
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.
No, no, no, no!
Reach for the sky!
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...
You're my favorite deputy.
- Bonnie!
- Coming!
Great.
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.
Toys are for playtime.
Speaking of playtime, they're lining up out there!
- How many?
- There must be dozens.
I can hardly wait!
Places, everyone!
At last! I 'm gonna get played with!
- Rex?
- Come to papa.
'Here's a snake in my boot.
I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song.
A sheriff!
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?
It's good for you. But don't drink too much, or you'll have to...
Be right back!
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.
Can you tell me where I am?
The guy's just asking a question.
Well, excuse me.
I 'm trying to stay in character.
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.
Hello, I 'm Trixie.
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.
We're either in a café in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey.
I 'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor with life-changing news.
We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!
"I know where to hide."
She'll never find us in here.
What's wrong?
She found us! We need a spaceship to get away from the witch!
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?
Look, I just need to know how to get out of here!
There is no way out.
Just kidding. Door's right over there.
Well, cowboy, you just jumped right in, didn't ya? I 'm Dolly.
- Woody.
- Woody?
Really? You're gonna stick with that?
'Cause now's your chance to change it, new room and all.
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!
- Told ya.
- I found a spaceship!
Showtime.
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.
Three, two, one, blastoff!
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.
I got a kink in my slink.
My tail! Where's my tail?
Someone need a hand?
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.
Honey, the mustache?
I don't recall playtime being quite that strenuous.
Andy never played with us like that.
We're just gonna have to make the best of it.
But these toddlers, they don't know how to play with us.
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.
Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room.
- With the big kids!
- That's right.
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.
I 'll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room.
Blast. Try that one.
It's locked!
- Same here.
- Try the windows.
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.
Finest childproof lock in the world.
- We're trapped!
- Wait.
Did anyone notice the transom?
Oh, great. How do we get up there?
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...
- Three!
- Whoa!
Let go!
Go!
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!
Way to go, Buzz!
Yeah, you think they had a fun playtime?
They might hear you.
- Okay, now you start.
- I...
- Love...
- You.
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...
- Love...
- You.
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.
You are so smart.
Come on, Romeo. We're late.
- I 'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.
- All right.
- Here we go.
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.
Come on, duck.
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.
Let me have the duck, let me have the duck, let me have the duck!
Here is a duck.
- I won!
- Ah, man!
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.
Hey, what do you guys think of the new recruits? Any keepers?
Oh, please! Landfill!
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.
But that space guy, he could be useful.
He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives.
Neither are you, Chunk.
You got a little keeper yourself, didn't you, Ken?
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.
What do you expect from a girl's toy?
I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?
All them toys are disposable.
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.
Well, well. Looky who we have here.
Let me go!
Take him to the libary.
No!
1225 Sycamore.
Woody, what are you doing?
I gotta get outta here.
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?
Well, of course I did, more than I 've had in years, but, you see,
I belong to someone else.
- Who's "Yid-nuh"?
- I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."
Guys, it says "Andy."
He's my Bonnie.
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?
I 'll fire up the computer.
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!
Zip it, Buck Rogers.
You don't talk to Lotso till we say you can...
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?
He got out, Lotso.
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.
F-A-oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I 'm so sorry.
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?
The children in the Caterpillar Room are not age-appropriate for me and my friends.
We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room.
Well, request granted!
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.
Why, I 'd say we've found ourselves a keeper.
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!
We're calling you up to the big leagues, son.
From now on, you'll have anything you want.
Excellent. I 'll go get my friends.
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.
Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with.
But my friends don't belong there.
None of us do, I agree.
Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear anymore.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.
Family man, huh? I understand.
Put him back in the timeout chair.
What are ya... Unhand me!
Bring in the Bookworm.
Here it is.
It was filed under "Lightyear."
Let's see here.
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.
"Remove screws to access battery compartment."
What are you doing?
Stop!
Let go of me!
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure to its original factory settings..."
No!
"...slide the switch from
Play to Demo."
Stop! No! No! No!
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.
I 'll see what it was.
What do you see? Anything?
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!
I see Andy!
- What?
- That's impossible.
No, no, I really see him. In his room.
My other eye! The one I left behind.
'His is so weird. He's packing up.
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.
He's looking in the attic.
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!
He's looking for us?
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!
I think he did mean to put us in the attic.
Well, then,
Woody was telling the truth.
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.
Hey, you didn't believe him first!
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?
There's been a mistake.
We have to go.
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.
We were runnin' low on volunteers for the little ones.
They just love new toys, now, don't they?
"Love"? We've been chewed, kicked, drooled on.
Just look at my pocketbook!
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.
"Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?
I have over 30 accessories, and I deserve more respect...
That's better.
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth, except me.
Give it back, you furry air freshener!
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.
Whoa there, missy.
You're not goin' anywhere.
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?
Buzz! You're back!
Buzz?
Hey!
Look out!
What are you, nuts?
Buzz!
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!
You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance!
- "Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?
Oh, boy.
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!
Yes, sir!
Where do you think you're going?
Buzz! We're your friends!
Spare me your lies, temptress.
Your emperor's defeated, and I 'm immune to your bewitching good looks.
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!
Not him.
I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners.
Take him to the box.
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?
Bad baby! Bad baby!
Ken? What's going on?
Barbie! I told you to wait in the Dream House.
What are you doing to my friends?
Get in there!
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...
And give me my scarf back!
Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations.
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.
Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box.
Roll call at dusk and dawn.
Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box.
Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to.
Any prisoner talks back, spends the night...
In the box! We get it.
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.
But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself.
Don't worry, Commander.
Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy.
Listen up, folks.
We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside.
If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true!
But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.
Woody! What did you do to him?
You all get a good night's rest.
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.
1225 Syca...
Who's Velocistar237?
That's just a dinosaur toy down the street.
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.
Sycamore. Okay, enter!
Please don't be far. Please, please!
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!
I 'm going to college! Look at me!
I 'm big toy on campus! Hello!
- Hey, I 'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.
Hey, listen. If any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home.
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?
Well, it wasn't easy.
What do you mean "escape"?
Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair.
Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.
Lotso?
The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster.
But... How do you know that?
Chuckles. He'll tell you.
Yeah, I knew Lotso.
He was a good toy. A friend.
Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy.
A was there when Lotso got unwrapped.
Daisy loved us all.
But Lotso,
Lotso was special.
'Hey did everything together.
You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love.
One day, we took a drive.
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.
She never came back.
Lotso wouldn't give up.
It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's.
But by then, it was too late.
Something changed that day inside Lotso.
Something snapped.
She replaced us. Come on!
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.
Didn't she?
She don't love you no more!
Now come on!
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.
'Hen we found Sunnyside.
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.
He wasn't anyone's friend.
He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.
So how'd you get out?
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys, they don't stand a chance.
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.
Returning now would be suicide!
But what about your Andy?
Isn't he leaving for college?
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.
But he ain't ever comin' back.
Rise and shine, campers!
Commander Lotso, sir!
All quiet, nothing to report.
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.
Wait! What've you done with my husband?
Big Baby.
Sweetheart!
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!
Hello?
You shouldn't have come back, cowboy.
'Hey've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols.
You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.
I made it out once.
You got lucky once. Want my advice?
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.
Yeah, for how long?
I've been here years.
'Hey'll never break me.
'Here's only one way toys leave this place.
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.
Then it's off to the dump.
Look, I appreciate your concern, old-timer.
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I 'd sure be grateful.
Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through's the doors.
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.
Got it. What else?
Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long.
Hallway, lobby, playground.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.
You go over or under.
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.
The monkey's the eye in the sky.
He sees everything.
Classrooms.
Hallways.
Even the playground.
You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere.
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!
Recess! Come on, kids!
Hey, guys.
- Woody?
- Woody!
Woody!
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!
- You're alive!
- 'Course I 'm alive!
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?
Lotso did something to him!
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Return of the astro-nut.
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.
No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys.
From now on, we stick together.
But Andy's leavin' for college.
College? Hog-tie the mailman!
We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow!
Tomorrow? But that means...
It means we're busting out of here, tonight.
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!
No, there is one way out.
One way.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- Springy dog.
- Present.
Green guys.
- Cowgirl.
- Here.
Horse.
- Piggy bank.
- Y o.
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.
- Barbie.
- Here.
Potato Head.
Potato Head?
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!
Impossible!
Hey!
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, smoothie.
Well, well, well. You're turning out to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?
What did you think you were gonna do? Waltz right out of here?
Yeah, and I would 've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!
You're a purse with legs.
Take him back to the box.
No! No, not the box! I 'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.
Really. No, no, no!
Okay, check.
Good work, Lightyear. All right, resume your space-guy-thingy.
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!
Ken! Ken?
What do you want?
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go to the Butterfly Room. With you!
Yeah, well, you should 've thought of that yesterday.
I was wrong.
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!
Darn it, Barbie!
Okay, but things are complicated around here.
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!
Wait. I 'll do anything!
I 'll change your diapers!
Go get the tape!
And this is where the magic happens.
Look at all your clothes!
I can't believe you never brought me up here!
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.
Campus hero with matching sports pennant, huh?
Flower power! Oh, Ken!
No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie. No one.
Ken, would you model a few outfits for me?
Just a few?
Go get the key.
Where is it, where is it?
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff!
Make a move, porky!
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.
No wonder you're extinct.
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!
Help! Prison riot!
Get the tortilla.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Barbie?
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?
And how do we switch him back?
You can't make me talk. You can't!
But I 'd like to see you try.
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.
Barbie! Those were vintage!
It's okay. All right, go ahead, rip 'em, I don't care.
They're a dime a dozen.
Glitter tux.
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?
A Nehru jacket.
Barbie! Not the Nehru.
This is from what, 1967?
The groovy formal collection, yes!
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!
There's an instruction manual!
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!
Where's that manual?
I don't know why this couldn't wait until morning, Ken, but here you go.
What's takin' so doggone long?
So how do we fix Buzz?
What are you looking at, feathers?
Hey!
Yeah, fly away, you coward.
Well, that's just great.
Help! Prison riot!
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.
- What?
- I said, "No one can hear you."
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."
Shush! Will you be quiet?
Woody! You're back!
Stop him! Don't let him get out!
Star Command! I 've been taken hostage by my own prisoners.
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!
Unhand me, Zurg scum!
The Galactic Courts will show you no mercy.
It's not working. Why is it not working? Where's the manual?
Here we go! There should be a little hole under the switch.
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!
What?
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.
"Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds."
It's not my fault!
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!
Amigos! We're all amigos.
We gotta switch him back.
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.
Good luck, cowboy.
Here they come.
Come on, Buzz!
What took you so long?
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?
We haven't seen him.
Buzz.
Did you fix Buzz?
- Sort of.
- Behind you.
Someone's coming.
You would not believe what I 've been through tonight.
Darling! Are you okay?
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.
You've lost weight. And so tall.
You're a sight for detachable eyes.
All clear.
Come on. Come on.
We're almost there.
Back up. Back up!
Come on.
Woody!
Come on. We're almost there.
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.
- Is it safe?
- I guess I 'll find out.
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.
Come on down. But not all at once.
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Geronimo!
- Look out!
Thanks, Jess.
Almost there, guys.
Slink, you think you can make it?
Well, I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step.
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.
Okay, climb across.
You lost, little doggie?
Well, well. Look who's back.
I'm sorry, cowboy.
They broke me.
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?
He don't want you no more.
- That's a lie.
- Is it?
Tell me this, Sheriff.
If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving?
You think you're special, cowboy?
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.
Speak of the devil.
Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room and you need to avoid that truck.
Why don't you come on back, join our family again?
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!
And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours!
Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force.
If that's what you want.
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.
Not to me, there's not.
Fine. Then why don't you join her!
Oh, Ken!
Everyone, listen!
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair.
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top!
Anyone concur with Ken?
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.
Wait! What about Daisy?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Daisy? You used to do everything with her?
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!
She replaced you.
And if you couldn't have her then no one could.
You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since.
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.
She never loved me.
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.
Mama.
What? You want your mommy back?
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!
Push 'em in. All of 'em!
This is what happens when you dummies try to think.
We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is!
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.
Come on. Hurry!
For crying out loud!
Woody!
Oh, boy. Incoming!
Come on!
Barbie, no!
Woody!
No!
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.
We all here? Slinky? Rex?
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!
Buzz!
They'll never make it!
Look out!
Buzz!
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.
Buzz, you okay?
Buzz! Buzz!
That wasn't me, was it?
Buzz, you're back! You're back, you're back, you're back, you're back!
Yes, I 'm back. Where have I been?
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.
Woody! So where are we now?
In a garbage truck on the way to the dump!
Hold on, we're going in!
You got all your pieces?
The claw!
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!
No!
Hang on!
Woody! What do we do?
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...
- Woody!
- Slinky!
It's a magnet! Watch out!
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.
You might wanna take a look at this.
Quick! Grab something metal!
You heard the guy.
It's not working!
Help! Help me. I 'm stuck!
Help, please! Help!
Woody!
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.
Woody!
Go, go!
Thank you, Sheriff.
We're all in this together.
Right, guys?
Guys?
Woody! Down here!
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.
Woody, look. I can see daylight.
We're gonna be okay!
Hey!
I don't think that's daylight.
Run!
Sheriff! The button! Help me!
Come on!
Go. Go! Hit the button!
Hurry!
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?
No. No!
Lotso!
No!
Rex!
Buzz! What do we do?
The claw.
You know all that bad stuff I said about Andy's attic?
I take it all back.
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.
Oh, darling. You were so brave.
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.
My boys!
Daddy!
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?
Yeah. I 'd like to loosen his stitchin'.
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.
- Hey!
- What you got?
I had me one of these when I was a kid.
Strawberries.
Hey, buddy. You might wanna keep your mouth shut.
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.
What about you guys? I mean, maybe the attic's not such a great idea.
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!
Wait, I 'll check!
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?
Yeah. Just a few more boxes in my room.
Okay. Come on.
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!
All right. Go. Go, go!
Okay. All clear.
There you are.
- There you go.
- Buzz.
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.
Yeah, but not too much fun.
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.
Sure thing.
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?
'Course I will. Besides, I know about
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?
Honey, you want some food for the road?
I 'll get something on the way.
You know where to find us, cowboy.
Did you say goodbye to Molly?
Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times.
Andy.
Mom, it's okay.
I know. It's just...
I wish I could always be with you.
You will be, Mom.
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye to Buster?
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?
Who's a good doggy? I 'm gonna miss you. I 'm gonna miss you.
- I 'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.
Come on. Get the rest of your things.
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.
Hey.
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"
Mom.
- Andy?
- Hi.
Wow. Look at you.
Well, I hear you're off to college.
Yeah. Right now, actually.
So, what can we do for you?
I have some toys here.
You hear that, Bonnie?
So, you're Bonnie?
I 'm Andy.
Someone told me you're really good with toys.
These are mine, but I 'm going away now, so I need someone really special to play with them.
This is Jessie, the roughest, toughest cowgirl in the whole West.
She loves critters, but none more than her best pal, Bullseye.
Here.
This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!
The Potato Heads. Mr. And Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,
'cause they're madly in love.
Now Slinky here is as loyal as any dog you could want.
And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.
These little dudes are from a strange alien world.
Pizza Planet.
And this is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!
He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg.
To infinity and beyond!
Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys.
They mean a lot to me.
My cowboy!
Woody? What's he doing in there?
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha?
There's a snake in my boot.
Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember.
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.
And kind. And smart.
But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you.
Ever.
He'll be there for you, no matter what.
You think you can take care of him for me?
Okay then.
Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking the haunted bakery!
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
And we'll actually need the rocket.
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.
Look! They're being attacked by a real dog!
You can eat my poisonous scones!
Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head are in trouble.
Get on, Woody.
It's my friend Woody.
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.
Thanks, guys.
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.
Come on. Let's get some lunch.
So long, partner.
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.
New toys!
Noses.
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all super excited about your new home.
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."
That Barbie has some nice handwriting.
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!
I 'll do it! This is it! This is it!
- Yes!
- We did it!
High-five! Hold on.
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.
Yeah, she really got your smile.
What the...
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
Romeo, o Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Next season, we're doing Cats.
Or might I suggest Hamlet?
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.
I don't know what came over me.
Just go with it, Buzz.
Oh, after you.
You worried?
- Superman does not worry.
Lex?
Right here.
You diseased maniac.
I'll take it from here.
You feel okay, Superman?
Lex, I'm surprised you took time away from your presidential campaigning and came to Gotham city for this.
Oh, dear lady, as a nominee it's my pleasure and privilege to be here.
Especially, if you win.
And now, ladies and gentlemen.
The moment you've all been waiting for.
We're here tonight to honor a great man.
A man who has proved time and again
'his first priority is helping those in need.' this year's man of the year award goes to... Bruce Wayne.
Next year, buddy.
I despise that guy.
Bruce, will you say a few words?
Well, there's not much to say.
I do what little I can.
Since every once in a while everyone needs a helping hand.
Though I'm not sure
I deserve an award for it.
'You heard him.
He doesn't deserve it.'
'which is just as well, since we got a last minute entry.'
'who has been there for you?'
'one man who has made it his mission'
'to improve the lives of people around him.'
'he has remodeled our buildings.'
'helped keep our banks free of unnecessary clutter.'
'you have always shown your appreciation.'
'what you need?
We'll do anything for you.'
'and why stop now?'
A standing ovation!
Did not expect that.
But I'll take it.
And also, everything else.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm going to purr-loin your valuables.
Riddle me this.
What's green and found in your wallet?
Money?
- Um, no. Not anymore.
Wait!
Sorry, to rain on your terrain, my dear.
Thanks so much.
Well, well, Lex Luthor.
Presidential candidate and Superman's least favorite bald person.
No, thanks. I don't want to get joy buzzed.
Oh, don't worry,
I didn't want to shake hands.
I want your watch.
Nice running into you.
Let's do it again some time.
- Oh, we will.
Speech.
- Come on, joker.
Speech.
- Come on.
What a night, such an honor.
I'm speechless.
Ah, who am I kidding?
When am I ever speechless?
Look at that face.
It's like, what's he gonna say?
What's going to come out of that mouth of his?
Sorry, to wipe that grin off your face, joker.
You're not sorry, you're not sorry at all.
Riddle me this, Batman.
What wears a mask and is unconscious?
You.
Let's get him.
Let's ask the coin?
'Get going, Robin. '
- 'I was waiting for you. '
Ah, my kind of party.
Good food, good people.
Good goody bags.
Hey, bat-lame and slobin.
Why are you guys hanging around?
You see what I did there?
We're here to get those valuables you stole, joker.
And Bruce Wayne's man of the year award.
This is my award it very clearly says, me, joker.
Oh, you just-you ju...
You just stuck that on there.
Robin, focus on your flying.
'Sorry.'
Oh, I missed.
You like shark, Batman?
'Because I think they're going to like you. '
Oh, come on!
I can't keep up.
I'll take it from here.
You like missiles, Batman?
Because I think they're going to like you.
Let's see, what do we have?
Oh, good. You like pie, Batman?
'Cause I think...
Ah, forget it.
Where does he get these unbreakable toys?
Oh, come on!
Oh, see, now you get out!
You are afraid of a real fight.
Yeah, you're so scary.
Watch the suit, boys.
Thanks for helping out, Batman.
Hey, you know,
I also was... part of this.
Hey, guys, need a hand?
With what? Parking?
Yeah, sorry. I wanted to be there for your award.
Ah, I mean, uh,
Bruce Wayne's award.
Me too. Kids weren't invited.
So, saw you put a big hole in the theatre.
I'll get it repaired.
I already did that.
Also, I put your boat back in the water.
Hey, thanks!
Yeah, thanks.
You know, you should really try not to make such a mess while you're fighting crime.
I can see you smirking in there.
X- ray vision.
Aren't there people somewhere else that need your help right now?
Yeah, actually there are.
I should go. See you, guys.
Bye, Superman!
He's so nice.
- Yeah, he's great.
You were kinda rude.
I was doing a systems check.
See you at the batcave.
Scenes of chaos tonight at the Gotham city theatre where the joker has interrupted the prestigious man of the year awards.
Watch the suit, boys.
This was the fifth annual man of the year ceremony held in Gotham but only the second to be brought to a premature end
'by a gang of rampaging villains. ' computer... I have an election to win.
Looks like another stay in arkham asylum for the joker.
Love you, joker!
I'll win in a landslide.
Oh, come on.
'First Batman, second Superman. '
Kryptonite.
'Batman seems to have recovered all the stolen property' including Bruce Wayne's man of the year award.
The only thing left for joker, a swift return to arkham asylum.
Along with the title, goon of the year.
This is Clark Kent on assignment in Gotham city for daily planet online.
'Hey! '
I was watching that.
Too much television is bad for you, pumpkin.
How does he sneak all that stuff in?
Clark Kent!
Really despise that guy.
Coming all the way to Gotham city to insult me.
Me, a hometown boy who made good.
'You're right.
You don't deserve that. ' that's right. I don't.
Eh, wait. Who said that?
'How would you like to be out of arkham right now'
'and given a chance to take revenge on Batman'
'and the rest of this ungrateful city? ' well, I'd have to be crazy to say no to that offer.
Unless you're just one of the voices in my head.
In which case,
I'm crazy anyway.
What?
Oh, hey, Lex!
You've come to get your watch back?
Or did a bus from Metropolis get lost and breakdown?
First, I don't take the bus.
And second, yes, give me my watch.
So, what you got there?
This, my friend, is the deconstructor.
It emits a unique energy.
One that is absorbed so quickly by any... shiny black object that it causes it to pull itself apart.
What?
Nifty! What's it got to do with me?
First, I need help replacing its power source.
It doesn't run on aa batteries.
Kryptonite.
And second, I might need some of that joker gas you are so good at making.
Oh, yeah.
I guess that could come in handy for someone running for president.
You help me, you can use the deconstructor to your heart's content.
Know anybody who has lots of shiny, black, unbreakable toys?
I don't know who you're referring to.
Come on! Batman!
You were...
Joking. I'm the joker.
'Prisoner escape!
Repeat, prisoner escape! ' we should be going.
Can I just have one try?
Joker, come on.
It's a shame.
Now someone's going to have to fix this.
But the good news is, I'm out of prison.
Joker!
Hey, what's going on?
It's a riddle.
- Oh, come on!
That's my thing.
'Justice league watchtower calling Batman. ' justice league watchtower calling Batman.
This is Batman.
Just checking your location in case of emergency.
I'm in the batcave.
Sounds like an emergency.
It's alright. I got it.
You got dressed fast.
Well, I've just started sleeping in the costume now.
May I?
Oh, well,
I think I should do it.
I thought you were going to let me play with that thing.
Dah! What's this?
Do I need this?
Joker, could we move things along?
You're no fun to shop with, Lexie.
Hey!
Wait!
Stop!
Okay, we can go.
On second thought,
I have an idea!
Joker, come on!
I'm an artiste.
I like to challenge myself with a bigger canvas.
Commissioner.
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
No problem, Jim.
Commissioner Gordon is what you need to call him.
What's the situation?
There's been a breakout at arkham.
'The bridge automatically submerges'
'during a prison break. '
'unfortunately, it's so old'
'it takes a long time to raise again. '
I'll get over there and start cleaning up.
Batman, wait for me.
You won't make it.
- Oh, yeah? Watch me.
Uh, Robin, I think you should listen to your-your-your Batman.
Don't worry about me, Jim.
Uh, commissioner Gordon.
Oh, man, should've listened.
Should've listened.
Yep, should've listened.
Hey, come on, get him.
Yeah.
Eat a brick, Batman!
What do we do?
You put your bike back together,
I'll take care of this.
'They've got the high ground. ' but I've got better aim.
That was easy.
A little too easy.
They were only meant to distract us.
From what?
Holy baloney!
Totally scared catwoman.
Did you see that?
Oh, Robin.
Come on, you've got to give me this one.
Now, Robin, what were you saying?
Something catty, I believe.
Alright, everybody, back inside.
Let's ask the coin.
Yeah, the coin says "no. "
You know that's where you're gonna end up eventually.
Not this time.
Perfect!
You brought my bike.
Can I drive?
I wanna drive.
You gotta let me drive.
Sorry, Harley Quinn, the coin says "no. "
You take catwoman.
I'll get the three in the Jeep.
What about the others?
- We've got time.
Bane's mole machine is not built for speed.
Go.
Bad news, two-face.
Batman's on our tail.
So, we'll lose him in the sculpture garden.
Okay.
Oh, for crying out loud!
Left or right?
Left.
What are you doing? Turn!
Oh, without the coin
I don't know which way to go.
Oh, stop it.
Riddler baby, you should've...
Let you drive.
I know!
You're not gonna find any cheese in this maze, rat-boy.
Rat-boy?
You get rat-boy from Robin?
You were saying... something catty, I believe.
It's defined now!
I can't control it.
Well, we contained the break out.
All the prisoners are accounted for.
Except the joker.
He must've been the first one to break out.
Smuggled in some kind of explosives.
No, I don't think so.
There'd be blast marks, powder burns, something.
It's as if the bricks just flew out.
Well, yeah. No, I mean, you didn't let me finish.
I was gonna say, was gonna say smuggled in some explosives which would be the usual way, he would break out.
Which he didn't, because there is no sign of an explosive.
Hey, look at this.
Looks like some kind of residual radiation.
Packaging remote tie-in.
Bat computer.
Remote tie-in, active.
Identify residual radiation.
Radiation consistent with energy signature of u. S. Defense department project.
J.s. G- 817 currently under development at Lex corp.
Well, I think we know who broke joker out of prison.
Lex Luthor.
What would an upstanding presidential candidate like Lex Luthor want with the joker?
I've heard that Lex Luthor may not be so upstanding.
You might wanna tell somebody.
Election day is tomorrow.
Sir, there's been a break in at Ace chemicals.
Wouldn't be surprised if that was joker's first stop.
Wait!
Joker, how's it coming?
You can't mess something like this.
Lex! It's a boy.
Just like arkham.
So, I can stop carrying this?
I mean, now we have other samples.
I can't go anywhere without making a mess.
He didn't just break in here to do this.
Come on.
Promethium, xenon, Mercury, tantalum and dialum.
And those aren't the chemicals he spilt all over the floor?
No.
So, uh, we're gonna leave now, right?
Yes.
Got to give it to the joker, that is kinda cool.
It'll be really cool when that fire ignites the rest of the chemicals in the building.
What's that?
Acid. It'll soften the planks.
Hey, guys.
Calm down.
Again.
That is great.
Isn't that great, Batman?
Destroyed all the evidence of the crime scene.
So, who blew this up?
Long story.
We've got it covered.
Okay, well, just let me know, uh, volcano in Mexico.
Call me, if you need me.
Uh, Batman, maybe he could help with this.
I mean, he's had a lot of experience dealing with Lex Luthor.
We don't need him.
Well, it seems like just now we needed him.
We'd have been fine jumping off the roof.
I think we would have broken our legs.
We've broken our legs before.
Yeah, but I didn't like it.
I mean, if we just call him.
Robin. We can't go through life expecting Superman or anyone else to save us whenever things get tough.
The only people we can rely on, is ourselves.
Bat computer, tie-in.
Bat computer remote tie-in. Active.
Access chemical database.
What substance can be produced to recombination of the following chemicals?
Promethium, xenon, Mercury, tantalum and dialum?
Accessing.
No substance found.
What substance can be approximated through the combination of the chemicals?
'Accessing. '
'listed chemicals can combine to form'
'an approximation of kryptonite. ' kryptonite?
We better call Superman.
We're not... going to call Superman.
Activate tracking systems.
Detect nearby sources of kryptonite.
Affirmative.
There it is.
Maybe, we should let Superman know.
We do and we'll be putting him in danger.
Can we ever leave together?
No! You tricked me.
Oh, don't worry.
Nice job.
So, Lex, when you're president can I be vice president?
I think we've got company.
You didn't answer my question.
'Auto drive, activated. '
Kryptonite.
Batman!
Oh, my goodness. Beaten again.
No hard feelings.
Where's your car?
Substance is 84% similar to kryptonite.
No harmful effects to natives of Krypton.
'That doesn't make sense. '
I had the bat mobile tracking kryptonite.
It wouldn't have picked this up.
There must have been kryptonite in the Van.
What's the point of making kryptonite that wouldn't harm
Superman anyway.
We'll put it away with the other kryptonite just to be safe.
'Why do we have so much of this stuff? '
I keep it in case Superman decides to be a bad guy one day.
You expect the worst of everybody.
Yeah.
What's happened?
We've lost the signal.
Don't worry.
It's directly ahead.
Beyond these walls, friend lie the keys to the destruction of Superman.
And Batman too, right?
Sure. Yeah. Fine.
'Intruder alert! Intruder alert! ' someone's broken into the batcave?
'Fake kryptonite. ' it was a homing device.
We were set up.
Hello! Anybody home?
We're here.
And we brought deserts.
Come on, we're guests.
You can't offer us a lousy cup of coffee?
Hey, is that the batboat?
Oh, gee.
Could've sworn it was there a minute ago.
Hey, look.
The batwing.
Must be seeing things.
We gotta get outta here.
But, Batman...
- Go.
Hey, Batman, penny for your thoughts?
Are we going upstairs?
I'd love to see the rest of the place.
Going down.
We don't have a lot of time.
Jump!
Let him go, we have to find the vault.
You're right. It's time to serve desert.
Where does he keep the kryptonite?
I just know he has it.
Not where he hides it.
Computer, where is the kryptonite?
Kryptonite location is protected by security access codes.
Computer, do you know who I am?
Lex Luthor, presidential candidate owner and founder of lexcorp industries.
Very good. Now, I'd like...
A corporation that serves as a cover for a variety of Luthor's criminal operations.
Involving smuggling, robbery, extortion, bribery.
Yeah, alright. That's enough.
Here. Let me do it.
Yeah!
Security access, verified.
How much time do we have before those pies go off?
Oh, like five minutes.
Maybe that was five seconds.
Run.
Maybe we should call for Superman.
Go ahead.
Hey, Superman!
See, you can't rely on anyone.
Nice job.
Art is always better if it's bigger.
Hey, isn't that
Bruce Wayne's mansion?
Bruce Wayne?
Really despise that guy.
Hey, guys, sorry it took me a second.
Hey, Batman, I think
I fixed the whirly-bat.
I'm... gonna go work on the batboat now.
Why didn't you tell me
Luthor was involved?
I was handling it.
Yeah, looks like you had it all under control.
Look, I'll hang around and give you a hand.
Remember, I can do anything.
You know what was in there?
What?
- Kryptonite.
That's what they wanted the whole time.
It must be what powers that deconstructing device.
I picked up Krypton on the Batmobile scanner.
So, now they can neutralize your gadgets and my powers.
Question is why?
What are they up to?
I don't know.
Tomorrow is election day, so we're running out of time.
We'll just have to go ask Lex Luthor.
You're just going to walk right into lexcorp headquarters?
Yep. You worried?
Superman does not worry.
'We can take this to get there.' introducing, the new, flying batboat.
You need a hand?
- No, I'm good.
Vice president joker.
Doesn't quite sound right, does it, Lex?
Not really. No.
Alright, sun will be up soon and the voters will be heading out to vote. Let's shut it down.
'Okay, did not need to turn off all the lights. '
Not the way I like to travel.
Come on, cheer up, sourpuss.
Not cool.
Oh, after you.
We're here to see Lex Luthor.
And you are?
Seriously?
Seriously.
I'm Superman. He's Batman.
Are those last names?
Even his receptionist is evil.
Just one name each.
- Like Madonna.
Oh, I see, you're down here.
Mr. Luthor is expecting you.
First elevator.
What's that song?
Sounds familiar.
I don't listen to music.
Either of you guys know the score of the game?
I don't follow sports.
Seven-three, St. Louis. Ah.
Ah, shouldn't have asked.
Nice costumes.
Lex?
Right here.
I'll take it from here.
'You feel okay, Superman? '
I hope you voted before you got here.
'Because you might not be leaving. ' you diseased maniac.
No one is going to elect you president.
Oh, yes, they will.
Once we've flown over the country dispensing my friend, joker's gas, I'll win in a landslide.
I was going to be vice president but I changed my mind.
It wasn't working for me.
Since I was deprived of the man of the year award in Gotham city, we're starting at their city hall.
Sorry, you won't be there.
'When I'm president,
I'll build a statue of you. '
You're not going to build him a statue.
No, I'm not. But you won't be there to call me on it.
Wait a second!
What are you going to do to the dynamic dumdum?
Joker, I have an election to win.
But who will I play with if he's dead?
Robin's still around.
If we eliminate Batman
Robin will probably put on the suit and say he's Batman.
No, it won't be the same.
Wow, did not expect that.
Let's go get out the vote.
'Alright. '
What the...
Joker, do you know how expensive that was?
I've no idea what it cost, no.
Nice plan.
Now, we know what they're up to.
We have to get to Gotham city.
- I should warn you.
I fly close to that kryptonium...
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
I thought I took care of him.
If I had a dollar for every time I said that.
Keep flying.
I'll deal with this.
Ah! Lex, we're losing altitude.
You alright?
- Yeah.
Being that close to the kryptonite weakened me.
We bought ourselves a few minutes.
We've got to get to the centre of town.
I don't think I can fly yet.
I guess we can get there some other way.
Two dollars or a token.
I have tokens.
Fellow citizens, thank you for joining me today.
I don't want to keep you from voting for too long.
I just wanna say a few words.
'What do you think of your presidential candidate? ' we love him.
And you'll do anything he says?
We'll do anything he says.
- We want him as president.
Let's go vote for him.
That's good to hear.
Now, I have a lot of other campaign stops to make today.
So, just say it with me now.
Vote for...
Joker.
Joker for president.
- We love joker.
Oh, did I forget to mention?
The gas just works for me.
Sorry. Oversight.
You, dirty double-crosser!
You tricked me.
I said vice president didn't work for me.
President joker.
Now, that sounds right.
The vice part goes without saying now get in and I'll let you be vice president.
Don't be such an idiot!
They're going to take off.
I've got some of my strength back.
The kryptonite.
I'll slow them down, Batman.
It'll be up to you to stop them.
This time, Lex,
I'm going to pull
Batman apart... literally.
Robin... great job.
What?
I... think I'm going to cry.
Get goin'.
Take a left up here.
Take a hard right.
Now left.
We're not losing them.
- I'm not trying to. Left again.
Where have you been?
- Getting some help.
Well, Batman, any last words?
Yeah. Look, you're on TV.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's also visible from space, you idiot.
Calling all justice leaguers.
'Calling all justice leaguers.'
'Calling all justice leaguers.'
'calling all justice leaguers.'
'Calling all justice leaguers.' what do you want to do?
Well, I do despise,
Bruce Wayne.
Thanks.
- You don't let go yet.
Alright. I wasn't going to.
Why is there a giant robot, climbing up Wayne tower?
A giant robot. Let's get it.
- Follow me, I uh...
...know my way around.
Come and get me.
Yeah...
Let me shake you by the hand.
Jump!
Oh, you're so strong.
Come on.
Go.
Thanks.
We have to stop them.
Are you my mother?
- Yes, give us a hug.
That tickles.
I'm gonna need a little help here.
Get the power source.
It's in his chest.
Wonder woman.
Lead your plane.
Well, that was fun.
There is a little good news.
At least, you're not going to be president.
- Great work, Batman.
- I have to admit.
I couldn't have done it without a little help from my friends.
Uh, a little?
Well, Bruce Wayne said, when he was given the, man of the year award...
...that "everybody needs help now and again."
Well, he was a wise man.
What did you do with all the kryptonite?
I put it in a safe place.
We might need it one day if,
Superman decides to go bad.
See! I'm not the only one.
- You know, I can hear you.
So bats, you need a little help rebuilding the bat cave?
No, Robin and I...
- Yes, we'd like some help.
Say it with me.
Okay, we probably could use some.
Are, are you asking me?
Are you asking me to help you rebuild the bat cave?
Well, no. I was asking, green lantern.
I don't think this is your color.
'Jovian. '
I have located it.
Very nearly there, sir.
I have to say, your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?
Occasionally.
Of course! I've seen you in the newspaper.
- You're a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.
Be patient, Snowy, not much longer.
I do beg your pardon.
There.
I believe I have captured something of your likeness.
Not bad!
What do you think, Snowy?
Snowy!
There you are, sir.
Now where's he run off to?
Anything?
Nothing.
Snowy!
Where have you been?
Chasing cats again?
Snowy, look at this!
Triple masted.
Double decks. Fifty guns.
Isn't she a beauty?
That's a very unique specimen, that is.
From an old sea captain's estate.
"The Unicorn."
Unicorn. Man o'war sailing ship.
It's very old, that is. 16th century.
17th, I would think.
- Reign of Charles I.
- Charles II.
That's what I said, Charles II.
As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.
You won't find another one of these, mate.
And it's only two quid.
- I'll give you a pound.
- Done!
Gently does it.
Excuse me!
Here you go. Careful.
Hey, bud, how much for the boat?
I'm sorry, I just sold it to this young gent.
Oh, yeah?
Tell me what you paid and I'll give you double.
- Double?
- Thanks. But it's not for sale.
Look, kid, I'm trying to help you out.
I don't think you realise this, but you're about to walk into a whole mess of danger.
What kind of danger?
I'm warning you, get rid of the boat and get out while you still can.
These people do not play nice.
What people?
Wonderful!
It's just wonderful.
Don't bother wrapping it, I'll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?
If you want to buy it, you'll have to talk to the kid.
I see.
Well, let the "kid" name his price.
"Name his price"?
Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac and I miss "name your price" by one bleedin' minute!
I'm sorry.
I already explained to the other gentleman.
American he was. All hair oil and no socks.
It's not for sale.
Then let me appeal to your better nature.
I have recently acquired Marlinspike Hall, and this ship, as I'm sure you're aware, was once part of the estate.
Of the late sea captain?
The family fell upon hard times.
Lost everything.
They've been living in a cloud of bad luck ever since.
We are talking generations of drinking and irrational behaviour...
I'm sorry.
But as I told you before, it's not for sale.
Good day to you, sir.
That young man, what's his name?
Him? Everybody knows him. That's Tintin.
What is it about this ship?
Why has it attracted so much attention?
What secrets do you hold?
Where is that magnifying glass?
I could have sworn it was...
Where could it possibly be?
Snowy, you haven't seen the...
Where is it?
Thank you.
No, Snowy!
Look what you did.
You broke it!
Bad dog!
Something happened on this ship.
And we're going to the one place that could have the answer.
Come on, Snowy.
Here it is.
"Sir Francis Haddock of Marlinspike Hall, the last captain of the ill-fated Unicorn."
"The ship set sail from Barbados in 1676"
"on one of the most ruinous voyages in maritime history."
"Ship never reached destination."
"Attacked by pirates, all hands lost except for one survivor."
"When Sir Francis was rescued and returned home,"
"he was convinced his name had been cursed."
"The Unicorn's manifest stated"
"that it was carrying a cargo of rum and tobacco bound for Europe,"
"but it was long claimed the ship was carrying a secret cargo."
What was the ship carrying, Snowy?
"Historians have tried and failed to discover what happened on that fatal voyage,
"but Sir Francis' last words,
"'Only a true Haddock will discover the secret of the Unicorn. "'
I've missed something, Snowy.
We need to take a closer look at that model.
Of course it's gone!
How could I be so stupid?
How'd you do that?
Clever boy.
A coat of arms.
Why does that look familiar?
Hang on a minute.
That fish!
It's a haddock.
Of course!
Marlinspike Hall is the old Haddock estate.
Snowy!
Well done, Snowy!
Good boy.
Well, well, well.
It seems we've caught our thief.
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
I see you let yourself in.
I came to retrieve my property.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.
I think you do.
This ship was stolen from my apartment less than an hour ago.
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr Tintin.
There's no mistake. It belongs to me.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
I took it home,
I put it on a cabinet in the living room, and then Snowy chased the cat and knocked it over, and it fell.
This isn't my ship.
No. Indeed.
I'm sorry.
- It looks identical.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.
Yes, indeed. But I don't understand!
Why did Sir Francis make two ships exactly alike?
And you have one already.
Why do you want another?
What is it about this model that would cause someone to steal it?
Goodness me, why so many questions?
It's my job.
There could be a story here.
That's what I do, you see.
Well, it's no great mystery.
Sir Francis Haddock was a drunkard and a hopeless reprobate.
He was doomed to fail, and he bequeathed that failure to his sons.
So it's true! The Haddock line is cursed.
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?
That depends what you're looking for.
I'm looking for answers, Mr Sakharine.
You're looking in the wrong place.
It's late.
I think you should go home.
This way, sir.
It's a pity, sir.
I'm sorry?
That the mast broke on your model ship, sir.
I hope you found all the pieces.
Things are so easily lost.
Nestor! Where are you?
Good night, sir.
Some things are easily lost.
What did he mean by that, Snowy?
What was he trying to tell me?
Some things are easily lost.
Snowy!
Great snakes!
What is it, Snowy?
What's this?
This was in the mast!
Good boy, Snowy.
"Three brothers joined."
"Three Unicorns in company"
"sailing in the noonday sun will speak."
"For 'tis from the light that light will dawn."
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."
What are these markings?
Some kind of secret language or code?
It makes no sense.
But it does explain why they ransacked the flat.
They were looking for this, and they didn't find it.
Which means they'll be back.
No, I don't know where he is, dearie.
I think he's gone out.
And anyway, it's after dark, and Mr Tintin is most particular about not admitting visitors after bedtime.
I have to go back to my cocoa.
I've got a very good book and a cup of cocoa.
It's really lovely!
Thank you, Mrs Finch.
I can look after this.
Hey, kid, is that you? Open the door.
What do you want?
Look, the game is up. He's gonna be back.
Now, I know he wanted those boats, but I swear to God,
I never thought he'd kill anyone over it!
Who? Who are you talking about?
I'm trying to tell you that your life is in danger.
Answer me! Who?
Mrs Finch!
A man's been shot on our doorstep!
- Not again.
- Call an ambulance!
No, Snowy!
Can you hear me?
Can you...
The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.
He was one of the top agents at Interpol, but we haven't got a clue what he was working on.
Quite right, Thompson.
We're completely clueless.
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?
Steady on, Tintin.
We're still filling out the paperwork.
Police work's not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.
Well, I might have something for you.
Before he lost consciousness,
Dawes tried to tell me something, and I think he was spelling out a word.
"...B- O-U"
"D-J-A-N."
"Karaboudjan."
Karaboudjan!
Does that mean anything to you?
Great Scotland Yard! That's extraordinary!
What is?
Worthington's have a half-price sale on bowler hats!
Really, Thomson! This is hardly the time.
- Great Scotland Yard!
- What is it?
Canes are half-price, too!
Are you going to take charge of this evidence?
Positively.
Never fear, Tintin, the evidence is safe with us!
Thomson? Where are you?
Well, I'm already downstairs.
Do try to keep up.
Wait! You dropped this.
Good heavens, Thomson!
Look after the evidence, man.
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.
Yes. Our light-fingered larcenist.
- What?
- The pickpocket.
He has no idea what's coming.
Go on, Tintin, take my wallet.
Yes, industrial strength elastic.
Very resourceful.
On the contrary. It was childishly simple.
Simply childish, I agree.
- Tintin.
- Tintin.
Gentlemen.
Mind you, I expect he's miles away by now.
I presume you're referring to the pickpocket?
Yes. I mean, knowing we're just a few steps behind him.
Snowy, what is it, boy? What do you see?
I don't suppose you'd fancy a cup of tea?
You're quite mistaken. I'd love one.
My treat.
- I've got you now!
- You devil!
Stop, in the name of the law!
Got you!
What's going on down there?
Come on, Snowy!
- I do beg your pardon.
- Sorry, sir!
The pickpocket, Tintin! He's getting away!
My wallet!
It's gone!
Come on! Snowy, after him!
Stop! Wait!
- Got you!
- Steady on.
I've lost him!
You must find my wallet.
It's very important. I have to get it back.
And you will.
Leave it to the professionals.
We've lost the scroll.
But we haven't lost the story.
"Karaboudjan."
It's an Armenian word.
That's our lead, Snowy.
What was Barnaby Dawes trying to tell us when he said our lives were in danger?
- Mr Tin... Tin?
- Yes.
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn't order anything.
Well, that's because it's you that's getting delivered!
Quick, get him in the van!
Get off me, you confounded mutt!
He bit me!
Quick!
Get him off!
Shake him off, then run him over!
I want this on the starboard side!
Not here. Look your side.
Hang on.
- Nothing.
- Well, check that pocket, Tom.
No, I've looked in this one already,
I'm sure of it.
Well, have a look in his socks.
- Have you found it?
- He doesn't have it.
It's not on him, boss. It's not here.
- Not here? Then where is it?
- Where's what?
I am tired of your games.
The scroll, from the Unicorn.
A piece of paper like this!
You mean the poem?
Yes.
- The poem written in Old English.
- Yes.
- It was inside a cylinder.
- Yes.
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes!
I don't have it.
You know the value of that scroll.
Why else would you take it?
Two ships and two scrolls, both part of a puzzle.
You have one, you need the other.
But that's not it. There's something else.
I will find it, with or without your help.
You need to think about exactly how useful you are to me.
- We'll deal with him on the way.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Hold this course.
Snowy!
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.
He's lying! He must have the scroll.
The question is, what has he done with it?
We searched him all over, boss.
I want you to go back down there and make him talk.
Break every bone in his body if you have to!
That's nasty.
You know the stakes.
You know what we're playing for. Just do it!
Mr Sakharine! Mr Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!
It's a disaster!
The captain has come around.
- What?
- He's conscious.
He's accusing you of mutiny.
- He says you turned the crew against him.
- Sounds like he's sobered up again.
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him another bottle.
Aye, sir!
Okay.
- Jiggle it a bit, it's just stuck.
- Jiggle?
Here.
What are you doing? Get off!
It's not stuck, you idiot.
He's bolted it from the inside!
So you want to play like that then, do you, Tintin?
Get the TNT.
Broken crates. Rope. Champagne.
What else do we have, Snowy?
There are other ways to open this door.
They'll be swabbing the decks with your innards when we're done with you.
Give it here.
- Don't move.
- What...
Let's go!
Let me have him!
He's got a big shooter!
He got me!
Hold your fire.
He ain't here. He's vanished.
He's hiding.
Search the ship. Quickly!
A giant rat of Sumatra!
So, you thought you could sneak in behind me and catch me with my trousers down, huh?
I'd rather you kept your trousers on, if it's all the same to you.
- I know your game. You're one of them.
- Sorry?
- They sent you here to kill me, huh?
- Look, I don't know who you are!
That's how he's planned to bump me off.
Murdered in my bed by a baby-faced assassin!
Assassin? Look, you've got it all wrong.
I was kidnapped by a gang of thugs.
The filthy swine.
He's turned the whole crew against me!
Who?
A sour-faced man with a sugary name.
He's bought them all off, every last man.
Sakharine!
Nobody takes my ship!
You're the captain?
Of course I'm the captain.
Who else could I be?
I've been locked in this room for days with only whisky to sustain my mortal soul.
Well, I assumed it was locked.
Well, it's not.
Now, you must excuse me.
If they find me here, they'll kill me.
I have to keep moving.
Try and find my way off this drunken tub.
"Tub"? Tub?
Tub?
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.
I'm Tintin, by the way.
Haddock. Archibald Haddock.
There's a longboat up on deck. Follow me.
Hang on a second.
Did you say "Haddock"?
How could you let them escape?
Find them. Find them both.
- Don't worry, we'll kill them, sir.
- No.
You can kill the boy. Not Haddock.
What? He's just a hopeless old soak.
We should've killed him long since.
You think it's an accident that I chose Haddock's ship, Haddock's crew,
Haddock's treacherous first mate?
Nothing is an accident.
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock and I.
We've unfinished business.
And this time, I'm going to make him pay.
We have to reach a locked door at the end of this corridor. This is gonna be tricky.
You wouldn't happen to be related to the Haddocks of Marlinspike Hall, would you?
Why do you ask?
It's for a story I've been working on.
An old shipwreck that happened off the coast of Barbados.
A man o'war. Triple masted. Fifty guns.
- What do you know of the Unicorn?
- Not a lot. That's why I'm asking you.
The secret of that ship is known only to my family!
It's been passed down from generation to generation.
My granddaddy himself, with his dying breath, told me the tale.
And?
Gone.
What do you mean, gone?
I was so upset when he kicked the bucket,
I had no choice but to drown my sorrows.
When I woke up in the morning, it was gone!
I'd forgotten it all.
- Everything?
- Every last word.
Well, is there somebody else in your family?
Maybe they would know.
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed.
I am the last of the Haddocks!
Did you say three sons?
Let's check below!
There is a bottle of rum for the man who finds Haddock.
And kill the boy. Hope I find him first.
What's that?
You're hearing things.
Quiet, Ali.
There's nothing there.
Let's go up.
I know what Sakharine's looking for.
- What are you raving on about?
- It was written on the scroll.
"Three brothers joined."
"Three Unicorns in company sailing in the noonday sun will speak."
Really?
Sir Francis didn't make two models of the Unicorn.
He made three!
Three ships for three sons.
Excellent!
Sakharine's after the third model ship.
Barnacles! Someone's locked the door!
- Well, is there a key?
- A key?
Yes, now, that would be the problem.
Mr Jaggerman!
Top bunk in the centre. Keeper of the keys.
Careful, mind. He's a restless sleeper on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.
- He lost his eyelids?
- Aye.
Now, that was a card game to remember.
You really had to be there.
I'd do this myself, Tintin, but you've a lighter tread and less chance of waking the boys.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- You've nothing to worry about.
Provided they all stay asleep.
I wouldn't get too close to Mr Hobbs.
He's very handy with a razor.
And I'd steer clear of Mr Gitch.
Sacked as a shepherd on account of his "animal husbandry."
Not the sandwich.
The keys!
You're a brave lad, Tintin.
My heart was in my mouth,
I don't mind telling you.
Well, that is, if it was my heart.
Judging by my stomach, it could've been anything, really.
Hurry up, Captain! We've no time to lose.
Bingo!
Just the necessities, of course.
To the lifeboats.
Ease it in!
Put your back into it!
Hold her there, steady!
Any sign of him, Jumbo?
Nothing yet. Watch yourself.
The boss says he's a handful.
Come on.
It's Allan.
- Is that the bridge?
- Aye, on the other side of the radio room.
Radio room?
Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone comes.
Careful, Tintin.
I can't see a thing!
Quit your whining and find the kid!
I didn't sign on for this!
Keep searching!
- Message just come through, boss.
- What's it say?
"The Milanese Nightingale has landed.
Waiting in the wings for action."
"Milanese Nightingale"?
Now pray this cheers him up.
"Bagghar."
What's this?
"The Sultanate of Bagghar"
"ruled over by Sheikh Omar Ben Salaad,"
"whose love of music and culture is matched only by his love of..."
Great snakes!
Bagghar.
The Port of Bagghar.
Morocco.
Tintin!
Hey! Put your hands up!
And let that be a lesson to you!
Help me!
In here! He's in here!
Here! By the lifeboats!
Out of the way!
After him! Get him!
Quick, quick, in here!
Over there!
Why, you little...
- He's up there!
- Go!
I can see him now!
Don't let them get away!
Help me!
- Turn this ship around!
- Aye, sir!
Get me a flare!
Captain, get down! Get down!
- There he is!
- Get out of the way!
Now! Full ahead! Full speed!
Got you now.
Stay down.
Look! Down there!
Idiots! You idiots! What have you done?
We killed them, boss, like you wanted!
No! Not like I wanted!
I needed Haddock alive!
Wait a minute, boss!
There are two boats missing!
So, that one must have been a decoy.
They're onto us, and our destination.
Find them! Make absolutely certain they never reach Bagghar!
Yes, boss.
Get up there!
We have to get to Bagghar ahead of Sakharine.
I know. I know.
Why?
Because he has the third model ship.
How do you know?
The Sheikh collects old ships. And this is the prize of his collection.
Blistering blue barnacles, that is the Unicorn!
Captain, do you see the distortion around the model?
Aye.
It means that Ben Salaad exhibits it in a bulletproof glass case in his palace.
And Sakharine is going there to steal it!
Yes, he has a secret weapon.
The Milanese Nightingale.
But that won't be enough to solve the mystery, and that is why Sakharine needs you.
That's why he made you his prisoner.
There is something he needs you to remember.
I don't follow you.
I read it in a book.
That only a true Haddock can discover the secret of the Unicorn.
I don't remember anything about anything.
But you must know about your ancestors,
Sir Francis. It's your family legacy!
My memory is not what it used to be.
- Well, what did it used to be?
- I've forgotten.
Captain, can you get us to Bagghar?
What sort of a stupid question is that?
Give me those oars!
I'll show you some real seamanship, laddie.
I'll not be doubted by some pipsqueak tuft of ginger and his irritating dog!
I am master and commander of the seas!
I know these waters better than the warts on my mother's face!
Look at the pair of them. Fast asleep.
Typical landlubbers.
Aye, no stamina these days.
Never mind. I'll get you there, Tintin.
Look, Thomson. There's the fellow.
Oh, my.
- Mr Silk?
- Yes?
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson.
- We're police officers!
- We're police officers!
Oh, crumbs.
Good gracious!
- Mr Silk!
- Mr Silk!
- Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Are you okay?
Poor fellow!
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right, sir?
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you, that's very kind.
- No need to run away, sir.
- No, no, you see, yesterday we very nearly caught the pickpocket who's been terrorising the town!
Pickpocket?
We pulled his jacket off and inside we found a wallet.
A wallet with your name and address!
- That's my wallet.
- Well, it's obvious he stole it from you.
- No, no, that's my wallet.
- Are you all right, sir?
We didn't mean to startle you.
Let us help you into your apartment.
Thank you so much. No need to come in.
I'll be quite all right, really.
- No, we insist.
- Better safe than sorry.
- It's the least we can do.
- Thank you.
There we are.
Good grief! What's all this?
It's my collection?
- What a lot of wallets!
- I can't help it.
It started with coin purses and sort of went on from there, really.
You want to be careful. Haven't you heard?
There's a pickpocket about.
- Yes, he'd love this. Can you imagine?
- What do you mean, "pickpocket"?
A master criminal.
A bag-snatching, purse-pilfering, wallet-lifting sneak thief!
I'm not a bad person.
I'm a kleptomaniac.
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.
Poor man. No wonder he keeps his wallets in the living room.
Wallets. I just can't resist the lovely little things.
It's a harmless little habit, really.
Good heavens, Thomson, look at this!
His name's Thompson, too.
What a coincidence.
No, Thomson, this is Thomson without a "P," as in "psychic."
No, no, no, it's Thompson with a "P," as in "psychologist."
Look at this one!
A green one that I managed to pick from a pickpocket actually pickpocketing at the time.
- And this one! Cuir de cochon.
- No, you have it all wrong.
- There is a "P" in "psychic."
- I am not your sidekick! You are mine!
- Smell it, won't you? Piggy leather!
- No, you have it all wrong.
- How dare you!
- How dare you!
- I met you first.
- I met you first.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.
- Didn't!
- Did!
- Listen! I can't stand it any more!
- Hey!
All right, I'll come quietly.
Take them! Take them! Take them all!
Stop it. Pull yourself together, man!
We can't take your wallets!
Do we look like thieves?
Good heavens, Thompson.
This looks familiar.
Can't be.
It is!
- Tintin!
- Tintin!
I'm so cold.
And thirsty.
My throat is parched.
Let's see if there's any fresh water.
What have we here?
Tintin.
Come and warm yourself, laddie.
Captain?
- What have you done?
- No need to thank me.
What?
Well, you looked a little cold, so I lit a wee fire.
In a boat?
No! Those are our oars! We need those oars!
Yes, but not for much longer.
Have you gone mad?
Quick, Captain, help me!
- Captain, help me, quick!
- He's right. What have I done?
- What have I done?
- No, Captain, not that!
Thundering typhoons!
Well, this is a fine mess.
- I'm weak.
- We're stranded here...
- Selfish.
...with no hope of rescue...
I'm hopeless.
While Sakharine and his men are halfway to Bagghar.
Poor, miserable wretch!
Yes, all right. That's enough of that.
It was his fault, you see.
It was Sir Francis.
Tell me, how did you work that one out?
Because he was a figurehead of great courage and bold exploits.
No one like him ever existed in my family.
Why do you think I drink?
Because I know I'll never be like him.
No, it's far better that I end it now.
Put us both out of our misery.
What is it, Snowy?
I'm gonna lower myself into the sea.
Into the cold embrace of the big blue!
Those are Portuguese markings.
- Are you even listening?
- Where is the Karaboudjan registered?
We're saved.
We're saved!
It's a sign from above!
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.
Slave-traders! Mutant malingerers!
Freshwater politicians!
Bad news, Captain.
We've only got one bullet.
- And what's the good news?
- We've got one bullet.
You got him!
Well done, my boy.
Stay here, Captain.
Tintin?
- Don't take your eyes off of them.
- Hurry up!
Just as I thought.
The ignition lead has been cut.
Lucky shot!
One more pass, and we will finish them off.
Put your hands in the air.
Now!
Let's see here.
You do know what you're doing, eh, Tintin?
More or less.
Well, which is it? More or less?
Relax. I interviewed a pilot once.
Which way to North Africa?
Captain, look!
We've caught up with them.
Wonderful!
But you think we might find another way to North Africa that doesn't take us through that Wall of Death?
We can't turn back.
Not now.
No, Captain! Those are surgical spirits for medicinal purposes only.
Quite right, laddie, quite right.
No, no, no!
The fuel tank! It's almost empty!
Captain! This may sound crazy, but I've got a plan.
The alcohol in that bottle may give us a few more miles.
I need you to climb out of the plane and pour it into the fuel tank.
Christopher Columbus!
There's a terrible storm out there.
And it's raining.
And you call yourself a Haddock?
Captain!
Captain! Can you hear me?
Captain!
Captain?
You're doing fine!
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.
We're running on fumes.
Fumes!
Oh, no.
Captain! I can't see!
Land! Land!
We can't! We're not there yet!
No, land!
No, no, no, starboard!
Starboard! Starboard!
Hang on, Tintin!
I'm coming!
The Land of Thirst.
- The Land of Thirst.
- Will you stop saying that?
You don't understand. I've run out.
I've run out.
You don't know what that means.
Captain, we have to keep going.
One step at a time. Come on, on your feet!
Lean your weight on me.
A man can only hang on so long without his vitals.
Captain, calm down.
There are worse things than sobering up.
Look! Tintin!
We're saved.
Water. Water!
Stop! Captain!
It's just a mirage!
But it was here. I saw it.
It was just your mind playing tricks.
It's the heat!
I have to go home.
- What?
- I have to go back to the sea.
Captain, you're hallucinating.
Look.
Did you ever see a more beautiful sight?
She's turning into the wind, all sails set.
Triple masted.
Double decks. Fifty guns.
The Unicorn?
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes! Yes, she is!
Tell me, Captain, what else can you see?
She's got the wind behind her.
Look at the pace she's setting!
Barely a day out of Barbados, a hold full of rum and the finest tobacco and the hearts of the sailors set for home.
The red pennant.
The blood runs cold in every sea captain who looks upon that flag, for he knows he's facing a fight to the death.
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.
And Haddocks don't flee.
All hands on deck!
Gunners to their stations!
Let's unload the King's shot into these yellow-bellied, lily-livered sea slugs!
- Prepare to bring her about, Mr Nicholls.
- Aye-aye, Captain!
Prepare to bring her about!
Fire!
Portside gun, fire!
Look lively, lads!
- Mr Nicholls, secure the cargo.
- Right you are, sir.
Prepare to repel all boarders!
This way! We need more men!
And then he saw him.
Like a phantom, rising from the dead.
Who?
Captain, who did he see?
It's gone.
What do you mean, gone?
What happened next?
By Jupiter, I have a beard!
Since when did I have a beard?
Captain, something happened on the Unicorn.
It's the key to everything.
You must try to remember.
The Unicorn? What? I'm so terribly thirsty.
- Captain!
- Tintin!
What is happening to me?
And to think all it took was a day in the Sahara.
Congratulations, Captain, you're sober.
Sober.
Good dog!
This one's alive.
- Check the other!
- Yes, sir.
Company, halt!
I'm Lieutenant Delcourt.
Welcome to the Afghar Outpost.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
We owe you our lives.
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he's not in good shape, I'm afraid.
He's still suffering the effects of acute dehydration. He's quite delirious.
Why don't we pay him a visit?
Haddock! You're awake.
Good! I have a visitor for you.
- Captain?
- Hello!
I think you've got the wrong room.
Captain, it's Tintin.
Our plane crashed in the desert.
Don't you remember?
Plane? No, no, I'm a naval man myself.
I never fly if I can help it.
He's got me confused with someone else.
What is this peculiar liquid?
There's no bouquet.
It's completely transparent.
Why, it's water.
What will they think of next?
We suspect he has a concussion.
Heatstroke. Delirium.
He's sober.
Now, Captain, out in the desert...
- The desert?
- Yes. You were talking about Sir Francis.
- Sir who?
- Sir Francis.
And you were telling me about what happened on the Unicorn.
- The unicorn!
- Yes!
The stuff that dreams are made of.
Wee children's dreams.
No, the ship.
Please try to remember, Captain.
Lives are at risk.
Snowy, what have you done?
I'd stand back if I were you.
Out! Everybody out of the room!
Snowy!
This man is insane!
Show yourself, Red Rackham!
If it's a fight you want, you've met your match!
A fight with who?
To the death, Red Rackham!
No, wait!
Wait. Captain...
I remember everything now.
Everything Granddaddy told me.
The Unicorn was taken.
The pirates were now masters of the ship.
The crew surrendered?
Granddaddy said that Red Rackham called Sir Francis the King's dog.
A pirate hunter sent to reclaim their hard-won plunder.
Why would I waste my time on rum, tobacco, molasses and dates when you have a more valuable cargo onboard?
Where is it?
You'll have to kill me first.
Not first, no.
Please.
I'll start with your men.
To save his men, he would give up the secret cargo.
And where was it?
Four hundredweight of gold, jewels and treasure.
Kill his men!
No, Rackham! No!
Rackham, you gave me your word! Rackham!
Rackham!
Sir Francis knew he was doomed.
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm.
But they didn't reckon on one thing!
Sir Francis was a Haddock.
And a Haddock always has a trick up his sleeve.
And with that, he hurls himself forward!
On the pirates? Like that? Unarmed?
No! No, on a bottle of rum rolling on the deck.
And he opens it up, and puts it to his lips, and...
And then he stops.
"This is no time for drinking," he says.
"I need all my wits about me."
With that, he puts down the bottle and...
Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle...
And he seizes a cutlass.
And then he makes his way to the ship's magazine, where they keep all the gunpowder and the shot!
You dog!
You'd blow us sky high?
Come on, then.
Let's have you.
Not this time.
You!
Captain, what is it?
How could I be so blind?
What are you talking about?
This isn't just about the scrolls or...
Or the treasure that went down with the ship.
It's me.
It's me he's after!
You'll suffer a curse upon you and your name, Haddock.
He wants vengeance.
Come back and face me!
- Hurry, Tintin.
- What?
- We're out of time.
- Captain!
I curse you!
I curse your name and all who come after!
We will meet again, Haddock!
In another time! In another life!
It's not over. It was never over!
I don't understand. Who's after your blood?
- Sakharine!
- Sakharine? Why?
He's Red Rackham's descendent!
He means to finish it!
- That's why he did it.
- Did what?
Sank his own ship. Sir Francis sent that treasure to the bottom of the sea.
He would be damned before he let Red Rackham have it.
- And he was.
- But he couldn't let it lie.
- No.
- He left a clue.
Three clues wrapped in a riddle, concealing a secret.
But only a true Haddock would be able to solve it.
- What secret?
- The location.
To one of the greatest sunken treasures in all history.
The wreck of the Unicorn.
He means to steal it! The third scroll!
Billions of blue, blistering barnacles!
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him!
To Bagghar.
He's here.
It's no good. They could be anywhere.
Captain.
Don't look now, but we're being followed.
Yes, we are.
What do you want?
Why are you following us?
Who are you working for?
Captain, stop! Stop!
- Thompson and Thomson.
- Not so loud.
- We're in disguise.
- So I see.
You got the message I sent from the ship?
Yes, well, bit of a long story, that.
The upshot is we caught the thief, retrieved your wallet, and then hopped on the next plane to Bagghar.
Yes, that pocket picker has picked his last pocket.
There. Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.
It's not the money I'm worried about.
The odds are even.
Now, to find the next two scrolls.
The Milanese Nightingale.
That's his secret weapon?
- My!
- My!
What a dish.
Enchanted, signora!
Benvenuto! Welcome! Marhaba!
We are blessed with your presence.
Yes. Indeed, Signor Salad!
What charming peasants.
May I introduce my escort,
Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff.
He's been very passionate in his support of this concert.
It's my first visit to the Third World.
Please forgive me. I must escort madame to her dressing room. Excuse us.
After you.
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello...
Here. I want you to look after this.
- What are you doing?
- Me?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
If I'm caught,
I don't want them to find this on me.
Look, just keep it hidden.
I will guard this with my life!
Get up! Get up!
It's her!
Blistering barnacles!
What's that noise?
My ears,
- they're bleeding.
- No, they're not.
Captain.
Shut up, Snowy.
Oh, Columbus, it's every man for himself!
Make way.
Make way! Medical emergency.
That was close.
Hello, Captain.
You!
Oh, no!
Sakharine!
The falcon! Snowy, after him!
Tintin! Tintin!
Those two! There!
They're here to steal your ship!
No, no, no, no, no, we're not!
Arrest him! The ugly one!
- No, wait!
- Who, me?
Yes!
Thief! Arrest him!
Captain!
- Sakharine's got the scroll!
- It's worse than that.
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll, Tintin. It's gone.
How? What happened?
It was Allan.
He knobbled me in the garden, and then
- there was a bottle of alcohol and...
- There always is.
No, no! No, not like that.
I can smell it on you.
Hurry. Back to the boat.
- Tintin! Where are you going?
- I'm going after Sakharine.
- By yourself?
- Yes!
Come on, Snowy!
Catch them, catch them!
Lose them! Get him off our tail!
Did you hit anything?
Oh, dear.
Faster, you idiot, faster!
Not again!
- I'll have those, thank you.
- Come on, Snowy!
No!
Incoming falcon at four o'clock!
Tintin, faster!
- The scrolls!
- I got one, two...
And three!
Snowy!
Oh, no! Not again.
Come here, my beauty.
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
Come here, you pilfering parakeet!
Captain, the bird! Grab it!
Nice work, Snowy! Don't let him go!
You blue blistering barnacles!
Hang on, Snowy! Snowy, I'm coming!
There he is! Stop!
That's right, that's right, come to Daddy.
Come to Daddy.
Gotcha!
No!
Geronimo!
You double-dealing, pilfering parasites!
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
Gotcha!
The scrolls are lining up.
These are hidden numbers.
What does it say?
I wouldn't do that if I were you!
Let the bird go.
What do you value more, those scrolls or Haddock's life?
Don't listen to him.
You'll never get away with this, you sour-faced sassonack!
I will kill him.
Don't worry about me, Tintin, I'm fine.
Let the bird go now, or this man dies!
No! Wait!
You two-timing troglodyte!
You simpering son of a po-faced profiteer!
Perhaps we should put it to the test.
Here's mud in your eye.
Fathead!
Captain!
- We're saved!
- I love the beach.
- You said you wanted a holiday.
- Quite.
Very good.
- Nobody takes my ship!
- They've already taken it.
Nobody takes my ship twice!
We'll show them, won't we, Tintin?
All right then, what's the plan?
There is no plan.
Of course there's a plan.
You've always got a plan.
Not this time.
Sakharine has the scrolls.
They'll lead him to the treasure.
It could be anywhere in the world.
We'll never see him again.
It's over.
I thought you were an optimist.
Well, you were wrong, weren't you?
I'm a realist.
That's just another name for a quitter.
You can call me what you like.
Don't you get it? We failed.
"Failed."
There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure.
A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse!
Don't you ever say it of yourself.
You send out the wrong signal.
That is what people pick up.
Do you understand?
You care about something, you fight for it.
You hit a wall, you push through it.
There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin.
You can never let it defeat you.
What did you just say?
You hit a wall, you push through it.
No, no, no, you said something about sending out a signal.
Of course! Captain!
I sent a radio message from the Karaboudjan.
I know what radio frequency they're transmitting on.
Well, how does that help us?
All we have to do is send that information to Interpol, they can track the signals and figure out which way they're headed.
Here comes Interpol now.
- Tintin!
- Tintin!
Any port they enter we'll know at once.
And we can get there first.
What are we doing here, boss? I don't get it.
We're right back where we started.
You're to speak of this to no one.
Keep your mouths shut.
- Don't worry. As long as we get our share.
- You'll get your share.
- Where are you going?
- Just guard the ship.
Where's the filthy moolah?
Good evening, sir.
I trust you had a successful trip abroad.
Do I pay you to talk to me?
You don't pay me at all.
What the blazes? Nestor!
Nestor!
Tom! Allan!
You blithering idiots, don't just stand there! Do something!
Caught him like a rat in a trap.
Congratulations, gentlemen. He's all yours.
Yes! We also have an arrest warrant issued by both Interpol and the FBI.
- Your friend who got shot...
- Barnaby.
He was one of their agents.
Hot on Sakharine's trail from the start.
It still doesn't make sense.
He has the key to the treasure of the Unicorn, which is sitting somewhere on the ocean floor.
Why would he come back home?
Right.
- Sakharine?
- Sakharine?
That's Mr Sakharine to you.
Hold it.
- Look out!
- What...
Oh, no!
Allan! Allan, get me down!
What? Not that way!
Not that way, you fool, the other way!
Right.
Look out!
Good Lord! Come on!
Close but no cigar!
- Red Rackham!
- That's right. My ancestor.
Just as Sir Francis was yours.
Unfinished business.
I'm glad you know the truth, Haddock.
Until you could remember, killing you wouldn't have been this much fun.
Who gave you permission to board my ship?
I don't need it.
I've never needed it.
The legend says only a Haddock can discover the secret of the Unicorn, but it took a Rackham to get the job done.
So you've lost again, Haddock.
That's right. Why don't you have a drink?
That's all you've got left, isn't it?
Everything that was rightfully yours is now mine.
Including this ship.
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.
We have you now, you devil.
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise, you are under arrest.
Do you see?
Blistering barnacles, they're coordinates.
- It took all three scrolls to form the numbers.
- Latitude and longitude.
That is it.
That's the location of the treasure.
We did it!
Almost there, Mr Tintin!
A nudge to starboard should do it.
- Are you sure we're on course?
- Trust me, laddie.
I know these parts like the back of my hand.
Starboard! Quickly! Quickly!
Aye, Captain, starboard it is!
All stop!
Marlinspike Hall.
Those coordinates lead here.
And this is where Sir Francis hid it?
I thought the treasure went down with the ship.
Master Haddock, Mr Tintin,
I've been expecting you.
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
Will you look at this place?
I don't think it's changed at all since I was a wee boy.
And may I say, sir, how much I'm looking forward to having a Haddock back in charge of the estate.
You'll be waiting a long time, Nestor.
There's no way I could afford to live here!
Well, Captain, you know the house.
Where do we start?
Is the cellar still here?
No, no, no, no, this isn't it.
I meant the other cellar.
I'm sorry, sir, there is no "other cellar."
It was bigger than this.
Snowy.
Snowy, where are you?
No, Hector.
Hector.
Captain, help me.
Heel, boy.
Snowy?
Just like you said, Captain.
You hit a wall... you push through it.
My grandfather must have walled it up before he lost the house.
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."
Well, I can see the cross, but where's the eagle?
St John the Evangelist, who was always depicted with an eagle.
And he's called the Eagle of Patmos.
He is the eagle.
What's he trying to tell us, Captain?
I'm at a loss.
That island, the one in the middle, that doesn't exist.
How do you know?
Because I've sailed those waters countless times.
I've been there. It's a mistake.
What if it isn't?
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance to go to a man who was worthy of it.
A man like himself, who knows the seas like the back of his hand.
A man who could look at a globe and tell if one tiny island was out of place.
Blistering treasure.
It's Red Rackham's barnacles!
What is this?
Just a wee tipple.
A toast to our good fortune.
That's better.
It's odd, really. You would've thought, after all the fuss and bother, there would've been more.
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.
I mean, by your account, he looted half of South America. I just thought...
Never mind. There's plenty to go around.
It's a funny old life, eh?
Well, you've got your story for your newspaper.
All's well that ends well.
It's not ended.
Sir Francis left another clue at the bottom of the globe.
- A clue to what?
- Four hundredweight of gold, just lying at the bottom of the sea.
How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?
Unquenchable, Tintin.

Oh! Paté! Hello!
I have a message from the Interior

He's not happy with all the destruction caused by your psychopathic chase in pursuit of your own ambitions.
But as everyone can plainly see,
I have risked my life.
Paté, I have slain the monster.
- Tell that to the Minister.
- With pleasure.
Victor Maynott, I am arresting you for the premeditated murder of Monsieur Francoeur.
What? Have you lost your mind?
The opposite.
I was so set on being a loyal officer,
I did not see the road you had taken us down.
I needed a flea to show me the way.
Are you mad?
It was just a miserable little flea!
You are so wrong, sir.
There was more humanity in that flea than in the louse I see before me now!

TANGLED 2010 DVDRIP - PRESTIGE
* = Music or songs
Lovingly cooked by 'Bake Master'
(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.
Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.
This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.
And it starts, with the sun.
Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic, golden, flower.
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?
You might want to remember her.
She's kind of important.
Well, centuries pass and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby,
but she got sick,
really, sick.
She was running out of time.
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.
You see instead of sharing the suns gift,
this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power
and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.
Mother Gothel: *Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine*
*What once was mine*
Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?
We've found it!
Flynn: The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.
With beautiful golden hair.
I'll give you a hint.
That's Rapunzel.
To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.
And then that moment ended.
Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow, let your powers shine*
*Make the clock re...*
HUH!
(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,
stole the child, and just like that...gone.
The Kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the Princess.
For deep within the forest
In a hidden tower.
Gothel raised the child as her own.
*...bring what has been lost, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine.*
Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.
Why can't I go outside?
The outside world is a dangerous place.
Filled with horrible, selfish people.
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.
But the walls of that tower, could not hide everything.
Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky.
In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.
HAH!
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.
GOTCHA!
That's twenty two for me.
How about twenty three, out of forty five?
Okay, well, what do you want to do?
Yeah, I don't think so.
I like it in here and so do you.
Oh, come on Pascal, it's not so bad in there.
*Sings "When will my life begin"*
*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*
*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*
*Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up.*
*Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.*
*So I'll read a book, or maybe two or three.*
*Ill add a few new paintings to my gallery.*
*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook and basically.*
*Just wonder when will my life, begin.*
*Then after lunch, it's puzzles, and darts and baking.*
*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet, and chess.*
*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*
*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*
*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*
*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush, and brush my hair.*
*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*
*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering...*
*Wondering, when will my life begin?*
*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*
*Just like they do on my birthday, each year.*
*What is it like, out there where they glow?*
*Now that I'm older. Mother might just let me go.*
Wow!
I could get used to a view like this.
-Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.
We do this job, you could buy your own castle.
Oh, hay fever?
Yeah.
Huh?
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!
Can't you picture me in a castle of my own?
'Cause I certainly can.
Oh, the things we've seen and it's only eight in the morning.
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.
This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal.
I'm finally going to do it.
-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!
Let down your hair.
It's time.
I know, I know. Come on, don't let her see you.
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.
Coming, mother.
Hi, welcome home, mother.
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do that every single day, without fail, it looks absolutely exhausting, darling.
Oh, it's nothing.
Then I don't know why it takes so long.
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.
Oh look, you're here too.
I'm just teasing, stop taking everything so seriously.
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.
Would you sing for me, dear?
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*
*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!
TADA!
No, no, no can't be.
I distinctly remember. Your birthday was last year.
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.
And I wanted to ask, what I really want for this birthday.
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.
You know how I feel about the mumbling.
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.
-What?
-Oh,...
Well I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights.
Oh, you mean the stars.
That's the thing
I've charted stars and they're always constant.
But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother.
Only on my birthday.
And I can't help but feel that they're,
They're meant for me.
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.
In person.
I have to know what they are.
You want to go outside?
Oh, why Rapunzel.
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.
(Gothel Sings "Mother knows best")
*Still a little sapling, just a sprout.*
-*You know why we stay up in this tower*
-Rapunzel: I know, but...
*That’s right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.*
*Guess I always knew this day was coming.*
*Know that soon you'd want to leave the nest.*
-*Soon, but not yet. Shhh..*
-But
*Trust me pet,
Mother, knows best.*
*Mother knows best,*
*listen to your mother.*
*It's a scary world out there.*
*Mother knows best.*
*One way or another, something will go wrong, I swear.*
*Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy, quicksand.*
*Cannibals, and snakes, the plague...yes.*
*Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.*
*And stop, no more, you'll just upset me.*
*Mother's right here, mother will protect you.*
*Darling here's what I suggest.*
*Skip the drama, stay with Mama.*
*Mother, knows best.*
*Mother knows best.
Take it from your mumsey.*
*On your own, you won't survive.*
*Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,*
*Please, they'll eat you up, alive.*
*Gullible, naïve, positively grubby.*
*Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague.*
*Plus I believe, getting kinda chubby.*
*I'm just saying,
'Cause I wuv you.*
*Mother understands,
Mothers here to help you.*
*All I have is one request.*
-Rapunzel?
-Yes?
Don't ever ask to leave this tower, again.
Yes, Mother.
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Don't forget it.
*You'll regret it.*
*Motherrrrrrr.*
*Knows best.*
Ta, ta, I'll see you in a bit, my flower.
I'll be here.
No, no no. This is bad, this is very, very bad, This is really bad.
They just can't get my nose right.
Who cares.
Well it's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.
All right, okay. Give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.
Give us the satchel first.
Wha..? I just...
I can't believe, that after all we've been through together, you don't trust me.
Ouch.
Now help us up, pretty boy.
Sorry, my hands are full.
What?
RYDER!
-Retrieve that satchel with any force.
-Yes, sir!
We got him now, Maximus.
Heeyah!
Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.
No.
No, stop it.
Stop it.
Give it to me.
HAH!
-AHHHHH!
-WHINNEYY!
Oh!
Alone at last.
Huh?
Aah!
Okay, okay, I got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet!
To weak to handle myself out there, huh Mother?
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.
Hmmm.
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair.
One moment, Mother.
I have a big surprise.
Uh, I do too.
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.
I seriously doubt it.
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.
Surprise!
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.
Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.
Okay, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, earlier.
I hope you're not still talking about the stars.
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.
No Mother, I'm just saying, you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.
Oh darling, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.
-Trust me,...
-Rapunzel.
-...I know what I'm
-Rapunzel.
-Oh, come on.
-Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.
All I was gonna say, mother is that...
I know what I want for my birthday, now.
And what is that?
New paint. That paint made from the white shells you once brought me.
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.
Almost three day's time.
I just thought it was a better idea than, uh, stars.
You sure you'll be all right, on your own?
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.
I'll be back in three days time.
I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Okay.
Hmm.
AHHH!
Is this...hair?
Struggling...struggling is pointless.
Huh?
I know why you're here.
And I'm not afraid of you.
What?
Who are you, and how did you find me?
Ah hah.
Who are you, and how did you find me?
I know not who you are.
Nor how I came to find you.
But may I just say.
Hi!
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Ryder.
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.
Gesundheit, here's the deal.
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.
I came across your tower and...
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll never find it.
It's in that pot, isn't it.
Huh?
Ahh, will you stop that.
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.
So, what do you want, with my hair?
-To cut it?
-What?
-Sell it?
-No!
Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair, is to get out of it.
Literally.
Wait, you don't want my hair?
Why on earth would
I want your hair?
Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story.
You're, telling the truth?
Yes.
Hmmm.
I know, I need someone to take me.
I think he's telling the truth, too.
Doesn't have fangs, but what choice do I have?
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
-Deal?
-Look this way.
Oh...oomph!
Do you know what these are?
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?
Lanterns...
I knew they weren't stars.
Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky, with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,
Take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely.
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.
That is my deal.
Yeah, no can do.
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren't exactly, simpatico, at the moment. So I won't be taking you anywhere.
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.
So I have made the decision to trust you.
A horrible decision, really.
But trust me, when I tell you this.
You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick.
But without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.
Let me just get this straight.
I take you to see the lanterns.
Bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel?
I promise.
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.
EVER!
All right, listen, I didn't want to have to want to do this, but you leave me no choice.
Here comes the 'smolder'.
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.
Really!
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.
You coming, Blondie?
*Look at the world so close, and I'm half way to it*
*Look at it all, so big do I even dare?*
*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*
Should I? No.
Here I go.
*Triumphant music*
(Rapunzel sings When will my life begin)
*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*
*Just feel that summer breeze.*
*The way it's calling me.*
*For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.*
*I could go running, and racing, and dancing...
*and chasing, and leaping and bounding.*
*Hair flying, heart pounding and splashing and reeling.*
*And finally feeling,*
*That's when my life begins.*
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!
Mother would be so furious.
That's okay, what she doesn’t know won't kill her, right?
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.
THIS IS SO FUN!
I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.
I am never going baaaccckkk!
I am a despicable human being.
WAHHOOOOO!
Best day, ever!
You know, I can't help but notice, you seem a little at war with yourself, here.
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces, of course, over protective mother, forbidden road trip.
I mean, this is serious stuff.
But let me ease your conscious.
This is part of growing up.
A little rebellion, a little adventure.
That's good, healthy even.
(Laughs) You think?
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me.
Does your mother deserve it?
No.
Will this break her heart and crush her soul?
Of course.
But you just got to do it.
Break her heart?
-In half.
-Crush her soul?
Like a grape.
She would be heart broken, you're right.
I am, oh my, oh bother.
All right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
I'm letting you out of the deal.
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's just turn around, and get you home, here's your pan and your frog.
I get back my satchel.
You get back a mother daughter relationship based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!
What is it going to take to get my satchel back?
I will use this.
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.
Oh, sorry.
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though.
Yeah, that probably be best.
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.
Oh, a Palace horse.
Where's your rider?
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
RAPUNZEL!
I know it's around here, somewhere.
Ah, there it is.
The Snuggly duckling.
Don't worry, very quaint place, perfect for you.
Don't want you scaring, and giving up on this whole endeavor now do we?
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!
Garcon, your finest table, please.
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell. and the other part is really bad man smell.
I don't know why, but overall, it just smells like the color brown.
Your thoughts?
That's a lot of hair.
She's growing it out, is that blood on your moustache?
Goldie, look at this, look at all the blood on his moustache.
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.
Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all.
And if you can't handle this place, well maybe you should be back in your tower.
Is this you?
No, no this is being mean.
Oh, it's him all right.
Gretel, go find some guards.
That reward's going to buy me a new hook.
I can use the money.
What about me?
I'm broke.
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.
Hey, leave him alone.
-Gentlemen, please.
-Give me back my guide, ruffians.
HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!
Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!
Put him down!
Okay, I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns, because I've been dreaming about them my entire life.
Find your humanity.
Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?
I, had a dream.
Once.
(Song: I've got a dream)
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*
*My sneer could curdle dairy.*
*And violence-wise my hands are not the cleanest.*
*But despite my evil look, and my temper and my hook.*
*I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.*
*Can't cha see me on the stage performing Mozart.*
*Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.*
*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*
*For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.*
*'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.*
*He's got a dream, he's got a dream.*
*See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem.*
*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*
*You can count me with the dreamers.*
*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*
*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*
*Plus something here that oozes.*
*Let's not even mention my complexion.*
Big nose thug: *But despite my extra toes.*
*And my goiter and my nose.*
*I really want to make a love connection.*
*Can't you see me with a special little lady.*
*Rowing in a row boat, down the stream.*
*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*
*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*
*'Cause way down deep inside, I gotta dream.*
*I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*
*And I know one day will never reign supreme.*
*Though my face leaves people screaming.*
*There's a child behind it dreaming.*
*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*
*Tor would like to quit and be a florist.*
*Gunther does interior design.*
*Ulf is into mime,
Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.*
*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*
*Fang does little puppet shows.*
*And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns.*
What about you?
-I'm sorry, me?
-What's your dream?
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.
*I have dreams like you, no really.*
*Just much less, touchy-feely.*
*They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny.*
*On an island that I own, tanned and rested and alone.*
*Surrounded by enormous piles of money.*
*-I've got a dream...I've got a dream.
-(Thugs) She’s got a dream.*
*I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam.*
*And with every passing hour.*
*I'm so glad I left my tower.*
*Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.*
*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*
*So our differences ain't really that extreme. We're one big team.*
*Call us brutal, say sadistic and grotesquely optimistic.
*'Cause way down deep inside, we've gotta dream.*
*We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*
*Yes way down deep inside
I've got a...*
*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*
Yeah!
I found the guards.
Where's Ryder, where is he?
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him, turn the place upside down if you have to!
Go, live your dream.
I will.
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.
Thanks for everything.
I believe this is the man you're looking for.
You got me.
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.
Maximus.
What's he doing?
A passage, come on men, let's go.
Corman, make sure those boys don't get away.
Play it safe.
We'll go get the crown.
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.
Because I just found me a tall drink of water.
Oh stop it, you big lug.
Where does that tunnel lead out?
Knife!
Well, that got us safe.
Didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty, impressive.
I KNOW!
I know...
Sooo, Flynn.
Where are you from?
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.
However I am becoming very interested in yours.
Now I...I know I'm not suppose to mention the hair.
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to ask about the frog.
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.
Here's my question though, if you want to see the lanterns so badly, why haven't you gone before?
Uhh, hey, well...
Uh, Flynn...
Flynn!
Run,
RUN!
Who's that?
They don't like me.
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment, that everyone here doesn't like me.
Here.
I've waited a long time for this.
Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these.
HAH!
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done.
How 'bout two out of three?
Flynn!
Flynn, look out.
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.
You should see your faces.
Because you look...
Ridiculous
Come on, Blondie.
Jump.
It's no use,
I can't see anything.
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch black down there.
This is all my fault.
She was right, I never should have done this.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, Flynn.
Eugene.
What?
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.
So you might as well know.
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.
What?
I have magic hair, that glows when I sing.
*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*
We made it.
Her hair glows.
We're alive.
I'm alive!
I didn't see that coming.
You're hair actually glows.
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?
-Eugene!
-What?
It doesn't just glow.
Why is he smiling at me?
I'll kill him.
I'll kill that, Ryder.
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.
And get back the crown, come on.
Boys.
Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails, and think for a moment.
Oh, please there's no need for that.
Well if that's all you desire, then be on your way.
I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns, would have made you rich beyond belief.
And that wasn't even the best part.
Oh well, C'est la vie.
Enjoy  your crown.
What's the best part?
It comes with revenge on Flynn Ryder.
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.
Sorry.
Just don't, don't freak out.
*Flower gleam and glow*
*Let your powers shine*
*Make the clock reverse*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
*Heal what has been hurt.*
*Change the fates design.*
*Save what has been lost.*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
*What once was mine.*
-Ah...
-Please don't freak out.
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out, are you freaking out?
No, I'm just very interested in your hair. and the magical qualities that it possesses.
How long has it been doing that, exactly?
Forever, I guess.
Mother said when I was a baby people tried to cut it.
They wanted to take it for themselves.
But, once it's cut.
It turns brown, and looses its power.
A gift like that, it has to be protected.
That's why Mother never let me...
That's why...I never left the...
You never left that tower.
And you're still gonna go back?
No...yes.
It's complicated.
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's a little bit of a...
It's a little bit of a downer.
There was this book.
A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids.
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive.
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing to ever brag about, of course.
Was he a thief too?
Ahh, well no.
Actually, he had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do.
He could go anywhere that he wanted to go.
And...and, for a kid, with nothing.
I don't know, I...
It just seemed like a better option.
You can't tell anyone, about this, okay?
It could ruin my whole reputation.
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.
Oh, the thing about a reputation, it's all that a man has.
Um, well I should uh...
I, I should get some more firewood.
Hey.
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than, Flynn Ryder.
Well, then you'd be the first.
But, thank you.
Well, I thought he'd never leave.
Mother?
Hello, dear.
But I...I..., don't we...
How did you find me?
Oh, it was easy really.
I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal, and followed that.
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.
I've been on this incredible journey.
And I've seen and learned so much.
I even met someone.
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.
I think
I think he likes me.
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that's demented.
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.
Dear this whole romance that you've invented, just proves you're to naive to be here.
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.
*Mother...*
-NO!
-No?
Oh.
I see how it is.
*Rapunzel, knows best.*
*Rapunzel's so mature, now.*
*Such a clever grown up, miss.*
*Rapunzel knows best.*
*Fine, if you're so sure now.*
*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*
How did you?
*This is why he's here.*
*Don't let him deceive you.*
*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.*
-I will.
*Trust me my dear, that's how fast he'll leave you.*
*I won't say I told you so...no.*
*Rapunzel knows best.*
*So if he's such a dream boat.*
*Go and put him, to the test.*
-Mother, wait.
*If he's lying, don't come crying.*
*Mother, knows best.*
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?
Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand?
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.
Hey, you all right?
Oh, sorry, yes.
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.
I mean because here's the thing.
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.
Born with it, but superhuman strength?
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...
Patience boys. All good things to those who wait.
Hmm, what?
Well I hope you're here to apologize.
AAAAAAAH!
No, no put me down.
Stop it. Let...me...go!
-Give me, him.
-OW!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy boy, easy, calm down.
Easy boy.
Easy.
That's it.
Now sit.
-Sit.
-What?
Now drop the boot.
Drop it.
Oh, you are such a good boy.
Yes you are.
You all tired, from chasing the bad man all over the place?
Flynn: Excuse me?
Nobody appreciates you, do they?
Do they?
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.
Isn't that right?
Maximus.
You've got to be kidding me.
Look, today is kinda the biggest day of my life.
And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.
Just for twenty four hours and then, you can chase each other to your hearts content.
Okay?
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.
OOMPH!!
(Mouths) WOW
Ahh!
Sorry.
Thank you.
It's for the lost Princess.
To the boats
Hey, Max.
What? I brought them.
Most of them.
Where are we going?
Well, best day of your life.
I figured you should have a decent seat.
You okay?
I'm terrified.
Why?
I've been looking out the window for eighteen years.
Dreaming about what it would feel like when those lights rise in the sky.
What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be?
It will be.
And what if it is?
What will I do then?
Well that's the good part,
I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.
*Solemn Music*
(Rapunzel sings, "I see the Light")
*All those days
Watching from the windows.*
*All those years
Outside looking in*
*All that time
Never even knowing*
*Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here*
*Blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here*
*Suddenly I see
Standing here*
*It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be*
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted*
*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new*
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*
*All at once
Everything looks different*
*Now that I see you*
I have something for you, too.
I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.
And the thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.
You know what I mean?
I'm starting to.
*All those days
Chasing down a daydream*
*All those years
Living in a blur*
*All that time
Never truly seeing*
*Things, the way they were
Now she's here*
*Shining in the starlight
Now she's here*
*Suddenly I know
If she's here*
*It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go*
*And at last, I see the light*
*And it's like the fog has lifted*
*And at last, I see the light*
*And it's like the sky is new*
*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*
*All at once
Everything is different*
*Now that I, see you.*
*Now that I...see you.*
Is everything okay?
Huh? Oh yes.
Uh, yes of course.
I just...
I'm sorry, everything is fine.
There's just something I have to take care of.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
It's all right, Pascal.
Ahh, there you are.
I've been searching everywhere for you guys. Since we got separated.
Hey the sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
You gotta be excited about that.
Anyhow, just wanted to say,
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.
I'll miss you, but I think its for the... best.
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?
-What?
-We heard you found something.
Something much more valuable than a crown.
We want her, instead.
I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.
He did.
What?
No.
He wouldn't.
See for yourself.
Eugene?
Eugene!
Fair trade.
A crown, for the girl with the magic hair.
How much do you think someone will pay to stay young and healthy forever?
No, please.
NO!
NO!
AHH!
Rapunzel!
Mother?
Oh, my precious girl.
Mother.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
-Mother, how did you?
-I was so worried about you dear.
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you.
All right, let's go, let's go before they come to.
You were right, mother.
You were right about everything.
I know darling.
I know.
Look!
The crown.
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.
Rapunzel!
Let's get this over with, Ryder.
Where are we going?
Oh...
There, it never happened.
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazel nut soup.
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you, what was out there.
The world is dark, and selfish, and cruel.
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine.
It destroys it.
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!
It wasn't us.
It was the old lady.
Old lady?
Wait, no, wait!
You don't understand, she's in trouble.
Wait!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?
Are you all right?
I'm the lost princess.
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.
I am the lost Princess.
Aren't I?
Did I mumble, Mother?
Or should I even call you that?
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?
Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?
It was you!
It was all, you.
Everything I did, was to protect you.
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,
Hiding from people who would use me for my power.
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.
From you.
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.
What did you do to him?
That criminal, is to be hanged for his crimes.
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.
NO!
You were wrong about the world.
And you were wrong about me.
And I will never let you use my hair, again!
You want me to be the bad guy?
Fine.
Now I'm the bad, guy.
What's this?
Open up.
What's the password?
-What?
-Nope.
Open this door.
Not even close.
You have three seconds
One...
Two...
Three...
Frying pans.
Who knew, right?
AAAAH!
-Head down?
-Head down.
-Arms in?
-Arms in.
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.
Knees apart?
Why do I need to keep my knees apar...
AAAAAAAAH!
Max.
You brought them here?
Thank you.
No really, thank you.
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time we've just misunderstanding one another.
And we're really just, yeah your right. We should go.
Max.
Max!
WHOAAAAA!
Okay Max, lets see how fast you can run.
Rapunzel.
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again.
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.
Oh don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.
And as for us?
We are going where no one will ever find you, again.
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.
Stop fighting me.
NO! I won't stop.
For every minute of the rest of my life I will fight.
I will never stop trying to get away from you.
But, if you let me save him...
I will go with you.
No. No, Rapunzel.
I'll never run, I'll never try to escape.
Just let me heal him. And you and I will be together.
Forever, just like you want.
Everything will be the way it was.
I promise.
Just like you want.
Just...let me...heal him.
In case you get any ideas about following us.
Eu..Eugene!
Ah, AHHH!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Everything is going to okay, though.
-No, Rapunzel!
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..
-Come on.
-I can't let you do this.
And I can't let you die.
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.
It's gonna be all right.
Rapunzel, wait...
Eugene, what...?
NOOO!
No...NO!
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
No, no, no,
NOOO!
No, no, no, noooo.
NO!
Noooooooooo!
No, no, no, no, Eugene.
Oh, look at me, look me,
I'm right here.
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.
*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*
-Rapunzel...
-What?
You were my new dream.
And you were mine.
*Heal what has been hurt.*
*Change the fates design.*
*Save what has been lost.*
*Bring back what once was mine.*
What once was mine.
Rapunzel?
Eugene.
Did I ever tell you, I've got a thing for brunettes?
(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what happened next.
The kingdom rejoiced.
For the lost Princess had returned.
The party lasted an entire week.
And, honestly I don't remember much of it.
Dreams came true all over the place.
That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it.
And this guy? Well he eventually found true love.
As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost over night.
As did most of the apples.
Pascal? 
Never changed.
At last Rapunzel was home,
and she finally had a real family.
She was a Princess worth waiting for.
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her.
And as for me, well.
I started going by Eugene again.
Stopped thieving, and basically turned it all around.
But I know what the big question is.
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?
Well I'm pleased to tell you.
That after years, and years of asking,
and asking, and asking.
I finally said yes.
*Eugene*
All right, I asked her.
And we're living happily ever after.
Yes, we are.
You're looking at the many noble rabbits who have served as the Easter Bunny.
If you've ever gotten a basket of candy and colored eggs on Easter morning, you have them to thank.
Yes, even that guy.
See, every bunny dreams of holding the title, but not just anyone can do it.
You have to be majestic.
You have to be dignified.
You have to be, well, a bunny.
Or, at least you did.
Hi. I'm Fred O'Hare, the first human Easter Bunny.
Sounds insane, you say?
It'll make sense once you know how it all went down.
E.B.?
E.B.?
Where are you?
Hi, Dad!
Woohoo!
Oh! There you are.
Son! I was thinking.
You are getting so big, you're practically a foot tall.
Over a foot, if you count the ears.
I always count the ears.
So, how would you like to go to work with me today?
Would I?
That sounds awesome.
I said the same thing when my father first took me to the factory.
I didn't use the word "awesome," but...
Down, please.
Thank you. Go ahead, Son.
Take a look.
Whoa!
Look at all that candy.
Come on, come on.
See you.
This is so cool!
Oh, careful! E.B., welcome to the Easter Factory.
This is where we make all the candy and eggs that I deliver to the children of the world.
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?
It's amazing, Dad!
I'm glad you like it, because someday this will all be yours.
Really?
Now, come on, Son.
There's so much to see.
Daddy, what do you call that thingamajig?
Ah, the Marshmallow
Chick Machine.
Loved them since
I was your age.
When your grand-dad, the Easter Bunny before me, took me on this very same tour...
Hello.
Hello, little bunny.
What are you doing?
We don't eat the candy.
We make the candy!
But I thought...
E.B.
This is my second-in-command,
Carlos.
It's fine, Carlos. E.B. was, uh, taste-testing.
Isn't that right, Son?
Yup, I'm taste-testing.
It's great.
Oh, dear me. No, no.
Son, we're going to have to work on your taste.
Carlos, too much marsh, not enough mellow.
Exactly, señor, I was just going to say that.
Phil! Too much marsh, not enough mallow!
Phil! Phil!
Phil!
Hi, boss.
No dancing on the job!
It's forbidden.
Yes, sir. I'm very bad.
I am so sorry, señor.
I will deal with this personally.
Yes. Easter is right around the corner, Carlos.
There is no room for error.
Si, señor.
Remember this, E.B., we can't make any mistakes.
The entire world is counting on us.
This seems hard, Dad.
And I don't know if I can do it.
Oh, come now.
Don't you worry, Son.
Yes, it's a big responsibility, but you'll be ready.
You'll have to be.
Why, in a few years you will pick up the Egg of Destiny and receive the magical powers of the Easter Bunny.
Now, let's move on.
Bye, Carlos.
Okay, ciao.
See you later.
Enjoy your life of privilege, little bunny.
So, how are my kids doing?
I had rehearsals for the Easter play today.
Oh.
They usually cast a boy as Peter Cottontail, but they made an exception for me on account of my singing voice is so strong.
That's great, honey.
Sam, how about you?
Well, I'm up for a big promotion at work.
Really? That's terrific.
Good to hear that two of my kids are working so hard.
So, Fred. How did that job interview go?
I don't know about that place, Dad.
I just don't know if it's really what I'm looking for.
Really?
Did they pay money?
Then it's exactly what you've been looking for.
Well, that's just crass.
What are you nodding for?
"Dear Fred, as your mother
I have always loved you,
"and it hurts me to have to tell you
"in this way, but there comes a time
"when every young man must grow up and leave the nest."
You all prepared statements?
Fred, we're just doing this because we love you, Son.
The Sadeki family down the street went through the same thing with their son Jordy.
He just laid on the couch all day watching court shows, but then they had an intervention, and now he works in a pharmacy, and has an apartment.
I don't really want to work at a pharmacy, Mom.
Well, you need to do something.
You need to get a life.
You need to get a job and you need to move out.
Especially that last one.
But I did move out.
And I had a job.
Is it my fault the company downsized?
Fred, that was over a year ago!
You have to get back on the horse.
And you have so much potential.
Thanks, Mom.
Sometimes I think you adopted me because Fred was such a disappointment.
Wow.
Alex, that is a very hurtful statement.
You're not denying it.
Eat your dinner.
Mom, Dad, I'm trying, okay?
I go on job interviews. I had one today!
Yes, but it wasn't what you were looking for.
It's always something.
You didn't like the commute.
The parking lot was too far away from the building.
The man in the cubicle next to you smelled.
He smelled.
Fred, nothing is ever good enough for you.
You don't want me to settle, do you?
Settling is fine.
Dad, when I was a kid, you said that when I grew up I was going to do something great.
Yes. But now I'm telling you that you should forget about "great," and settle for getting any job.
We should have nudged you out of the nest a long time ago.
Baby birds get a nudge.
Giant birds who never leave, they get shoved.
E.B.!
E.B.!
Hello, Dad.
So, what do you think?
Uh, what did I...
It was great! Really kicking.
But, E.B., shouldn't you be rehearsing your speech?
You're about to be crowned the Easter Bunny in front of
3,000 of your peers.
Uh, yeah, about that.
Yes?
LOOK, Dad, ever since I was yea big, it's been,
"The Easter Bunny wouldn't do that" and
"The Easter Bunny has to be perfect."
But I'm not perfect.
I know that, Son.
But you'll get there, eventually.
But I'm...
Listen.
You want me to be this.
But maybe I'm not this.
Just maybe, maybe I'm this.
A Sock?
Ugh."
Yeah, that's right.
I might be a metaphorical sock.
I might not be a good enough egg, but I might be the best sock ever.
I might not cut it delivering Easter baskets, but I might be great at something else.
Oh, the drums!
Why, I think that's fine.
I think it's really nice that you have a hobby.
Everyone should have a hobby.
It's not a hobby, Dad.
I want to drum in a band.
I want to see the world.
E.B., the Easter
Bunny sees the world.
Every country in one night, making people of the world happy.
Really, Dad?
The whole world?
What about China?
No!
Look, it's candy, woman!
Madam, please.
All right. So, we haven't cracked China yet.
But, for all those that do believe, you will be there.
No, Dad. I don't want to be the Easter Bunny.
Now, listen to me.
Four thousand years of tradition doesn't end just because one selfish bunny doesn't feel like doing it.
Look. Dad...
No, E.B., you look!
You are going to be the Easter Bunny!
Now you need to get it together, get rid of these drums, and get your priorities straight!
I'll see you out there!
No, I don't think you will.
Destination.
Where dreams come true.
In-flight snack preference.
Any baggage?
Just emotional.
I'm sorry, Dad.
OW!
I did it.
Hollywood.
Right. First order of business, find a place to stay.
Perfect.
Fred, wait, wait, wait! Fred.
Did you know about this, Sam?
Oh, uh...
You did.
Okay, look.
The rules of this intervention state that I am not supposed to help you, okay?
So you can't tell anyone what I'm about to do.
No! I'm not going to take money from you.
Wasn't going to give you money.
We can call it a loan.
Fred, look,
I got you a job interview tomorrow at my friend's company.
I'm a little slammed tomorrow.
I know you're not.
I'm pretty busy.
No.
Look, it's an entry-level position.
Entry-level?
At a video game company!
Okay. That's kind of cool.
I know.
All right, look, if it means that much to you, I'll swing by.
No, Fred.
You don't "swing by." Okay?
You shower, you shave, and you show up.
The three "shs."
Come on, Fred. You've got to start your life.
Think of this as a reboot.
Right!
It's time.
Yeah. You know what?
You're right.
In a couple of months, couple of weeks, you're gonna see a whole new Fred.
Yeah. By Easter.
Easter is in two weeks.
By Easter, I'm going to have a new job, a new place, a new life.
Great!
Okay.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go sleep in my car.
Fred, listen.
My boss is on vacation for a few weeks and he asked me to house-sit.
Nobody ever asks me to house-sit.
I know.
It's so weird.
Anyway, he has dogs, and you know I'm scared of dogs, so take over for me.
Wait. Your boss lives in a big mansion, right?
Yes, in Beverly Hills.
And he loves his house more than he loves his kids.
So you have to behave. Okay?
Do not touch anything.
Do not break anything.
Do not go upstairs!
Wait, what's upstairs?
Fred.
Okay.
And do not forget to feed the dogs.
Got it!
Thank you, Sam.
You're welcome.
I put the address on the paper.
Okay.
But, Fred?
Yeah?
If you screw up,
I'll kill you.
Okay.
Listen to me.
This is the Playboy Mansion. It's not a hotel.
Yeah, right.
But it says here that ever since 1971, the Playboy
Mansion has been home to sexy bunnies from around the world.
Friend, I can't see you.
Please step forward.
Now, I'm telling you that I am both a bunny, and incredibly sexy.
I don't have time for this.
Hello? Hello?
Maybe this is the rags part of my rags-to-riches story.
All right, let's see here.
54 Broadway Terrace.
Whoa!
Look at this!
Hello, Fred's new crib.
Maybe this is a good thing.
All great artists suffer before they become famous.
That lady wrote
Harry Potter in a ditch.
But it's the hunger, loneliness and exhaustion that gets you really.
How could this night get any worse?
I see.
Car accident. Thank you!
OW!
Why?
Oh, ow!
It's still alive.
I've got to help him out.
This will do.
Don't you worry, little friend.
I'm going to end your suffering.
No!
Who said that?
Well, who do you think said it?
Your latest victim.
You know what? We can leave the insurance companies out of this.
I could just, maybe, come live with you for a couple of months.
No, no, no!
Not real. Not real. Not real.
Excuse me?
You left your car back there, with the lights on.
I'm just saying!
Say something. Talk again.
I'm E.B. And you are?
I'm Fred.
Well, Fred, I am so hungry.
Have you got anything in the old snack department?
Okay.
Here you go.
Oh! Oh! That's.. -
What is this?
What? It's Turkey Jerky.
First, you hit me with your car, and then you try and poison me with a meat stick.
Why do you hate me?
Okay. Is there something you'd rather eat, you weird little thing?
Well...
Carrots!
He's a genius.
One carrot. Okay.
Time to hop away out of Fred's life back to the Enchanted Forest.
You're kicking me out?
Yeah. It's a bad time.
Yeah. Did some jerk just hit you with his car?
That kind of bad time?
No, I'll tell you what.
It's fine.
Oh, me leg. OW.
I mean, you can't be expected to help every innocent creature you wound.
And I'm sorry if I dented your bumper with my face and body.
Do you want me to look for some baby aspirin?
No, no! You save it.
You might run over a baby.
Just pray that sweet messenger of death visits quickly.
Is that the icy hand now?
Okay, wait!
On the off-chance that you're really here and I'm not completely crazy, and I did run you over and you're hurt...
I guess you can stay.
Thanks, mate. And I could bunk down anywhere. Seriously.
West wing, master suite, guest bedroom. I'm not picky.
Right. Okay.
What's this space, then?
This is a place for you to stay for the night.
I'm not a car.
So why would I need to stay here?
Look, it's not my house.
I'm not even allowed to go upstairs, and I'm human.
Sorry. What are the newspapers for?
Because I'm not really a voracious reader or anything.
You know, you're an animal.
So, we all know animals...
I understand.
I'll just sleep down here, among my poo and pee like a pig.
If you like, you use it as well.
Sorry.
No, don't reproach yourself for these medieval conditions.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm going to go to bed where, hopefully, I've been all along.
So, good night.
Oh, okay,
I'll just stay here then.
By myself.
In the dark.
With the door closed.
Señor. Señor
I have news.
Operations are running at full capacity.
With my supervision, we are right on target for Easter.
Fine, fine.
But is there any report on my son?
Yes, I have the report.
The sun will be shining, foggy times are lifting.
Easter will be clear sailing, señor.
Not the sun.
My son, E.B.!
That son.
Yes. I almost forget.
The rabbit hole was used for an unscheduled trip earlier this evening, sir!
What? You mean he ran away?
And at the height of our busiest time.
It's almost unforgivable.
But how could he just take off like this?
It's just not like him.
Please, señor.
Don't be too rash.
It's way too early to disown him.
But I wasn't going to...
Wait a minute. Are you hopping?
Am I? I didn't notice.
It just comes so naturally.
Anyway, señor considering your obvious distraction with this, wouldn't it be wise to pass the mantle to, I don't know, somebody else?
Hmm.
Let's see. It would have to be someone you trust.
Someone who is comfortable giving orders.
Phil! Keep doing that, but do it faster!
Faster. Gotcha.
And stop dancing!
No dancing. Yes, sir.
Carlos, you're right.
I'm totally right.
Assemble the Pink Berets at once!
I'm sorry. What?
We need to find E.B.
The Pink Berets?
But they're only to be used in a situation of extreme emergency.
This is pretty extreme, Carlos.
The Pink Berets will find E.B.
They have to!
You can't ignore me forever, Senor Bunny.
Freeze!
Who's there? Is this the same guy?
Don't make me come down there.
101 is blocked due to an overturned tractor trailer at the Burbank entrance.
Weather is a cool 72 degrees...
Rabbit.
Hello?
Talking rabbit?
Okay. Wow.
Dude, you are stressed.
Hi, Fred O'Hare.
Hey, Fred O'Hare.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Fred O'Hare.
You need me for this job.
You're going to hire me for this job.
Oh! The dogs. Right.
"Sam, until Daisy and Baby are accustomed to you,
"please wear the safety suit in the hall closet when you feed them."
Safety suit?
Daisy! Baby! Come here.
Let's go.
I'm on a schedule here.
Oh!
No!
No! Heel! Sit! Sit!
That's fine.
Okay, it's all good.
No, no, no!
Look, Fred!
Can you believe it?
They've got a drum kit in here.
What do you think?
Never had one formal lesson!
I am the Extreme Rock Master!
I know what you're thinking.
No, you really don't.
Hey, Fred, what's wrong?
You look a bit put out.
Why are you still here?
You can't be up here.
You're in the forbidden part of the house.
Yeah, but so are you.
Pick this up, man.
You've destroyed the place!
I wouldn't say, "destroyed.
"I was just getting comfortable.
What about your injury? Huh?
Your leg? You're hurt, right?
Yeah, exactly. I needed a soft bed in which to convalesce.
Oh, I see. So, you climbed a flight of stairs...
Struggled up each stair is more like it.
Worth it, though.
That Jacuzzi loosened me right up.
Jacuzzi?
Oh, yeah. You might want to turn it off.
It was creating a lot of bubbles.
No!
My sister is going to kill me!
Don't worry.
We'll clean it up together, as soon as I've beat my high score.
Hey, Fred! Come on, your turn.
Pick up a guitar, mate.
Fred, I think we got off on the wrong foot.
You said some things,
I flooded some things.
Let's start over again.
Fred? Why am I in a box?
This seems like the sort of thing a serial killer might do.
Is this going to be a surprise?
All right, come on. Out.
Oh! Are we going for a hike?
Better! We're releasing you into the wild.
The wild?
Oh, no, no, no. I'll just stay with you, I think.
This place seems to be dominated by carnivores
Get out. Let's go.
What are you doing?
You're going to leave me here?
Yeah, there's lots of rabbits out here.
You'll feel right at home.
Fred, are we locked in a destructive relationship?
Get out. Fred.
You're making a scene!
Get out!
Move along.
Look, Fred.
Goodbye!
But I want to stay with you!
Fred, please don't go.
I'm already late. So go away.
Come on, man.
Fred, mate.
I'll behave.
I'll clean up my mess.
I'll do the dishes.
Not your problem.
There are no dishes in the wild.
No. Fred.
But I'm special.
Well, we're all special.
You're not getting it.
I don't mean special as in,
"everybody's special."
I mean, I'm really special.
What're you doing?
See?
Jelly beans?
Mmm-hmm.
So what? So you talk and you poop candy.
Could you do it in someone else's life?
No, you're right.
It's not your concern.
And in two weeks, maybe you can explain to the children of the world why they didn't get their Easter baskets.
Easter?
What, Easter?
No way.
Yes, Fred.
I am the Easter Bunny.
Hop in.
Yes! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew you were real. I knew it!
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm real.
No.
When I was a kid,
I saw you on Easter morning.
You did?
Yeah.
That was you, right?
Absolutely. No question.
Okay. Because you do look a little different. Was it...
I don't know, have you lost weight?
Or maybe it's the clothes.
You're talking about the old guy.
Yeah. We got rid of him.
He didn't understand children. Ah.
He didn't get that children sometimes just want to drum.
I mean, dream.
Sometimes they just want to dream.
Children dream.
Yeah. So he had to go, anyway, this guy. Right.
Well, it's a good thing you got rid of him, then.
Exactly.
So... Wait a minute.
Why are you here now?
Just doing a little last minute recon for Easter deliveries.
Finding ideal egg hiding locations.
There is one. That's perfect!
Compiling a list of kids with chocolate allergies.
That kind of thing.
It's all very technical.
I see.
Okay.
Oh, man. I'm really late.
Late for what?
What are we doing?
I have a job interview.
You're staying here.
But here is boring. Let me come with you.
I could be a job reference.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Look, I really need this job, and I don't think anyone there is going to be able to handle you.
I'm not sure I can handle you.
So, just do me a favor? Wait in the car.
Fred, I don't want to get your hopes up, but I think you're definitely going to get this job.
Be good.
Yes, sir.
I'll stay here and guard the vehicle.
2UP Games.
Yes, sir. I'll put you through to Mr. Hill.
Hi, I'm Fred O'Hare.
I'm here for a 10:30 with
Mrs. Beck.
You're a half-hour late.
I know. I called.
That doesn't make you any earlier.
Uh-huh.
You know, you're the first impression people get when they walk in here.
In many ways, you are the face of the company.
Fill this Out.
Yes, ma'am.
2UP Games.
Yes, sir. Can I help you?
What is that alarming noise?
Oh, no!
Pink Berets!
2UP Games. Please hold.
I'm sorry, sir.
Who did you want to speak to?
Fred.
What are you doing here?
I told you to wait in the car!
This is serious.
I really need your help!
I need your help! You can't be here.
You've got to go!
Fred?
Yes.
Get me out of here!
Ah!
Mrs. Beck.
Yes.
How are you?
I'm well. I can't say that I'm that impressed with your punctuality, though.
Yeah, I have half a dozen excuses.
But I'm just going to go with a straight apology.
I'm really, really sorry.
Okay. Clean slate, then.
Thank you.
So, let's begin, Fred.
I'll show you inside.
Whoa!
So, recent employment history.
You haven't worked in a year?
Yeah, my parents have moved in with me.
That has sort of been a full-time job.
Mmm-hmm.
It's fine. It just gets in the way of writing my novel, is all.
You're writing a novel?
What is that about?
It's about a crippled soldier who, in the future, goes to another planet and he becomes one of the indigenous people who are blue and live in the forest.
That's not Avatar?
Not really.
So, why don't we take a walk and I can tell you a little bit about the company?
Okay.
So, the good news is, we tend to promote from within.
But you'd be starting in the mailroom.
Mailroom.
Is that a problem?
No, no, I love mail.
I get lots of mail.
E- mail, snail mail, chain mail.
I am male.
Speaking of mail, that's Cody.
Let me introduce you to him.
He is being promoted to junior exec and you would be replacing him.
Wow. Congratulations.
Question.
I need 30 copies of something, collated, stapled, bound and on my desk by yesterday.
What do you do?
I would make 30 copies, and I would do what you said with them.
I smell potential.
Oh, Mrs. Beck, I was wanting to talk to you about my lunch.
Fred. Fred!
What is wrong with you?
This is an extreme emergency.
You're ruining this for me.
You really need to go.
You're right.
I'll create a diversion and we'll escape in the ensuing chaos.
E.B., no! Get back here!
Fred?
Yeah.
I got a good feeling about this place.
Where to next?
Sounding good to me.
But where is Ricky?
We need to put a back beat behind that.
A back beat.
I think Ricky went out for coffee.
I guess he's back.
How you feeling, Ricky?
Yeah, I'm smashing.
I mean, I'm fine.
I'm just fine, daddy-o.
Well, then let's do it.
Okay, so this our sport...
Oh.
This is our sports-game motion-capture studio.
Mmm-hmm.
In here?
Yeah.
Ah!
Hockey.
It's golf.
And this is our sound recording studio for our music games.
We've done Extreme Rock
Master; Extreme Jazz Master; and now we're doing
Extreme Blues Master.
Sounds like a cool idea.
Whoa, you got the Blind Boys of...
Quit it!
I'm going to kill you so bad! Get out!
Okay, Fred, let's try and keep moving...
I'm all of a sudden not feeling so good. Oh.
Do you have a restroom?
Yeah.
Where is that?
That was brilliant!
I mean, that was tight.
Sounded all right.
But I know my drummer when I hear him.
So, who are you, boy?
Okay, I admit it. I'm not a blues man.
My name is E.B.
I'm just some guy off the street with two sticks of wood and a dream.
I understand if you throw me out.
I get it if you don't want to give me a break.
Hey, slow down, friend.
You know, we have a buddy who is always on the lookout for new talent.
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather of entertainment.
And he's having auditions tomorrow.
The Hoff?
You mean he can help me?
If he like you.
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.
Good luck, little rabbit.
Wait, how did you know I was...
Mmm!
Clever gents.
So, Fred, how'd it go?
Don't say a word.
Can I get a little clarification, here?
Is this what the Easter Bunny does now?
He just goes house to house, messing up people's lives?
Well, that is just hurtful.
Besides, you're selling yourself short.
They were going to shove you in the mail room.
Well, excuse me, but I happen to think you're better than that.
You don't Know me, okay?
We just met.
I can tell. You give off this aura of untapped potential.
I do?
Don't pull that with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.
But, Fred, I'm serious.
You're destined to do something great.
I just know it.
I've heard that one before.
You'll find an awesome job.
Hey. Look, what about this?
Dog walker?
No.
TSA Officer?
No.
What about this one?
It looks exciting.
Wind in your hair, hot babe on your arm.
That's a car ad.
You should buy that car, then.
Ah! Señor.
How you doing, jefe?
Am I disturbing?
It's never been this quiet in here.
Yeah, it's so depressing.
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.
Like a man-cave!
It'll be fun.
I called his dreams ridiculous.
What kind of father does that?
No, no, señor.
I will not permit you to beat yourself up over this.
Anybody would be lucky to have a father such as you.
Thank you, Carlos.
I miss him.
Me, too, señor.
A son is very difficult to replace.
Difficult, but not impossible.
Carlos...
What the...
What's that on your head?
What? My new earmuffs?
It's a cold spring this year, you know? Brr!
Oh.
Anyway, what am I going to do?
I know, how can you deliver Easter with this tremendous burden on your old, frail shoulders?
Hey, hey, hey, easy with the "old."
No, I'm just saying, like, compared to me.
Surely you're not thinking of making the trip yourself?
What choice do we have?
We can improvise. I mean...
Does it even have to be a bunny?
What?
I suppose, given these troubled times, even a humble chick could do the job.
Really, Carlos.
Wow. I mean, that is funny.
Can you imagine that?
A chick delivering Easter?
That's ridiculous.
Oh, dear me.
But I appreciate you trying to cheer me up, though.
Please. It is my pleasure to amuse you, señor.
A chick delivering...
Fred, I was wondering if...
Are you doing anything tomorrow?
Tomorrow I get to start my new job at the video game company.
Wait a second.
No, that didn't work out.
I know. I know.
I'm sorry about that.
But do you know what?
Every cloud has a silver lining.
And behold this silver lining, Fred!
The Hoff?
Yes, please.
I just need a ride.
Mmm.
No.
Come on, Fred.
This is my one big chance.
I'll do anything.
Even get out of your life.
I take you to Hoff Knows Talent, and that's it, we're done.
Bunny's honor.
Right here, mate.
It's okay.
A verbal agreement is fine.
Now, you realize, you can't talk.
No. I can.
No, what I mean is, you shouldn't talk.
What? Like, ever?
Yeah,
"ever" would be wonderful.
But from now on, especially not in front of other people.
They might freak out and want to dissect your brain.
Dissect? That's a bit extreme.
There's an easy explanation as to why I can talk.
It's a simple combination of cuteness and magic.
Okay. Here we go. One BLT.
And one order of carrot cake a la mode, topped with, quote,
Whatever candy you have laying around back there. Unquote.
Uh, excuse me.
Is that a cough drop?
Yeah. It's cherry.
It counts.
It's a peculiar garnish.
Can I get some chocolate syrup?
Sure, doll.
Thanks, love.
It seems my brain is still intact, Fred.
Fred,
I've just had an idea.
When I'm a famous rock star, I'm going to buy a mansion just like this and make you sleep in the garage in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.
What do you think?
Oh, man. My sister is here.
You never told me you had a sister.
There's still so much we don't
Know about each other, Fred.
If she goes upstairs,
I'm dead.
Why?
Why?
Let me take you back to this morning when you flooded the bathroom and you trashed the bedroom.
You remember that?
Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth it out with her. Ow!
Hey!
Look at me.
One word out of you, and it's rabbit season. You got it?
Okay, I'm going to run interference.
I need you to sneak upstairs and clean up, quietly!
Sam!
Hi!
Hey, it's not a good time for me right now.
I was just leaving.
But you just got here.
I know, right?
Hey, what are these?
Oh!
There you are.
Mmm!
I'm on this North Beach diet.
It's carrots only.
That is why they're all over the house.
I was going to clean them up, though.
Okay, Fred, how did the interview go? Yes?
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.
Really?
Yeah.
No way!
Why are you so surprised?
Fred, that's awesome!
Place could use me, too.
Don't get me wrong, it was great.
It was good.
It was all right.
I just... I don't know if it was for me, really.
It just didn't gel.
Something felt a little off about the whole thing.
I didn't get it.
Oh! What? What happened?
It's kind of hard to pinpoint any one specific thing.
Oh, Fred.
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
What is that?
I wouldn't know because I'm not allowed to go up there.
And I haven't been up there once.
Hmm. Okay.
Sam, no, you're not allowed up there, either.
Don't go up there!
Sam, I'm begging you!
I can explain.
Oh, my God!
Look at this.
Look how cute this stuffed bunny is!
Wow! Yeah. Oh.
So cute!
Isn't he?
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't be playing with him because we're not really supposed to be up here in the first place. So...
He's just so lifelike.
You think?
It's a little freaky-looking to me.
Oh! Oh, he's so soft!
And cute, and cuddly, and warm.
Okay!
Why don't we put him back before things get uncomfortable?
No, I'm not uncomfortable.
Well, I'm uncomfortable because
I'm looking after the house and it's my responsibility.
There we are.
All right.
Oh, my God!
Wow! Look at that.
He's a wind-up toy.
That is so adorable!
Yeah, I think he might be broken.
Yeah, you're a broken little guy, aren't you?
Hey... Ow!
Fred, I am really worried about you.
Hmm!
Don't eat that.
You might not like the flavor.
Fred, relax.
Watermelon.
Can we go?
Look, Sam, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'll get something.
Look, Fred, I just thought it would make tomorrow night a lot easier if you could tell Mom and Dad that you had a job.
Whoa! What's tomorrow night?
Alex's play! The one she's been talking about for weeks.
Oh, that is easy.
I'm not going.
Oh, yeah, you are.
Fred, come on, she's your sister.
All right.
Wear something nice.
I'll wear something nice.
Don't forget, I love you.
I love you.
Put gas in your car. 7:00.
Bye.
Nice. Is she seeing anyone?
No, she's single, and she's looking for a rabbit.
Wow! There's a lot of people here, Fred.
Way more than I imagined.
You nervous?
Well, a little.
It's just...
I'm starting to feel a bit sick, Fred.
I've never actually played in front of anybody.
Come on. This could be your big opportunity.
I know it's my big chance, but what if I blow it?
Relax. I'll give you a good intro.
I'll set you up, you knock them down.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you, Fred.
No problem.
Now, if you could please remove your claws from my shoulder.
Sorry about that.
That's my nerves.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Mr. Hasselhoff.
Yes.
May I call you The Hoff?
Yes.
Fantastic.
Sir, I realize that you have seen it all.
But this...
This will stretch the limits of even your vast experience.
What you're about to see will mystify you.
It will challenge the very scope...
Cut to the chase, my friend.
Okay. Uh...
I give you E.B.
Come on, let's drum.
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Come on! Mr. Hoff, we've been waiting all day.
Give the guy a chance.
I gave him a chance.
I didn't like it.
I loved it!
Woohoo!
Yes!
Hoff knows talent, and that rabbit's got talent!
Thank you, David Hasselhoff!
I will not let you down.
This is a golden opportunity and one I intend to realize fully!
Hey, wait.
You're not surprised that I'm a talking rabbit.
Little man, my best friend's a talking car.
Can you make it to a live taping of the show Saturday night?
I'll send a limo.
Did you hear him?
Did you hear The Hoff?
I'm on my way, Fred!
It sounds like
The Hoff really dug you.
I mean, he is a good actor, but I think he was sincere.
Thanks, mate. And don't think
I've forgotten our deal.
You've done your part.
And now I'm ready to get out of your life.
Good. Yeah, good.
We've had some good times, eh?
Haven't we, Fred?
Yeah, there were a few.
You validated my whole childhood dream.
And then, what else?
Let me think.
Good times.
Well, maybe just one good time.
But the main thing is
I got to meet the guy on my second grade lunchbox.
Hasselhoff, wow!
E.B.?
E.B.?
E.B.?
Psst! Fred!
What are you doing?
Pink Berets.
Pink what?
Pink Berets.
There is nobody here.
Oh yes, there is.
If they see me, they'll take me back to Easter Island and I'll never get my chance to drum!
Pink Berets? Huh?
Sounds super fierce.
Don't be fooled by their adorable name.
They're the Easter
Bunny's Royal Guard!
But you're the Easter Bunny!
Aren't you?
Of course I am, technically.
What do you mean,
"technically"?
I'll explain later.
Just get in the car.
Look, I was supposed to take over this year, but I ran away.
What are you, crazy?
Who wouldn't want to be the Easter Bunny?
That's, like, the greatest job ever!
Yeah, you'd think so.
But it's what my dad wants, not me.
He expects so much.
What's left for me to do but let him down?
Sounds familiar.
Sometimes fathers just don't get it.
He told me I only ever think of myself.
Other times, they hit the nail right on the head.
Come on, Fred.
I know we said we'd go our own separate ways, but please, you've got to protect me.
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't really leave you places,
I can't really take you places.
And I've got to go to my sister's play tonight.
Oh, I like plays.
We should go see a play that my sister's not in and that my family will not be attending.
I understand.
Just drop me off at the bus station.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
I could be one of those street drummers, with a bucket!
Hi. How you doing?
Good.
Who's your kid playing?
An egg.
An egg?
Yeah.
Wow, that's something.
My kid is the Easter Bunny.
The one that makes it all happen.
All right, Dad, all the roles are equally important.
Sure, sure.
Fred!
Please get to your seats.
The play is about to begin.
Hey, guys. Mom, Dad.
Here comes Peter Cottontail
Hopping down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppity,
Easter's on its way
Bringing every girl and boy
Baskets full of Easter joy
Ugh! What is that dreadful sound?
Oh, no! They found me!
Run for it!
It's the Pink Berets!
Oh! Never mind, everyone.
False alarm.
Please continue with your awful singing.
How did that rabbit just talk?
Um...
Fred has been studying ventriloquism.
Yeah! I might do it professionally.
Woohoo!
You're being ridiculous.
Stop it! Sit down!
You should be nicer to your son.
It's just a thought.
Who wants to hear a song?
We'd love to sing a song for you.
No, we wouldn't.
Stop making a fool of yourself! Sit down!
Absolutely.
I want candy
I want candy
Take it, kids.
I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine she can't be beat
She's got everything I desire
He's really good!
I can see his lips move.
Sets the summer sun on fire
I want candy
I want candy!
Just the proud moms now.
I want candy
Now the grumpy dads.
I want candy
All I want is your candy
All I want is your...
Chewy
Fun to eat
So darn sweet
Candy
We're a hit!
They love us!
Here.
Are those for me?
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you. So sweet.
Alex. Good job tonight!
Wasn't she a good Easter Bunny?
Jerk!
Oh! Hey, Dad.
I was just leaving.
Fred, seems like we made quite an impression on you the other night.
Is this your new career?
Upstaging grade-schoolers with your ventriloquist puppet?
No, no, I got lots of other stuff going on.
Yeah.
There it is.
What?
That look. The complete and utterly disappointed look.
Well, I'm sorry, Fred, but can you give me just,
I don't know, one reason not to be disappointed?
Well...
Just one.
Yeah.
Fred?
Fred, where'd you go?
Yeah, I'm right here.
I just remembered I have a really great solid lead, actually.
You do?
Yeah, a great job.
Tell me about it.
I can't really tell you about it.
But it's big.
You're going to love it.
It's really big!
Hey, what's with the "Mr.
Serious" all of a sudden?
Wait, is this where you tell me you want to see other rabbits?
Because I'm open-minded, Fred.
E.B., I have the most amazing idea.
When I was a kid,
I told everyone that I saw the Easter Bunny, right?
No one believed me, even though he left me this.
This chocolate bunny, which I kept.
Oh, dear.
And tonight, it just hit me.
I realized that it was my destiny to see him.
Just like it was my destiny to meet you.
It's all been leading up to this.
Up to what?
You don't want to be the Easter Bunny, right?
I know who can take your place.
Who?
Me!
I'm sorry, Fred. Would you mind repeating that in my good ear?
I want to be the Easter Bunny.
What was that for?
That is for people who have gone loony!
A human Easter Bunny?
Come on, Fred!
It doesn't make sense.
A bunny makes no sense.
You deliver eggs.
If you wanna get all logical, bring logic into this, you should be an Easter Chicken.
What? Come on.
People might resist it at first.
But, hey, change can be a good thing.
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!
It did a number on me.
Do you know there was a period of roughly nine months where the sight of a colored egg made me want to vomit?
And rabbits are physically unable to vomit.
So it was just hours of...
Nothing coming out.
I don't care.
Imagine that, Fred.
Don't care.
If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.
Fred, you can't just be the Easter Bunny.
My dad has to give you special powers. Eh.
Besides, the Easter Bunny has got to be fit. Ow!
And you're a little scrawny.
Finally, the Easter Bunny has got to have lightning-fast reflexes.
Hi-ya!
Knock it off. I'm serious.
I can do this.
I will be the Bunny.
The stubborn old bunny refuses to crown anyone else.
This can only mean one thing, my friends.
We are going to have to take matters into our own hands.
Um, um, um.
Carlos? Carlos?
Yes, Phil?
We don't have hands, per se-.
No, it's a figure of speech, Phil.
Right. Got it.
Too long have we labored under the yoke of the bunnies' tyranny.
Well, no more!
It's time for the Easter Chick to rise!
Um, um...
Yes, Phil?
Just thinking out loud.
But wouldn't it be easier just to wait for E.
B? I mean, he can fix this.
Phil, if you love E.B. so much, why don't you marry him?
E.B. is gone, okay?
Oh.
There is a new boss.
Really? Who is it?
Is it me?
Are you being serious?
Yes. Hi.
Just rehearsing for the big Easter sing-a-long.
Okay, everybody, this time sing a lot more better.
And one, and two.
And three and four.
It's me. Me, you idiot.
I'm taking over.
Oh. I see.
But first,
I must get in shape.
I will be the Bunny.
You know,
I've been thinking, Fred.
Oh!
Hey, E.B., what's up?
Fred, listen.
You helped me become a drummer.
And how do I repay you?
I jellybean all over your dream. Well, no. No.
I've changed me mind.
I've seen the light.
We're going to do this.
And nice job on the eggs.
I told you I was serious.
Seventy-two.
Conditioning is a must, Fred.
Seventy-three.
This is fun. Just a couple of dudes hanging out, getting buff.
I could do this all day!
Me, too, Fred.
I feel great.
Phil, how am I doing?
Be honest.
Next up, speed and agility, Fred.
I want you to run so fast that you're just a handsome blur with great hair.
Ready? Go!
Fred, that was awesome!
For a couple of seconds, you touched greatness.
I can feel the burn!
But it's good.
It's a good burn.
Phil, too fast!
Too fast, Phil!
Sorry, sir.
Come on, Fred!
Keep hopping!
Woohoo!
That's the spirit!
The student is becoming the master.
The Padawan is becoming the Jedi!
The human being is becoming the Easter Bunny.
I can feel myself getting stronger.
Phil? How do I look from back there?
My buttocks, they are pretty firm, yeah?
It's a wonderful butt, Carlos.
Si, si, I know.
That's very good, in a crude, primitive, offensive-to-me-personally kind of way.
What do you think?
Uh...
It's a little too hot for the kids, no?
Very impressive!
But I can bet you can go even faster.
Way to go! Stay calm, Fred.
Dogs can smell fear.
And you have nothing to fear but fear itself, and this dog I'm riding on.
Wow!
Nice work, Fred.
Oh, no. Not today.
Ah!
What about Fred?
He'll be all right.
Whoa.
Hey, I know you guys.
You're the Pink Berets, right? Ha!
E.B. said you guys were so scary, but you're really...
You're really adorable.
Oh.
Easter Island.
Oh.
They brought me here to lead them in all things Easter, of course!
Hello, my fellow Easter-teers.
I am truly, truly humbled by your choice in me.
And as I stand before you, I...
Oh.
Is this part of the Coronation ritual?
Phuh!
Murderer!
Picking up a little tension in the room.
Carlos!
What's going on?
Who is this person and what's he doing here?
Wow, you're him.
The big guy. I'm Fred O'Hare.
I met you...
Well, I didn't meet you.
I saw you when I was a kid.
You look great.
Señor Bunny, brace yourself.
This heartless human, he has killed your son!
What? E.B.?
Did you Say "kill"?
NO, I didn't kill E.B.
Oh! Liar!
This can't be so.
Where are the Pink Berets?
Non
Wait a minute.
That's not...
Silence, human!
Can't you see you have broken his poor old heart?
Are you kidding me?
Old friend,
I share your sorrow.
E.B. was like your son to me.
I'm trying to keep it together.
But don't you worry,
I will take care of Easter.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Does anyone care that that's a Butterball turkey?
No, no, that is E.B.
He has the same shirt and everything.
My deepest condolences.
Attention, all bunnies.
There will be a service for E-B.
In the egg painting room.
Carrots and coffee to follow.
Carlos. What are you up to?
It's called a coup d'état.
Which is French for coup d'état!
But, Carlos.
You've been my most trusted number two for years.
Guess what? I am sick of doing number two.
It is our time for number one!
Yeah? We the bosses now.
All hail Carlos!
We the bosses!
We the bosses! Woohoo!
Pink Berets!
Seize him!
Woohoo!
Hey! Don't do that.
He's a beloved holiday icon!
No!
You can do this.
You are the world's best rabbit drummer.
You are a superstar.
You are a jerk for abandoning Fred.
Hey, I don't need that kind of voice in my head!
Yeah, well, you should have thought of that before you abandoned Fred.
Look, you better tell me something positive about me.
I can't. You abandoned Fred.
Oh! Hello, who is this gorgeous devil?
Is Eb in here, please?
Eb?
It's "E.B." That's me.
Oh, all right, well, E.B. , you're wanted on stage in two minutes.
Welcome to Hoff Knows Talent.
You guys look great- There are all kinds of exciting acts tonight-
There he is.
How's my little guy?
Actually, David Hasselhoff,
I've got a problem.
Hmm.
Is it the jitters?
Believe me, even I used to get them.
Now, I find a good way...
No, it's not the jitters, David.
I'm starting to realize I might be a really selfish rabbit.
Look, I love drumming.
But when my friend needed me most,
I left him in a house full of highly trained ninja bunnies.
What am I going to do?
Hmm.
A dilemma as old as time itself.
I know that if I left right now, I'd be giving up fame.
And untold riches.
And untold riches.
And all the bunnies you could ever want.
Yes, and all the...
You're not really helping much, David.
Like, at all!
And Fred could be in real trouble.
Go to him.
Go to him.
Give it up for Mr.
David Hasselhoff!
It's The Hoff#
Fred?
Anybody home?
Fred?
Uh-Oh.
The Easter moon is on the rise.
At midnight, her radiant beams will fill up the Egg of Destiny with magic.
Then, at last, Senor Bunny,
I will be Easter's new king!
Carlos, I'm warning you!
The Egg of Destiny is too dangerous in the hands of a chick.
Its power can only be wielded by a bunny.
Oh, yes? Well, look at me wielding.
I'm wielding!
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding it again. Okay?
Oh, Carlos, can I wield the Egg of Destiny? Please?
No.
Can I at least touch it?
OW!
There, you touched it.
That was harsh.
But, Carlos, think of the children.
Yes, but I am! The childrens.
They don't want candy and chocolate.
From now on, their baskets will be filled with clumps of bird seed, dried crickets, and the world's finest worms!
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Mmm!
Have you completely lost your mind?
Silence! You see, this is why he must go.
It's this lousy attitude of his. Well, no more!
The more sensitive chicks in the room may want to avert their eyes.
What about a compromise, okay?
The bunny gets Easter one year and the chick gets it the next.
Enough of the chitty-chatty.
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.
Hello! Hey, everyone.
I'm back. Yep, it was all a big mistake, but I'm alive.
Hey, Larry, Kyle, what are you doing in there?
E.B.! You're alive!
E.B.!
Dad? Fred? What's going on?
Gummy cannons! In position.
Fire at will!
That hurt!
Put him on the belt, boys.
Dice him, slice him, and pulverize him!
That is a bit excessive.
Oh, no! E.B.!
Son!
The reign of the bunny is over!
Oh!
Somebody help!
Help us!
What are you doing? Don't worry, Dad, Fred.
I'll be right there.
To the Egg Sleigh!
And step on it!
Are these ropes made of black licorice?
Yes, yes, they are.
Horrible stuff!
We can eat through them.
I suppose you can.
You see, my friends?
It is just like I told you, no?
Oh, tonight is going to be a very big night!
I'm flying!
Without even flapping my tiny wings.
Everything is coming up Carlos!
Got it!
Good man, Fred.
Hop on.
All right. Let's go!
I'm starting to get a sense of impending doom now.
Ow!
No!
I made it!
All right. Here we go!
Come on, Fred!
Whoa!
Look, Fred! There he is.
It's E.B.! E.B.!
The Egg Sleigh!
You've got to stop Carlos!
Don't worry, Dad!
I'm on it!
The power is surging through my veins!
It's good to be the king.
En?
What is happening to me?
Uh-Oh.
Whoa!
Come on out, Carlos.
It ends here!
You think you can just take over Easter?
Well, guess what?
I actually think you're on to something.
You're a bright man, you're an innovator.
I like it.
Give it a whirl.
One second. Hey!
You finish?
Um... Not quite.
Take that!
Get off!
Whoa!
Incoming!
Why?
Bunny slam!
OW!
You father was a fool to think you would ever amount to anything.
Here comes
Carlos Yellowtail
Hopping down the chicky trail
Easter is coming your way
Okay, Phil, initiate take-off procedures.
Aye-aye, Captain!
Chicks, fall in!
Attention!
Here we go.
Right naps!
Left flaps!
Okay, we're good to go!
Let's go, Phil.
Easter is waiting.
Righty-o.
Uh-Oh.
Oh, boy.
Phil, let's get this bird in the air!
Yeah!
Phil!
Knock off the dancing!
Yes, sir. Sorry.
Lifting off!
No way! The show is not over.
Phil!
What are you doing?
Fly us straight!
No, no, Phil!
Knock it off!
Keep her level!
NO, Phil.
Phil! Phil!
Phil! Please, Phil!
Phil!
Phil, I'm feeling a little...
Will you please stop dancing?
Phil!
Woohoo!
Yeah, that's right!
This is not over!
Ah-ha!
Thank you very much.
Dad!
E.B.!
I was so worried, Son.
I'm so sorry for all the things I said.
Me, too, Dad.
And your friend, here.
He saved my life.
He was magnificent!
Well, I...
I kind of was.
Hey, thanks, Fred.
Well, Easter's in a few hours.
I have to get going.
What?
Dad, I'm ready.
But, E.B., what about your dream?
I'm still going to be a drummer, Dad.
But I can be the Easter Bunny, too.
There's just one thing.
All right, then.
Fredrick O'Hare.
Yes, Sir.
Please step forward.
Down on one knee.
Left or right, doesn't matter.
And now, place your forefinger on the Egg of Destiny.
Oh...
EB., you as well.
By the power vested in me,
I pronounce E.B. and Fred O'Hare co-Easter Bunnies.
Hear, hear!
Wow!
Now go forth and deliver!
Woohoo!
Wonderful brunch, Bonnie.
Thank you, dear.
It is delicious.
Totally agree.
This is amazing, Mom.
You should open a restaurant.
I'm serious.
That is a very nice thing to say, Fred.
And can I say that
I love your costume?
I think it is so cheerful.
Thanks, Mom.
But it's a uniform.
I'm so tired.
Yeah, you were up very late delivering pizzas.
Easter baskets.
Every time you say "Easter baskets," I hear "pizza."
It just helps me cope.
Guys, can we not do this today?
Oh, they're here.
This is exciting.
That is my co-Easter Bunny.
Hey, why don't you guys come see me off?
It'll be fun.
Well, that's weird.
Who do you think it is?
I don't know.
Wow.
Fred.
Fred, wait.
This is amazing!
I know, right?
It's pretty cool, huh?
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time.
Aw, Dad, come on.
You don't have to...
I'm proud of you.
Thanks, Dad.
Easter Bunny.
Wow!
The one who makes it all happen.
Say the words, Fred.
Bring it home.
Happy Easter to all!
And to all, a good mid-to-late morning.
On Cheepers! On Peepers!
On Biscuit and Buzzy!
On Chucky! On Clucky!
On Feathers and Carlos.
Yeah, come on, Carlos.
Put your back into it.
I've been flapping all night, so just cut me some slacks, okay?
One little coup and suddenly
I'm everybody's chump.
Fred, what did she say?
Was that about me?
You speak Chinese? Just when I think I can't love you any more...
Somebody told me once...
that if you stand still in the forest long enough...
you'll see signs of a hidden struggle.
Raging between forces of life and decay.
That the survival of the forest itself depends on the outcome.
And that the good guys need all the help they can get.
And that if you don't believe it, take a close look.
And if you still don't, look closer.
Oh! Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Ah! Oh, oh, oh!
Whoa! I...
Oh!
Whoa!
Need a lift?
I don't need your help!
You're running out of branch there, buddy.
Still don't need your help.
Whoa! Oh!
Why aren't you with your group?
What? I fly faster alone!
How do you not get this?
You're not the only one on this team, you know.
So yell at one of them for a change.
You hear that? What am I supposed to do with this kid?
Ah, you're right.
You've got your own problems.
You're a Leafman. You know how important today is.
You know what? I'm thinking maybe
I'm just not cut out for this.
That's the problem.
You are cut out for it.
But I'm tired of waiting for you to prove it.
Get a bird and get back to
Moonhaven, or you're done.
What, you're not going to help me now?
I just did.
That's cool!
I could probably just jump from here!
Just follow that last guy down!
Whoa! Incoming.
Bet they didn't have bugs like that in the city.
Yeah. I miss it already.
She talks!
Something on your mind, kid?
What do you say to a total stranger?
Stranger? You and I go back twenty minutes.
Not you... Larry.
I mean the person I'm visiting.
I'm leaving you out here with someone you don't know?
It's okay, Lar.
We weren't always strangers.
Maybe now things will be different.
♪ And everyone says
♪ This love will change you
♪ Well, I ask
♪ Does anything ever stay the same?
♪ No, no, no
♪ It's strange changes
That's not a house, that's termites holding hands. No offense.
Don't worry, Lar. I'll be...
Call if you need a quick getaway, kid!
Fine.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Hello?
Okay. No, actually, you know what?
I should check this bee.
No, that's right there. Uh...
Do we have... I had it we... Oh, no, it's over here.
Okay. Yeah.
Uh, let's see.
Uh...
Made of...
Oh, gosh!
I don't know, polished acorn shell and thin leather?
Perhaps mouse hide.
Pardon me, excuse me, sorry.
Correction: not mouse hide.
Shrew, perhaps.
Or, you know what, actually, it could be vole.
Hi, Dad.
Oh!
Mary Katherine!
Yeah.
You're here! Mmm!
Yeah.
I didn't realize today was today.
It always is.
Hey, let me look at you! Oh...
You look just like your mother.
Like she did.
You would, if you know what I mean... Dad.
Do you want to talk about it, if that's...
Thanks, but I've been reading up on the five stages of grief.
I'm working through them myself.
I'm good like that.
There actually are a few things
I would like to talk about.
Oh, oh, oh! Ozzy!
Look who's back!
Ozzy?
He's still alive?
Well, you know, most of him.
He may be down to three legs, but he'll make a break for it... the first chance he gets.
Ozzy, go say hi.
Here, boy!
Ah, there he goes.
His depth perception's a little off... and he has a tendency to run in circles.
Hey, but that was closer than usual, you know?
He remembers you!
So, I have a little surprise for you up here.
Just follow me, take a look.
Ozzy! No. No kisses.
Well, here we are.
Welcome home.
It's like I never left.
All your things are here, you got your dolls and... your pictures, your turtle.
Oh, dear.
Well, it's good to have you back, Mary Katherine.
Actually, I go by MK now.
Oh! MK.
I like that.
It's more grown-up.
Oh! Um... Hmm.
Do you have to get that?
Oh, no. No. That was just one of my sensors.
I got a lot going on right now.
Today is actually a highly unusual day.
There is both a full moon tonight and the summer solstice... which only coincide every hundred years or so.
You can imagine, it's just crazy over here.
Hey! Uh...
You probably want some time to settle in.
I'm just going to let you make yourself at home, Mary Kather...
Oh! No, who's Mary Katherine?
MK, I mean.
Okay, Mom, I'm trying.
That was the deal.
Oh, my.
Oh!
Come on, Mom, you're going to miss them.
Hey, Leafmen!
Huh? What?
Queen Tara, we need to discuss today's ceremony.
The Boggans have crossed our border again.
You're not getting enough sunshine.
Yes, it's Ronin.
Well, I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.
I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.
You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.
When we were kids he wasn't so serious.
Would you like to hear my plan?
And he had the sweetest smile.
Look, instead of a public ceremony,
I go in with a small platoon... pretend we're stopping for a drink.
We grab a pod, bring it back to you.
It blooms, the life of the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.
It doesn't work that way.
I can't choose unless I'm there.
It's about the feeling.
I get it from the pods...
I get it from the forest...
I get it from all of us.
There we are.
Don't you have feelings, Ronin?
Yes, I feel this is a bad idea.
The Boggans have never been this aggressive.
I'm not completely helpless, you know.
I am aware.
But you're the life of the forest.
Looking after you is my duty.
Is that the only reason you do it?
Isn't that reason enough?
If that's the only reason there is.
Your Majesty.
Yes?
I'm not ticklish.
Oh!
You used to be!
Very well. I understand your concern... but this is the one day in a hundred years I can choose an heir.
If I don't do this today... there won't be a future to protect.
I don't think I saw a salute, Boggan!
We had a little skirmish with some Leafmen this morning.
A rat got caught in the crossfire... so I got a new coat.
It's, uh, just like yours!
Did you find the location of their ceremony?
Uh...
Yes, sir!
It's way outside of our borders.
You mean their borders?
The Leafmen think they can keep us contained... surround our beautiful island of rot... with their hideous green forest.
So arrogant!
All in the name of balance.
I'm sick of balance.
No matter how much of the forest we destroy... the queen regrows it with one wave of her hand.
She needs to be cut down!
At the root!
Exactly.
Today we'll show them you just can't stop the rot.
If the queen dies without an heir... the Leafmen can't regrow anything.
The balance swings in our favor forever.
Leaving you and me... rulers of a desperate, desiccated kingdom.
I won't let you down...
Dad.
I know you won't.
You look good in rat.
It's slimming.
Yeah!
Look out, look out!
Here comes your star pupil.
Oh, oh, oh!
Where have you been?
Wait, you're mad?
You told me to get back and I'm back.
On this!
And you want credit for that?
You're late.
Find a real bird and get back to your group.
You know what? No.
What did you say?
I'm not doing it.
I'm not a kid anymore and I'm tired of you treating me like one.
I'm trying to help you, I'm trying to look out for you.
I never asked you to do that.
Your father did.
Well, you can stop.
I absolve you of all further responsibility in the raising of young Nod.
Don't walk away from me.
I'm your commanding officer!
Not anymore!
I quit! Hyah!
Whoa! Thatta girl.
Easy, easy!
What are you looking at?
Nothing. I have no opinion on this.
Everyone, mount up!
Parade! Fun! Smiling!
Dad!
Dad!
Is this a good time to talk?
Ow. Hold on, I'll be right down!
Ow!
Ozzy!
Ozzy, stop!
Fetch the camera!
Why do you have security cameras, anyway?
Do people around here steal old newspapers?
Oh, no, no. They're not security cameras.
No, I have an extensive network all through the forest, yeah.
I don't know how much your mother told you about my work.
Um... nothing.
Just that you have a delusional belief... in an advanced society of tiny people living in the woods... and it ruined your career... not to mention your marriage.
Or something?
Well... your mother had a wonderful sense of humor.
But I'm not delusional.
I know they're out there.
It's intuition, like scientists intuited the atom.
These little guys are a big part of the ecosystem... the engine, if you will, and I will prove it. Here.
You have bat sounds on your iPod? Why?
To study them. They don't really fly in your hair.
That's a myth.
But I was trying to identify... the frequencies that draw bats to gather with their own kind.
So I slowed the sounds down... and I put them through some proprietary filters... and guess what I heard.
Voices?
Yes!
Isn't that cool?
Okay... if tiny men are flying around in the forest... how come I've never seen them?
No, that's easy.
It's the same reason we can't hear them.
They just move too fast, like insects.
Didn't you ever wonder why it was so hard to swat a fly?
My theory is they're actually living faster.
Like in a different dimension.
So, no matter how fast we think we are... to them we're just big and dumb and... slow.
Have you ever seen one?
Well, you know, uh...
You know what? Just because you haven't seen something... doesn't mean it's not there.
I, you know, that's...
Come on.
Okay, we need to talk.
I know it's a lot to take in.
I mean about us.
Oh, no! No, we'll do it together!
Yeah, both of us. Here,
I made this for you.
Dad, look...
I am almost old enough to be on my own anyway... so I think it would be better if I just...
Um...
You don't want to live here?
That's what you want?
No, it's not what I want.
I want you to stop!
All this!
And be normal. I just, I want a dad who's not...
Oh, um, okay.
This is big.
This is a big thing going on right now.
Let me just find...
Where are you going?
I'm just going to investigate, rather...
Okay, something must be happening.
Ooh! Uh... Let's see.
Where's my camera?
Are you serious?
You have to catch these things in the moment... while they're happening... otherwise you miss a chance that could be gone forever.
You're missing a chance right now!
Are you even listening?
Look, you've got to believe me.
I am so close.
All I need is one little breakthrough.
This could be it!
I will clear this all up when I get back!
I promise!
Sure, Dad.
I'll be here.
In reality.
Bye, Ozzy.
It's not you.
Uh, Larry? I need that getaway cab.
I said, pick me up by the... Hello?
Ugh! No bars!
Ozzy! Heel!
Stop! Play dead!
How are you so fast on three legs?
Ozzy!
Ozzy!
Ozzy!
Isn't she pretty?
She's awesome!
She moved those trees with her mind!
Mom, can I be queen when I grow up?
Oh, honey, it doesn't work that way.
Today, Queen Tara gives her power to a special Pod... so the life of the forest will continue.
It's all very mysterious, and...
Sweetie, what are you doing?
Mom!
I did it!
Did what?
Aw!
She's coming!
Don't do anything to embarrass me... or it could ruin my chances of being a Leafman.
Why do you want to be a Leafman?
They gotta wear uniforms.
Me? I like to let it all hang free.
You see this, you see that?
Yeah, don't do that.
That's vile.
Come on, I know you got a little belly, too.
Gentlemen.
Hey. Your Majesty.
Hello.
It's all right.
Relax, it's just me.
Mub, Grub, it's a very nice-looking group of Pods.
I might have a hard time picking one.
Do you have a favorite?
Well, Your Majesty, we have had quite the debate.
Really gone back and forth.
You'll note the carefully curated selection of sizes, densities, color.
With so many variables, you can't be too hasty.
Boom! Right here.
Biggest in the bunch.
Hmm.
Well, that's one way to go.
How about that one?
What? That one?
For real?
But it's so...
Perfect!
It's perfect.
Excellent choice, Your Majesty.
Sometimes the biggest one isn't the best one. Ow!
I told you, she doesn't like gaudy, Mub.
Unlike you, she's got class.
This is it.
This is the one.
Aw!
Boggans.
Your Majesty!
Get to the barge!
I told you she was awesome!
Hold the formation!
This is it, Mub!
My chance to be a Leaf...
What? Your chance to be a what?
Ronin!
Ozzy?
Oh, come on, Ozzy.
We had numbers, and we had the surprise part!
How are we losing?
Patience, son. The forest wasn't grown in a day.
But we can destroy it in one. Right?
Ha! That's the spirit!
You take the Pod,
I'll take the queen.
Nice one!
You're stealing my moves, kid!
Your Majesty, come with me!
Take her to safety!
I have to lead them away from the crowd!
You're totally my hero!
Okay... so maybe you were right.
Remind me to gloat later.
Son! No!
Ozzy!
Ah!
Oh!
Ah! Ah, ah!
Ahhh!
Huh?
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Oh, my gosh, that's an arrow.
Should I pull it out?
I don't know what to do.
Take the Pod to Nim Galuu.
Nim what?
You need a doctor.
Somebody call...
What is this thing?
It's the life of the forest.
Tara!
So serious.
I'm so sorry.
What did she say to you?
Something about glue?
Or a canoe.
Nim Galuu.
The scroll keeper.
We don't know anything about the Pod without Tara.
Maybe he does.
Take the Leafmen to Moonhaven.
Fortify it.
Keep everyone safe.
What about you?
Mandrake will be looking for this Pod... but he won't be looking for a Leafman traveling alone.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
I'll send word when I reach Nim's.
Who are you people? Is this some sort of reenactment?
That's a big bug.
No, it's about average, actually.
Then what? I'm tiny?
Oh, no.
No.
No, no, no.
I'm not sure why the queen brought you here either... but she gave you that Pod, so you have to come with me.
Make me big!
Excuse me?
I'm not going anywhere until you make me big again!
Uh... You know what?
I don't do magic.
You can talk to Nim Galuu about that, he might know something.
Might?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast, soldier boy.
You do not yank on a Pod, okay?
Especially when it's attached to something so lovely.
Talking snails.
Actually, he's a snail.
I'm a slug.
No shell over here, baby.
It just slows me down.
Ronin, right?
Head of the Leafmen?
Big fan.
I just love what you do with your jaw.
Yes, that!
We are the official
Pod caretakers, sir.
It can't survive without us.
We keep it moist.
Moist is what we do.
You're kidding.
You're not kidding. Fine.
Word of the queen's passing will travel fast... we have to travel faster.
With all this extra weight we're going to need another bird.
Bird. Of course.
By any chance... you don't happen to be part of an advanced society... of tiny people living in the woods, do you?
Some are more advanced than others.
And that's another lap down.
These racers are in it to win...
and they'd better be, we've got some
heavy betting in the crowd today.
They're clustering together...
I'm telling you, this is where I belong!
You belong in the back of the pack!
I mean racing!
The best man wins.
No other rules, nobody telling you what to do.
You talk too much!
And you ain't winning this race!
Sorry, can't hear you!
Going too fast!
Hey. Nice old fleabag you got there.
It's not the bird, it's how you ride it.
Yeah? Prove it.
Fetch!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's a dirty trick,
which, let's face it, is exactly what we've come to see.
Final lap!
This is bird racing, folks, it's not a parade.
Looks like Nod's out of the race.
Wait a minute, is that...
Nod is down but not out!
Don't let his old bird fool you!
The kid's on the comeback trail!
You know what we'll do if you win?
I don't know, lose?
It's the final lap.
They're beak to beak, wing to wing...
and it's Nod by a tail feather!
The odds-on favorite takes it home.
I bet there's a lot of happy faces in the crowd right now.
Is that the best you've got?
How was that?
Better.
Nod, you know I like you.
Yeah, I like you, too,
Mr. Bufo.
And yet, you don't do what we agreed.
We agreed that you would lose, but then you win.
Now, I can't help it if I'm fast.
You want me to lose, you gotta give me some better competition.
It's called teamwork.
Maybe if you understood that... the Leafmen wouldn't have kicked you out.
They did not kick me out.
I quit.
I admire your independent spirit, Nod, I'll miss that.
Feed him to something.
A snake would be good.
No, snakes just swallow you whole.
Now, if you put him in a hornets' nest, that's a show.
Ah, look, it's Ronin, defender of the weak... popper of parties, here to ruin the fun.
I didn't ruin all of it.
I let you hit him.
Twice.
Hop along now, little froggy.
Easy, Ronin, it's a big forest out there.
Even Leafmen gotta sleep.
You're wasting your time.
I'm not coming back.
I'm not asking.
Oh, I see. The old reverse psychology.
Make me feel guilty, get me to beg you.
I didn't come for you.
The queen is dead.
What? How?
Boggan ambush.
Ronin,
I don't know what to say.
She was your...
I'm sorry.
What's going to happen to us, to the forest?
If we don't get the Pod to Nim
Galuu's, the forest will die.
Let me grab my saddle.
What? No. I didn't ask for your help.
Really? Because it sounds like you could use a rider with my...
Ability to absorb punches?
The situation's desperate.
Let's not make it hopeless.
All right, well, who's with you?
Who's riding point?
Uh-oh.
Get your saddle.
I'll get my saddle.
This doesn't make any...
I mean, it makes sense.
Mary Katherine, you're not gonna believe these readings... they are off the charts!
The wind, and the rain and lightning!
And the birds were flying!
In a storm!
Okay, and that's not normal.
Which would prove...
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to make some lunch... and I'll tell you all about it.
Ozzy, what are you doing outside?
Did you see it, too?
Tell me you saw it.
Hey, Mary Katheri...
Or, no, MK!
MK, what did you want to talk about?
What?
What is it, Ozzy?
Hey, I'm Nod, by the way.
Hi. MK. Yeah.
Could you just face the way the bird's driving?
No, don't worry. She practically flies herself.
Great, because this whole bird-riding thing's new to me.
Are you serious?
We gotta fix that.
Here, put your arms around me.
I just met you.
Okay, but you're gonna want to hold on to something.
What is wrong with you?
Do you know how hard it is to do that without falling?
I do now!
Nod, perch your bird.
Hey, I'm just trying to keep things... light.
What did that?
Mandrake.
Tara's power always kept him in check.
Now nothing can heal what he destroys.
Except that Pod.
We have to go around.
Just for one scout?
Ever see just one Boggan?
Hold on to me. Hyah!
Still barely know you.
Nod, wait!
Whoa!
Get to the ground!
This way!
Other way!
What was that thing?
What, you've never seen a Boggan?
Someone had a happy childhood.
Come on, let's regroup.
You mean up there with those things?
They almost killed us.
Don't turn around.
Is it a Boogie?
Walk towards me slowly.
Oh, it's a mouse.
Hi, mousie!
I was gonna scare it away.
What are you doing?
Look at its little hands and its little whiskers. Oh!
Hello! Other person!
Jump!
I can't jump that high!
Ohh! Ah!
Did you see what I just did?
Out! Jump out!
Oh, great.
Hey, over here!
Over here!
Whoa, whoa!
Fuzzy mousie.
Ahh!
Nice tail.
It's flexible.
Ah! Ah! Help!
They have very sensitive whiskers.
You know, I had this.
Uh-huh.
Are you all right?
Dad? I had the most messed-up dream.
There were talking slugs and tiny little soldiers and...
Hello!
Ah, man!
Now let's move.
Where there's mice there's bound to be chipmunks.
New seating arrangement.
You're riding with me.
Thank you.
You're with the slugs.
Ugh! Disgusting.
Do you and me have a problem?
Uh, I don't think so.
What was that over there?
A little chit-chat?
That's real cute.
You trying to jump in?
What are we talking about?
There's a code amongst men.
It goes something like this.
I saw her first.
Ow!
You're a slug.
So? You think she'd want you?
Look at yourself!
Oh, that's right, you can't... because your eyeballs are stuck all the way inside your head.
What's wrong, flatface?
Are you gonna cry?
Do you want me to call your flatface mommy?
You know you're not insulting me, right?
You're just grossing me out.
You've been warned.
Ow!
Hey, if this is a bad time...
I can come back when you're done gardening.
Oh! Hey!
I imagine you're wondering why I invited you here.
I was frog-marched here at spearpoint. Ah!
How is that invited?
I let you keep your legs.
Comedy. Terrific.
Funny psychopath.
There are rumors that the Leafman Ronin was at your place of business... and that he may have rescued a Royal Pod.
Real smooth.
You got rid of the queen, but let her Pod get away.
Plus your idiot general gets himself mulched.
That idiot general... was my son!
Of course he was.
He had your good looks.
And your healthy gray complexion.
And forgiving nature.
Shut up!
What's it gonna be, Bufo?
Are you gonna talk?
Or are you gonna croak?
Where are they taking the Pod?
It's clear. Hyah!
Why is he even with us?
He's not helping.
Well, when he's not being an idiot... he's a pretty decent flier.
Could be one of the best.
Plus his father was my friend, so I do what I can.
"Many leaves, one tree."
What does that mean?
We're all individuals, but we're still connected.
It's what we live by.
Hyah!
Maybe you're connected, but I'm kind of on my own.
No one's on their own.
Not even him.
Hey, Nod, how's the view?
Well... here we are.
I thought this was a secret Leafmen mission.
How many people did the queen tell about this?
They're here looking for answers.
Nobody knows that the queen is gone... only that the blight is spreading.
So, this Nim guy can tell them?
He's the keeper of our history... but even he may not know about the queen.
He's not always up to speed.
But he'll help, right?
He's, like, the wise old man of the forest.
Uh, he's more like the crazy uncle.
The whole meadow just died.
Everything was green, and now it's gone.
I grew up in that meadow.
Why isn't the queen doing anything?
If anything happened to her, everything's going to rot!
We're doomed!
We're doomed!
Get a hold of yourself!
Oops. Sorry.
Friends!
Neighbors!
Prepare to see your worries... disappear.
Ooh!
I know rumors have been flying... but the truth is never as bad as it seems.
I have just returned from deep inside this tree... from the Rings of Knowledge... where every memory... every event that ever happens in the forest... is recorded in these scrolls.
♪ Listen, party poopers,
I've got something to say
♪ Dry your weeping eyes, we're gonna be okay
♪ So you don't have to worry about a dog gone thing
♪ The Rings of Knowledge know everything
♪ The scrolls never lie and, honey, neither does Nim
♪ It's right here in my hands, all six of them
♪ So tuck your little fears and put them right into bed
♪ It says right here that the queen...
That the queen is...
Uh...
What?
Just tell us what it says!
What's it say?
He doesn't know anything! Boo!
Fraud!
♪ Dry your weeping eyes, we're gonna be fine
♪ Everything is really gonna be all right ♪
Ronin! Did you hear about the queen?
This is terrible!
I know, but...
We gotta do something!
We gotta keep everyone from freaking out!
Yes, that's why we...
And the Pod!
We gotta make sure the Royal Pod is safely hidden... far away. And...
What'd you bring it here for?
The queen's last words were
"Bring the Pod to Nim Galuu."
She say anything else? Specific instructions? Maybe a note?
Those were her last words.
I thought you were magic.
Magic might be stretching it.
I'm charismatic.
Possibly charming.
Do you know what to do with the Pod or not?
Not a clue, but I do know where to look it up.
Follow me!
There he is!
Phony!
Um, no, it's this way.
The Rings of Knowledge!
Is everything that happens really recorded right here?
Oh, yeah.
And you've read all these scrolls?
Ah, I've skimmed them.
So, is this event being recorded?
Right now?
Of course.
Is this?
Yes.
How about this?
Yes.
What about this?
Yep.
That should be it right here.
Thanks, Marty.
Aw!
Okay. Blooming a Pod.
Gotta go way back for that.
Here we go.
Let's see.
Pod, care of.
Must keep moist.
Well, good news is, once the queen chooses it... it's going to bloom no matter what.
But it has to open tonight... in the light of the full moon when it's at its highest peak.
Yep, solstice... full moon, highest peak, mentions it a bunch of times.
What happens if it blooms out of the moonlight?
Unclear.
The last part's missing.
I gotta be honest, termites have been a problem.
So here I thought we were doomed.
This calls for a celebration!
I suppose we've earned it.
Wait... this is gonna sound weird, but...
I'm not from this world.
And I thought maybe something in these scrolls could tell me... if there's a way for me to get home.
The scrolls don't tell the future... they only guide us with the knowledge of the past.
Hey, that's a great line!
You guys got that, right?
So you can't help me?
I didn't say that.
I can't read this.
It's just dusty.
Blow it off.
It's you.
But I saw you turn into moss.
Come closer.
Oh, this is perfect!
You can make me big again.
Closer.
It's a memory.
If you can hear me now... it means you got to Nim's.
The Pod needs you.
I can't be around for it anymore.
No, don't do that!
Why would you give that to me?
You don't understand,
I have to get home... this has nothing to do with me.
You're here for a reason.
Maybe you don't see the connections yet.
But just because you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there.
I know you're scared.
Just stay with the Pod... be with it when it blooms... and then you'll get back what you've given.
You'll get back.
Well, that was intense.
I gotta read more of these.
That means I can get home!
Well, if you want to go home so bad, then why did you leave?
Lose the sword, Ronin, we're done.
We're not done until the Pod blooms.
We're bringing it home to Moonhaven.
I need you to watch it while I tell the rest of the Leafmen to expect us.
Hey, I helped you get here, but I haven't changed my mind.
Do you think just because you're not a Leafman anymore... you're not a part of this?
Well, the fate of that Pod affects all of us.
The queen is gone.
But, as always, she looked out for us... even in her final moments.
Tonight, when this Pod blooms, a new queen will rise!
I know you're sad.
I am, too.
But Tara wouldn't want us to mourn!
She'd want us to celebrate her life!
And the life of the forest!
So, stay with it.
And don't lose the sword.
Look, I'm thinking that I didn't make the best first impression.
It's okay. I've never had a guy fight a mouse for me before.
You're not from around here, are you?
What makes you say that?
If you were,
I would remember you.
To Queen Tara!
To the queen!
You wanna go somewhere quieter?
Will that be okay with Ronin?
Yeah, he said to watch the Pod... but there's nowhere safer than Nim's tree.
I think he's just pretty upset about the queen.
Here, let me show you something.
What?
Huh.
That actually gets easier.
What is...
Wow.
Grab on!
What?
Put your arms around me.
But I barely know you.
Do you want to ride him or not?
The scroll said there was nothing you could do to save her, Ronin.
You have to know that.
Send a code to the Leafmen.
Let them know the Pod is safe and we're bringing it home.
You heard him.
Go tell them, boys!
And it's happy hour at Nim's!
Or just do the first part.
I gotta admit, flying is nice, but this is riding in style.
Yeah.
Not everyone can do it.
You have to be gentle to ride a deer.
My dad taught me how.
It's one of my best memories of him.
You must really miss him.
I know how that feels.
Fruit fly, huh?
So, what's it like, having such a short life cycle?
It's great, mister!
When I grow up...
I'm going to... wish I had done more with my life, sonny.
The forest trembles at the passing of the humble fruit fly.
Excuse me, but I've lost something very dear to me.
It was left by a friend who's no longer with us.
Ah!
You found it!
If you want to take this Pod, you're gonna have to go through us!
Relax. I'm not going to hurt it.
I need it alive.
Well, we're the only ones that know how to keep it that way.
Thanks for the tip.
Stay with the Pod, that's all you had to do.
Yeah, but I just thought...
Do you ever think about anyone besides yourself?
It wasn't all his fault!
And you. I expected as much from him.
But I thought you would know better.
We're really sorry, okay?
I don't want to hear it.
That was the last part of the queen that I...
That any of us will ever have.
The queen gave it to me. I should have been here with it.
I'll do whatever it takes to help you get it back.
I appreciate the offer, but
Wrathwood is too dangerous.
But you can't go alone.
What about the whole leaves-tree thing that you said?
Nim, tell him.
Look, kid, the moon's coming up.
That's bloom-or-die time.
So if no one has a better plan...
Why don't we sneak in, in disguise?
Great idea.
I'll go as a grasshopper and you can be my cricket ladyfriend.
It's dangerous, I might get killed.
I thought you'd like that.
I don't have any Boggan armor handy.
Do you?
I know where we can get some.
Well?
I gotta say, six hands are better than two.
That's been my experience.
You might want to hang on.
Hyah! Whoa!
Stop! Please!
My son was born on a night like this.
These were his baby fangs.
And here's the first skin he ever molted.
He was big for a larva.
He took after his mother.
Your stories are boring and torturous!
And the Leafmen took him from me.
So I took something of theirs.
It's basic etiquette.
- An eye for an eye.
- Ow!
Jerk!
Tonight your Pod will bloom here.
And when a Pod blooms in darkness, it belongs... to the darkness.
It will become my little dark prince.
I'll destroy the forest with the very thing you hoped would save it.
I hate to break it to you, but it doesn't say that in the scrolls.
It does in the part I have.
D'oh!
Hey, the Boggan armor... where is it?
Over there.
Let's make this quick.
Come on.
Ow!
Oh!
Ow!
That was awesome. Here.
Up we go.
Ugh! That is some static cling.
No, that's metal, don't touch that!
Whoo!
Ow!
Knock it off.
Ow. Quit it.
Ow! No, you quit.
I'm not doing it.
Stop!
Ow. I'm not doing...
Now!
Come on.
You know... some of this stuff looks familiar.
Hey, that's my saddle!
Where are we?
Oh, it's where this guy lives.
I can't believe it.
He's been crashing around the forest like a bear for years.
Most stompers just come and go, but this guy's relentless.
- Wait. Stompers?
- Yeah.
Like us, but big and dumb and slow... always stomping on things. Stompers.
And this one is obsessed with finding us.
Obviously that's a security risk.
Can't have one of his big fat feet stepping on Moonhaven.
One of his ginormous, flabby, dirty, stinky...
Okay, I got it.
So we've been throwing him off the trail.
So you're just messing with him?
But he's found all this stuff.
He only finds what we want him to find.
Look at his map.
We've got him looking everywhere but where we are.
I love how this guy talks.
"Look at this flower."
"I hurt my elbow."
I think that's kind of mean.
"Who said that?"
It's his life's work.
He's my dad!
He what?
I'm a stomper.
What happened?
You got shrunk?
Yes! Which he knows.
Seriously?
It's been a weird day for everybody.
You got a problem with stompers?
A stomper squashed my uncle.
Oh, my gosh. Really?
No. I'm messing with you.
Too far?
Try it again, maybe she'll punch you harder.
I'm sorry.
I guess she's right about me, huh, Ozzy?
All I seem to be able to do is... drive people away.
No, Dad, you didn't! I'm here!
And you're right about all of it.
Don't stop looking.
Not now.
Dad! Dad, just turn around!
Uh-oh.
Ozzy... no kisses.
Ozzy!
Hey, how do I look?
Scary as ever.
Are you okay?
Run!
Ozzy, will you please stop?
Oh! Oh!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
They're here!
They're in my house!
No!
Ow!
I hurt my elbow!
Did you hear that?
He said it!
Whoa!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
No! Don't let go!
Don't let go! No!
Oh, oh!
Hello there, my little friend!
Dad! Dad!
Oh!
Dad! Dad!
Let's go.
You can't stay.
You're with us now!
I'll come home soon, Dad.
I promise.
Come on, MK, we gotta go.
You think he's okay?
Yeah, he'll be fine, their heads are like rocks.
Uh, smart rocks.
That's a whole lot of ugly.
Ugh! It smells like something died in here.
Something did.
How do we know where to go?
I've been here before... with your father.
He never told me about this.
He never got the chance.
How's my dark prince?
It's fine!
Good. Because if it dies, you die.
We know. You said.
Ugly says "what"?
What?
Nothing.
Shh!
There's our exit.
Meet me back here when you've got the Pod and the slugs.
How are we supposed to find them?
Follow the slime.
Aren't you coming with us?
I'm gonna make sure nobody follows you.
Don't worry, you get the easy part...
I get the fun part.
Hey, look!
It's a Leafman!
I'll keep this simple.
I run... you try to catch me.
Let's go.
When I get big again,
I am so coming back here with a can of bug spray.
Mub. Grub.
We're down here!
I told you she'd come for me.
This girl is smitten.
Mmm...
Hand me the Pod!
Oh, come on, you should work on your grip, my dude.
It's a bit womanly.
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa!
Hurry, before the guards come back!
Too late!
I have a plan!
Quick!
Everybody hide in your shells!
Oh. I have another plan!
Go! Go!
Ow! That hurts!
Those are my eyes!
Can you go any faster?
It's kind of hard when you're pulling on my brain!
Ronin!
What a surprise.
I get so few guests.
Could be the stench of death.
Some people don't care for it.
It's all right.
Ronin's an old...
What do you call someone you've known a long time... and always wanted to destroy?
I expected you to come.
But I didn't think you'd come alone.
Who said I'm alone?
Whoa.
Ow!
Ooh! So, what's the plan here?
A hundred Leafmen?
A thousand?
Don't flatter yourself.
Well, now I'm just embarrassed.
I completely over-prepared.
Go, go, go!
I'm afraid you'll find getting out... is a lot harder than getting in.
Ronin!
Hang on!
Go! Take the Pod to Moonhaven!
I'm not leaving without you!
Now you're starting to sound like a Leafman!
Ronin!
Come on!
Hyah!
We've been waiting for you.
Where's Ronin?
He gave us a head start.
But the Boggans aren't far behind.
You guys made it!
I knew you would.
You got that from the scrolls?
Some things you just know.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Moonlight comes in here, moves along here... reaches the Pod here.
At the moon's highest peak.
Only time it can bloom.
Do you know what this means?
We single-handedly saved the forest!
Eye five! Down low.
Too slow.
So, when the Pod opens, what happens to you?
I think I go home.
Well, I guess this is...
Yeah, I guess it is.
Mandrake's bats!
They're not attacking, they're just blocking out the moon.
Are you ready for this?
Are you kidding?
We're outnumbered, out of time and the fate of the world is at stake.
Why did I quit again?
See you up there.
As soon as I can find my helmet.
Thank you.
Hey, guys!
I'm going to need a uniform!
And a bird!
Oh, that's...
You...
That's all right.
I'll find them myself.
A Leafman makes do.
What are you doing?
I'm going to help.
Whoa, whoa.
You heard the queen!
If you want to get home... you have to be here with the Pod when it blooms.
Isn't that what you want?
So I should just sit here?
I didn't say that.
Then I'm going up there.
I didn't say that either.
You don't even know what you're saying.
I'm saying, who gives up everything... for a world that's not even theirs?
Dad. My dad does!
I have to get my dad!
Where do you think you're going?
The queen said I was here for a reason.
This must be it.
That's my girl.
Hyah!
Oh, come on!
Mandrake! He's headed for Moonhaven!
Grub! The Pod! It's blooming in darkness!
Whoa! Hyah!
Hey, Dad!
Come on, I need your help!
Whoa, whoa!
They're all right about me, Ozzy.
All these years just chasing things that aren't even there.
I actually thought
I saw my daughter, two inches tall, stuck in a bug jar.
I've lost my mind.
And I am talking to a dog.
Hey, Dad!
Come on, I need your help, Dad!
What? No! No!
Dad, look at me!
I'm right here!
Just check your cameras!
Ozzy, please.
I've made up my mind, okay?
Quiet!
I don't care anymore.
All I want now, is to find my daughter!
Dad, please!
Please, I need you.
Oh!
I am so over Boggans.
Ah!
Ozzy!
Dad!
Don't faint!
I won't!
How did you find me?
I got your message.
You were right.
About what?
About everything.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
How did you get so small?
Dad, it was amazing!
They're real!
And they need your help.
Follow me!
Missed me.
I wasn't aiming for you.
Ooh! This must be the delivery room.
Whoa! Boy, are you lost!
Down the hall... make a left, and then when you see the janitor with a weird eye...
Shut up!
My dark prince.
Come to Daddy.
I don't think it likes you.
Ronin!
You know how many Boggans
I had to fight to get here?
Seriously, I lost count.
Well, what's one more?
It's all real!
It's really here!
Dad, the bats! We have to get them away from the moon.
It's so beautiful.
There's no time!
But what matters most is...
Not now!
Oh!
Oh, you want me to play the frequencies that... attract the...
Run!
I'll find you, Dad!
I just have to get back before...
Oh! Oh!
Ow, ow, ow!
They really do go in your hair!
This time, when
I leave you for dead... you'll stay that way!
What's that little saying you people have?
"Lots of leaves, something-something"?
Very inspiring.
But in the end every leaf falls and dies alone.
No one is alone.
Not even him.
Look after them for me.
There's that smile.
Your Majesty.
You look terrible.
Hey, did you see how many times I got hit?
I learned that from you.
You're not going to make me say all the stuff...
I learned from you now, are you?
Well, you'd have learned a heck of a lot more from your dad.
I was a pretty poor substitute.
Don't beat yourself up. Lately you've shown some real promise.
Oh, please.
Just say you love each other.
I thought we just did.
Hey, you're still here.
Yeah.
I guess I missed my chance.
I'm sorry.
But not completely sorry.
Wow! Strong grip!
What's happening?
A queen brought you here. How about a queen sends you back?
It's working!
We have to say goodbye!
What for?
You're part of us.
Many leaves, I always say.
I mean, the Leafmen say.
Not that I'm a Leafman.
Says who?
We'll find each other!
Just follow the slime!
I will, Mub.
You're really leaving.
Put your arms around me.
I always hoped if I, uh... if I proved it to her... she'd, uh... you know.
Well, what do you think?
It's perfect, Dad.
Except, the boots are higher and the sleeves are longer.
And they wear actual helmets, not acorns.
Really?
They should seriously consider the potential.
Ozzy!
Here you go, boy.
Um...
Go. It's always for you, anyway.
Hey.
Hey!
How's work?
No, it's not work when you love your job.
"Many leaves, one tree," that's what I always say.
Uh-huh.
What do you think you're doing, Leafboy?
Leafman. You know it's Leafman.
Is it?
I wasn't sure.
Hey, MK!
What's going on, baby girl?
Hi, Mub.
We were talking.
There's a big sack of
"shut your flat face" over there by that tree.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Listen, slick.
Guys, don't fight.
Oh, it won't be a fight. I could whip him with both eyes behind my back.
I'd like to see you try, jelly butt.
I didn't want to have to do this!
Ew!
Mub, get him out of your mouth!
Dad, I gotta go Heimlich my friend out of a slug.
Yeah, that looks pretty weird.
Here don't forget this.
Tell them about the acorn helmets.
Or you could tell them yourself.
Oh!
Come on, Ozzy!

Fall back!
Go! Go! Go!
Thanks. I'd hate to miss the view.
You know, the cops didn't seem to like you that much, Ms. Lane.
- Occupational hazard.
- You and me both.
So which are you guys angling for?
Life in prison or, you know, blaze of glory?
You watch your mouth, lady.
You're not proving to be much use to us.
No offense, it just takes pretty huge stones to get this noisy in Metropolis.
Oh, didn't you hear?
Seven-point-two in Belize this morning.
Superman's busy, we scramble.
- You do know he flies fast, right?
- We'll take our chances.
- What the...?
- Plus there's the other one.
Other one?
- Superman's cousin. Didn't you hear?
- No, I didn't hear.
You really should read my column.
You don't know many teenage girls, do you?
Rebellious, angry at the world, doesn't know her own strength?
You're in deep trouble.
Ow!
Hold it, the skirt's the bad cop?
She's just visiting.
Metropolis is my turf.
- You all right, Ms. Lane?
- I am now, Superman.
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.
If I knew I was gonna be abducted,
I might have skipped the heels.
Seat belt?
Enough!
Let me explain how this is gonna go.
Anyone else care to educate me?
Kara, what the hell were you trying to prove out there?
I was stopping bad guys.
That's what we do, right?
- Stop them, not scramble them.
- Don't lecture me, Kal.
I'm still older than you.
No. You may have left Krypton that way, but you're not anymore.
The wormhole got me here faster.
That's not fair.
Tell it to Einstein.
- Who?
- Smart guy. Lived here on Earth.
Do your homework.
Why don't you do yours?
Excuse me?
You've spent your whole life on this planet.
You grew up with these powers.
Do you even remember Krypton?
Your parents? My parents?
Only a little.
Well, for me, it was only several months ago.
I didn't have powers. Nobody did.
And when bad things happened, we were helpless.
Kara, I can't know unless you tell me.
Ask regular people down there how they feel when guys like that terrorize them.
I have powers now.
And I'm going to use them.
This is U. S. Space Surveillance.
We've got an unknown object, incoming over the southwestern U.S.
Lost contact with communications satellite VN59.
GEODSS, can you get a visual?
- Teenagers.
- It's a matter of calibration.
She's a good kid. She'll learn.
- So, what's your excuse?
- Meaning?
You volunteered to be their hostage?
Well, better me than someone else.
You have to stop doing things like that.
- No, what I have to do is get the story.
- Other reporters do their jobs...
...without needing me to save them every time.
Other reporters don't have the access I do.
To the stories or to me?
Both.
Must be awful being you.
Most powerful man in the world...
...and you still can't control the women in your life.
Kent.
You're not Kent.
Uh, just leaving a note.
Think he'll mind if I use his DVD player?
Mine's...
I busted mine.
You and he aren't dating?
- What makes you ask?
- Yeah, didn't think so.
I got a little theory about Kent.
The way he's so secretive about his personal life?
- Yeah?
- Ask him if he's got a girlfriend...
...you never get a straight answer.
How he's not really a sports guy, but he's in that great shape.
- Huh.
- I'm just saying.
- So, what's your story?
- Me?
We know you're not with Kent.
Oh, it's just, I thought you were asking about Clark because you were...
Me? Hey listen, baby.
Any time you need proof what makes me stand and salute, you just let me... Aah! Unh!
Ooh. Sorry,
I've been meaning to get that fixed.
Lois, Perry wants to see us.
Heart rate, breathing, skin temp.
- What? You're mad at me?
- You're something else.
I don't care what he thinks about me.
I know that.
I'm surprised you didn't think of it yourself.
It's the perfect cover.
- Then what?
- You don't want anyone knowing...
...that we're together, but at the same time, you don't let another guy even talk to me.
It's like I'm going out with my own stalker.
Him? Lombard?
You want that guy hitting on you?
No. That's not the point.
The point is, you need to ease up a little.
Thought you like it when I come to your rescue.
Seems like it, the way you take unnecessary risks.
When I'm falling out of a plane, rescue me.
Getting ogled by the office pig, I can handle.
It's like everything you do is to protect poor Lois.
- And what's wrong with that?
- I don't need protecting.
Heads up, guys.
Some kind of thing falling over Arizona.
Reports of an unidentified object...
...currently projected to impact somewhere in the suburbs north of Phoenix.
- I gotta go.
- Go.
- We'll talk later.
- Go.
Ow.
I actually felt that.
Transmitter.
Uh-uh. No phoning home!
Still can't believe you eat these.
Trust me, honey.
In Kansas, bacon is one of the major food groups.
Maybe I'll fry you up some in the morning.
That's okay. Heh.
Come on. It's getting buggy out here.
Okay if I lose these?
No one's around for miles.
Sure.
I know Kal means well, but this is just not me.
Got a feeling you're not going...
...to be around Smallville long enough to need a secret identity.
I hope I don't seem ungrateful.
Oh, honey, you aren't.
You know Clark.
He always wants what's best for people.
I think he thinks history can repeat itself.
But we're all different.
Pa and I can never substitute for your parents.
We know that.
For one thing, we're too darn old.
And so are you.
Just know that you're special to us...
...and you'll always have a home here whenever you need it.
Thanks.
It can get awfully quiet around this place, but sometimes a person needs that.
... Superman seconds before it nearly destroyed a home in the high desert.
It works for him.
...Into a robot and attacked the Man of Steel.
We've received this amateur footage taken of the encounter.
Good lord, what do you suppose...?
Kara?
How far can you zoom in before we lose detail?
Well, lookie here.
What's she looking for?
Hey, I don't bite.
I think you scared her off.
She'll be back.
They always come back.
Kal?
- Kal, where are you?
- Over here.
Kara, it's just a robot.
- I know. Are there more?
- I don't think so.
Hey, are you okay?
Where's that indestructible kid
I was arguing with a couple of hours ago?
Kara, whatever it is, it's disabled.
It's not going to do any harm.
You're wrong.
- You've seen these before.
- A lot of them.
On Krypton?
In Kandor, the capital.
The day it disappeared.
- A whole city disappeared?
- Taken.
- I don't understand. By who? How?
- It calls itself Brainiac.
We were in Kandor visiting friends when those things attacked.
The robots were everywhere.
Our army threw everything we had at them...
...but they were unstoppable.
They killed people randomly at first.
Then, as they downloaded our knowledge and learned about us...
...they figured out who to keep and who to kill.
Who they found redundant.
Zor-El! Alura!
Kara! Come on!
Our friends tried to help us escape, but we got separated in the chaos.
We never saw the being inside the ship, the thing in charge.
I don't think there's anyone alive outside that ship that has.
No!
Thara! Ak-Var!
You've got to get us out of here,
Zor-El! We can't get out!
Please! Please help us! Please!
Fearing he'd return, my parents sent me to Earth...
matter my father and other scientists decoded the memories of robots left behind.
That's how they found out he was called Brainiac.
They learned from his technology, planned to find him, fight him.
Get back the people of Kandor.
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.
- We were all so powerless.
- I know.
I never want to feel that way again.
No one should.
But if that thing's here, it's all going to happen again.
No. I'll make sure it doesn't.
You're going after him, aren't you?
Kal, you don't know what you're dealing with.
These probes must be how he searches for planets.
And if this one didn't contact him, someday one will.
I need to finish what your father started.
Isolate this robot's comm signal, scan for others like it and find Brainiac first.
If you're right, there could be a hundred thousand Kryptonians alive...
- ...and trapped on that ship.
- And what if he shows up while you're gone?
- What if you never come back?
- You'll have to keep things safe here...
...until I come back.
What makes you think I'm ready to do that?
You'll have to be.
You missed Perry's big announcement.
He's a grandfather.
Keith and his wife had a girl.
They're naming her Alice.
That's great.
I want a normal life, Clark.
I don't know if life with me is ever going to be normal.
You know what I mean.
I wanna do regular things with you.
Get a place together. Make couple friends.
Someday maybe get married, have kids.
I don't know.
We've talked about this before.
If people ever found out, you'd be in danger.
I'm not talking about people knowing
I'm with Superman.
I'm talking about their knowing
I'm with Clark.
And what if someday people find out that's the same person?
Then we'll deal with it.
I'm in danger all the time, Clark.
And I'm not thrilled with that either.
Well, what about me?
You think I like sharing you with the world?
Wondering if today's the day some lunatic finally figures out how to kill you?
But I don't tell you not to do your job, and you can't tell me not to do mine.
- You can't compare what I...
- Yes, I can.
This fear is your problem, not mine.
You can't keep the world safe for me all the time.
Not if it's gonna keep us both from having a life.
- And if you keep insisting...
- Lois, I have to go away for a while.
"Away" as in spend some time with your folks in Kansas...
...or as in somewhere just past the Crab Nebula?
More like the latter.
Can we deal with this when I get back?
Men. Always finding an excuse to leave when things get scary.
Of course, you're the only one who literally disappears off the face of the earth.
Member Zor-El's report to the science council.
Although we've stiff found no visual record of the creature Brainiac...
...we have determined that he is from a planet called Colu.
Born fully organic...
...Brainiac has incorporated extensive motor, skeletal...
...and cybernetic enhancements into himself.
His method is to explore the galaxy, upload knowledge into his own neural core...
...from the worlds he encounters and then destroy those worlds.
Whether Brainiac has kept the people of Kandor alive remains a mystery...
...as does why he didn't destroy Krypton.
My brother, Jor-El, has his theories about our planet nearing its natural end.
Maybe Brainiac detected this and saved himself the trouble.
Pausing playback. Frequency match identified.
Star system ahead.
Where's Brainiac? How does this work?
These people were leaving.
I'm new here.
Maybe this will get the message across.
...acquired this video from last night...
...of Supergirl taking on human traffickers in North Korea.
From Mexican drug lords to genocide in Africa...
...Supergirl seems to be on a one-heroine rampage...
...during Superman's absence.
Yeah. Everywhere but here.
Why does Superman disappear for weeks like this? Maybe there's an angle in it.
Does he wanna make sure the human race stays self-sufficient?
- Are there other worlds he protects?
- You mean, like, he's cheating on us?
Let's play with it.
"The Aloofness of Superman."
Lois, you run with this.
- Must I?
- Who else am I gonna give it to? Kent?
He's probably cheating on us too.
Cataloging.
Planet Larroo.
Three sentient species identified.
Stand by.
Knowledge has been uploaded.
Specimen analysis underway. Stand by.
Specimen active.
Sending units to subdue.
Specimen analysis complete.
Storing specimens.
The Milky Way.
He's placed each city according to the planet it came from.
Then Krypton would be...
Kandor.
Kara was right.
Really?
Put yourself in the center of the galaxy?
A little egocentric, aren't we?
So you must be Brainiac.
Okay.
Identify.
Try asking nice.
Kryptonian.
Not big on people skills, are you?
- You should not exist outside my control.
- Sorry to disappoint.
I did not destroy Krypton after uploading my specimens...
...because the planet was about to destroy itself.
You exist because I allowed you to be.
Hope you're not expecting a thank you.
- It was an error.
- Got that right.
What are you? Who made you God?
You ask me such questions?
Ridiculous.
I am the knowledge and strength of 10,000 worlds.
I am flesh and machine.
I am becoming everything.
And you, your arrival is no more than a rare opportunity for entertainment.
And it presents me the opportunity to correct that error.
You shall be integrated into Krypton's specimen city...
...where you belong.
No, thanks.
It was not a request.
Your struggle is pathetic. You are weak.
Your mind has been fully scanned.
Your skills and limitations are mine to read.
Ah...
You've been living on another planet with intelligent life.
Earth.
The Kryptonian rocket I found adrift, yours.
Yes.
Its guidance system contains Earth's location.
New acquisition planet entered in database. Changing course.
Preparing environmental simulator.
No!
You have brought me another gift,
Kryptonian.
Perhaps letting you live was not such an error after all.
Kandor.
Jim, you still got that watch
Superman gave you?
- Sure, but I don't think it...
- Can't hurt to give it a shot.
Ms. Lane, if Superman were around, he'd have responded...
...to that hijacked freighter the other day, and the fire over on Third.
Ow!
What is that noise?
Oh, sorry.
Okay, Jimmy, Supergirl. Supergirl, Jimmy.
Thanks for your help, Jim.
- You meant to call her?
- Yup. Keep this between us, okay?
Sure.
- Okay. I'm here. What?
- What's your rush?
All right, look, you and I don't know each other, well, yet...
...and I'm guessing Superman didn't tell you, but it's okay to talk to me.
I know about him being Clark.
I'm his girlfriend.
He didn't tell me.
Yeah, well, that's Clark.
It took him a year to tell his folks.
Here's the thing. While everyone else is singing tributes to you...
...for kicking butt all over the world...
They were bullies.
Bullies should be punished.
Right. Right on, sister. But in the meantime,
I think you've been avoiding Metropolis.
So, what do you know that we don't?
And what does it have to do with Superman?
- He cares about you? He'd want you to live.
- I think that's the general idea.
Then get out of Metropolis.
Stay with the Kents in Smallville, somewhere he can find you after.
"After"? After what?
Remember that thing that fell from space just before he went away?
Uh-huh.
- It was a probe. A scout.
- And he's gone to find whoever sent it?
Brainiac.
Because, otherwise, this Brainiac will come here.
And Metropolis is just the kind of city he'll take.
Take? Like a souvenir?
And, what, you're planning to let him?
- Kal's out there trying to stop him.
- Well, you don't sound very confident.
If Kal fails, there's nothing I'd be able to do.
- So you're not even gonna try?
- I'm sorry. I'm not saying it's right.
I just lived through it once already and I can't do it again.
It must have been the worst day of your life.
Hm.
I forget you're still just...
I'm not used to someone with powers like his being scared.
Or showing it, anyway.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- I know I'm not supposed to show it.
- Kara, it's okay.
There's this Somali warlord.
Go.
Get me the Pentagon.
- Hello.
- Excuse me.
A red sun.
I don't have much time. What's the closest way to the edge of the city?
We don't go near the edge of the city.
Did you come from Krypton?
Are things all right there?
I'm sorry, I'll get you all out of here...
...but right now I have to get myself out and fast.
Please. You can't say such things.
They'll come.
Do you realize where you are?
You're prisoners.
This whole city is inside a ship.
Dispatching sentries. Dispatching sentries.
Citizens, your conversation has become subversive.
Please modulate accordingly.
Uh, yes, of course.
Heh, heh, the new one doesn't know.
They keep you in line?
Hey, talk to me this time.
Retrieving sentries.
I'm losing my strength.
I need to get out of here while I still can.
I'm sorry, there's no escaping.
We all tried long ago.
Eventually we accepted and so will you.
You had to have been children when it happened.
No. No one ages here.
We've all been the same age since we were captured.
Even...?
That's over 30 years ago.
Tell us. How is Krypton?
We feared it was destroyed.
It was. I'm sorry.
Then the arrivals from Argo City were right.
Arrivals from Argo City?
They appeared the same way you did, a short time after Brainiac took Kandor.
Was there a couple with them named Zor-El and Alura?
Great Rao, he looks just like his father.
- Unbelievable. I'm eating Kryptonian food.
- Close enough.
We don't have soil to grow food.
No springs for fresh water.
Brainiac gives us everything we need and nothing more.
Enough of that.
Please tell us more about Kara.
She's having some trouble adjusting to a new world...
...but she'll be all right.
- And you? How did you adjust?
- Well, for me it was easier.
It's the only world I know.
I have family and friends and...
Someone special.
Drives me nuts sometimes.
Heh. Nice to know that's the same everywhere.
So how did you end up here?
We were studying Brainiac's probes for information on him.
Adapting our technology so we could find him and fight him.
We think by doing so we attracted him back.
He watches us constantly, listens to every word.
This conversation right now is subversive.
It's so you'll never escape.
It's more than that.
I think it's a bug in his programming.
That cyborg core inside him.
It wants to know everything there is to know in the galaxy.
- So he said.
- But that's impossible.
Worlds are living things.
Their knowledge is always growing and changing.
So he has to stop them.
Turn them into these fake versions instead.
You can't control a living thing without destroying what's alive about it.
So his whole system is a lie.
- Brainiac is headed for Earth. I need to...
- Kara's in danger.
We would do anything. But what is there?
We have no tools, no way to escape.
He's made sure of that.
Maybe we can use his own tools against him.
Hey, Brainiac,
I've still got some punch left in me.
What's underneath this street?
You have machines to keep this facade going?
He wants the robots to come.
Citizen, your behavior has become subversive.
Cease your activity at once before we are forced to...
Hey.
Subvert that.
Retrieving damaged sentries.
I'll be back for you, I promise.
Hey, ugly.
- Fool.
- Shut up.
This won't hold you forever.
It just needs to hold you long enough.
You underestimate me.
You'll die and your new world will be mine just like your old world is.
You're meaningless compared to me.
I am everything. You are nothing but fists.
When I need to be.
The engine room.
Ma, Pa, he's home. Clark's come home.
Kal. Kal? Did you find him?
- I did.
- Tell me he's dead.
I disabled him for now. Marooned his ship.
- Kal, that's not good enough.
- His ship had thousands of cities on it.
Millions of lives.
They all need to be freed and found new planets to live on.
Then he did keep the cities.
They're alive. Thara, all those people.
That's not all.
Kara, your parents are in there too.
I spent time with them.
They can't wait to see you.
How? What do we do?
I know a habitable planet with a red sun like Krypton's.
You and I will take them there.
What is it?
Something's happening in Metropolis.
What is that?
- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on?
No.
It's happening here.
It's happening again.
Have a seat, butt head.
Come on, move it.
We have to go.
- I can't.
- I need your help.
We'll take Kandor, we'll take my parents, find that other planet like you said.
Kara. If you run, he'll never stop.
But here on Earth you have powers.
This is your chance to fight back.
We can beat him.
No.
Could be the end of the world, Lane.
- You and me. You wanna hook up?
- Not a chance.
Superman!
Lois.
The impudence.
I have been claiming worlds for centuries before you were born.
You thought it would help you to disconnect me from my ship.
You fail to comprehend. This ship is me.
Constructed around me.
An extension of me.
Earth.
Forget Earth.
- It was unexceptional.
- Aah!
It had nothing to offer me.
I found it redundant.
Lois.
Disgusting.
Your affection for humans is nauseating.
Kara.
Yes.
The other Kryptonian, I will keep.
I'll need at least one.
And you may not survive.
Now you will see a glimpse of what I am.
How many worlds do you think your feeble mind can process...
...before it turns to sludge?
I'd say less than one.
Good. Fight it.
I need your brain to function long enough to tell me one more thing.
Where you've put Kandor.
Oh.
Changing course for planet's North Pole.
- Then you haven't destroyed Earth.
- Soon.
And Metropolis?
Here.
But not for long.
Your sentimental attachment is grotesque.
Even you must realize how worthless they are.
Such a savage world.
Its scientific achievements paltry.
Its weapons unimpressive.
To think that two Kryptonians chose to call this planet home, sickens me.
What could Earth have possibly offered you?
Something you wouldn't know anything about.
It's my home.
My heart.
It gives me strength.
Go to hell.
Kara, wake up.
Kal?
- Is this his ship?
- It's all right.
We're inside Brainiac's.
Kryptonian trash, you have already failed.
I am the knowledge and strength of 10,000 worlds.
Neither you nor Metropolis will ever leave this ship.
Soon I will have Kandor...
...and then I will destroy your world with a thought.
- We'll see about that.
- You will see nothing.
You are nothing.
A specimen to dissect. A genus to analyze...
Hey, plug-head.
You talk too much.
- Aah!
- Unh!
Kal.
Initiating Solar Aggressor.
Launching Solar Aggressor.
That's a missile. It's headed for the sun.
If it gets there, Earth will be destroyed and Kandor with it.
On it.
Enough!
I will forego Kandor.
I have Krypton's knowledge.
And for a specimen, you will do.
All of your efforts have been futile.
Even if she catches the missile,
I'll fire another.
I've figured you out, you know?
Have you?
I find that highly unlikely.
You never leave this ship.
There is no need.
Everything I require is here.
My uncle was right.
You've got a bug.
Very well, Kryptonian. I'll humor you.
Tell me.
Better if I show you.
I saw it when I was inside Kandor.
I saw it when you were downloading your worlds into my head.
You don't really know these worlds. You only know your safe, bottled versions of them.
You have data, scientific knowledge.
But you have no real sense of life.
Huh?
Hm?
That. You hear it?
It's a highway 50 miles from here.
The fall leaves rustling.
A small plane taking off.
Little kids playing in their backyard.
The smell of fresh bread in someone's kitchen.
Dragonflies in the air.
You hear it all too?
You see it all? Huh.
Something, ain't it?
All this activity.
All this chaos. Oh!
How do you block it out? Unh.
I learned to live with it.
But you can't, can you?
You can't face things you can't control.
Ah. And that is mud.
Look at it.
Bugs, and worms and bacteria.
You see them?
Smell them?
Feel them?
The high and mighty Brainiac.
- No. Get it off. Get away!
- All that need to control everything.
To know everything.
Your giant brain can't take it.
Hiding in that little ship of yours like a coward.
It's made you weak.
Attagirl.
Welcome to Earth.
All right! Yeah!
Kara.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Mm! Mm. Mm.
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Funny. I was here the whole time.
It's okay.
You were right.
- I knew it.
- Sure you did.
I thought I wanted a world where I could always keep you safe.
And you don't want that anymore?
That's not what I meant.
Because right now I could use a little safety.
All you want, I promise.
I don't ever wanna stop you from being you.
- You know you're rambling.
- I know.
- Not that I mind.
- I thought you'd like it.
So, what do you want?
Marry me.
- Yes!
- Hey! Was that a goal?
No, just checking if you're awake.
Smart aleck!
Bad enough getting all the dirty work.
Frank, d'you hear me?
Yeah, what's up?
See anything on the monitors?
No. Why?
Is there a problem?
No, it's just...
I must have been dreaming, sorry.
Oh, Dom!
Dom, you were right.
There's someone behind you!
D'you hear?
- Right behind you!
- Where?
There's no one behind me.
The dirty scoundrel!
He's on the top floor! I'm on my way!
We'll get him!
Perfect!
We'll corner him!
Where are you precisely?
Not very far.
And where are you precisely?
A Cat in Paris
Ooh, Zoë, what a fright!
I didn't hear you come in.
What is it?
A new present from Dino?
Waow! Another lizard!
You lucky girl, that cat really spoils you!
Well then... It makes a change from sweets and toys.
Cat presents.
Yes. No. Listen, Lucas, we'll discuss it tomorrow at the office.
I need a few hours off, do you understand?
I promised my daughter.
Either way, I need that report on my desk by tomorrow.
You'll manage!
I can't always be there.
- But, what's that about?
- She had something to show you.
Something? What was it?
Oh, nothing really.
You know how kids are.
She's very sensitive, and she was waiting for you.
I'm getting everything wrong.
I'm so exhausted.
It's been very tough, just me and Zoë.
If only her father was still here.
I miss him so much.
Please don't cry, Madame, or you'll have me in tears too.
May I come in?
I'm so sorry for earlier.
I've got a lot on at work right now.
And sometimes I can't help bringing it home with me.
Anyway, I'm glad it's going well with Claudine.
I really like her, apart from that perfume of hers!
So what was it you wanted to show me, Zoë?
Oh dear, what a horror!
Was it Dino again?
Zoë, this really has to stop!
All these dead creatures in your room, it's unhygienic.
Look, I have to take this call.
Hello?
No. I'm at home, guys.
Just ask Lucas!
I'm sure he can help you out.
Do you need me for anything else? Can I go?
Yes, Claudine, that's fine.
Thanks again for all your help.
Bye, sweetie.
- Good evening, Claudine.
- Good night, Madame. See you tomorrow.
I'm sorry for telling you off earlier but I can't stand creepy crawlies.
Little girls shouldn't play with spiders and dead lizards, especially inside the house, don't you agree?
I know who you're thinking about.
Since he left us, I feel like nothing's right between us anymore.
There's nothing worse than a girl losing her father.
But sadly, nothing will bring him back.
We just have to go on without him.
It would make me so happy if from to time, you called me Mum.
Take your time, I can wait.
Forever if need be.
Now let's forget about all this.
How about going to see a film on Sunday?
We haven't been in ages.
Ah, looks like it's time for our terrible tom to go out on the prowl.
I wonder what that naughty creature gets up to every night, don't you?
Rufus! Be quiet!
Shut up!
Hello there, Mr Cat.
I thought you weren't coming, so I started without you.
Get your strength up for tonight's expedition!
You'll like what
I've got in store for us tonight.
Come on, old boy, let's go.
There's work to be done.
Are you coming?
You show-off.
Hey, don't rush off so fast!
I've got something to show you.
Look!
Not bad, huh?
What does Mr. Fish-lover say to that?
Stay if you want, you're not bothering me.
I'm always alone anyway, so...
Zoë, you've been going through my briefcase again!
You know I don't like you doing that!
Yes, darling, that's the man who shot your father.
But I'm on his trail, you know.
Soon I'll catch him, we'll throw him in prison, and we'll never hear of him again.
That's a promise!
You're my special treasure, my wonderful little girl.
Never forget how much I love you.
- 'Morning.
- Hello, superintendent.
Nearly done, 10 more minutes.
Leave it to one side.
I need you to do something for me.
OK. No problem.
Remember the serial jewellery burglaries?
- Yes.
- I just got the lab reports back.
- Cat paw prints were found every time.
- Cat paws?
The boss wants results.
It's your case. I want something new within 24 hours, OK?
No problem. As usual!
Right, got to go.
I have a meeting with the boss.
I'm supposed to arrest a cat?
That's what ten years on the force gets you.
Get out of here, you filthy beast!
Go on! Get out! Now!
Get out, I don't want you here.
Out, I said!
Go on, off with you!
I'm going to suck you right up!
There you go! Good riddance!
Your attention, please.
This is the Colossus of Nairobi.
A priceless piece, not shown in public for over 30 years.
It's scheduled to be transported to the museum next Friday.
Victor Costa requires no introduction from me, you all know this city's Public Enemy N° 1.
He'll be out to get the Colossus by any means possible.
Last time he almost succeeded, and, as you know, that cost... it cost the life of a police officer.
- What's up with her?
- The guy who got killed was her husband!
No need to tell you to be careful, the man is a raving lunatic, who's extremely dangerous!
Let's take a look at the route the van with the Colossus will be taking.
I'm convinced that's when
Costa will try to strike.
That's all for this morning.
See you at target practice.
Look, guys, I've dreamt of this since I was just a toddler.
My mother stuck this photo above my cradle.
This Colossus! It has to be mine!
Do you hear?!
Here he is, he's back...
What took you so long?!
The queue was endless and there wasn't that much choice.
- Ham?
- Over here, hand it over Bob!
The hot dog's for me.
Eat up, we haven't got all day!
- What about my sausage sandwich?
- They don't do sausage.
- I got you chicken instead.
- You trying to kill me?!
Feathered stuff brings me out in a rash.
I wanted a sausage sandwich.
It's not my fault they don't have sausage.
- So you decide to poison me!
- Cool it, Jack! I'll swap you my hot dog.
Deal! Hand it over.
Hey, I'm the one he offered it to!
- What is yours anyway?
- Hey, it's my hot dog!
Boss, sure you're not hungry?
Not even for a quiche?
You mean a quiche with bacon?
Yes! With melted cheese on top!
And cream?
Is there cream in it too?
Oh yes, boss, loads of cream, you'll love it.
So I look like a quiche-eater to you?
Well, no... I don't know.
- You were asking: Cream, no cream?
- No copping out now!
I look like the kind of guy who's into quiche! That's what you're saying?
Had you going there, didn't I?
You had your knickers in a twist, there.
Dammit, you had me scared, Boss!
You're very good!
You want to know how I like my cream quiches?
Drive, you idiot, before I get really annoyed!
Zoë, what's this?
No, no, I don't mean the drawing,
I mean the bracelet!
Where does it come from?
You mean Dino brought it you?
Zoë, sweetie, listen,
I'm glad Dino's not bringing you those horrible creatures any more, but you can't keep wearing something that valuable.
Look, there's a diamond in it.
Darling, there's someone out there who's really unhappy at losing their bracelet.
We'll have to find them and give it back to them.
I'm very proud of you, Zoë.
My cat picked this bracelet up in the street.
Don't ask me how,
I don't have a clue.
Check if there's a link with the break-in on Rue Mouffetard.
OK then. See you later.
The break-in on rue Mouffetard.
Well, my love, I'm going now,
I have to work tonight.
Claudine's staying.
Now, you try to get off to sleep straight away, OK?
Sleep well, little Zoë.
Rufus, stop it!
Just stop.
Please stop it.
Stop it, Rufus!
Every night the same thing!
Aaargh! Rufus!
You asked for it!
Rufus, are you going to shut it, once and for all?!
Ah, there you are!
You're late tonight!
What happened?
I was about to leave without you, old boy!
Have you looked at me?
I'm not a potato!
I know you're not, that's not the point.
I've told you, they're just code names.
Yeah, I know, code names, but "Potato" is ridiculous!
You think I like being called Mister "Baby"?
Shut it! That's enough, alright?!
You are Mister Frog.
You, Mister Baby.
You, Mister Hulot.
And you are Mister Potato.
Understood?
Yes, yes, fine! OK, boss.
And what's your code name, boss?
I'm the Colossus, the Colossus of Nairobi!
That's a really good name!
That's enough!
We're wasting time.
So, anything new, my lovely?
Keep your voice down.
Here, this'll make you happy.
It's the transfer date of the Colossus, but staying around this area, it's risky.
- Be a bit patient.
- I'm running out of patience.
Go through her papers, her computer, her dustbins.
I need the security van's route.
You don't want my cover blown, do you?
- What's going on?
- It's the kid! She heard everything!
Don't let her get away!
Get her, guys! Quick!
- Do we go in after her?
- You think we can go in there?
Get out the way, you idiots!
Search the place and bring me the kid. Right now!
OK, boss!
I know you're here, little girl.
Hiding in the back of one of these cupboards.
Great cupboards, aren't they?
Well laid out and very comfy?
You're Zoë, aren't you?
I know about all sorts, you see!
Not too dark in there for you, eh?
You know what gets on my nerves?
In films, the victim always hides in the last cupboard.
Where's the suspense in that?
I'm counting to three, little piggy, and then I'm going to blow your house down.
One... Two... Thr...
- Boss, come and look, it's amazing!
- You've found the kid?
Better than that, Mister Costa!
Why don't you shout out my address, whilst you're at it?
The code names, not real names, you stupid ass!
Sorry, boss, but come and look!
So, where's the kid?
There, look!
Look where? There's no kid here!
- The dartboard!
- Are you winding me up?
Please wake me up from this nightmare!
Wait a minute, just take a look at the dartboard!
- I'll take the dartboard and...
- No, no, no.
Wait, Hulot's going to throw a dart.
How about that!
Ali Baba's cavern.
And I found it!
When he sees a dart game, he can never resist.
That takes the biscuit!
I've stumbled on to someone's stash!
But whose place is this?
So, little snoop, proud of yourself?
What am I supposed to do after this?
- Calm down, you little pest!
- Hum, Hum. Sorry to disturb you.
- What are you doing in my house?
- It's the girl's fault.
She's a real tearaway.
I spend my time chasing after her.
Don't mind her, she's a bit retarded.
Come along, Zoë!
Wait! I don't think she wants to go with you.
Who are you? Her mother?
Zoë, come! We're going!
- I think you should let her go.
- Colossus!
Problem! The owner's come back!
Don't move, we're coming!
You wouldn't dare hit a woman!
Ouch!
Nasty beast!
I'll hurt my shoulder!
It won't budge. Forget it.
I know! We need a thingamy to lever it.
Trust me! Climb on to my back and hold on as tight as you can.
- Or else we pull... or we could...
- Stop rabbiting!
Just break this damn door down!
They're climbing up the roof!
Over there, look!
Guys, help me! I'm slipping!
Come and help me!
I'm gonna break my neck!
Thanks, Boss, phew! Colossus.
Er... is it Colossus when it's just us two, or only when there's other people around?
Shut it!
Look, Zoë, you see that hedge over there? Behind it is the zoo.
You go with the cat, he'll take you to my place.
I'll create a diversion, then come and find you.
Go now!
- Over there! That's him!
- There he is!
Hmm! Smells like fresh meat!
- What's up, boss?
- Never mind. She's had it.
We've got her!
Look. I told you.
She can't go very far.
Come on, hurry up!
Yes? What is it?
'Evening, Madam. Police.
- Ooh, what have...?
- No need to worry, madam.
I just have a little question.
A cat living in the brick house over there, mean anything to you?
Oh yes, I know that cat, a real piece of work.
Every night of the week he sets the neighbour's yappy little dog barking.
- It drives me mad.
- Yes, but do you have any idea where this cat goes?
Well, he certainly doesn't go very far.
He leaves from there, makes the nasty little dog bark, and disappears into the house opposite.
Every night it's the same routine.
So are you going to do something about it, officer?
Hello?
What?
You've got a lead on the cat-burglar?
Where are you?
Near my place?! How come?
OK, I'm on my way.
I can't go on, I can't go on.
Come on, make an effort!
He's going to get away!
I didn't digest the sandwich.
Think how angry Colossus will be if we don't catch him!
Need a lift, guys?
Looks like the tables have turned, eh?
- It doesn't work!
- Stop it!
You think he's dead?
Believe me, after a fall like that you'd have a bit more than a bump on the head.
If you had a head left at all!
Go on, Mr. Frog. Get her!
I'm stuck in the mud!
Yeah, but there's no boats left.
Remind me what your codename is, you idiot!
Mr. Frog.
So you're already half way there.
Go on! Get going. Hop in.
Yeah, but...
"Frog" is only a nickname.
I don't give a damn!
Your name is Frog, and frogs swim, so get moving and jump in!
D'you mind telling me what you're up to, you idiot?
Well, I can't go in with my clothes on, can I?
Okay, I'm going, boss.
Oh, it's really freezing!
That's better!
Hey you there, you horrible little brat!
Playtime's over!
I don't believe it!
OK, let me guess:
You can't actually swim, can you?!
Nobody ever taught me, boss.
What about you, can you?
Mind your own business, you fool!
Colossus of Nairobi, why have you abandoned me?!
Zoë?
Zoë?
Ah! There you both are.
I see you found the old swing.
It's on its last legs, you know.
With everything that's just happened, we haven't even talked.
I haven't even told you my name: Nico.
So, are you going to tell me what happened?
Do you not want to talk to me?
Cat got your tongue, eh?
Well, you don't talk but at least you can laugh.
Now, can you tell me where your parents are?
You do have a mum and dad, don't you?
What's up?
Did I say something wrong?
I see.
Anyway, we can't stay here, they may come back.
I know a place we can hide for the night, but first I'll have to get the key, okay?
Stay here, I'll only be a minute.
Zoë?
Police! Don't move!
- Oh no! No!
- I said, don't move!
I was right, Superintendent, this is the burglar we've been after.
And it looks like your cat's his accomplice.
You don't understand!
It's not what you think!
It's just I was there when...
Let's go. You can tell the judge all about it.
In case you didn't know, you kidnapped my daughter.
A cop's daughter.
You've just landed yourself in a whole load of trouble.
Calm down, Zoë.
There's nothing to be scared of now.
Come on, head down!
Your game's up!
Ooh, I'll have you too!
It's the animal pound for you!
Oh, my little sweetie!
You've no idea how scared I was!
I don't understand what's going on.
Explain it to me!
It's that crook there!
He got into the house, to burgle us.
When he saw me, he panicked and grabbed Zoë from her bed and ran off with her.
- Who is that woman?!
- Mind your own business.
Listen to me! It's not me,
- it's that woman who wants to harm the girl!
- Shut it, okay!
- Car 17, we've got news for you.
- Lucas. I'm listening...
It's all over, my princess.
There, there.
Let's go home.
I'll stay with you all night.
Superintendent, I know this really isn't the moment, but if I don't warn you straight away.
What is it now?
The night watchman at the zoo was attacked by some kind of thug.
He photoidentified him.
It's our man, Costa!
- Costa!
- There's a chance we can catch him.
Listen to me, Zoë,
I'm going to say the exact opposite of what I just promised.
I have to leave.
It's very important for both of us.
It's the man who killed your daddy.
I can't let him get away!
- Do you understand, Zoë?
- Don't worry, madame, the poor thing's in shock but I'll calm her down.
- Let me take her home.
- Yes, thank you.
Zoë, I'll be back really soon!
I promise!
Don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.
Mmm... Mmmmu... Mu...
Mum!
You've left it a bit late to find your voice, you little brat!
When you arrested me I was in the process of saving your daughter.
It's a well-known fact:
All kidnappers are actually saviours.
I can't believe you're completely unaware that your nanny's in cahoots with Costa!
You can stop the fairy tales, they're getting boring...
But it's the honest truth!
And all the money we found in your bag?
That's for good works in the community, I suppose?
It's the same with all of them, they always have a story.
Be careful!
- I can't see the road!
- The brakes, Lucas! Break!
Dino, stop!
Let go of him!
Now you're going to listen to me!
You're making the biggest mistake of your life.
Believe what you want, but if I were you,
I'd go back home immediately.
Your daughter Zoë is in terrible danger!
He's an odd one, that one.
I'm missing something and it's making me uneasy.
What if he's right?
Come on, Lucas, we're going to my home to check.
Zoë?
Claudine?
Zoë?!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'll go upstairs.
You keep watch down here, okay?
Lucas, are you okay?
Were you hit?
No, no, it's my fault, I was startled and the gun just went off!
Oh, Lucas.
Take this! And take that!
Someone's going to pay for this, right now, or there's gonna be big trouble!
Arghh! Damn it!
You think it's funny, you bunch of idiots?!
Oh, big teddybear, sounds like you're losing your cool!
Look what I've brought you as a surprise!
What have we got here?
The little honey pie, all ready for Daddy Costa's cooking pot!
Well, you can pride yourself on giving me a real run around, you little pest.
And you, my little flower, thank goodness I've got you!
If I had to count on this bunch of good-for-nothings
I'd still be nicking sweets from the corner shop.
Wait a minute...
I've just had a thought.
This could solve all our problems.
We may even be able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
Having the kid is like having the mother!
Gentlemen, we're changing tactics.
We're going to make this spectacular, do it in style!
If the mother wants her daughter back, she'll have to give us what we want.
She's going to hand over the Colossus all-included, with a cherry on top.
And with a smile, if you please!
- And?
- That guy was right.
They've kidnapped her, and it's all my fault.
I got it all wrong!
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I promise.
I'll alert everyone.
We'll start searching immediately.
Come on, Jeanne, be strong!
There you are, you filthy creature, always hassling me.
You're a nasty piece of work.
You look at me and think:
"I'll have her for breakfast!"
Well, just you try.
I'll be waiting.
I don't sabre champagne bottles,
I behead them!
You've got a good aim, boss, well done!
Ladies first!
Some manners, please!
In any case, a frog that can't swim, doesn't drink champagne.
Take the kid upstairs and don't let her out of your sight!
Come along, you!
You heard the boss!
Dolling yourself up all nice, my Doll?
Yes! Just for you, my big teddybear!
Oh no, she's at it again.
More of that disgusting poison!
Tell me about it.
It gets me right in the throat!
Sorry, boss, do you mind if I open the window?
- It's terribly hot tonight.
- Be my guest...
What's with him?
It's nothing, boss, too much champagne, that's all.
You know, guys, no offence, but I sometimes wonder if you're really cut out to be gangsters.
It's all very well, Cat, but how are we going to find Zoë now?
What's up with you?
Have you picked up a scent?
Hey! Wait for me!
Wait for me!
You know where I'm taking you when all this is over?
Nairobi!
It’ll be our honeymoon, sweetheart.
I know a lovely little hotel deep in the bush!
It’ll be the most beautiful day of my life!
Well, thanks a lot, kid!
Now, I can't even go and have fun with the others.
What's going on?
Why's the power gone?
Can someone tell me why the power's off?
I'm like you now, Cat.
I can see in the dark.
- Maybe it's a power cut.
- Or the fuses.
Are there any torches here?
I think there's one in the cellar.
Hang on, I'll get it.
What's up, Hulot?
Have you got a cold?
No, not at all!
I thought it was you who...
You think I don't hear you all talking about my perfume behind my back?
You don't dare say anything when my teddybear is there, but you all gossip away like a bunch of girls.
Be honest.
You think I stink, right?
Not at all.
Why do you say that?
Do I smell good or not?
It's a simple question, isn't it?
Shut it up, down there!
Not a peep until the lights come back on!
Well, serves them right for leaving me out of the party like that!
They can drink their bloody bubbles in the dark!
It's me, princess, Nico...
I've come to rescue you.
Anyway, I'm not a frog.
I don't even like frogs.
And it's not because I can't swim that I can't drink champagne.
You know, it's not easy being a gangster, but it's the only job
I know how to do.
I used to work in a café.
It's that guy again!
He's taking the girl!
Come quick! All of you!
I've got him.
Come and help, I've got him.
Me too, I've got him too, it's okay!
But I had him!
Dammit, it's you?
Yes, it's me, you idiot!
Over there!
Something's moving!
What are you doing?
You bunch of useless idiots!
Blithering fools!
Where's the kid?
Where the hell is she, dammit!
Hang on tight, Zoë!
Co-Cos! Go on, jump!
You've just seen how easy it is!
How right you are!
Here I come!
Look up there! What are they doing?
It looks like a chase!
One of them's got a kid on his back!
They're completely crazy!
Costa did this to you?
Are you sure it was him?
What direction did he take?
Did you see a little girl with him?
Chief, he's wounded, let me talk to him.
Are you sure it was Costa, sir?
I recognised him alright, it was your man.
He was with a big chap.
He doesn't pull his punches, that Costa.
- Look what he's done to me.
- Hello, I'm listening.
Game on!
They've spotted Costa.
Hurry up! Not a minute to lose!
Thank you, sir, get well soon.
Right, don't move from here, Zoë.
Promise me.
I'll come back for you, when I've dealt with that brute.
It won't take long.
At least, I hope it won't.
So tell me, Mr. Muscle Man, is that cat's piss or sparrow fat in those arms of yours?
Wanna find out?
Come on then, come on!
I'm waiting for you.
What a shame,
I never got my invitation.
This is your lucky day!
No invitation's required!
So, Costa, those keks and their classy low waistline,
- some kind of artistic statement, is it?
- Don't make me laugh, it hurts too much!
Oh! Poor little thing.
Does it hurt then?
Damn! Nothing's moving.
Perfect timing, huh!
- Not our lucky day.
- Superintendent! There's news on Costa.
Talk!
There's another guy with Costa up there!
- And a little girl, and a cat.
- Zoë! It has to be!
What do we do, Jeanne?
- Take the wheel, I'll make my own way.
- But...
You still up here?!
Do you need a hand to get down?
Or a foot?!
Are you going down or what?
Down, I say!
Too short, old man!
I'm sure you'd be less nasty, if you weren't so short.
You want to know? I'm about ready to mash you to a pulp.
Tell me, Costa, does your mum choose your shorts for you?
How dare you insult my mother?!
Too short!
Thanks, mate.
You popped up just in time.
Let me give you a hug.
No, Zoë, stay where you are.
It's too dangerous.
You can't help me.
And I can't hold on for much longer.
I don't want you to fall.
You okay?
Oh boy!
Since when do the police save the lives of thieves?
Since thieves started saving children's lives. Am I wrong?
Hello, my little friends.
I've come to pay you a visit.
In memory of your father, who I knew so well.
Off we go, and no letting uncle Costa down this time, okay?
Enough!
This little game's lasted long enough!
I'm not that easy to catch!
Colossus, here we come!
Hmmm Hmmm of France...
Ouch!
Let go of me, you filthy beast!
Get off me! Bon voyage!
Go on! Hopla!
It's over, Costa, you're under arrest.
This has gone on long enough!
Catch this!
Sorry, old boy, no choice!
I'm going to finish the job
I started with your husband.
Mum!
Give him my regards when you're up there!
I'm your worst nightmare.
You'll pay for that, you nasty viper!
Look out!
He's too heavy,
I can't hold on to him!
Don't move, I'm there.
What on earth is he up to now?
I think this time he's gone completely doolally!
Look! Here he comes.
Here he comes.
Stop your clowning, Costa.
Can't you see the game is over?
See you around, losers!
Costa! No!
No!
Step back, there's nothing to see.
Let the police do their work.
Move away!
You can go back home.
Mum, I was in the zoo tonight and then I got in a boat and this big man wanted to catch me but he couldn't get me.
But before... well, Claudine, she was with the baddies.
That was really scary.
But luckily Dino was with me at the zoo and he gave a big whack to the baddy in the water and then he nearly drowned!
They took me to a big house and Nico came to find me and then it went all dark.
Hey, you two!
You're not listening to me!
Isn't my story interesting?
Ah, my little Zoë!
This time it really is all over.
We'll always be together.
Tonight.
So what!
Yes.
Eh...
No... no, no, no...
Wait.
Look.
For you.
No... no, no, no...
Watch out. 
There you go.
Me... here.
There.
Presto... and there you go.
Good evening.
Please.
Let... let me see.
Rabbit... rabbit... [in English]
Ah, rabbit!
Lobster... lobster... [in English]
No, thanks.
Well.
Me... pass pass.
Magic, not magic.
Me... magician.
Well, let me start again. 
Me, this way.
Bye! [in English]
Rabbit? [in English]
Ah, rabbit! 
Enjoy your meal!
Yes.
Ha ha, that's it! Call his agent! [in English]  
Pass pass.
Good evening.
Hello. 
Yes, I wanted to...
No... no, no, no, no. It's over!
To Sophie Tatischeff...
Gotham City.
Clean shafts of concrete and snowy rooftops.
The work of men who died generations ago.
From here, it looks like an achievement.
From here, you can't see the enemy.
Hey. Hey, buddy, slow down.
- You're talking to me?
Yeah, you almost...
Twelve hours.
Train's no way to come to the city.
- Knock it off.
- Hey, watch it.
Thank God Barbara's flying in.
She should have gotten the tests back by now.
I only hate myself a little for hoping they came out negative.
This is no place to raise a family.
Maybe Gotham's all I deserve now.
Maybe it's just my time in hell.
Nice book for a small donation.
Nice book for a small donation.
No, please.
Nice book. Look at the picture... Aah!
They don't know when to quit, do they, lieutenant?
Name's Flass. Detective Flass.
Commissioner Loeb sent me to meet you.
He wanted to make sure you didn't miss your appointment.
Welcome to Gotham, lieutenant.
Don't worry. Not as bad as it looks.
Especially if you're a cop.
Cops got it made it Gotham.
Are we rolling?
Sir, a moment of your time.
Welcome home, Mr. Wayne.
How's it feel to be back?
What are your plans, Mr. Wayne?
Mr. Wayne, Princess Caroline, any truth to the rumors?
Mr. Wayne, please, can you look over here?
The 25-year-old heir to the Wayne millions...
...declined to comment on his return home after 12 years abroad.
We'll keep you posted on Gotham's richest and best looking native son.
- Tom?
- Thank you, Vicky.
Vicky Vale at Gotham Airport.
In other news, conspiracy charges against
Police Commissioner Loeb...
...were withdrawn today after the disappearance of a key witness.
Lieutenant James Gordon.
Impressive. Very impressive.
We're delighted to have you on the team, lieutenant.
You'll get my best work, sir. I promise.
I know I will.
And we are a team, Gordon. A team.
Any team needs to play together in order to win, don't you think?
Yes, it does.
Your record shows you've got what it takes.
I know I've made my mistakes, sir.
What mistakes did you make, lieutenant?
You kept the media away from it.
That's all that matters, isn't it? Yes, it is.
You won't have to worry about my honesty, commissioner.
Last thing on my mind.
Last thing.
Welcome home, Master Bruce.
- Thank you, Alfred.
It's good to be back.
I knew you'd like the commissioner.
He's a stand-up guy.
And he'll be just as good to you as you are to him. Count on it.
Yeah, I got that feeling.
- Flass.
Nothing I can't handle, lieutenant.
Hey, Stevie, mother know you're here?
Oh, crap.
He's got a Green Beret's training.
He knows how to use his size too.
Don't do a damn thing.
Be sure of your facts before you bring down another cop.
Just watch him.
Memorize every move.
For future reference.
Was that necessary?
Had this little beauty in his pocket.
It's a comb, Flass.
Hey, I'm only human, Jimmy.
Mind if I call you Jimmy?
Twelve years.
And the ache is still fresh.
Like a raw angry nerve.
But this isn't about healing.
I'm not looking for closure.
The boys, Jimmy.
They've been asking me to talk to you.
They're worried about you.
I mean, you with a baby on the way and all.
- Call me lieutenant.
- Yeah, sure thing, Jimmy.
You gotta learn to relax.
See, we got our own way of doing things here in Gotham.
This job can get to you, Jimmy.
That's why we gotta stick together.
The boys need to know they can count on you.
We can count on you, right?
Hey. Everything okay?
It is now.
I'm not ready.
I have the means, the skill...
But something's missing.
I have to wait.
I have to wait.
And Gordon, he looks at the 50 like it's diseased.
Then throws it in the padre's face.
Gives the entire squad a two-hour lecture on ethics.
Put Schell on probation.
I'm telling you, Gill, he's just not fitting in.
I had such high hopes for that boy.
I requested off this damn night shift four times now.
Barbara needs me.
Barbara and little James.
So I hope it's a boy, so what?
Going to work, lieutenant?
You're gonna be a little late.
May have to skip the whole night.
I was taught to handle worse than this.
But then...
It's been a while.
Consider this a warning. Be smart.
Think of that pregnant wife of yours,
Jimmy.
This is reconnaissance mission.
Until I'm ready, my anonymity is an obvious priority.
All it requires is a change of clothing and complexion.
And a single memorable distracting detail.
It's a 20-block walk to the enemy camp.
The East End.
Hard to believe it's gotten worse.
Cheer you up, mister?
- How old are you?
- Young as you want me to be.
Stupid little bitch.
You're doing it all wrong.
- But I did what you said.
- Get on out of here.
- We'll talk this over later.
No.
I think you're finished with her.
Man, that crazy vet thing is old.
You stink like vice.
I'm not the police. Believe me.
Selina, don't stop now.
He can't be vice. We're paid up.
Selina, what are you doing?
Watching some idiot trying to get himself killed.
Man, you're pushing.
You're looking for a new scar.
Just tell me where you want it.
Come on. Get him.
Freeze.
Jeez, Eddie, why did you shoot?
He didn't move.
He was going to.
- Any cash?
Couple of bucks.
No ID.
Oh, he's bleeding all over the backseat.
What if he dies?
So, what if he does?
One less mouth to feed at the soup kitchen.
You two.
Stop the car. Get out.
What the hell?
Don't mind him.
Probably hopped up on something.
Scum maybe.
But even scum have families.
Detective Flass is off duty, lieutenant.
He and the guys have a poker party every Wednesday night over at Chutes.
No. I said posse.
See you guys tomorrow.
Hello, Jimmy.
It's been years since I had to take out a Green Beret.
Even so, he deserves a handicap.
He'll never report it.
Not Flass.
He'll make up some story that involves at least 10 attackers.
But he'll know.
And he'll stay away from Barbara.
I've tried to be patient.
I've tried to wait.
But I have to know.
How, Father?
How do I do it?
What do I use to make them afraid?
If I ring the bell, Alfred will come.
Another of your gifts to me, Father.
But I'd rather die than wait another hour.
I've already waited 18 years.
Eighteen years since all sense left my life.
Yes, Father.
He's held four children at gun point.
Reportedly he has a history of mental illness.
SWAT team lead by Brendon has just arrived...
Crap. Brendon?
Lt'll be a massacre.
Last month, he and his lunatic gestapo calmed down a riot in Robinson Park.
He didn't even leave the statues standing.
No. Don't want.
Isn't blank.
Damn it, Merkel. I'm not here to argue,
I'm here to clean up.
Lieutenant Gordon is on his way, sir.
I really think...
To hell with that spineless bastard.
Now stand aside.
Go find your own war, Brendon.
I'll take it from here.
Intense hostage situation in midtown, at the corner of Richmond and Todd...
...we're getting reports that the gunman has history of mental illness...
...and was apparently released from Arkham Asylum.
Take it easy, friend.
No. Defibrillate.
No lunch. No lunch.
It's okay, pal. We'll order out.
No lunch. No gangrene lunch.
Who wants gum?
You really handled that well, Brendon.
What was I suppose to do?
Disobey a direct order?
- Something's gotta be done.
- I'd like nothing better.
But we must be patient.
Gordon has the press on his side.
He's a hero.
I hate the job.
I hate the gun.
But I keep practicing.
How did I let this happen?
To bring an innocent child to life.
In a city without hope.
I could use a jackhammer on your back.
Oh. You're doing fine, honey.
Ignore it.
Hello?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon...
It's Merkel at the station.
Something about a giant bat.
The chicken'll keep.
Amateur.
Lucky amateur.
Some of you know Detective Essen.
She has returned to Gotham from Lakeside to help with our investigation.
Okay, okay. Listen up.
Our vigilante, or Batman, as the news shows are calling him...
...has committed 70 assaults in the past five weeks.
Now during this time, certain patterns have emerged.
Thank you, detective.
He operates between the hours of midnight and 4 a. m.
Concentrating his efforts in the East End.
This Batman is working his way up the crime ladder.
From junkie to pusher to supplier.
No one appears safe. Not even cops.
- Right, Detective Flass?
- He's not human.
Gentlemen.
Why don't you tell us what happened.
And try not to exaggerate.
It's like I said in my report.
I received an anonymous tip leading me to an East End cocaine delivery.
I was on the process of single-handedly apprehending the felons.
It came out of the night sky.
Wings 30 feet across.
One of the felons I have not yet disarmed, produced a gun, fired point blank...
...bullet passed right through the creature like it wasn't there.
Something flew from its hand.
Little dart things.
Paralyzed everyone. Except me.
It singled me out. It had claws.
I'm telling you it isn't human.
Gentlemen, please.
Have you seen Batman, commissioner?
They say he's huge.
You shouldn't pry, Marian.
Gill has his hands full these days.
We're trusting him to cope with Batman and Gordon.
Whoever this bat person is, he's a having a positive effect on public spirit.
Street crime has dropped significantly.
Hell, Gill, maybe you ought to offer him a job.
Hey, hey, let's not kid ourselves.
Batman is costing us all money.
Two sides to everything, friends.
Look at the long term.
A few street operators are put out of action, yes...
...but the people of Gotham have a hero.
Makes them feel safe.
And the safer they feel, the fewer questions they ask, right, Gill?
I don't like it. It's stirring things up.
And with Gordon pushing Internal Affairs to go after Flass...
...Flass would be difficult to replace.
- And if he were to talk...
- Let me worry about Flass.
Relax, Carmine.
I got everything under control.
- What is going on?
- The lights? What happened to the lights?
Ladies, gentlemen...
...you've eaten well.
You've eaten Gotham's wealth.
Its spirit.
But your feast is nearly over.
From this moment on, none of you are safe.
No excuses.
That vigilante bastard goes under, instantly.
Or it's your job.
She knows how to walk in heels.
So few women do these days.
And she knows how to scream.
You could hear it from the rooftops.
Gordon is wasting a lot of manpower on these traps.
We'll try again tomorrow night.
Mr. Falcone, your Rolls, it's gone.
He took it. Said it's in the river.
Thinks he's a damn Robin Hood.
He dies.
He knows when and where we sets our traps for him...
...and night after nights, he terrorizes the most powerful men in Gotham.
- Heard what he did to the Roman's car?
- Laughed myself silly.
A Rolls-Royce.
You've been after the Roman for years.
Some of your witnesses changed their testimony. Others vanished.
- Must be frustrating.
- Oh, yes.
- Do you mind?
- Go for it.
I understand he used his muscle to keep you from making DA.
- You keep in shape, don't you, Mr. Dent?
- What are you driving at, lieutenant?
I need to know where you were on the following dates.
Thank you, sir.
I thought he'd never leave.
You can come out now.
He had an alibi for every date, Essen.
Says he was home between midnight and 4 with his wife.
No point in questioning her.
- You really think he's Batman, lieutenant?
- It's possible.
Dent certainly is passionate enough.
But it takes more than muscles to fight the way Batman does.
And to get around the way he does.
And those weapons?
I mean, he's got an arsenal.
Hard to afford on a blue-collar salary.
- Money, lieutenant.
- Hmm?
Bruce Wayne is the richest man in Gotham.
Being from out of town, you might not know...
...but Wayne's parents were murdered, by a mugger, I think.
He was just a little boy at the time.
Essen, I could kiss you.
Jim.
Hold on.
Take the wheel.
Don't move.
Lieutenant, you all right?
I called for back-up.
Essen.
Stop. Or I'll...
It's Batman. He went down that alley.
Get the front of that place covered.
Merkel, take a squad to the roof
No one fires without my order.
Batman hasn't attacked anybody.
There's no need for Brendon.
I've got the situation in hand.
Oh, no.
Everybody, back.
- Move it back.
- Move, move, move.
Clear the area.
Selina.
Selina, come see.
Five in the morning? Come on, Holly.
I'm serious, Selina.
Things are blowing up.
Brendon's probably cornered some jaywalker.
Turn on the TV.
Gotta be something on about it.
- Lock and load.
Brendon.
Keep your men under control.
No one fires unless I say.
Not this time, Gordon.
The commissioner wants a corpse.
He's gonna get one.
All units entering the target area.
No prisoners, men.
Batman has been surrounded by Gotham police...
...inside an abandoned tenement off Robinson Park.
Selina, it's Batman.
- Can we?
- What the hell?
Grab your coat.
Unit 1 reporting, second floor's a mess.
Nothing living.
Unit 2 reporting, body under the water-heater just an old wino.
If he made it down there, he might have survived.
Check it out.
Super must have lived here.
What the hell is going on?
Open that goddamn door.
I like you right where you are, Brendon.
Too many people have already died.
Order your squads to withdraw.
I can't guarantee their safety.
Units 1 and 2, converge on the lobby.
He's here.
Shoot on sight.
I need a mask.
Goddamn. Unit 1, do you read me?
Seems like Brendon is in trouble.
I wish I could help, but orders are orders.
It breaks my heart.
Sir, he's taken out Unit 3.
The entire unit, commissioner.
You better shoot straight, son.
I've made a mess of things.
Let it get out of hand.
Step it up. Step it up.
Careful, these stairs are about to give way.
Hold your fire.
It's a bat we're after.
With my belt gone,
I'm down to a blow gun.
Three darts and an unofficial invention of Wayne Electronics.
Haven't tested it for this great a distance.
It took me weeks to find the right ultrasonic tone.
A tone that acts as an attractant.
Whoever Batman is, he's stronger than I...
Shut up. He could be anywhere.
Cease fire, you idiots.
I'm gonna cut that bastard in half.
Yeah.
They've made a hero out of him.
There, the motorcycle. After him.
Shoot him, you idiot. Kill him.
Kill him.
I can't see a thing.
Every member of Brendon's team...
...every cop and everybody in the crowd were vaccinated for their bat bites.
Never have so many had so much trouble sitting down.
Four of Brendon's men were hospitalized with broken bones.
Brendon himself suffered five broken ribs and internal bleeding.
The dead winos had no relatives to complain about their fire bombing.
Everyone who could have ordered
Brendon and Loeb up on charges...
...remains unavailable to me by appointment or telephone.
I spoke to his butler.
Wayne has been skiing in Switzerland for the past six weeks.
Apparently, he took a nasty spill, broke both legs and an arm.
Cast on his arm and legs would cover bullet wounds.
Exactly where Batman received them.
You're relentless, Essen.
Only when I want something.
Well, quitting time.
- We'll pick it up tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Share a cab?
Uh...
Sure.
Selina, you punched Stan.
We're changing our line of work, Holly.
Why a cop?
I was told I was too masculine for about six other careers.
Whoever said you were masculine must have been blind, deaf and dead.
Mind if I ask you a personal question?
I know why I'm here.
But what are you doing here?
In Gotham, I mean.
It's a long, sordid story.
The bullet points are police corruption.
A cop who wanted to believe the system works...
...and one incredibly bad decision.
There's a reason everyone hates Internal Affairs.
They dangle the carrot of integrity and honesty.
But at the end of the day, when you take down another cop...
...they treat you like any other low-life scumbag.
I'm sorry.
You spent the last of our money on that?
It's not even Halloween.
Sometimes, Holly, you have to spend money to make money.
Selina.
What the hell am I doing?
I need to stop this thing with Sarah.
Oh, God.
Calling her Sarah now.
I need to come clean with Barbara.
Beg for forgiveness.
But I can't stop thinking about her...
...like I can't stop thinking about this Batman.
He's a criminal, I'm a cop.
It's as simple as that.
But I'm a cop in a city that uses its cops like hired killers.
He saved that old woman.
He saved those two cops.
What the hell am I doing?
I just wanna know...
...if your wife weren't pregnant, would you...?
I'm sorry, that wasn't a fair question.
Damn it, Jim.
I'll request a transfer.
Give me Flass, I'll see that you walk.
Try this one, how about
I don't give you Flass and walk anyway?
You got nothing on me.
Save your little Q and A session for the inquest, Gordon.
My client just posted bail.
If you say one word about Flass and your life won't be worth a nickel.
Are you listening to me?
Yeah, sure.
I want you in a blue suit with a tie.
None of that pimp stuff.
And when you smile at the jury, make it nice. Particularly the women.
You mean like this?
Just remember, they'll have their clothes on.
You can never escape me.
Nothing harms me.
But I know pain.
I know pain.
Sometime I share it with someone like you.
You got Flass.
Get the DA and forget to tell the commissioner.
On it.
Sources inside the police department reveal that Detective Arnold Flass...
...has been implicated in Jefferson
Skeevers' massive drug operation.
I just need to ask you...
If I can just stop you for just one moment.
Detective. Detective,
Vicki Vale here with the local ne...
Detective?
You might have informed me before handling Flass' head to IA.
It was a slip-up, sir.
Everyone's working such long hours.
Right, Brendon?
You get good press, I'll give you that.
A.G. And his pack at the Gazette, they like you.
But they don't know you.
Not like we do.
Be a shame if your wife were to learn about your special working relationship...
...with Detective Essen.
Walls have ears, Jimmy.
Everything looks good, Barbara.
I'll see you in a week.
That is unless your son decides differently.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Batman.
Lieutenant Gordon?
Gordon here.
Bruce Wayne's representative is on the other line.
Mr. Wayne's available for an interview right now.
- What should I tell him, sir?
- Tell him I'm on my way.
- Sorry, honey.
- That's okay.
I've always wanted to meet Bruce Wayne.
They say he's quite charming.
Police Lieutenant Gordon and Mrs. Gordon, sir.
Mrs. Gordon, I'm charmed.
Alfred, be a joy and get some glasses for our guests.
And another bottle.
This one's evaporated.
Little early in the day for us, thanks.
Please, sit.
Mr. Wayne, I don't wanna waste any more of your time than necessary.
I've been following your exploits, lieutenant.
I must say I'm impressed.
You're getting about as much press as this Batman fellow.
It is Batman you wanted to talk about, isn't it?
Something about me being him?
Pardon me. Where are my manners?
I neglected to introduce my friend.
Unfortunately,
I'm not sure what her name is.
She doesn't speak any language that I know.
- Except one.
- How convenient.
Barbara.
Mr. Wayne, I need to know where you were on the following dates.
- He's a pig.
- He's acting like one.
Anyone who'd wear a cape and hunt criminals...
...might go far to keep his secrets.
Or he really is a sleazy, womanizing scumbag.
Jim, what is it?
Honey, there's something I need to tell you.
He's been sitting there for 10 minutes.
Ah. Now he's moving. Good.
Grape juice and small talk.
That is not my idea of a party,
Mr. Wayne.
What are you complaining about?
Easiest 5 grand you ever made.
Can I go now? You guys are weird.
Skeevers told us where, when and how much money you received, Flass.
You're facing 10 years in prison, my friend.
That is if Skeevers is alive enough to testify.
Uh, my client didn't mean that.
Hello?
You know your husband's been fooling around?
Yes, I know about Detective Essen.
Don't bother calling here again.
Rat poison. He's lucky.
We pumped his stomach in time.
Skeevers is still going to testify.
Just keeping you informed, sir.
In his continuing investigation into police corruption...
...District Attorney Harvey Dent...
...has promised a press conference early next week to discuss the Flass case.
Lieutenant Gordon?
It's a boy. Your wife is fine.
The city has experienced the fourth in a daring series of cat burglaries.
This time, the victim was none other than Police Commissioner Loeb.
The commissioner had a collection of pop memorabilia.
Ugh! I thought he'd have jewels or paintings, not these stupid toys.
How can I sell this crap?
I don't know. They're kind of cool.
- Charge Batman with the crime they admit to no evidence.
Batman?
They're giving the credit to Batman?
But, Selina, you don't want them to know it's you, do you?
I hear Falcone's got a fortune in old stuff.
Maybe I'll give the Roman a little scratch before I steal it.
On the face.
They won't think it's Batman if I give him a scratch.
Hello, Johnny, my sister's boy.
You're a man now, Johnny.
A strong man.
Mother says there are several men plaguing you, sir.
I need only be told their names.
Your mother is wise in her way.
You see, Johnny...
...there are too many people in this world who ask questions.
And far, far too many who give answers.
Mother said...
Listen to me.
- We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.
- Yes, sir.
- Here's what I need done.
Over there.
You work for Batman.
I'll take care of this one.
Here, kitty, kitty. Ugh!
Thanks for wasting my time.
You made the paper again, sir.
We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.
Yes, sir.
Here's what I need done.
Over there.
If only that cat woman hadn't been there.
Marked increase in paranoia. Hmm.
The Roman says he doesn't want bad publicity.
It follows he won't murder anyone.
What then? Blackmail?
Extortion?
Tendency toward aberrant, even violent behavior.
Kidnapping.
Shall I fetch your tights, sir?
Never during the day, Alfred.
Last night's attack connects
Batman to the recent string of burglaries.
A woman in a cat costume, presumably Batman's assistant...
- Assistant?
... left before police arrived.
- Now I'm his assistant?
In other news...
You're going to need your rest.
All bets are off.
You understand?
Tell me what to do.
Gordon, Johnny.
Not gonna be easy.
He'll be hard to get to.
Then make him come to you.
Once a man becomes a father, he is never truly free.
Feeding time.
My turn.
Easy now. Almost warm.
- Gordon here.
Get down here.
Sir, Merkel's on duty, can't you...?
Yes, sir. On my way.
Gordon is leaving his apartment.
Tell Falcone.
Whoa!
Maniac.
Drop the gun, lieutenant.
Go to your office, wait for our call.
- Jim.
- You heard him, lieutenant.
Drop the gun.
If I let them go, my wife and son are dead.
The son of a bitch is crazy.
Barbara, get out of here. Call Merkel.
Don't move. I'll shoot, I will.
Mrs. Gordon, I won't let your son die.
Trust me.
No!
You must be wearing armor under that jacket.
Something like that.
You know, I'm practically blind without my glasses.
You better go.
And, thank you.
It turns out Flass is smarter than he looks.
Took notes on every little talk he ever had with Loeb
Dates, times, it was all there.
Loeb is holding up pretty well...
...for someone under federal indictment for racketeering.
He even offered up a sacrificial lamb.
Barbara's not crazy about the marriage counselor, but we're making progress.
As for me, well, there's a real panic on.
Somebody has threatened to poison the Gotham reservoir.
He calls himself the Joker.
I've got a friend coming who might be able to help.
He should be here any minute.
One must be a sea to receive a poIIuted stream without becoming impure.
Lo, I teach you the Overman.
He is that sea.
What's the problem?
Did you drink too much last night? l can hold my liquor much better than you, servicemen.
That's just the rookies, and if you're not careful, you might end up like them, barfing your guts out inside your suit.
Watch and learn! l'm about to do some maneuvers only big boys can pull off!
You'd better give up and admit defeat,
Rhodey!
Your War Machine is all about firepower, not speed. lt's too heavy!
You might as well admit it.
You're never going to catch me!
Just watch me!
Gotcha!
You keep forgetting one thing, Tony. lt's not just speed that counts here, l'm an Air Force pilot with a whole lot of experience. l have years of training under my belt, in actual combat conditions! You're a novice who only just got his license!
No fair, shooting repulsor rays!
You said you were experienced in tactics!
You didn't see that coming?
Imagine if outbreaks of vioIence, murder, and terrorism couId aII be detected and prevented before they ever took pIaceI
It sounds Iike science-fiction, but it's not.
We're here to introduce the new
Howard sateIIite, deveIoped by Stark Industries.
This technoIogy wiII enabIe the
S.H.I.E.L.D. detection program to monitor every event and the fuII range of human activity, aII over the pIanet.
But there are those who are aIready caIIing it the uItimate spy sateIIite.
Privacy-rights advocates have demanded that Stark Industries scrap its depIoyment.
Tony Stark responded to those accusations in his presentation Iast night... l named this satellite ''Howard'' after my Dad, who always watched out for me.
It's a tribute to him.
And for a particuIar reason.
He beIieved in the concept of personaI freedom. The Howard sateIIite has not been designed to infringe upon that right.
Instead, it's an aII-seeing eye in the sky with one job, to identify and prevent troubIe before it occurs, 24 hours a day. Once it's Iaunched and activated, it wiII provide reIief to the victims of crime, and protect countIess Iives aII over the worId.
Tony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries, who is aIso known as Iron Man, is cIaiming the Iaunch of his new sateIIite wiII provide endIess benefits to ordinary citizens...
With many questions unanswered, there is much anxiety over potentiaI vioIations
-of privacy...
-PeopIe are wondering whether they're abIe to trust this man, who has a background as a weapons deaIer.
There is an undercurrent of anxiety that the sateIIite was deveIoped for some secret purpose.
There are those who say there is great danger in putting aII of our faith in technoIogy. Who wiII be in controI, man or machine?
Here comes Tony Stark in his Iron Man armor, and CoIoneI James Rhodes, fIying his War MachineI ObviousIy, they are both here to reassure the pubIic.
-Glad you're still alive.
-Not as much as me.
Who the hell are these guys?
They're targeting the Howard. l've run into these bastards before.
They're armored mercenaries who call themselves the ''Raiders.''
They must be paranoid that we're gonna be able to track their activities.
They're jamming the radio waves!
Data interrupt! We've lost communications!
Scramble our lnterceptors and get them out there.
Rhodey! Great work! lt's time for us to have a little chat, my friend.
If you answer niceIy, you might survive this interview. You'II be in prison, but at least you'll still be alive.
Am l supposed to be scared? My boss is more powerful than you.
He's far surpassed your capabilities.
He's that good, is he? Maybe l can find a job for him in my company.
We'd have to settle a few things first, like a claim for damages.
We've only just begun.
My boss is going to smash your satellite into pieces before you have a chance to play with it! lf he's that powerful, why is he so afraid to show himself?
Oh, he's here.
Rhodey!
Take care of this guy, will you?
Hey!
Have all staff except necessary personnel evacuate immediately!
-We're about to launch the satellite!
-Yes, sir!
Who's there? Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!
-Fuel update!
-Complete, sir!
-Launch pad status!
-Ready to go!
-Fire flow complete!
-Countdown continuing.
-Wind speed, eight miles per hour!
-Purging energy supply pipe!
-All systems are green!
Acknowledged!
Good morning.
And goodbye.
Huh? What the heck?
Unknown phenomenon.
No reference in the database.
PossibIe presence of erosive bioIogicaI ceIIs.
No one escapes. l won't let you do it!
Power is down. Energy reserves at 55% .
Who is this guy?
Insufficient data. Genome DNA extract impossibIe. Cannot read base sequence.
Unknown gene region.
Centrifuge is required to continue anaIysis.
You must be some kind of monster!
How could you sacrifice so many lives for a single satellite? Hey, you! Say something!
The leaders of all fascist companies appear to have similar eyes.
The eyes of smartass kids also seem the same.
People who place their faith in high-technology, like you, should be placed in museums with the rest of the fossils.
Actually, coffins would be better.
And kids who are all mouth, like you, should be sent to the Stark School of
Re-Education. l am Ezekiel.
Ezekiel? l promise you, l will be dancing around your coffin as they drive in the final nail. l will then hold a wake in the offbeat style you so favor. l'm not done with you yet!
Goodbye.
Shoot! What the hell is this?
Tony, where are you?
What happened down here?
What's going on in this place? l'm done on my end!
Tony, are you down here somewhere?
-Don't come any further!
-What? Are you in trouble?
What's that? Tony! l don't believe this.
The control tower's gone!
-Any signs of life?
-l'm afraid not.
Wait! l see some movement down in the rubble! lt's Tony Stark! He made it out, sir! lron Man is alive!
Send Black Widow to pick him up!
And hurry!
We need to debrief him immediately!
Come on! Where are you, Rhodey?
Come on! You've got to be here somewhere! l'll find you, no matter how long it takes! lf you're alive, answer me!
Natasha! Help me find Rhodey! Please!
Stark! There's no time to waste, we have to get out of here.
Fury has ordered me to escort you to the helicarrier.
The medical team will continue to search for survivors, but casualties are expected to rise to more than 300 people.
Nick! Rhodey died! Right in front of me!
And so did a lot of other people.
Who the hell were these guys?
All their signals were blocked by a very powerful electromagnetic field. l was hoping you could give us some guidance.
He was a smartass kid.
His armor was weird. lt was very advanced, l'll tell you that is something l've never seen before. lt was techno bio-organic matter, combined with manmade mechanisms!
Techno bio-organic armor? l'm gonna find that guy. And when l do, l'm gonna make him pay for Rhodey!
Nick! What's going on here?
What are you up to?
You're not leaving this complex, Stark.
Not until S.H.l.E.L.D. has worked out exactly what's going on.
Are you suggesting l had something to do with this?
We have more questions.
What happened just now is being broadcast everywhere. lt's being played out on every news channel on every television across the planet. lf we don't provide an explanation some high-up heads at the Pentagon are going to roll.
Just routine procedure, of course.
Business as usual.
They have enough heads.
Believe me, they can afford to lose a few.
That's not the most important thing now.
We need to get hold of that kid before he causes any more damage.
And that's exactly what l'm gonna do!
Go after him.
NickI WiII you caII off your pit-buII?
For God's sake! l don't have time to mess around!
That's too bad. l'm the only one who has a chance against that smart-ass kid's technology!
You probabIy won't beIieve it, but l'm telling you the truth, l'm not enjoying this one bit.
There are rules. And whether you like it or not, l happen to be duty-bound to obey them. There'II be heII to pay if I Iet our onIy witness get himseIf kiIIed.
You government workers sure have a tough job.
Homing missiIes Iocked on and tracking.
Thanks a lot for the update!
Wanna play?
Commander, he's goneI We've Iost himI
Natasha?
Sorry, Natasha.
Stark! l need to teach that kid the greatness of technology. l'm going to have to find out where its weaknesses are.
How's the art coming? l'm still working on it. l love art, but l don't intend to become an artist. After all this time playing around, l realize l don't have the talent for it like my uncle.
You shouldn't give up in frustration.
Your body has the DNA for it.
There's something l've finally come to realize.
Even with talent, you need chaos to give birth to a dancing star. l'm not sure l have it.
Someday, man will no longer give birth to any star.
By the way, l see they managed to launch the satellite after all.
The Raiders couldn't control the reinforced functions l gave them.
However, it's still early in the game. l'll be preparing another offensive.
Tony Stark.
Tony Stark.
He seems to be in possession of a wide range of technological icons.
And one of the high-tech graven images these people pIace on an aItar to worship, is his new sateIIite.
-He's the high priest of technoIogy.
-Yes.
But it's a conceited and fooIish misunderstanding.
TechnoIogy and the peopIe who give birth to it are nothing more than faIse idoIs,
Ieading society to disaster. lt's a tiresome task.
But these people must be taught the truth. l need your help!
Excuse me?
Check the black market for bio-related products.
You promised me a full week's vacation!
And anyway, aren't you supposed to be in
Utah for the launch of that new satellite you developed? l'll make it up to you, Pepper. l'll tell you what. This year, you can have the villa and a whole support staff.
Thanks, but you already gave me that to
-make up for losing last year's vacation.
-l did? Okay, then how about l rent you an entire village or something?
Please, Pepper. lt's urgent.
-What's going on here?
-l'll tell you inside.
How long is it before the Howard goes online?
Everything should be active within four hours.
We're going to use that satellite to find its maker.
As of now, priority one is capturing the fugitive lron Man.
Poor Rhodey. l can't believe it. l can't believe he was such an idiot for letting that kid get him. l could've taken care of myself.
He didn't need to come looking for me.
You're saying the killer was a child?
Yeah, some know-it-all kid!
There was something about him, though, that was very intriguing.
The bottom line is, if he was able to create a technology that l've never seen or heard of before, he deserves a little respect.
His sense of design isn't really my cup of tea.
But his results are.
As you know, l've dealt with some shady vendors in the past.
But Rhodey was the exact opposite.
He was a straight arrow. All the time l knew him, he never broke the rules or left the straight and narrow. l admired him.
He really believed in the dream.
Rhodey was a government worker and a normal person. l'm nothing but a rich genius.
The worlds we lived in were so different, it's amazing we got along at all.
He was a good friend, but l'm not sad about it. l'm fine, really. lt's a shame, though, that l lost someone to race against. l guess l should have let him win some of the times.
Tony.
That suit was made of technology l've never seen before.
Nanotechnology? Biotechnology? No. lt was nowhere near as simple as that.
He had inserted the integral DNA of living organisms into a material based on the functions of a human body. lt couldn't be done in a normal research facility.
Could he somehow be using mutated cells? No!
He's synthesizing them in a molecule assembler! lf not, it wouldn't be stable.
Tony. l need you to authorize access.
Stark, vocal authorization.
Nanomachines, nanotechnology.
Here's something on human-mech hybrids.
There's research being done all over the world, but no one has announced a practical application. l haven't heard of any successes, either.
But l have to believe my own eyes.
What l saw was a definite breakthrough. lt merged biotechnology and mechatronics.
Customized artificial neurons were working in conjunction with the human nervous system.
He was controlling them perfectly.
A.l.M! lt's a company called
Advanced ldea Mechanics and they're the largest supplier in the black market.
They've been researching biotechnological hybrid armors for a long time, in secret. ln recent years, they've continuously invested vast amounts of capital.
Does your data indicate where their research facility is located?
Let me see.
Karachi, Pakistan! There's a secret lab there!
The facility is being fronted as a warehouse for medical supplies.
But actually, they're involved with chemical warfare research and the sales of illegal weapons. l've downloaded map coordinates in case you plan to pay them a visit.
Thanks, Pepper.
You can return to your vacation now.
Are you going to be okay on your own?
A kid misbehaved.
An adult needs to discipline him.
You're a kid yourself, Tony, an obstinate, stubborn kid.
Are you going to scold me, Pepper?
Why do you keep putting me in that position? l don't want to be the only adult in this relationship. lt's intriguing, though. l find l'm drawn to more mature women.
Especially when they're beautiful.
Darn it.
Tony. lron Man is not responding.
All signals are being blocked.
Damn it! Teams Blue and Gold, cover all escape routes! Team Red, move in on my command. Capture and contain!
-lt's S.H.l.E.L.D. What did you do this time?
-Something awful, l imagine. l suppose it's too late to apologize.
Confirming as our target, Mr. Tony Stark.
Checking profiIe.
Target identified.
Mr. Stark, pIease throw away your weapons and surrender immediateIy.
PIease compIy.
PIease compIy.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
PIease compIy.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
You can Ieave your beIongings with us.
Sorry, Nick. l don't have time to waste right now. l'll pay for the damages. l have to go.
Fire.
There goes my vacation. Predictable.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
AII Mandroids have Iost position of Iron Man.
Visual monitors are disabled.
Switching to motion sensors.
Hey, boys, l'd love to keep playing.
But l think it's time to excuse myself.
Sorry, Nick, but l had to do what l thought was necessary. l think you need to improve the A-One on the Mandroids.
After facing off with them, l have to say, they seem a little vulnerable to me!
All Mandroids have been annihilated.
Get me special agents Barton and Romanova.
Right away, sir.
So, Miss Potts. ls your boss free any time in the near future? l'm afraid he's fully booked for the next three years or so.
Of course. Being Tony Stark, he never follows his schedule.
Then he blames me when he misses his appointments.
There's something l want to show you. l was trying to tell your crazy boss about this, but he appears to be blocking all communications.
One day he's going to go off half-cocked, and run into something unexpected he can't handle.
They herald the coming of the lightning, and perish as heralds.
-Lo.
-Lo.
-l am a herald of the lightning.
-l am a herald of the lightning. l feel good today. lt's so beautiful.
With the Technovores, l will have great power. l will be able to control any machine, using the interface built into this armor.
So. Are you ready to go?
Yes. l will now be able to infect the satellite and bring it down.
We will grind these oppressors and their techno gods to dust. lt's up to you, however, as to where you want to use it.
Obviously.
Excellent. We have a deal, my friend.
Tell your associates A.l.M. says hello.
What's wrong?
Shit! lt's the Punisher! How did he track me?
We're being blown to bits over here!
You need to send reinforcements right away!
What do you mean, 10 minutes?
Nobody's gonna be alive here in 10 minutes!
We need them in 10 seconds!
What do you think you're doing?
Let me handle this, Punisher. l don't need help from a company president who can't stay out of the limelight.
These guys are scum.
They don't deserve to live.
Punisher, l don't disagree with your feelings.
But l need some answers before you wipe 'em out. l have all the answers l need.
Get out of the way. lf you shoot, l'll blast you from here to Tokyo!
Fine, go ahead. l appreciate it. All right. Let's get this over with while Punisher's still in a good mood. l need to know about the men who hired you.
Do you think an A.l.M. man would give up the identity of his clients?
Come on, Stark! You of all people should know what would happen if l were to do that!
Let me guess.
You'd never be able to do business again.
Permanently! l figured.
But thanks for the directory anyway.
Nice work.
So, neo-terrorists.
Techno-organisms, buyers of body armor.
Let's see who you've been dealing with.
Ezekiel?
Ezekiel. Wait a minute! l know that name!
But l've got a dossier on him, if it's any use to you.
-You're sure about that?
-l remember that name, too.
As a friend, you'd let me read that dossier?
Huh! Now you're a friend?
The same friend who threatened to blast me from here to Tokyo? l guess our job is done. Let's get out of here.
How can you drink this coffee? lt's like sludge. lt's military issue.
Drinking it at night in the jungle used to calm me down.
Actually this place kind of reminds me of a jungle.
Here's the file. l found it.
Ezekiel Stane... Stane! Wait!
Obadiah Stane's son?
That would be pretty disgusting.
This nutcase turns out to be the son of your old partner?
Obadiah went crazy. l had no choice at the time.
I had to kiII him.
Are you telling me he's that Ezekiel Stane?
But he's supposed to have died in an aircraft accident!
At the age of 16!
His father had a lot of assets hidden around the world.
Having inherited all that, l'm sure a clever kid like him would know how to put it to very good use.
Nowadays, a little cash can make the impossible possible.
You're right. There's no denying that.
Looks to me like this kid has been burying his trail for a lot of years.
And now he shows up in the form of a sociopathic super-genius.
There are rumors he injected his brain with nanobots to make himseIf smarter than he already was.
According to this, he's involved in a wide range of shady research.
From synthetic drugs to nanotechnology.
One of his interests is techno-organic armor.
What a surprise.
He won't be an easy opponent to handle. l've been after him for six months and l haven't been able to pin him down.
-Let me try something.
-What are you looking for? l'm hacking directly into the
S.H.l.E.L.D. network. l figure if l cross-reference your dossier with the data in the network l might be able to find out where he is.
Computer geeks are something else.
Thirty miles to Karachi.
Log note, I'm briefing Agent Natasha
Romanova, and Agent CIint Barton.
Here's the update, it's been confirmed that
Stark has joined forces with Frank CastIe, known as ''The Punisher. ''
That weapon-crazy lunatic?
Although l hear he's not very good with a bow and arrow. l want to get out of this country as quickly as possible. lf it's discovered that we're violating the airspace of a sovereign nation, it'll cause an international incident.
You have 40 minutes to complete the mission and get back to the ship.
Shanghai? l don't get it.
What would he know about a place like that?
We had a weapons research center there, until l decided to close it down a few years ago.
Then someone bought the property and built a luxury hotel there with a penthouse suite for wealthy VlPs.
The hotel's privacy is as tight as a Swiss bank.
The land itself was apparently purchased by Obadiah Stane.
You see how effective a little bit of cash can be?
Thanks for everything, Frank.
The next time l come, l'm gonna bring you a bag of the best coffee in the world.
Hello, we've got company!
Oh, boy! l knew they'd come, sooner or later.
They sure seem to have a lot of time on their hands.
See you.
Wait!
There is an object approaching from behind. ls it a missile?
Negative.
Bulls-eye!
Some freakin' arrows caused this much damage?
Conducting system check.
So glad l installed a protective force field.
Give up, Stark, and come with us to see the Director.
You really think he's going to come along willingly?
System interrupt. Initiating forced shutdown.
Hold on, wait a minute!
Stop fighting.
There's no way you can get loose.
You might as well accept it.
The game's over, buddy. We're taking you in.
Listen, Stark! ln the helicarrier's medical bay is...
Watch out! You're not too good at this, Stark!
Crap, he's getting away!
Tell me something.
Are you trying to be as obvious as you can?
What do you mean, Stark? l thought you liked the attention.
Not when l look like five miles of bad road!
Well then, hang on, buddy!
What's your problem, mister? lt's over, Stark! lf you join forces with a crazed vigilante killer, no-one's gonna take you seriously as a hero, buddy!
That son of a gun!
Don't do it, Frank!
They're just following orders! l'm not trying to kill them! l just want them to know we're not about to surrender!
Shit!
-You ready?
-Leave it to me!
Bingo!
All right, guys! lf you don't want to get hurt any further, you'd better come out!
We hear you. But before we do, here's a little gift!
You bastard!
Thanks for the compliment. Now throw down your weapons and raise your hands!
Did you hear me?
Good girl.
You, too!
Fine. You jerk.
Don't think you're gonna get away with this.
Bunch of bleeding-heart S.H.l.E.L.D weaklings! lf you disrespect me again, l'll... lf you don't want a tunnel bored in your head, throw your guns away!
Whatever. l don't need them now, anyway. l guess l was able to buy enough time.
Power reserves now recovered to 40% .
Good, now go ahead and re-route force field reserves to thrusters.
Affirmative.
Come back here! lt's no use. Your arrows won't reach him.
Darn it!
Power reserves fuIIy recovered.
AII systems are now optimaI. l've wasted too much time. l can already hear the boss dismissing us, sarcastically.
Yeah. lt makes me want to bore a hole into my own head.
You owe me, Stark.
Payback won't be cheap. l hear a soft breeze.
And that wind gathers another soft wind. l can sense our destiny.
We come together with that wind.
Listen carefully, Sasha.
Can you hear it, as well?
Jarvis, have you got anything?
Readings are uncIear. There's interference.
Wait, there is a sIight reaction.
It couId weII be a Iiving organism.
That doesn't help me much.
Hey boy! l came to see you.
Why don't you turn the lights on for me?
When l was young, l played hide and seek. l hid in the dark garage for so long, l fell asleep.
After a while, my mom, Maria, came to look for me. She was worried sick.
-Did your parents do the same for you?
-l've never played hide and seek.
Five meters behind you, the air shifted.
And the room temperature changed sIightIy.
Where did you come from?
Did you use magic?
My mom was very upset by my behavior. l worried her with my appearances and disappearances. lf you keep this up, your Mom will get upset, too.
Or your Dad, if he's still around. l don't hide from anyone.
You're simply not looking in the right place.
Really? This is starting to feel more and more like a kid's game to me. l told you before, l've never played hide and seek.
And my Dad that you speak of, l suspect you know who he is.
You might as well say his name.
-Obadiah!
-That is correct.
He can summon up a hoIogram, just Iike thatI
-You want revenge?
-Revenge? Why would l want that?
Because l killed him. You knew that.
Wait, that's right. You were involved, weren't you? l remember now.
You'd forgotten that? lt wasn't as important an event in my life as you might imagine.
We weren't actually that close.
Then why are you targeting me?
-Don't be so conceited.
-What? l wasn't targeting you specifically. lt's just that you were standing in my way. l don't understand. What are you saying?
But he kiIIed Rhodey.
Even if it was just a prank, some things cannot be forgiven!
Rapid power decrease.
System error detected.
What's going on?
Synthetic aIIoys and unknown bioIogicaI entities have invaded the system.
Technovores.
Power source and aII sensors have been compromised.
Technovores?
This armor is pretty well made.
Who do you think made it? l'm impressed.
For someone like you, it's good. l realize you can't move.
But believe me, Sasha will still be impressed.
Sasha?
This must be your pride and joy.
The arc reactor.
Don't you have anything to say?
Like how you think Tony Stark is a genius? l must say, it's very well made.
For you people, that is.
What does that mean ''you people''? l'll have you know...
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and as a result, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden.
And 160,000 years ago in Africa,
Mitochondrial Eve was born.
The ancestor of humankind.
Very impressive. Did you study the history of mankind in college?
Now there are over seven billion people on Earth.
What does that have to do with anything?
You asked what l meant when l said ''you people.'' That's what l was referring to.
You talk as though you're not a part of the human race.
That's exactly how l feel. l think l'm different from the rest of you.
-Then what are you?
-lt's somewhat hard to describe, really.
But if l were forced to explain it in words, l guess l would be a breeze.
A breeze? l'm a little confused, can you elaborate on that?
Sasha would also be a breeze.
Who is this ''Sasha'' you keep referring to?
A girlfriend?
A gentle breeze that caresses your skin.
And ruffles up the grass and trees. l see. l have no idea what you're talking about. But l'm beginning to understand one thing.
Obadiah wasn't a very attentive father.
He let you get lost in a world of dreams.
You represent the dinosaurs of the past. l, however, represent the future.
Dinosaurs of the past?
You should consider retirement.
That sounds pretty good to me. l could relax in a nice, quiet place. ln fact, l actually tried that once.
But my personal assistant just won't let me.
This time, l'm afraid l'll have to override her.
You'll retire for sure.
You understand the situation, don't you?
New wind, new future.
A brand new world is created to go with the brand new future.
A completely new technology will be created.
The old will die out, and the new will be born.
That is the providence of nature.
A superior technology to that of man.
Howard will be the whistling arrow that announces the new reality.
You should be honored.
The wind that follows is going to blow away your most advanced technology.
Howard will be the shot that leads the way.
Hey. Obadiah was lucky he didn't hang around long enough to see this.
New technology, you say?
Technovores, you called it?
Don't make me laugh.
The birth of mankind. Refinement of steel.
Computers, biotechnology.
The things you call old technology have all been linked and accumulated to create your ''technovore.'' lt's not new at all.
The truth is, it's only been born and exists because of the past.
You think you represent a brand new form of existence?
You're mistaken, kid.
You're no more advanced than the rest of us.
You were born from human parents.
So?
You're just a petulant child throwing temper tantrums. And just like a child, if you've been bad, it's an adult's responsibility to correct you.
You would do that? l don't think so. Be quiet for a second.
Part of the system has been restored.
Where? Search for the area that's functional!
The missile!
Locked on target.
Foolish man.
Do you know what will be written on the brass plate that gets installed on your exhibit in the museum?
''Here lies a fragment of lron Man.''
But only if someone is able to identify those fragments after l blow you up.
You spoilt kid. l don't want to put the curators of the museum to that much trouble!
Perhaps if we had had more time, l could have taught you a few things.
Well, it's time for goodbye, Tony Stark.
There's still quite a bit of work to do.
What's wrong, boy?
Invading technovore now being removed.
Restarting system, restoring circuits.
Energy charge in three, two, one, compIete.
What's the matter, boy?
You look like you're in trouble.
Do you need the hand of an adult? l don't believe l do.
The future is full of uncertain elements. lt's okay for a child to rely on adults.
Send energy to the reactor!
Force field deployed!
Hey, where did you go, boy?
Hide and seek time is over!
You went too quickly.
You can't break me...
And you're unable to change the future because that timeline's already written. lt's a blessing your father's not here to witness this all play out.
That's enough, Stark! lt took long enough but we finally caught up with you!
You're coming in with us to see the Director or l'm gonna add an extra hole in your head!
All right, William Tell. You made your point. l'll go, but only if she takes me in.
You only got 98 on your test?
Without a perfect score, you're the same as the other idiots!
Go to your room and reflect on your shortcomings until dinner. l thought you were much better than this!
You're a disappointment!
Did you listen to me? l told you never to touch my Monger!
You little fool! This Monger is worth 10 times as much as you!
My God! l can't believe what l'm seeing!
Rhodey survived that attack?
Has he woken up at all?
He's being kept alive by the life-support system but so far we haven't seen...
Hey, Rhodey! Rhodey, can you hear me? lf you don't wake up you're gonna die a loser!
You can't die without beating me in a race at least once!
-That would be shameful!
-Tony...
Wait a minute! How 'bout this? lf you wake up l'll concede the next race to you! l'll introduce you to a beautiful woman, too!
You just tell me which model on which page of that magazine you were looking at!
Anyone at all! Except the girl on page 10. l've got dibs on her. Just don't tell Pepper!
Other than that, anybody you want!
All stations! An unknown program is hacking into our system!
-Shutting off communications!
-Starting antivirus program! lnitiating defense protocols!
How are the main servers?
We can't stop it.
Someone breached our security and is invading our systems.
Technovores.
-Ezekiel's Technovores are the invaders.
-What? l'm sure the servers have been taken over by now. lt's too late.
Damn it!
He's gone! Where did he go?
The Howard is under attack!
What's happening? lnitiate Guardian program! lt won't start!
The firewall is about to be breached! lf we don't do something immediately, all the systems in Howard will be taken over! l'm right here. Look around for me.
My, my. You're not very observant. l'm right beside you.
Above us!
Are you okay?
Yeah, here's the problem.
Howard has the power to access every computer in the world. lncluding military satellites.
Exactly. He's planning to make Howard the source to hack into the world's military satellites and control them.
Ezekiel called that the wind.
The wind?
He's planning to wipe out everything that lives on this planet!
-What happened to the server room?
-l haven't been able to get a response.
Stark! What are you planning to do? l'm going to fix the computer so we can use it. lf l can divert the power of the arc reactor and aim it at the Technovores, l can annihilate them. l'm pretty sure l can survive for five minutes without this old heart of mine.
After that, l guess it's straight to heaven! l can't tell the situation from here.
What do you want to do? l guess we should return to the bridge.
Ezekiel is definitely coming here to target us.
WarningI WarningI
Power reserves decreasing rapidIyI
Ezekiel!
He's here!
Hi there, ''Old Man'' Tony!
Stop this, now!
Where are Clint and Natasha?
-They're tucked away safe and sound.
-What?
-Don't worry about them.
-Connect it.
Good, Maria. Now re-boot the Howard.
Rebooting Howard, sir! The Guardian program has also been initiated!
You people are determined to try and get in my way somehow.
Come here. Sit down.
You and l are gonna have a talk! Right now!
No matter what you think about your father l can tell you Obadiah loved you very much. lt was a pretty straightforward bargain.
He was human and you were his son!
Was that all? lsn't that enough? You'll achieve nothing if you throw away your history. l have personal experience. l was only able to move forward by accepting my father.
And you'll only create a new world by accepting the past and building on it.
A relic like you is lecturing me about the future? How amusing...
Why should l listen to someone irrelevant?
The Technovores!
Why... Why are you betraying me?
Together, we could have defeated them. l can't see anything, feel anything.
-Sorry, Ezekiel.
-The wind...
...has stopped. l've lost all instruments! l have no control over the helicarrier! lt's losing altitude!
Shoot him!
Come over here! This way, you bastard!
Hurry up, Maria!
Reactor detected.
Power reserve at 15 percent. l have that much?
That's it, pal. Playtime is over!
Propulsive force still inoperable!

-Rhodey...
-How did he...
Rhodey!
What in the...
Wait, Rhodey!
What the hell...
What's happening?
Whatever it is, we're gonna have to put an end to it, right now!

We have to conserve our energy resources!
But we can't just let him destroy everything!
Stop wasting bullets!
What are you talking about?
What are we supposed to do then? l don't know what we can do! l'm trying to think of something!
...finaI... universe... reincarnation...
We've lost control of the Howard!
PowerIess and immature beings...
Prosperity...

He's replicated it!
He's using the Howard to control all the other military satellites in orbit! l'm confused! What's this all about? ls he planning an attack?
Ezekiel, you said that a new wind would create a new future. ls this how you plan to reset the world?
Destroy everything and start all over?
All of the military satellites have been repositioned! He's preparing to attack!
...worId... technoIogy...
I wiII start...
He's completely insane.
He's going to destroy the world.
Tony, we should save our nail clippings.
-What?
-To be filed with our wills. As keepsakes. l hate to bring this up but why would we do that?
There won't be anyone left to give them to. l thought it might be something
Pepper could remember us by.
Wait a minute. Pepper!
Wills...
Leaving something behind...
Of course!
-Pepper! Pepper, can you hear me?
-Yes, sir.
Are you focused enough to heIp me one Iast time?
Anything but dictation.
You're an amazing secretary but it's a IittIe more compIicated than that. l'm not surprised.
You can't do anything without my input.
I want to give you a present before I die.
What's the one thing you've never had since I've known you?
What do you truly want, more than anything else?
What do l want more than anything else?
That's easy. What l want is a vacation!
Vacation. Vacation.
Vacation. Vacation. Vacation.
Vacation. Vacation.
We're starting to regain control of the Howard!
Good job, PepperI I was abIe to get through Howard's back doorI
What back door? l'm not all-powerful. l'm an imperfect human and l realized a while ago that l had to be careful.
I programmed a back door into the sateIIite to protect it from unauthorized users.
When did you set up my voice as the password?
You taIked in your sIeep when you passed out at your desk.
-l don't remember that.
-You wouldn't.
But l was able to uplink my armor to the Howard at the time.
You've earned that vacation twice over.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
The particIe-beam cannon on the Chinese miIitary sateIIite is about to shootI
I'm onIy abIe to controI one sateIIite and I won't have controI for IongI l want to show this guy something l have that he doesn't!
Are you out of your mind?
What are you gonna do?
This is gonna be our last chance, so listen carefully!
The Technovores are trying to take over the Howard by hacking inI
How much time do we have?
Tens of seconds, that's all. l'm counting on you Rhodey. Okay?
All right, Jarvis, pull the trigger!
AffirmativeI
Tony!
Here we go!
Hope your little nap didn't affect your aim!
Aim at what?
All right, it's aligned.
Rhodey! This is it!
You've only got one chance!
Let's do it!
Release the energy of the arc reactor!
The Technovores reacted. Aim for the crack!
-Careful...
-All missiles are ready to launch!
Rhodey, we have no time! You have to shoot!
Do it now! lt's our last chance before the world ends.
Shoot!
All missiles, armed and ready!
Rhodey!
Bear down and shoot!
Everything should work now!
Launching!
Tony!
Yeah, the last thing l can remember is watching the bombs go off. l guess the Technovores decided they needed to repair you before they could override your system.
And in the process, it looks to me like they saved your life.
That was fortunate.
Now it's your turn to recover!
At least you'll be taken care of by a bunch of hot nurses! l'm glad you're okay, Tony, but if you do anything like that again, l'll kill you myself. l hear you, Pepper.
When a child is bad, you need to scold him.
So, you're finally getting it.
You're an obstinate child...
...who needs discipline.
And it's an adult's duty to provide that discipline.
Do you hate women who scold?
Not really.
All boys look up to authority figures.
Especially when they're as beautiful as you.
Don't forget, now.
You promised me a vacation.
Of course. So where do you want to go?
-I'II take some days off, too.
-What?
Let's take a vacation.
Just the two of us. How 'bout it?
Is that an order, sir?
No. It's more Iike a suggestion.
Well then, l suggest you and l pack up.
The insane man shut up and Iooked at the audience.
The audience aIso shut up and Iooked at him.
He regained consciousness last night.
He has a visitor today but there's been no change. He's still mentally deranged.
He finally threw his light against the ground.
The light shattered and died out.
This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering. lt has not yet reached the ears of men.
Deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard.
This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant of stars.
Still, they were able to do the deed.
According to the people, this insane man forced his way into various churches that day singing, ''Requiem.''
The wind!
MAN:
What? He slipped and fell?
- 1337, wasn't it?
- You think he'll be okay?
MASTER CHIEF: This kind of thing happens to him all the time.
Well, 1337 is still a Spartan.
He's been trained with the best of them.
There's no need for concern.
MAN:
If you say so, Master Chief.
It wouldn't be the first time he fell off a Pelican.
- But still, I am a little worried.
MASTER CHIEF: Yeah.
Oh, no.
Hey! Wait for me! Come back!
Don't leave me behind!
I'm gonna have to rendezvous with them somewhere.
Huh?
I wonder if these natives are dangerous?
Hey, look at that.
It's the junky old robot that fell.
Ha-ha-ha. I am not some junky robot.
Even if you don't wanna know,
I'll tell you who I am.
I am one of the strongest warriors in space.
I am Spartan-1337.
- I wouldn't stand there if I were you.
- It's not safe.
1337: How dare they ignore my awesome heroism.
Fear not. I am the strongest warrior in the... Oh, no.
[1337 GRUNTING]
I'm fine. That was just a few dents.
[1337 GROANING & GRUNTING]
He doesn't really get along with strangers all that much.
[GROANING]
ALIEN 1: So where is the accursed group of Spartans?
ALIEN 2 [ON RADIO]: On Cronkee, the fourth planet of the Unicon system.
ALIEN 1: Excellent.
This is the perfect opportunity...
...to show those Spartans a thing or two about Covenant power.
- Bring out Pluton.
- Yes, sir.
ALIEN 1: Yes. It is the finest bio-warrior ever created.
Now go to the planet Cronkee and demonstrate our might.
ALIEN 2: But Pluton's weapons are still in the experimental stage.
They'll be enough to vanquish the humans.
Don't you think a real battle will be the best way...
...to conduct our little test?
If that is your wish.
I will get you at long last, Master Chief.
Now go, Pluton!
PLUTON: Guh.
- Not "guh." Go destroy them!
[GROWLING]
No, not over here.
- He's over that way. He's over there!
- Huh?
Don't "huh" me. Go that way.
[PLUTON GROWLING]
I need a vacation.
[GARBLED RADIO INTERFERENCE]
1337: Chief, respond please.
Can you hear me? Chief? Over.
There's some strange interference.
- Hello? Can you hear me?
BOY 1: We can hear you.
1337: Not you. And I thought I told you to stop following me.
BOY 1: Robot, look.
- I told you I'm not a robot.
What's that?
BOY 2: Sure is a lot of junk falling from the sky today.
[ROARING]
Covenant? It's dangerous.
Get out of here!
- As far as you can.
BOY 1: Okay.
[ROARING]
[KIDS SCREAMING]
[1337 GRUNTING]
Chief, this... Stop it. Stop it.
[ROARING]
[SCREAMING]
BROTHER:
Are you guys all right?
- Hey, look. It's big brother.
BOY 2: And big sister.
Any of you know what that thing is?
It looks like he almost blew up the mountain range.
He fell from the sky. All of a sudden, he and this giant monkey started going nuts.
BROTHER: Don't worry.
Your big brother is gonna take care of it.
Yeah. Well, he might be a little tougher than you think.
We don't have much choice.
We'll just have to try our best.
SISTER:
Yeah, you might lose.
BROTHER: Why would you say that?
Give me some credit, will you?
It must have been scary.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm kind of hungry.
[LAUGHS]
BROTHER:
All right, let's do this.
[GARBLED RADIO INTERFERENCE]
I'm not gonna lose. No way can I lose.
I am Spartan-1337.
No one else will say it, so I will.
The fact that I never give up is one of my good points!
Hey, look. The rain stopped.
The robot's back.
What's that?
BROTHER: Apparently they used to travel between the stars with that.
1337: An old UNSC frigate.
Must've crash-landed.
SISTER:
I hear that we were all born inside there.
BROTHER:
Mama raised us all by herself.
Mama?
You kids should stay behind.
This is my fight.
BROTHER: Don't worry about it. We may not look it, but we're pretty tough.
SISTER:
Though, we're no match for Mama.
Mama, huh?
BROTHER: When we were still little she fought off a bunch...
...of bird-headed pirates by herself.
That sounds like one heck of a mama.
But you know what?
I'm one heck of a mama myself.
[BROTHER & SISTER GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[1337 GRUNTING]
[ALL PANTING]
I did it.
I did it!
BROTHER: Oh, no. We'll be done for if he reaches full strength.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah, and that's gonna be the hard part.
Less talk, more action.
Ah!
[SISTER SCREAMING]
[BOTH SCREAMING]
BROTHER:
This isn't good. He won't budge.
SISTER:
We're totally screwed.
BROTHER:
What else can we do?
We're doomed.
BROTHER & SISTER:
Well, don't jinx us!
I'm just kidding.
We gotta do something.
Hey, what the heck is that?
BROTHER:
Oh, as if he'd ever fall for that.
SISTER:
He did fall for it.
1337: He did? He did.
Now let's get out of here.
[ROARING]
[BEEPING]
[ROARING]
Whoa. What's happening?
[BLEEPING]
No way.
Ah!
Is that a Slipspace rupture?
[BEEP]
Ah!
That was Mama.
SISTER:
I told you, no one was as tough as Mama.
MAN: Master Chief, radio contact has been reestablished.
MASTER CHIEF:
Good. I'll try to contact 1337.
There's another Al living on this planet.
MASTER CHIEF: What?
- I've lost contact with it.
But I'm pretty sure I felt it just tinkering with the Slipspace drive.
She's another Al it seems. Just like I am.
MASTER CHIEF:
Why here?
- You want me to collect her?
- No. Let's not do that.
It's a very old Al construct.
You might say something of an antique.
- She seems...
- Seems what?
Happy. If I'm understanding correctly, she seems to be happy here. Hm.
MASTER CHIEF:
Hm.
BROTHER & SISTER:
We're home.
MAMA: Were you playing as cavemen again? You really do like that game.
BOY 1: Mama, you're not gonna believe what happened today.
MAMA: All right, all right.
You can tell me all about that later.
BROTHER:
Mama, just what did you do back there?
MAMA:
That's not important right now.
By the way, dinner is ready.
GIRL: I'm hungry.
MAMA: I thought so.
- Now go wash your hands.
KIDS: Okay.
MAMA:
And clean behind your ears.
Mama.
CHIEF [ON RADIO]:
Can you hear me, 1337? Come in, 1337.
This is 1337. I hear you clearly, sir.
Head to the rendezvous point immediately.
Rendezvous ASAP, over.
Huh? Roger that, sir, but I may run a little late!
[PLUTON GRUNTING]
[ENGLISH SDH]
[ENGLISH SDH]
PLUTON:
Guh.
Hey, Chico, how's it going?
Hey, Rosa!
You're listening to "Yesterday's Melodies"
And now for a song that won the "RHC Cadena Azul" contest sixty years ago.
"A Little Taste of Me" by Chico and Rita.
HAVANA 1948
Bourbon!
- Make it two!
- No.
Not whiskey.
Four mojitos, you gotta see what drinking really is!
Ramon...
Kiss me, kiss me, as if tonight was the last time
Ok, ladies, a toast.
To us!
To us!
Time to switch partners!
Who's your hick friend?
Who him?
That's Chico. Unknown, but he's the hottest piano player in Cuba!
Oh, really?
Time to switch partners!
Who do you think you are?
Me? I'm Chico.
You?
- Leave me alone!
- Oh, Miss Leave-Me-Alone!
Is that the Leave-Me-Alones from Santiago or Matanzas?
Try the Leave-Me-Alones from Buzzoff-ville!
Some girls come from far away just to get a little buzz.
Be my guest!
Don't let me stop you!
Nah, I like you better than that!
Right! That explains why you're all over me.
Man, she's just what I need!
Yeah, tell me about it!
No, man, don't you get it? She's the singer we've been looking for.
With her, we'll be shoo-ins to win the contest.
Damn it, you're right!
- We've got to talk to her!
- I know where she hangs out!
- You know her?
- No, but I know where she goes.
Those Yank chicks wanna head over to the Tropicana.
Woody Herman's band is playing there.
How can I say this?
Hey guys, it's time to go!
Relax.
Wow, Chico.
- Come in, the coast is clear!
- Thanks, buddy, I owe you one.
This is the performers' entrance.
- Performers...
- Thanks.
Get lost!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, dearest music-lovers.
Please excuse the delay in tonight's main attraction due to technical difficulties.
We hope to be with you shortly.
Meanwhile, we hope you will continue to enjoy the tantalizing sounds of the
Tropicana Orchestra!
This is the best nightclub in Havana!
I'm sorry... sorry.
Are you following me?
Me following you?
What are you, the Queen of Sheba?
Then why don't you leave me alone?
Because if I leave you alone,
I know I'll never be able to live with myself.
I don't know you either and yet I feel like I've been waiting for you all my life!
- I hear you're a piano player!
- The best!
I hope you're right.
Follow me!
What's up man?
The band's piano player had an accident and he's in hospital.
Hey, wait for me!
I'm his agent.
And now, what we've all been waiting for!
Straight from New York:
Woody Herman and the Four Brothers Band!
Who are you?
Rita, at your service.
Coming.
Take it easy, man.
Ok, we get out here.
Hey.
- What do I do with these two?
- Want me to paint you a picture?
Bye!
Bebop.
Be-what?
That's the sound in New York now!
You can play with the best bands.
All the top Cubans are there.
Mario Bauza, Miguelito Valdés,
Machito. Even Chano Pozo!
Chano Pozo is now playing with the Dizzy Gillespie Band!
What's that lovely tune you are playing?
Take it down a key.
- Let me in!
- Not now. Come back later.
Who's in there?
Another one of your Yankees?
I told you to come back later!
No way!
You're planning on taking off to New York with one of them and
I want to see what the big deal is!
I see, this time your little friend's not a Yankee.
Get out of here! There's plenty of men around here! This one's mine!
Was yours!
Now he's my man!
You don't know what this guy's like.
And you don't know who you're messing with. Beat it!
Go on!
I'll show you what it means to steal a man from a woman like me!
Hey, watch those hands!
Don't touch me!
- Get your dirty hands off me!
- Bitch!
- Let me go!
- You let go first!
If I get hold of that face!
Let me go!
Don't scratch me, you bitch!
I'll kill you!
You're crazy!
Tell her to go.
Tell her to get dressed and get lost!
Juana, Juana...
Get outta here!
Ow!
Sure you don't have more girls hiding under the stairs?
Don't worry,
I'm gonna leave the door open so you can service them all!
Get off! Rita!
Let her go, Chico! Let her go!
Rita!
Hey, you, don't run so fast!
You want him?
You can have him!
He's all yours!
I'm leaving too.
Wasn't that what you wanted?
Shit!
Shit!
What gives, Chico?
You've been chosen for the competition and you don't care!
- I need a singer.
- I know a hundred.
That can sing my arrangements?
I get it.
You've fallen in love!
That's it, right?
Hey, buddy, only whites allowed.
Look, man, I just want to give a message to my sister.
If I had a sister, I'd be damned if I let her work here!
Whatever you say, you're the boss!
Ok, see you.
- Ciao!
- Ciao!
See you around, Angel.
I'll come by soon!
Good evening, Rita!
Did you lose something?
I think I just found it.
Well, that's good news.
- Got ten pesos you can spare?
- Ten?
Stick with me and you'll make much more.
Oh, really?
What's your cut?
Twenty percent.
Hey, I don't need anybody hustling me!
So, beat it!
It's been a nightmare of a night.
Rita!
Rita! Hey, wait up!
- What if she doesn't show up?
- Relax, she'll show.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because...
Look, there she is!
Coming up,
Contest Couple Number 21.
Chico and Rita!
For so long we have enjoyed
This love
Our souls got so close
That I keep your taste
But you also carry a taste of me
You got what you wanted.
Satisfied?
Of course, you guys are the perfect couple!
They announce the winners at the Fausto theater at 10 PM tonight.
- Don't let me down!
- But don't forget,
I'm only doing it for the money!
Hey, come here!
What did you tell him?
Me? Nothing. You know me,
I wouldn't breathe a word!
Wait... wait up!
- Where you headed?
- Let me give it a shot!
What are you doing, man?
You don't know the first thing about riding bikes.
I'll bring it back tonight.
Goddammit!
What are you doing here?
Is your neighborhood off-limits?
- I don't like people being nosey.
- Who does that house belong to?
Do I ask you about the floozies crawling around your place?
You telling me you live with another man?
Is that him?
I told you he'd make you suffer.
- Rita, let's just forget it.
- Ok.
I'll forget about you and you forget about me.
Come on, baby!
You mean nothing to me!
I don't know you from Adam!
Don't even think about following me!
You know what?
I'd kiss the ground you walk on if you lived in a cleaner neighborhood.
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for.
Especially our contestants.
The grand prize, as you all know, is 500 pesos plus a one-month contract at the Hotel Nacional.
And the winners of the Fourth Annual RHC
Cadena Azul Amateur Contest are...
Couple Number 21!
Chico and Rita!
A song that was a hit more than fifty years ago.
By Chico and Rita.
You're listening to "Yesterday's Melodies" on Radio Progreso.
I never meant to own you,
I was a nobody, lacking vanity
I gave you
The best of my life
You have a marvelous voice.
One of those voices that you have to listen to with your eyes closed.
Of course, in your case it would be a shame.
You see those girls over there?
I could take any one of them and make a star out of her.
They're dying for somebody to discover them.
Like I've done with you.
What's your price?
The price of success is success.
I mean real success.
And I'm not talking Havana.
I'm talking New York!
New York?
My dream!
Is that a "yes"?
It's an "of course" as in "when do we leave?".
Now you're talking!
But where's Chico's name?
Chico?
Hey, honey, how can I leave without him?
New York is full of piano players.
Chico's not just a piano player.
Chico is... well, Chico.
Wait.
Leave me alone!
Is that what you like?
Having these guys at your beck and call?
I'm sure you didn't tell him to get lost.
You were straight in there.
And where are you going with him?
Oh, let me guess.
Why settle for a shit-hole of a room when you can have a suite at the Nacional?
All settled.
I still don't see Chico's name.
Two names or none!
Chico!
Chico!
What's up?
- I'm looking for Chico.
- I didn't hear him arrive.
She hears what she wants to hear.
She says she's deaf, but she doesn't miss a thing.
- Well, you two sure keep her busy.
- They keep me up every night.
If you want to come up here, we can wait for him together.
- Pour me another!
- Ok, but this one's your last.
C'mon, man, why don't you go home and sleep it off?
Hey, Juana.
Do me a favor and take him home with you.
No problem.
Hey, baby.
Don't worry.
Mommy's gonna take good care of you.
She'll put you to bed, tuck you in...
Juana, I can walk on my own, ok?
Who loves you, baby?
Who loves you, Chico?
Exactly, who loves me, huh?
Your Juanita...
Chico.
Ramon!
So you were leaving without saying goodbye?
Do you want me to say anything to him?
Yeah.
Tell him I don't ever want to see him again!
You know something?
I never would have let you go.
It's a pity
I didn't fall in love with you.
A pity.
Ok, so we're all square!
Chico!
I know how to find Chano Pozo.
His sister gave me a letter for him.
He can make it happen for us over there in New York.
My name is Chico!
It used to be.
Chico!
Chico, get up!
Chico!
Chico, get up!
- Get up, brother!
- What's going on?
Guess what?
We're arriving!
New York!
New York!
Dammit!
Careful, bro.
Let's go. Rita should be getting ready for the first show.
- Rita Labelle?
- La-belle.
I like it. Sounds classy.
Follow me!
Come on.
For Rita Labelle?
I'll take them, thanks.
Here!
Wait.
I'll do the honors!
Scram!
"I needed to kiss you again"
What are you doing here?
Didn't Ramon tell you that
I never wanted to see you again?
- I need to talk to you.
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Why didn't you bring her?
- She means nothing to me!
That's what you said, and then I found you two making out!
Enough already!
One day you drop me, the next you come looking for me!
You think you can do what you want with me?
Rita, I know I've been a jerk, but I'm here now and I love you.
We're not... in Cuba and
I'm not the girl you used to know!
You're still the same girl to me!
Don't you realize that everything's changed?
Look at me!
That girl you reduced to tears stayed back in Havana!
Go away!
Get outta here!
Go and don't come back!
Whatever you say.
Come on, it's not the end of the world.
Hey, we're in New York!
Look... I think this is the place.
It's Charlie Parker!
Look, that one over there is Chano Pozo!
Chano Pozo!
Hey, who's the guy with the hat?
Where did you two escape from?
Did Cuba sink or something?
I was supposed to be down South right now with Dizzy Gillespie.
But you know why I'm here?
Because we're not allowed in a lot of places down there either.
We have to use the service entrance at hotels, sit in the back of buses.
There are even different bathrooms.
There are more sons of bitches there than in Cuba, man.
Shit, be careful!
Gotta keep movin'.
You did right in coming.
Machito, Mario Bauza,
Miguelito Valdes, Arsenio...
They're all here.
People are crazy about Cuban music.
All they wanna dance is mambo, conga...
Our time has come!
Let's get high!
- What the hell is this?
- Let me see.
Shit!
I think they sold you oregano!
- Oregano?
- Oregano!
Gimme that!
That son of a bitch!
- C'mon, man, let's go!
- Where?
If you think you can cheat me, you better think again!
Listen up, Cabito!
Nobody cheats Chano Pozo!
Tell your friends.
Nobody screws with Chano Pozo!
Here, rule number one is: respect!
Your beers are gonna get warm!
It's party time! Cuba!
New York!
What's that Bebop shit?
Cu-bop!
That's what it is!
Mantecaaa!
Chano!
Chano...
Chano!
Chano Pozo,
To your memory I sing this rumba as a tribute to your work
May God take you in His bosom and offer you His goodness
May the Holy Spirit help you rest in peace
Chano Pozo, Chano Pozo,
Cuba and the rumba mourn for you
Those juicy contracts will be coming soon. Trust me.
This is just to keep you finely tuned.
What now?
Another birthday for white kids?
It's a private party on Park Avenue for some big fish.
I think a Hollywood producer is gonna be there.
At least, you'll eat well!
- Where did you leave the car?
- We'll go in yours!
We'll do what?
Kidney beans!
Eat, baby, eat!
- That's delicious!
- Sit down, sit down!
It's an honor to have you right here in my kitchen!
You look like a Yankee!
But I still like kidney beans.
I've seen you in magazines.
You're headed for Hollywood, right?
Aren't you tired of playing Miss Charming?
Don't you like me sitting by your side eating kidney beans?
I like it so much it frightens me.
- What are you frightened of?
- Same thing as you.
Why should I be frightened?
Of listening to your heart for once.
Of leaving your cage and not finding your way back.
You really believe that?
Come with me!
Don't tell me you're gonna leave without finishing.
Yes!
Are you coming or not?
Oh, Mary, Mother of God, what is this?
Easy does it!
Careful!
- Shit! Damn American cars!
- Careful!
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, nothing!
- So wipe that smirk off your face!
- Ok.
Rita Martinez.
What are you mumbling about?
Rita...
"I needed to kiss you again"
Yeah, same ol' shit!
Yes, yes, yes.
Don't tell me that horse finally won?
What's its name?
Do you remember that investor I told you about?
No.
Well, our hard times are over, Chico.
From now on,
- straight to the top!
- Maybe you are.
So are you.
Look.
- What is this?
- It's a contract.
Dizzy Gillespie needs a piano player for his band.
Tomorrow you fly to Europe.
A month in Paris and then a tour!
The opportunity of a lifetime, Chico!
Sorry, dear, for being late.
- I had no-one to take care of Lily.
- Lily?
My puppy. She's like a baby.
She can't be left alone.
Are you sure you don't want to go for a stroll?
No! I've been told this film is really good!
Oh, c'mon.
The music is so lovely, and she's such a good performer!
Hi, Lily!
Like it?
Another blackout!
What do you need light for at this ungodly hour?
Go to sleep! Tomorrow we've gotta work for our country.
He was reading Granma and the lights went out just when it was getting interesting.
I dream
I love you as I did yesterday.
Sweet scents are reborn and come into play
My soul takes flight and recalls moments divine
Echoes of kisses, two destinies, yours and mine
Rita!
- What a surprise!
- Where is he?
I need to talk to him!
Please Rita, don't go looking for problems, just when things are going so well.
- For who?
- For all of us!
And above all, for you!
You can't be fighting with Ron every night.
Don't you get it?
I can't stand him!
But, you mean everything to him!
Yeah, I'm his biggest investment!
- True, but he made you what you are.
- Yeah.
A miserable wretch!
And who could make you happy, Rita?
Who?
You mind telling me who the hell Lily is?
Lily?
Yeah, Lily!
What's wrong with you?
Are you deaf?
I met her in Paris.
She used to sit by my side whenever I played the piano.
You must have been very fond of her to write a beautiful song like that.
Well... who hasn't been in love at least once in their life?
What happened to her?
She passed away.
I'm sorry.
She also used to like to lick my hand.
Bitch!
She was a tiny dog, silly.
It'd be better ifwe didn't see each other for a few days.
New Years Eve, I debut at the Hotel Pelican in Vegas.
Come the day before...
Have you thought about your career?
About your future?
Future, what future?
The future never gave me anything!
All my hopes are set on the past.
I haven't seen that expression for years!
I'm tying the knot!
Congratulations!
When?
New Year's Eve in Las Vegas.
Are you sure no-one by that name was on the plane to Vegas?
Ok.
Thanks.
What were you expecting?
He did it before!
And good ol' Ron is always there for me, right?
Stop drinking!
Don't spoil it all now!
Your passport will be withheld until further notice.
What?
Chico?
They've cancelled tonight's show!
What?
They don't like this kind of music any more.
Jazz is considered imperialist.
It's the enemy's music!
If you wanna keep on working, you'll have to join the Party.
- That's it!
- But, that's crazy!
Viva Fidel!
And then there was light, brothers.
Now they're screwing with us in the middle of the night.
So the whole point is to protest.
The light goes out, complain, it comes back on...
Comrade, it's just that I was dreaming about...
Well, you know about who.
Who?
About you, baby, who else?
I gotta tell the world about it.
Chico!
Chico!
Chico!
Piss off!
There are some gringos asking about you!
What are you saying?
That singer and her producers.
You know that young singer, man, the pretty one, that big star!
Let them find somebody else.
I'm not a musician any more.
They know that but when they heard you were still alive, they went nuts!
Who said I'm alive?
It's been years since
I've been this close to one.
Maestro...
Don't call me Maestro.
Call me Chico.
I've got all your records.
How's it possible that a girl as young and pretty as you can own all those old records?
That's my favorite song.
I've always dreamed of recording it.
"Lily"!
Lily...
I thought...
What?
That I'd never see you again.
I've been waiting
47 years for you.
Waiting for you everyday to knock on this door.
And, just like that, you're here.
No call, no nothing.
You haven't changed.
You look as beautiful as ever.
Oh, Chico!
All this time... you were... you were here?
They were nice to me.
They let me have this room in exchange for my doing the house-keeping.
May I come in? to Bebo

Lovingly cooked by BakeMaster
The story you are about to see, has been told before.
A lot.
And now we are going to tell it, again.
But different.
It's about two star crossed lovers, kept apart by a big feud.
No one knows how this feud started, but it's all quite entertaining.
Unfortunately, before we begin.
There is a rather long boring prologue, which I will read to you now.
Two households.
Both alike in dignity.
In fair Verona.
Where we lay our scene.
From ancient grudge.
Break to new mutiny.
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two...AHHH.
Ah Mrs. Montague. How you just love to ruin my day.
My Sisters dear cardigan Mr. Capulet, it suits you.
-Feisty old hag.
-Grumbly old codger.
Oink...oink
Oh, great.
I got one! I got one!
I got one! I got one!
(Moans) Oh.
Hey, Winston. Throw us the ball.
Huh, Tybalt!
Hold on. Blues are at it again.
Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick.
Lady Blueberry
Your tulips are looking a little limp this year, aren't they.
Oh, I don't like what you're incinerating.
The proper word is 'insinuating'.
Illiterate.
I am not illiterate.
My parents were married!
Benny, come on. Let's go give those Reds another lesson on how it's done.
'Shroom all clear?
Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
Gnomeo, it's your mum.
-Oh no. Just get this out into the Alley.
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.
-Gnomeo, I can't..
-Have you ever seen,
...our beautiful, beautiful garden, from this angle?
Oh. Oh yes, it's beautiful. The Wisteria.
That tree was your father's pride and joy.
May he rest in pieces.
Oh, how you remind me of him.
Oh which is why I wanted to say.
I know, I know. My chores.
-Gnomeo...
-Edging trimming, planting consider it all done.
-Done, done, it's all like it....
-Gnomeo!
...done.
All I wanted to say was...
Good luck.
Thanks, mom.
Go out there and show them we
Blues are better than any Reds.
Red, I hate the word.
Wow.
A Cupids Arrow orchid.
Oh, Juliet!
Oh!
Whoa!
Hiya Dad. You won't believe what I found.
Oh, you want to get smashed?
A flower that will put that blue garden to shame.
-Just across the alley.
-This feud business, is none of your concern.
And as leader of this garden it's up to me...
Uh, I am a Red after all.
Oh, you're just as impulsivated as your mother was.
Bless her to bits.
Now, back where you belong.
I  can't just stay tucked away on this pedestal all my life.
Don't you see.
When will you realize you're delicate.
I'm not delicate.
She's definitely not delicate.
Stubborn girl.
Oh, right.
Delicate, hmm.
I'll show him who's delicate.
Blue Gnomes chanting: Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
Red Gnomes chanting: Tybalt, Tybalt, Tybalt.
-Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

*Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)*
-On your marks.

*It's getting late have you seen my mates.
Ma tell me when the boys get here.*
*It's seven o'clock and I want to rock.
Want to get a belly full of beer.*
*My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys.
And my old lady she don't care.*

A handful of grease in her hair.*
*Whoa, don't give us none of your aggravation.
We had it with your discipline.*

*Saturday...*
-(Laughs)
-You're the greatest boss. The greatest by far.
All together: The greatest, the greatest by far.
Oh please, please my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.
-A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
-Huh?
All together: A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
-All together: Umh!
-Well Benny.
I didn't think it was possible. But your mouth is getting even bigger than your hat.
Tybalt, you just crossed the line.
Yeah, the 'finish' line.
Adios, loser.
Hey, come on out and fight, like a Gnome.
No body won't come out.
-You'd better do something.
-This can't go on.
Well if he won't come out.
-I guess we'll just have to go in.
-(Benny gasps in shock)
The Red garden. No one's ever been in there.
Then I say. It's about time someone did.
And payback is gonna be fun.
'Shroom, lets go kick some grass.
This mission into Red garden territory, is gonna require maximum stealth.
Well you won't get much stealthier than this.
Hello.
Mumbles: I got one.
Mumbles: I got one.
-Swim away , be free.
-Thank you.
(Whines) Oh.
Mumbles: I got one.
Oh, all this for some daffy flower.
Yes, it's the only way I'll ever be taken seriously around here.
And I'm going to need you to cover me.
If my dad asks.
Just tell him I'm washing my hair.
I'm washing my hair. I don't have hair.
He'll know it's a lie.
-No, my hair.
-Got it. I'm washing your hair.
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.
I'll be quick.
-(Gasps in fright)
-Growling.
-(Barking)
-(Juliet screams)
Out, out!
Ben stop, over here boy.
Wow! That was quick.
I'm to easy to see.
I'm going to need some kind of disguise.
Oooo, a new outfit.
I'm on it.
Here.
That is cute.
Give it a turn.
Ah, huh. Ah huh.
Nice junk in the trunk.
Now go get your flower.
Uh, maybe a tad less florescent pink?
How much less?
Try black.
Aaaaaaah!
Trust me, nobody is going to pay you any attention in that.
Then it's perfect.
Oooo,
I'm going in.
Take care.
I'm telling your Dad you're doing your hair.
Let's play a game.
I'm thinking of a movie.
It's a...it's one word.
And it starts with a...'spider'.
All: Is it, Spiderman?
Oh you're good, okay.
Great, I love going commando.
Shh, I know, just the key.
Shhh.
Okay, I have another one.
Two words.
The first word is 'Spiderman'.
All: Spiderman Two?
Okay, who's cheating?
Benny, give me the paint.
Benny?
No!
-Benny!
Benny!
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Tybalt!
-Get them you idiots.
Run for it, now.
Where did he go?
He's in the begonia's.
-Well, do I look like a begonia?
-No, more like a pansy.
Find him!
-Not here.
-Not here, either.
Nothing but Pansies here.
Come on.
Hold on.
Whoa, whoooa!
-Hey, Benny
-What?
-See you on the other side.
-Gnomeo!
Ah, ha, ha.
Hmm.
I wish I could stay but...
...gotta fly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoooa!
Huh!
*Elton John, Lady Gaga: Hello, Hello*
*Feel I'm feeling light*
*I like to see the sights.*
*Ain't life a many splendored thing?*
*Ducking up and down*
*All these crazy sights and sounds*
*Bounce around like puppets on a string.*
*Never gonna find, anything to change my mind.*
*Famous last lines of a fool*
*Just when you think.*
*Your chain is just one link.*
*Something comes to tip you off your stool.*
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*
*My, my, my what have we here?*
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*
*I'm not alone, it's good to know.*
*Someone's out there saying hello.*
*Heeeellooooo.*
Um, you're probably wondering what I'm doing on the roof of your greenhouse.
It's just that, well I thought no one lived here.
Yeah, they don't. I mean I don't.
This isn't my garden.
Oh, well that's good.
Because I just came to get that Orchid.
-Oh, this?
-Yes.
I don't know. I think I'm going to have to keep ahold of this one.
What? But I saw it first.
So why don't you just hand it over.
Well I grabbed it first.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
But if you want it.
-Come and get it.
-All right.
Thanks.
Aaaah!
-Nice greenhouse, hey.
-Oh yeah. You should see it from here.
What, and miss this view?
-Who's your Gno-me.
-Who's your Gno-me?
Whoa!
Who's your Gno-me now?
*Hello, Hello. Hello, Hello*
-Hey!
*My, my, my what have we here?*
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*
*Hello, Hello.
Hello, Hello*
*I'm not alone, it's good to know*
*Someone's out there saying, hello*
*Hello.*
*-Helloooooooooooooooooooooo
...................................-Heeeello.*
*Hello, hello.*
*Heeeellooooo.*
*Hello, hellooooooooooo.*
Oh no, he's a blue.
Not a blue.
Juliet. Your not off of your pedestal.
What are you doing out here?
I'm...oh, well I can ask you the same question, Tybalt.
We're looking for a blue Gnome.
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.
Got a scratch, right here.
And his name's Gnomeo.
You haven't seen him, have you?
Uhhhhooo, um.
Uhh, he sounds awful no.
I...I...uh...certainly haven't seen him.
I haven't seen him at all.
Well lucky you.
Come on, let's get inside.
Juliet.
A red.
Why of all things, did she have to be a red?
Sooo, where is the oh so important, life changing orchid?
Um...
Um...
What, what orchid?
What?
Hmmm?
Shut up!
You met a boy.
What? No! Well maybe...
Sort of, um...yes!
Yes I did.
I need details.
And go slowly, is he totally gorgeous?
-Totally.
-Does he have a nice rotund belly?
Well let's call it sturdy.
And his uh..(Whistles up)
-His hat, is um..
-Big and pointy?
And, you know I suppose in a certain light.
You might say it looks sort of...
...blue.
Blue.
Ah, this is one of your little jokes.
No, I don't get it.
(Gasps) Oh flipping, flaming Dora's sheep, you cannot take with a blue.
Shh, shush Nanette, just zip it.
Zzzzip.
Oh Juliet, this is fantastic!
-Is it?
-It's doomed.
-What?
-A red and a blue.
It just can't be.
So it's a doomed love.
And that's the best kind.
You'll never see him again.
And then one day when he dies, you'll be all,
"Oh, my true love".
"I only saw him once".
I'll only see...what do you mean?
What are you talking about, once?
I'll only see him once.
How romantically tragic.
Your love is doomed.
Your love is dead.
Your love is doomed.
Your love is dead.
It's doomed.
-It's dead.
-I'll only see him...once?
Dooomed!
I've never seen Lord Redbrick so riled up.
We have to find Gnomeo.
Let's split up.
(Sighs) I wish I could quit ya.
Both: Hmm.
Oh well.
Let's go fishing.
All right, mate.
Go find, Gnomeo.
Doomed!
Dead!
Doomed, dead.
Doomed, dead.
Oh, Gnomeo.
Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo.
To never see each other again?
Why must you wear a blue hat?
Why couldn't it be red like my father, or... green like a leprechaun, or... or purple like, um... like uh, like some weird guy.
I mean what's in a Gnome?
Because you're blue my father sees red, and because I'm red I'm feeling blue.
Oh at any rate, that shouldn't be the thing to keep us apart.
-Should it?
-No, no! It shouldn't.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
Oh my giddy aunt, did you just hear all of that?
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know, um...
I came here, to...
Well. I don't know I just wanted to see you again.
Are you crazy?
If dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio.
Find me, are you kidding?
Stealth is my middle name.
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
-Turn it off.
I'm trying.
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
*Welcome to our tropical hideaway,*
-Do something.
-The button's stuck.
*If we weren't in the show starting right away,*
Ah, Juliet!
*All together! In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
Come on man, off.
There's somebody behind you!
'Shroom!
Whoa, whoa...whoaaa!
Juliet! What's the ....
Oooo, you look like a fun guy.
Excuse me, little help here.
My dad's coming.
So, you must be, Gnomeo.
Lovely to meet you.
Even though it's seconds, before you're discovered and killed.
-Quick, hide.
-Juliet!
I told you before, no music in the grotto after ten o'clock.
What's going on here?
Um, It was a...
Um, ...I saw a squirrel.
And he...he...
...dropped his nuts.
Yes, nuts.
The size of boulders.
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.
Well, okay. But no mucking about.
Especially not tonight.
We've been attacked.
By a blue!
And if I ever get my hands on the blue?
He'll be sleeping with the fishes.
Now I'm not a man who is rounded up easily.
Lord Redbrick, I've been having problems with my...(Mumbles incoherently)
-Your what?
-(Mumbles incoherently)
I guess this isn't the best time to talk.
It's not ideal.
-But I...
-Just go.
-Please go.
-...just came here to say I.
-Um...
-What?
What did you want?
Oh, sorry!
Juliet, is there something wrong with the pond?
The pond? No, what this pond?
No it's fine.
I mean it's just as pondy as ever. (Laughs)
Oh my gosh, what is that thing over there?
What? What was it?
-That thing, over there.
-What did it look like?
-Oh, it looked like a really, uh.
-Okay. Goodbye then, off you go.
Thanks for popping by. Goodnight sweet prince, and flights of angels, or pigeons or sparrows, whatever.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
(Dejected) Oh!
(Hopeful) Oh.
Nanette, where's Gnomeo?
-Is he gone?
-Yep, gone forever.
What?
Whoa!
I think you'll find this 'does' actually belong to you.
Thank you.
-I can't go.
-I know  how you feel.
No, really. I'm stuck.
So, uh, heh...
Can I see you again tomorrow?
Yes, but not here.
Back in the old Lawrence place then?
-Noon?
-Not soon enough.
I can do 11:45.
Done.
That frog was right.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
-Thanks Nanette.
-You know he's going to ditch you, when he finds how much you weigh.
Shroom, you see this face?
It's a happy Gnome face.
Now come here.
Come on.
Outrage, infamy!
The gardening gloves are off then, are they?
You, wrecking my mower.
Dear lady, you are insane in the brain.
I never thought that you'd stoop to such a level.
Oh, and by the way, kindly stop stealing my underwear.
In your dreams, you jacked off cabbage.
Oh, how could she do this to Tybalts wishing well?
Mmm, my sweet little flower boy.
Why would anyone ever pick on you?
Who thinks I should order the best, new lawnmower?
Money can buy.
Why would anyone do this to, Tybalt?
All: Because nobody likes him.
-(Growls)
-So what are we going to do?
Find their weak spot.
Then what are we going to do?
Damage.
Lot's and lot's of damage.
Right.
Mess with me will you, Capulet.
I'll show him what, that old pompous.
It's not over, not by a long shot.
Yeah, uh, right. What have we got here?
Show the world the mighty web ....
Oh, no. No, no, not good.
Pick one.
-Yes, that one.
-No.
Oh, yes that one.
What's this?
Are you losing the war in your garden?
Well brother maybe it's time for a secret weapon.
Terrafirminator!
It's the most useless, 500 horse power... ground dominating piece of hardware, the world has ever seen.
TERRAFIRMINATOR!!
It's unnecessarily volatile.
Now with 75% more power!
It clears...clears.
It digs...digs.
It mulch,...Mulch
Your lawn will be afraid to grow.
Terrafirminator!
Get the weapon that plans destruction!
(Laughs) That one.
Oh my.
Pick, pick that one.
Please, please pick that one.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That's a bit in-your-face.
This is more my speed.
Oh, not the Kitten Clipper.
Oh, no.
*Elton John and Kiki Dee:
Don't go breaking my heart*
Definitely not.
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I couldn't if I tried.*
*Oh honey if I get restless.
Baby you're not that kind.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.
You take the weight off of me.*
*Oh Honey when you knocked on my door.
Ooo, I gave you my key*
*Wooo, hoo Nobody knows it.*
*When I was down*
*I was your clown*
*Right from the start.
I gave you my heart.*
*Whoooooa oh, I gave you my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I won't go breaking your heart*
*Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my...*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my...*
*I won't go breaking your heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my.
I won't go breaking your heaaaaaaart.*
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*
Juliet. There you are.
-Hi dad.
-I've been ruminating about our little discussion yesterday.
-But I was just...
-What you need is companionship.
-Huh?
-Someone to look after you.
Who'll keep you safe.
-What?
-You know Paris, don't you.
Yes, yes of course, why?
Well he's come to pay you a visitation.
-Dad!
-All right, all right.
No one will ever say I don't know when I'm not wanted.
-Toodles.
-Uh, got something for you.
Here it is, gypsaphilla.
Lovely, what does it mean?
It means love woodchuck.
Although ironically it grows better in a clay soil.
It's weird isn't it.
You think you got it down and bram, you do some readings and it turns out it's clay soil.
Even though you thought it was a level of chalk.
Weird.
-Right, well it's been terribly nice meeting you.
-Where are you going, stop, no.
You can obviously do what you want.
But my point is it's surely a bit, rude to leave me on the first date.
-First date?
-Yeah, and I thought what does a boyfriend.
-Boyfriend?
-Get his girlfriend.
-Girlfriend?
-Oooo, this is good.
A small token of my affection.
Oh, wow!
Juliet, do you realize what this is?
It is my own hybrid, a foxglove and buttercup.
Oh, a love triangle.
Which I call, Foxcup.
And you. I never knew you were such a devil.
Well, I mean I guess I've got my dark side, sure.
Hey there, Juliet.
What a name, it's a great name.
Goes with your, eyes.
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?
That's a killer, man.
Yeah, uh, no. You're looking cool.
Yeah, so how's it going with you, baby?
-Oh I'm fine, Baby. How are you?
-Gaaahh!
Uh, (uneasy laugh) never better.
Do you think anyone heard that?
(whispers) There's nobody here.
(Whispers) Then why are you whispering?
(Softly) Why are you whispering.
Oh, look at that.
Guess we're done with the whispering thing.
It's a 1950's Macalister Ranger.
Let's start her up.
Yeah, okay.
Check out the power on this beauty.
She's empty.
Bingo!
-Hey, try this.
-Thanks.
-Is that you?
-Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
It's me, too!
What was that?
I have no idea.
Okay, whatever you are.
Come out, slowly.
I have a loaded stic...uh, weapon.
And I'm not afraid to use it.
Do you think I scared it?
Oh definitely, I know I'm scared.
Look at that baby, huh.
Watch me now.
(Scats) Ooo...uh...ooo....aah.
Oh by the way, thanks for finding my leg.
And setting me free.
I love you!
Do you know what it's like to be trapped for thirty years?
All alone, by yourself.
No one for to talk at.
Hola, Featherstone, como esta usted? (How are you?)
Ah, bueno, Featherstone, how's the other leg?
I don't know Featherstone, remember
I don't have it.
You see, I'm not exactly terrific company, am I?
Sorry but, we didn't think anybody lived here.
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.
-What if he follows us?
-Then our parents find out.
Oh no. Nanette was right, we're doomed.
Oh, oh, oh. Up, up, up.
You cannot ever pull the wools over these beady eyes.
Oh, ho. I think that you two are on a date.
Both: Date! No, no not dating.
-Fighting, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it is. To the death.
-Mortal enemies here.
-Yeah, don't you see it?
-He's a blue.
-She's a red.
And I'm pink!
Who cares?
Anyway, I got to ask.
Why are you bringing her to a dumpy place like this?
Ohh, I know, I know.
Un momento, I'll be right back.
Juliet, wait.
Oh, here it comes.
I'm to delicate, right?
No, no I was going to say.
Don't hold back, let her rip.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
GO!
Ta da!
Whoo, look at that.
This is definite improvement.
Fantastic penmanship, too.
But you know...
We still got to do something about these weeds.
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.
Well I don't know. A weed by any other name is still a weed.
Go on, make a wish.
And then blow on it.
It's kinda hard with a beak, huh?
Kinda pass you out, huh?
I going to sit down now.
I've got a confession to make.
I've never actually driven a mower.
No, you're a natural.
Well my dad, he's a little over protective.
You know this is crazy, right?
Yeah.
I just never imagined that I could fall for a red.
Oh and me a blue.
No way.
My whole life my mom raised me to hate you guys. You reds.
So, this could never work.
Could it?
Well a red and a blue.
It just can't be.
Can it?
Look it's kinda like snowing, but it's not.
Oh baby, you know I getting into this now.
See the trick is to go like... (Blows sharp)
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...(Blow's short)
Ah, I wish that we could all come back.
And do this tomorrow.
And uh, I promise.
Your secret is safe with me.
Well, should we?
I can do 11:45.
Not soon enough.
Oomph! Hey Shroom, what's up buddy.
Careful there, you're going to kick something.
What's eating you?
Huh?
(Crying) How?
How?
-Mom
-So beautiful...Gnomeo.
How could this have happened?
Well, where were you?
I was...
I was nowhere.
Don't worry mom, I'll make it up to you.
How, Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed, the most beautiful thing we blues have.
Your father planted her.
We raised her from a seedling.
Those blasted Reds, come on.
We'll make them pay.
Every last one of them.
Every last one?
*It's a little bit runny.*
*This pesticide.*
-My dad can really pick them.
-Can he just.
-Oh, this is painful.
-Oh, sweet torture.
*Don't have much money.*
*But, but if I did.*
*I'd buy a big house where.*
*We both could live.*
*If I was a sculptor...*
-Ooo, sexy, sexy.
*A man selling stuff for plants it's called, Miracle grow.*
Uh, Gnomeo!
Okay.
Then we go need a bunch of coconuts.
Wha?
Juliet no, wait.
I...I um...
A blue, a blue!
-Abort, abort the mission.
-What?
-What happened.
-Ah, the muzzle jammed, let's go.
Gnomeo!
Hmmm.
Such a big hat, on such a small gnome.
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?
Let's take this baby out into the alley.
Then what are going to do?
We're gonna have a smashing time.
Oh come on, Juliet.
It's  not as bad as all that.
Is that your big move on a second date?
You wine them, dine them and spray them with weed killer?
You got to admit, it is original.
Hola, my fellow funsters are back already.
I mean be reasonable.
I didn't have a choice...
...after incident 'Wisteria'.
How do you think that looks?
Just a toilet in the middle of a yard, with nothing growing out of it.
Oh you blues are so infuriating.
Wait a minute, us blues?
So, what you guys want to do?
-Featherstone, we're busy.
-Come on guys.
-Let us have some-a fun.
-Let me tell you something about you reds.
-Us reds?
-Oh, can't we all just laugh about this?
I know the little mushroom can.
Both shout: Featherstone!
-We're in the middle of something.
-You wouldn't understand.
-We're talking.
-All right, so just leave us alone.
Right,
I'm sorry.
You know sometimes I get a little over excited.
Especially having such great new friends.
Like you and...
But I know I can be a bit...
...much.
Wait, Featherstone.
-Hey.
-Come back, Featherstone. I'm sorry.
I may not be a smart bird.
But I know what love is.
*Elton John: Love builds a garden*
*You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say*
*Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face*
*A smile that spoke to me in oh so many ways*
*Then*
*We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again*
*But a frost, it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die*
*There's only so much you can do, to keep some things alive*
*That love built a garden.
Grew it from the ground up*
*Each one of us knowing, every inch of it was us*
*We pulled it all together, hoping and believing.*
*That love built this garden for the two of us to dream in.*
You know, other people's hate, destroyed my love.
And...
I couldn't do nothing about it.
But you...
...you can.
You know I think that crazy pink plastic bird might be right.
What if we never went back?
Never go back?
But what about my Dad?
And Nanette and the red garden?
You see the truth is, over there, we're enemies.
But here, here we're a matching pair.
Juliet, will you stay here, and build a garden with me?
I'd love to.
GNOMEO!
What are you doing?
Benny, listen mate, I can explain.
BENNY!
Benny, wait.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little big hat, Benny.
Mess with the red garden, will ya.
BENNY!
NO!
Ooo, that felt good.
Oh no!
Oh, no.
Tybalt!
A hat for a hat.
Gnomeo, no!
You wouldn't attack an unarmed Gnome, would ya?
Sucker.
Pity.
Tybalt, the wall.
You don't I'm going to fall for that old trick, do ya?
Ha, ha, what wall?
Ut oh, that wall.
Blast!
What was that?
What's happened?
Tybalt?
Tybalt.
Tybalt?
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.
(Gasps) Ooo.
Smash him hat.
-No!
-What is the meaning of all this constipation?
Gnomeo smashed, Tybalt.
No, he didn't do it.
-Juliet.
-Gnomeo.
-Mom.
-A gnome for a gnome.
-Catch.
-What?
Smash him back.
Run, Gnomeo.
Run!
Stop, stop that.
Revenge!
Whup!
Woo...
-What were you doing?
-No!
-I love him.
-What?
Doomed.
Oh, someone do something.
Gnomeo!
Are you mad?
There's been enough smashing for one day.
Now get her on her pedestal.
And keep her there.
(Sobs) He's gone.
(Crying) Oh Gnomeo.
(Sobs) No, no not Gnomeo.
Let's get you home now.
Oh, my poor, poor boy.
Hmm?
Stay, stay!
Good boy.
Shroom!
Shroooooom!
No!
-A gnome?
-Yeah, Mate.
It looks like your sister.
You left me no choice, Juliet.
I've lost your mother.
I am not going to lose you.
(Sadly) Mmmm.
Hmm?
Psst, psst, bunnies, fall in.
All right, we've got to avenge, Gnomeo.
Here's what we're going to do.
Now...(Mumbles softly)
No, not now Shroom.
Right, got it.
Okay, okay you're a mushroom
Dude I coming.
What, what you trying to say?
Sooo, little Timmy has fallen down the well?
No, did he jump?
Little Mustafa?
Little Richard, what?
Oh, a teapot fell down the well.
Well what?
Oh, no.
You say Gnomeo fell down the well?
No, little mushroom.
He was a smashed.
I saw it myself.
What, you want I still to follow you some more. Okay fine.
I go with you, I go.
Well what this has to do with,
Gnomeo, I don't know.
And where is this well that everyone has fallen into?
Psst.
Oink, oink.
Ready?
Hmm?
Huh, oooh, hello.
Whoa!
Hmm?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Terrafirminator!
Are you losing the war in your garden?
-Never!
-Well brother, maybe it's time for a secret weapon.
-Bring it on.
-TERRAFIRMINATOR!
This one's for Gnomeo!
Meoooooww!
Hah, hah, yeah.
Huh?
(Whines) Come on.
Ohhh!
Oh, ruddy purse.
Call me.
So Juliet and me we decided that we wouldn't carry on this horrible feud.
It was great, but then my best mate Benny found out.
And Tybalt, who's a right piece of bad gnome.
Crashed a trowel through Bennies hat.
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt and he ended up getting smashed.
Which wasn't my fault.
Then I was chased down.
Exiled.
Stuck up here on your head.
Far away from, Juliet.
Extraordinary.
Your story,
It does put me in mind of another.
-It does?
-Oh indeed, yes.
There are remarkable similarities.
What happens?
Did they get back together then?
Get back together?
Um, no.
Not exactly.
What exactly do you mean?
-Well now, it really is quite good.
-Whoa, whoa!
-She feigns her death.
-Whoa!
He finds her.
Thinks her dead.
Takes his own life.
She wakes, finds him dead.
Takes her life, both dead!
Exium omnis, the end, curtain!
Standing ovation.
Bravo, bravo!
Author, author!
What did you say?
They both die?
What kind of an ending is that?
My dear boy, this is a tragedy.
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish.
-Rubbish?
-There's got to be a better ending than that.
Well I suppose that he could have made it back in time to prevent disaster.
But I like the whole death part better.
Oh dear.
Whoo hooo!
Featherstone.
One word.
Plastic.
How'd you find me?
Shroom!
He sniffed you out, and he doesn't have a nose.
Not yet.
Yeah, I knew I could count on you, you little button head.
What is it, boy?
Oh he hasn't stopped.
Yakity, yakity, yak.
He's been going on and on and on since the accident.
Chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers....
Juliet's in danger.
No, that's not it.
Juliet's in danger!
-Told you so.
-Come on, boys.
I've got to get back to Juliet, and save her.
That's what he said, but she was dead before he got home.
We'll see about that.
Whoa...
Tada!
-Benny.
-What do you think, Lady B.?
This baby is fully equipped.
Equipped for what?
It has settings for edging, trimming, mulching, and revenge!
Do it, Benny.
Do anything it takes.
Make them rule the day they destroyed my son.
Unleash the gods of war.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Ah, no, no!
Ohh.
Oh, no!
Go', blimey!
Oh, no.
ATTACK!
Counter attack!
Counter, counter attack.
Wwww, whoa, whoooa, whoooa!
All: Ah me, no, no, no!
Nyah, nyah!
I got one.
Thank you.
(Moans) Ohhh.
Not, the dolphin.
Oh...ah...oh...no!
Nooooo!
Paris.
Wa...watch out!
Gentlemen, I suggest we put our heads together.
Charge!
Oh, no, no, nooo!
Yee haw!
Cannonball!
Right!
What?
Juliet!
You're alive.
-Come with me.
-Okay
Oh, no.
Gnomeo!
Would you like to complete destruction now?
Destruction in progress.
Come on, come on, come on!
Oh, Juliet!
Oh, my son. It can't be.
Target locked.
She's going to blow!
Get back, get back.
Huh!
-Huh.
-Huh.
-Huh!
-Huh!
It's no use, go.
Go.
I'm not going anywhere.
Told you so.
-Huh!
-Oh!
(Sadly sighs) Oh.
Huh?
It's okay, I'm okay.
Ewww!
I'm sorry about your son.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
I was just trying to keep her safe.
And, now...
The whole thing, is my fault.
Our fault.
-This feud.
-Is over.
*Tiiiiki, tiiiki, tiikii, tiki rooom.*
*The tiiiiki, tiiki, tiki, tiiiki, room.*
*The birds...flowers croon. Tiki, tiki, tiki room.*
I don’t' know about you.
But, I think this ending is much better.
-Good afternoon, witch.
-Nitwit.
Both: AAAAAHHHH!
*"Crocodile Rock"*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaaaaaaa.*
*I remember when rock was young.*
*Gnomeo and Juliet had so much fun.*
*Holding hands and skimming stones.*
*Had their own gold Chevy and a place of their own.*
*But the biggest kick they ever got*
*Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock*
*While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock*
*They were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock, hey!*
*Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still*
*They never knew me a better time and I guess I never will*
*Eh! Everybody is feeling right
Because we gonna dance all night*
*And the Crocodile Rocking is something out of sight*
*Yeah, yeah, yeah.*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, laaaaa.*
*-Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.
-..........................Crocodile rockin.*
*-Crocodile rockin'
Laaaaaaaa, la, la,*
*-Ooo, a rock, rock, rockin',
-la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaa.
-Crocodile rockin'*
Oo, thank you.
KUNG FU PANDA-2 (2011)
Long ago, in ancient China,
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.
They brought great joy and prosperity to the city
for they had invented fireworks.
But their son, Lord Shen,
saw darker power in the fireworks.
What had brought colour and joy
could also bring darkness and destruction.
Shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer.
She foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path,
he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white.
The young lord set out to change his fate.
But what he did next only sealed it.
Shen returned to his parents full of pride.
But in their faces, he saw only horror.
He was banished from the city forever.
But Shen swore revenge.
Someday he would return
and all of China would bow at his feet.
It's almost done, Lord Shen, but we've run out of metal.
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!
China will be mine.
And then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five!
And they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever!
Enough talk. Let's fight!
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!
You can hear the Dragon Warrior training right now!
Thirty-three. Stop him!
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!
How is he doing that with his face?
Thirty-eight bean buns!
Yes! New record! You monster!
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.
Do it.
No problem!
Yeah!
Give me a minute.
Yeah!
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!
Your training has paid off.
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!
You'll save those for me, right?
Flippety-do.
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Master Shifu.
Master Shifu, what do we got?
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.
I need to get something done, you know what I mean?
What are you doing?
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.
Awesome!
How did you do that?
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.
Every master must find his path to inner peace.
Some choose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this...
...without the slightest taste of food or water.
Or?
Some find it through pain and suffering, as I did.
Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior was the worst day of my life.
By far.
Nothing else came close.
It was the worst, most painful, mind-destroying, horrible moment...
- OK.
...I have ever experienced.
But once I realised the problem was not you, but within me,
I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe.
So that's it? I just need inner peace?
My innards are already super, super peaceful, so all I need to do is just get this thing going.
Inner peace, you're going down.
Now show me what you were doing there with your feet.
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.
Danger.
Tell those musicians to start playing some action music because it is on.
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master inner peace as soon as I get back.
No snack stops this time.
Snack stops.
Wait, are you serious?
Get all the metal you can find!
Grab the metal!
Help, help, help, help. Help!
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.
Oh, no.
Wings of Justice!
The Dragon Warrior!
A panda? That's impossible.
My fist hungers for justice.
That was my... fist.
- Get 'em!
- Come on!
Take that!
Po! Incoming!
Thanks, Mantis!
Tigress, Double Death Strike!
Feet of Fury!
Tigress! Monkey!
Viper! Mantis!
Bunny! What?
Oh, sorry.
Help!
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!
Is everyone OK?
That was awesome!
I got this.
Po!
Chew on that, tubby!
Help.
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?
I think I saw...
I think...
I gotta go.
Thank you. Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.
If you need anything, just ask.
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?
He doesn't work here any more.
He's busy out there protecting the Valley.
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.
Po!
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.
In honour of my son, free tofu dessert for everybody!
With purchases.
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.
Have you lost weight? I can almost put my wings around you.
Ah, well, maybe a little.
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.
I had this crazy vision.
I think I saw my mom and me, as a baby.
Mom? A baby?
- Dad?
- What...?
How do I say this?
Where did I come from?
Well, you see, son, baby geese come from a little egg.
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.
I know it's not.
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.
OK.
You might have been kind of a...
...adopted.
- I knew it.
- You knew?
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.
But if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?
Actually... you came from this.
It was just another day at the restaurant.
Time to make the noodles.
I went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered.
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.
Only there were no radishes.
Just a very hungry baby panda.
There was no note.
Of course, you could have eaten it.
I waited for someone to come looking for you, but no one did.
I brought you inside.
Fed you.
Gave you a bath.
And fed you again.
And again.
And tried to put some pants on you.
And then I made a decision that would change my life forever.
To make my soup without radishes.
And to raise you as my own son.
Xiao Po, my little panda.
And from that moment on, both my soup and my life have been that much sweeter.
And, little Po, that's the end of the story.
Look at me. No, don't look at me.
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!
Well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture.
It was imported, too.
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.
Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning, but look how it turned out.
You got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles.
I know. I just have so many questions.
Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?
Why didn't I like pants?
And who am I?
Good. Watch your form.
Good.
Better. Elbow.
Straighten it out!
Shen?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.
- Your house?
- Yes.
Didn't you see the peacock on the front door?
There you are, Soothsayer.
It seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council, and we will protect it. Even from you.
I'm so glad you feel that way.
Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing.
What's in the box, Shen?
You want to see? It's a gift.
It's your parting gift, in that it will part you.
Part of you here, part of you there and part of you way over there, staining the wall!
You insolent fool!
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.
You are no match for our kung fu.
I agree.
But this is.
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?
- He's dead.
- Whoa.
That's impossible.
Rhino's Horn Defence is impervious to any technique.
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon, one that breathes fire and spits metal.
Unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu.
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.
Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!
OK, here we go! Here we go!
Wait a second.
How can I do this?
I mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?
Remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace.
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
Peace on.
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.
And I even packed all your action figures. See?
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.
I also packed your paintings of our best time together, just in case you get lonely.
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.
And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.
You have a job to do... far from home, in a strange city, filled with strange people, and strange noodles, facing horrible danger from which you might never return!
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.
And if I don't... what am I?
You're my son.
Right?
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.
He'll be back before you can say "noodles".
Noodles.
Come on, guys, let's go!
Yeah!
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...
Mama?
Mom? Dad? Is that you?
Mom! Dad!
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.
Honey, what are you doing here?
But I thought...
We replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish.
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly, does better kung fu.
No. No, no, no.
Wait!
No.
Radish, radish, radish, radish.
Inner pea...
Pea...
Inner peace.
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!
I'm... training.
The mast is not a worthy opponent.
- I am ready.
- OK.
So serious.
I think I prefer the mast.
Apologies. I used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train.
Now I feel nothing.
That's severely cool.
Again!
So, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that?
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.
Is there any, you know, faster way?
You know, until you, you know, don't feel anything?
No. Besides...
...I don't think hard style is your thing.
Po, why are you really out here?
I just found out that my dad isn't really my dad.
Your dad? The goose.
That must have been quite a shock.
Yeah.
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.
Souls of platinum.
Like you.
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing. Nothing.
Po's having daddy issues.
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.
Maybe it's because Mom ate his head before I was born.
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.
Po is the one freaking out.
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!
- What?
- We're here.
Gongmen City.
My father's throne.
He used to let me play here beside him, promising someday, this throne would be mine.
A little to the left.
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!
Thirty years I've waited for this moment.
Everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.
And I envisioned it a little to the left.
Perfect!
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.
With the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me.
We move out in three days, when the moon is full and the tide is high.
Now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my...
Fortune?
Future. I was going to say future.
Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits.
If you continue on your current path...
...you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs.
I see...
I see...
I see pain... and anger.
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!
Followed by denial.
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying
- what's happening right...
- Now?
The most important time is now.
But if you really want to see the future...
Oh, what do you see?
A peacock...
...is defeated by a warrior of black and white.
Nothing has changed.
That's impossible, and you know it.
It is not impossible, and he knows it.
Who?
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!
Big and furry.
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.
There are no more pandas.
Even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth.
Why is it that you cannot?
Find this panda and bring him to me!
Yes, sir!
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.
You're right.
Being right makes me right.
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.
Will you stop that!
That must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city.
Great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim,
"We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five, and we are here to bring you to justice"!
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.
Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face?
I do not like that guy.
We need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves.
Got it. Stealth mode.
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.
Now, where'd those noodles go?
Hello. I couldn't help but...
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?
OK.
Guys! Guys?
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.
So that was stealth mode, huh?
To be honest, not one of my stronger modes.
...gold in there, come on!
This rice is raw!
You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen!
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.
How am I supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught?
- Wait, I have a better idea.
...two...
...one.
- Hey.
- Hey.
We're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep, but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.
Right.
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.
They're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley.
What? They're still alive?
They must be in that jail gathering intelligence, hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon!
OK, let's go!
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!
- Get them!
- Sorry!
Take that!
- Keep going!
- Faster!
Hey, stop!
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!
Surround him.
Now!
Gotcha!
What? Where'd he go?
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.
Then search there!
They must be close. I can feel a kung fu chill riding up my spine.
Sorry, Po. It's just me.
Look. Gongmen Jail.
Aw, it's cute.
Cute, huh?
Nice work, Po.
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.
Excuse me, when have I ever made that noise?
Master Ox! Master!
The ferocious Master Croc!
And Master Storming Ox.
I can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu.
We're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem.
Gotta be a key around here. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!
We're coming for you, Shen!
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?
I mean, you do want to take back your city, right?
Of course we do.
But if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city.
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City by not protecting Gongmen City?
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...
...by the unstoppable weapon.
Nothing's unstoppable except for me when I'm stopping you from telling me something's unstoppable!
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.
I'd like to see you get me out!
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.
Come on! Whatever happened to being heroes?
The only hero in this town is a dead one!
Like I said, you are not getting me out of this cell!
Yes!
All right, let's go!
I get the top bunk.
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.
I...
You...
Kung fu is dead? Fine!
You stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness.
And all you get are three square meals a day of shame!
With despair for dessert.
We'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry for justice and honour that kung fu still lives!
Yeah!
Monkey?!
You! You're mine!
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!
My fist in your plush, cuddly, super-soft face!
Get him!
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!
Stop him!
Faster!
Yeah! Go, go!
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!
- Viper!
- Hang on!
- What?
- Watch out!
Uncool! Very uncool!
Try this!
Guys, guys, guys!
Maybe something smaller!
No, no! Oh, no, no.
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!
Fire!
We've lost them.
Again! Again!
Crane, catch!
Gotcha!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!
Mantis, now!
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!
Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!
Your turn!
Why... are... there... so... many... signs?!
Come here! Alaka-squasho!
Yes! Taste the defeat!
Let me tell you something.
Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole a...
Guess nobody told you, if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs.
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?
We surrender!
You can chain my body, but you will never chain my... warrior spirit.
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.
These are the best cuffs!
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!
No, no, no...
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.
Greetings, panda. We meet at...
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.
He is coming to me in chains.
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.
Don't even think about it.
I hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water.
This plan's nothing like that plan.
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.
Keep moving.
Ah, my old enemy...
...stairs.
Thanks for carrying me those last few flights. OK.
I threw up a little bit on the third floor.
Someone might want to clean that up.
Is there some sort of evil janitor or something?
Greetings, panda.
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?
Hey.
You've grown up bigger than I thought.
Hey... enough with the poking around.
Strong. Healthy.
Look, I don't know who you are, but please stand aside, sir.
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!
Bring the prisoners to me.
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.
Keep your eyes peeled for the... weapon!
Sparrow kick!
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...
Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?
I do not. I know he is.
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?
I did not have a lifetime.
We only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago,
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?
You probably did some other evil stuff along the way. I don't know.
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?
Know what? What's so funny?
The very thing that you clearly do not know!
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?
First, we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big.
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...
The only reason you are still alive is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing.
Well, thank you. But I find your evilness extremely annoying.
Who do you think you are, panda?
Who do you think I am, peacock?
Why are we laughing?
Take aim.
Fire.
Well, light the... thing!
I did!
Fear the bug!
Get the weapon!
Tigress!
You... You were there.
Yes. Yes, I was.
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.
Fire!
Oh. No, he's got way more.
- My wing!
- Help, Po!
Coming!
- Watch out!
- Po!
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.
Use the ropes.
Run, run, little panda!
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!
Bring it down!
- We're trapped!
- This way!
Goodbye!
Fire!
Get back!
The only way out is up.
What?
Follow me! Come on!
Where are they going?
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!
Here we go!
- You idiot!
- My nose!
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!
The Year of the Peacock begins now!
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year, so you'd only get like a half of the Year of the Peacock.
And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock.
Happy New Year, sir.
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.
Now!
Now, now, now, now, now!
Move! Move, move, move, move!
This way.
Let's go.
Oh, you!
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.
What happened to stopping Shen?
Yeah.
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.
I meant for him to get away.
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.
That makes no sense.
What do you mean? Sure it does.
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.
The truth.
Fine. They will keep you far from danger.
- Real far.
- What?
You're staying here.
Wait! I have to go ba...
You're staying here!
I'm going. And you can't stop me.
OK. I wasn't ready that time.
Guys? Don't.
Ready.
Look!
Stay down.
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!
He was there! OK?
The peacock was there the last time I saw my parents.
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.
Who I am.
Look, I'm going.
I have to know.
The hard core can't understand.
Tigress, no!
The hard core do understand.
But I can't watch my friend be killed.
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.
You're better off here.
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.
Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool?
You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen.
A trivial sacrifice... when all of China is my reward.
Then will you finally be satisfied?
Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?
It's a start. I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.
It is time to stop this madness.
Why on earth would I do that?
So your parents can rest in peace.
My parents hated me.
Do you understand?
They wronged me... and I will make it right.
They loved you.
They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.
The dead exist in the past... and I must tend to the future.
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.
Happiness must be taken.
And I will take mine.
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!
If all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall.
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.
I can't feel my face.
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?
- Hey.
- Hey.
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.
You! Where are you going?
On your feet! And wipe those stupid grins off your faces.
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!
Greetings, panda.
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?
- That night.
- Ah, that night.
Yes! We're talking about the same night, right?
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched as your parents abandoned you.
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.
Here's your New Year's gift.
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.
Po? What's he doing here?
Return it! Return it!
Are you willing to die to find the truth?
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.
We got them. Go!
You looking for me?
I said that too soon, didn't I?
Po!
Po, get away from him.
I'll get up. Here we go.
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.
Now... answers.
Oh, you want to know so badly.
You think knowing will heal you, huh?
Fill some crater in your soul?
Well, here's your answer.
Your parents didn't love you.
But here...
...let me heal you!
No!
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.
What are you talking about?
Where am I?
What is this place?
I'm surprised you remember so little.
But you were so little when it happened.
Perhaps you do remember.
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.
Nightmare? Or memory?
This was a thriving village.
Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.
But he wanted more.
I foretold that someone would stand in his way. A panda.
But I never could have foretold what came next.
Get them all!
Take our son and run away! Go!
Stop fighting. Let it flow.
Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are.
It is the rest of your story.
Who you choose to be.
So, who are you, panda?
I am Po.
And I'm gonna need a hat.
Such sad, sad faces.
But now is a time only for joy.
You are going to be part of something beautiful.
Once we reach the harbour, in front of all the world, you and your precious kung fu will die.
Then China will know to bow before me.
Set sail!
What is that?
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.
I always thought I'd meet a nice girl and settle down and...
...then she'd eat my head.
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.
Fire!
You coward!
Po?
Po?
How many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda?
Shen!
A panda stands between you and your destiny.
What?
Prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice.
Your reign of terror comes to an end.
- What?
- And now, free the Five!
Disc of Destruction!
OK. Take aim!
Ready?
You can't follow me.
Just get him!
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
No, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.
Yeah!
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.
Po!
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.
Nice!
Viper, Puppet of Death!
Tigress!
- Master Ox!
- Jump!
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.
Master Shifu!
Quickly. Use their boats to block the way.
Crane!
Wings of Justice!
Yeah!
What?
I love you guys.
Why aren't we firing?
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.
Fire! Fire at them!
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!
Fire!
No.
Po!
Tigress?
As you wish.
Let's finish this.
Fire!
Inner peace.
Again!
Yeah!
Kill him! Somebody kill him!
What? No. No!
Keep firing! Keep firing!
Skadoosh.
How did you...?
How did you do it?
You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose.
Not that. How did you find peace?
I took away your parents. Everything.
I scarred you for life.
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.
No, they don't. Wounds heal.
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.
You gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.
You're right.
Then I choose... this!
That was pretty hard-core.
- Po!
- You did it!
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.
It seems you have found inner peace.
And at such a young age.
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.
All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.
How about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh?
You know, I think we'll just try again another time.
When do you think he'll be back?
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.
At least, I was his dad.
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.
But why? He's just one little panda.
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?
Yep.
Well, I knew you would.
That's why I had new signs made.
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.
Buy one dumpling, get one free."
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.
There's something I should tell you.
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.
I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.
You did?
- I know who I am.
- You do?
I'm your son.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, son.
Delicious, fat radishes!
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.
What are you talking about? I'll cook.
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.
- Po.
- Dad.
- Po!
- OK.
Let's both cook. Together.
Together.
No, I'll cook.
My son is alive.
ENGLISH ESL
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.
And I'd like to say a few words, if you please.
Regarding the story that you're about to see it actually happened.
Just take it from me.
But there's more to this story than what's on the page, so please pay attention while I set the stage.
We open in Thneedville, a city they say that was plastic and fake,
and they liked it that way!
A town without nature, not one living tree.
So, what happened to them?
Cue the music! Let's see.
Buzz. Buzz.
In Thneedville, it's a brand new dawn
With brand new cars and houses and lawns
Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville
In Thneedville, we manufacture our trees
Each one is made in factories
And uses 96 batteries
In Thneedville, the air's not so clean
So we buy it fresh
It comes out this machine!
In Satisfaction's- guaranteed-ville
In Thneedville, we don't want to know
Where the smog and trash and chemicals go
I just went swimming, and now I glow
In Thneedville, we have fun year round
We surf and snowboard right in town
We thank the Lord for all we've got
Including this brand new parking lot!
Parking lot!
Parking lot!
Oh, look, it's Aloysius O'Hare
Aloysius O'Hare
The man who found a way to sell air
And became a zillionaire
Hip-hip-hooray!
In Thneedville, we love living this way
It's like living in paradise
It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay
Oh, yeah!
Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville
Destined-to-succeed-ville
We-are-all-agreed-ville
We love it here in...
Thneedville!
Yes!
Oh, hi, Ted.
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.
Did your ball land in my backyard again?
What? No.
A model airplane, this time.
Hey, do you want to see something cool?
Come on.
Whoa!
Did you...
Did you paint this?
Do you like it?
What?
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!
What are those?
Those are trees.
Real ones.
They used to grow all around here.
And people said that the touch of their tufts was softer than anything, even silk.
And they smelled like butterfly milk!
Wow! What does that even mean?
I know, right?
Oh, yeah.
What I want more than anything in the whole world is to see a real living tree growing in my backyard.
So if, say... I'm just thinking out loud here.
If a guy somehow got you one...
I'd probably marry him on the spot.
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?
No! Not crazy.
Not crazy at all.
Ted, honey, don't play with your food.
You, either, Mom.
So, Mom, do you happen to know if there's any place where I could get a real tree?
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.
Yeah, but I mean a real one that grows out of the ground or whatever.
You know, a real tree.
Really?
You would rather have some dirty, messy lump of wood that just sticks out of the ground?
And it does what? I don't even know what it does.
What's its purpose?
Look at what we've got.
It's the Oak-amatic. The only tree with its own remote.
Summer, autumn, winter, and disco!
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.
Dance with the tree.
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.
So' anyway...
Let's just say I need a tree.
Where would I go?
What do I do?
Then you know what? You need to find the Once-ler.
The what?
Mom, it's not really the time for one of your magical fables, okay?
That's right, I forgot.
I'm old and can't even remember to put my teeth in.
Stand down.
That's not what I meant.
No, really, I forgot my teeth.
Would you be a dear and go get them for me?
Sure, Mom.
Okay, here's the deal.
The Once-ler is the man who knows what happened to the trees.
You want one, you need to find him.
The Once-ler?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. Grammy, is this a real thing that we're talking about now?
Oh, he's real all right.
Well, where can I find him?
Far outside of town where the grass never grows and the wind smells slow and sour when it blows.
And no birds ever sing, excepting old crows.
Quit doing that.
That's the place where the Once-ler lives.
Wait, outside of town?
People used to say if you brought him 15 cents,
a nail
and the shell of a great, great, great grandfather snail,
he would tell you everything.
Hmm.
Mr. O'Hare, what we've got for you is something that is going to take O'Hare Air to the next level.
Now, Mr. O'Hare,
I know what you're thinking.
One, "I've gotten rich selling people air that's"
"fresher than the stinky stuff outside"
Two, and here is the important one,
"How can I possibly make even more money?"
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.
Check out this commercial, huh?
Well, here goes another lame Saturday.
Dude, I don't think so!
Huh!
Hey!
Man!
Oh, yeah!
What!
Yeah!
O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.
Please breathe responsibly.
Ah?
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it.
You got to be kidding me.
You really think people are stupid enough to buy this?
Our research shows that if you put something in a plastic bottle, people will buy it.
Exactly. And...
And what's more, when we build a new factory to make the plastic bottles, the air quality is just going to get worse.
Which will make people want our air even more, and drive sales where?
Through the roof!
So, in other words, the more smog in the sky the more people will buy.
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!
I'm aware it rhymes.
Coats. Big.
What do you two knuckleheads want?
I'm in the middle of a meeting!
What?
Why is he leaving town?
No one ever leaves town!
See what he's up to.
Whoa!
Huh?
Whoa! Whoa.
Oh, man.
Whoa!
All right.
Okay.
What the...
Whoa!
Who are you?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.
I can't breathe.
Are you the Once-ler?
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?
No one is supposed to come here.
Get out of here and leave me alone!
And don't let the boot hit you on the way out.
The boot?
Hello!
Ow!
Listen! People say that if someone brings you this stuff that you will tell them about trees.
No, no, no!
Trees?
Yeah, real ones.
You know, that grow out of the ground?
Hello?
Sorry, it's just...
Well, I didn't think anyone still cared about trees.
Well, that's me. The guy who still cares. I'm here.
Hey! What?
Do you want to know about trees?
About what happened to them?
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.
Wait, what?
It's because of me!
And my invention, the Thneed.
It was an amazing product that could do the job of a thousand.
All right.
Sounds ridiculous, but I mean, that's cool.
You're darn right it was cool!
It all started a long time ago.
Can we start not so long ago, maybe?
Do you want a tree?
Yes, yes.
Then it all started a long, long time ago.
I was a young man leaving home.
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to change the world with my Thneed.
I'm actually doing it!
Yes, but just remember, Oncie, if somehow your invention ends up a failure instead of a success, oh, it wouldn't surprise me at all!
Nice wheels.
Burn!
Ow!
Yeah, "Burn!"
But you will see, okay? I'm going to prove you all wrong.
Come on, Melvin!
So, there I was at the very bottom.
With nothing but a wagon, a mule,
and a completely irrational sense of optimism.
I was searching the globe,
obsessed with finding the perfect material for my Thneed.
But I'd had absolutely no success.
Until one day, I found paradise.
Oh!
We're going to be there soon, I'm sure.
Whoa!
This is the most beautiful place, okay, I have ever seen.
Oh.
Ta-da!
Whoa!
Yeah
This is it
This is the place
These Truff ula trees are just what I need
Gonna chop one down and make my Thneed
But first...
Now you!
That's great!
So now our friendship can begin
Hand in hand, and wing and fin
There's nothing you and I can't do
So let's all make my dreams come true
Hey, guys!
Come on, where is my back-up chorus?
What?
Ah-ha! Oh.
Ooh!
Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.
Excuse me?
Yeah, that's awesome.
Feeding junk food to forest animals?
That's great.
But, uh, is there a musical number where you show me how to get a tree?
Because I would love to hear that one.
Oh, yes. Right after the musical number about the kid who kept interrupting the story, and was never heard from again.
Right, got it. Proceed.
All right, here we go.
About to make a Thneed, about to change the world.
Check it out, guys...
Where did everybody go?
Little did I know that by chopping down that tree
I had just summoned a mystical creature as old as time itself.
The legendary, slightly annoying guardian of the forest.
The Lorax.
Hey!
Whoo!
Did you chop down this tree?
Uh... No.
Who did it?
What's that?
I think he did it.
Leave!
Vacate the premises!
Take your ax and get out!
And who are you?
I'm the Lorax!
Guardian of the forest.
I speak for the trees.
So you're telling me, you just didn't see me magically appear out of that stump?
With all the lightning and thunder and stuff.
You didn't see any of that?
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.
Okay. Um...
Didn't really happen.
Oh, I know what you want!
I've got one of these for the cutest little guy lever saw!
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy...
How dare you!
Give me that!
Mmm.
I'm going to eat this, but I am highly offended by it.
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?
What's your deal, man?
Pull them right out Time for you to go, Beanpole!
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.
Stop right there! Stop it!
So you would hammer one of nature's innocent creatures?
What? No!
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,
I would gladly pound you and your mustache into the ground!
Behold! The intruder and his violent ways.
Shame on you.
For shame!
All right, you know what?
That's it!
You listen to me, you furry meatloaf.
I'm going to chop down as many trees as I need. Okay?
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!
End of story.
Then you leave me no choice.
If you're not gone by the time the sun sets on this valley, all the forces of nature will be unleashed upon you and curse you until the end of your days!
You have been warned.
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.
You have been warned.
But I didn't listen to his warning.
And you won't believe what happened that night.
What?
If you want to hear more, come back tomorrow.
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho.
Are you serious right now?
Ah! You live in the middle of nowhere!
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!
I guess you don't really want to hear the rest of the story.
No, no.
I do. I really do. I want to hear the story. I just...
Nah! You don't have what it takes. Goodbye.
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.
It's all right. It's okay, I'll come back.
It's no problem.
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Mmm.
Maybe. Just maybe.
What did you wish for, Audrey?
Well, I would love to tell you, but, sadly, according to the universal wish laws, I cannot.
I know what she wished for.
Was it, perhaps...
This?
Ted, you didn't.
Oh, no. I totally did.
Happy birthday, Audrey.
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Ted.
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!
You're kissing the cereal again, hon. What?
I just...
I like this cereal.
What one is this?
Yeah!
Okay.
Well, I'll make sure to buy extra next time for you.
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do athing.
So, I'll see you guys.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You're not going anywhere, young man.
It's Sunday. You know what that means?
Family time, and we're all playing board games!
But...
Hmm.
Mmm?
Oh, man.
Mom, seriously every turn?
Hey, back off!
Ooh!
No.
Okay! Family time is over.
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.
Okay, dear. Have fun.
I knew I could break her.
Go.
Huh?
Go see him!
Oh, yeah!
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.
Whoa!
Hey! Ted, right?
Um, Mr. O'Hare?
So, I hear you have become interested in trees.
What's that all about?
Oh. Um...
Where did you hear that?
Oh.
Teddy, there's not much that goes on in Thneedville that I don't know about.
Here's the deal, I make a living selling fresh air to people.
Trees?
They make it for free.
So, when I hear people talking about them,
I consider it kind of a threat to my business.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
You listen to me, boy.
Don't go poking around in things you don't understand or I'll be your worst nightmare.
I'm Frankenstein's head on a spider's body!
Yeah, um...
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...
Of course, of course. Now, go back to your family game time.
Grandma just finished her turn.
How did you know?
Please. I have eyes everywhere.
Huh!
You got a beautiful town here, Ted.
Lots of fun stuff to occupy your short attention span.
Why, I can't think of any reason you would ever want to go outside of town again.
Ever.
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.
Oh, no.
Look out!
Hey, man? You know, you need to change that door bell.
Oh, you missed me.
What?
You're already back. Clearly, you missed me a little. Right?
No, I didn't. I'm just here to hear the end of the story.
Why are you so interested in trees anyway?
Why aren't you like other kids, break dancing and wearing bell-bottoms, and playing the Donkey Kongs?
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.
Uh, I just thought it would be kind of cool to have one, you know?
Huh?
It's a girl, isn't it?
What? No!
Really? Because when a guy does something stupid once, well, that's because he's a guy.
But if he does the same stupid thing twice, it's usually to impress some girl.
Hey, she is not some girl!
She's a woman, in high school.
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.
Aw!
How nice to see someone so undeterred by things like reality.
Thank you.
All right, but where did we leave off?
Now that's a Thneed.
Nothing unmanly about knitting. No, sir.
Look at that...
Oh!
Who taught you guys how to steal a bed?
Shh!
Okay, nice and easy.
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't have done it without you.
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?
Of course he can't swim!
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!
Whoo! Whoo!
Jump, jump!
Come on, get up there.
Come on.
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!
Now what?
Mmm-mmm.
Get up there.
Okay, Pipsqueak, give me your hand.
Come on, reach out for the Lorax.
Where did you go?
Bar-ba-loots.
Oh, that's bad.
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!
What's happening?
Where am I?
Hey! We got trouble, and it's coming up fast!
Whoo!
We're in a river!
Whew!
Oh, no.
Just do something!
Help is on the way!
No, no!
Just a minute!
Oh, no!
Wake up! Wake up!
Yuck!
Clear!
Ah!
I was heading into the light, and you pulled me right back and here I am!
You saved my life!
Yeah, I know. Well, no, it's not that big a deal.
It is a big deal!
Look, I almost went over that waterfall! Wait...
On my bed. How did my bed get in the river?
Uh... About that...
Actually... I put your bed in the water.
I didn't mean you any harm.
I just wanted to calmly float you away.
Look, everyone here needs the trees and you're chopping them down!
So, we've got a big problem.
All right, look.
I hereby swear that I will never chop down another tree.
I promise.
Thank you. But I'm going to keep my eye on you.
Good. Now, I've got a big day tomorrow so I'm going to get some sleep.
Right after I find my bed.
Ow!
Okay, what are you...
Question, what are they doing here?
And follow up, if I may, what are you doing here?
Well, after the incident last night, we found one of your socks and came here to return it.
But when we got here, you were asleep. What?
Ew!
Exactly. And sleeping is the body's way of telling other people to go away.
I know, but you looked so cozy.
And it was cold outside, and we just fell asleep. No harm done.
"No harm done"?
"No harm done"? Okay.
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.
Ew.
Did you just...
In my bowl!
Why do you have one of these?
You don't even have a mustache.
Okay, that's it!
What? I thought we made a deal last night.
Yes, we did.
And I said I wouldn't chop down any more trees.
And I said I was going to keep an eye on you.
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?
Breakfast is overrated.
You know what?
I got work to do. Yeah.
I got to go into town and sell my Thneed.
You chopped down one of my trees to make that piece of garbage?
Look at that...
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.
This is a revolutionary product that will change the world as we know it.
It has a million uses!
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!
Mud tracked all over your floor by uninvited guests?
Well, the Thneed sure comes in handy for that!
But wait, there's more!
Thanks to its all-natural microfibers, the Thneed is super-absorbent!
It also works as a hat.
Of course, you probably want to wring it out first.
Go ahead, knock yourself out.
But nobody is going to buy that thing.
Good to know.
Well, fortunately, you are not the target market, weirdo.
You're bringing a guitar?
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.
I'm gonna blow some minds, gonna sell some Thneeds!
Yeah.
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing that all people...
Sit down, go on.
Unfortunately, I didn't sell it the first day.
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great...
Hey!
Or the second day.
Hey!
Or the third, or fourth, or fifth day.
Okay, that one hit the tender spot.
Until finally...
That's it!
You know what?
I'm done with this thing.
Aw.
My family was right.
I quit!
Hey. Cool hat.
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.
That thing makes me like you more.
Hey! Where's your Thneed, did you sell it?
Hey. No, no.
Didn't sell it.
Turns out, it's ahead of its time, I guess.
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?
Come on, take a seat, we'll deal you in.
What are we playing?
I'm playing poker. He's playing Go Fish.
And I think he's hungry.
Oh.
Pancake, the pancake
Up!
Who is up for ninths?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Whoa!
All right, pass them over.
Yeah, see?
What's going on?
Oh, no.
That's a lot of people.
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing that all people need
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great
Let's hope we're not too late
It's a super trendy hat
It's a tightrope for an acrobat
A net for catching butterflies
A thing we use for exercise
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing that all people need
Everybody needs a Thneed
Oh, yeah!
We're in business, baby!
We need a Thneed
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!
You need to bring the whole family here right now.
We're going to be rich!
What? I'm going to need all the help I can get. Don't worry.
So, has he told you how to get a tree yet?
Actually, no.
But I think he's going to get to that part really soon.
Here we are.
What?
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.
Just me and my thoughts.
Oh, is this the girl you're always talking about?
Grandma!
Stop making things up.
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.
Okay, Grammy, let's get you home!
Yeah!
Whoa!
I'm so sorry. So sorry.
Did not wanna see that.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho!
Hey!
Hey, I'm back.
What have you got there?
Yes!
Whoa!
Thank you, Ted.
Now, picture this.
Sun shining, a blue sky, a perfect day.
It was all downhill from there.
Whoa!
What a dump.
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!
Hey, Chet, check this out!
Go long!
No, Brett, that's actually not a...
Okay.
Go long! Go long!
I got it! I got it!
Got it!
He totally ran into that tree!
Ow!
Oncie, is that you?
Mom!
There he is! There's my big, suddenly successful son!
We always knew you would make it, Oncie. Right?
Hey! I love this guy!
But you always said I wouldn't amount to anything, remember?
Hush your mouth. I was just trying to motivate you!
I am really glad that you clarified that because it actually hurt my feelings for a really long time.
Anyway, you're all here, you all work for me, and that's cool.
So, let's get to work.
Brett, Chet, set up the RV!
Would you stop throwing that bear?
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.
Nobody's moving in here.
You got to go. Goodbye.
So, who invited the giant, furry peanut?
You calling me a peanut, huh?
I'll go right up your nose!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You wouldn't hit a woman.
That's a woman?
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.
Let's not get off on the wrong foot here.
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good acquaintance, the Lorax.
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.
And on behalf of the trees, get out!
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.
And I'm going to need their help if my company is going to get bigger. Okay?
Bigger?
Yeah, this isn't some rinky-dink operation any more.
I got plans. Big plans!
A vision of a world filled with Thneeds.
It's going to be huge!
Which way does a tree fall?
Uh, down?
A tree falls the way it leans.
Be careful which way you lean.
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.
I am so proud of me.
Oncie, we've got us a little problem.
Problem?
Mmm-hmm.
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.
Harvesting the tufts takes too long!
Well, what else can we do?
Well, and this just came to me, we could always start chopping down the trees.
What?
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!
But...
No "but" s, Oncie.
You're running a business now.
You have to do what's best for the company, and your momma.
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to chop down a few trees.
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!
Hey! I love this guy!
No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.
Take that, you stupid tree!
Where do you think you're going?
Excuse me, sir. I need to talk with your boss.
Oh, I'm sorry, but Mr. Once-ler's not seeing anyone right now.
Yeah, well, he'll see me. So...
Hey, keep your paws off me!
Give me a reason, Shorty.
Hey, you broke your promise.
You're better than this.
You gotta stop!
This is bad!
Have a nice day!
Bad?
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.
Do you think I'm bad?
Thank you!
I mean, something good finally happens to me, and he just has to come along and rain on my parade.
What's his problem?
See?
Yeah, bad! Right.
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
I'm just following my destiny
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
How bad can I possibly be?
Well, there's a principle in nature
Principle in nature
That almost every creature knows
Called survival of the fittest
Survival of the fittest
And check it, this is how it goes
The animal that wins gotta scratch and fight
And claw and bite and punch
And the animal that doesn't
Well, the animal that doesn't
Winds up someone else's
La-la-la-la lunch
Munch, munch, munch, munch, munch I'm just sayin'
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
I'm just following my destiny
How bad can I be?
I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How bad can I be?
How bad can I possibly be?
There's a principle in business
Principle in business
That everybody knows is sound
It says the people with the money People with the money
Make this ever-loving world go round
So I'm biggering my company
I'm biggering my factory
I'm biggering my corporate sign
Bigger, bigger!
Everybody out there
You take care of yours
I'll take care of mine-mine-mine-mine-mine
Shake that bottom line
Let me hear you say Smogulous Smoke!
Smogulous Smoke!
Schloppity-Schlopp!
Schloppity-Schlopp!
Complain all you want It's never, ever, ever, ever gonna stop
Stop!
Come on, how bad can I possibly be?
How bad can I be?
I'm just building the economy
How bad can I be?
Just look at me petting this puppy
How bad can I be?
A portion of proceeds goes to charity
How bad can I be?
How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!
All the customers are buying
And the money's multiplying
And the PR people are lying
And the lawyers are denying
Who cares if a few trees are dying?
This is all so gratifying!
How bad?
How bad can this possibly be?
So, how are things?
What are you doing here?
Happy yet? You fill that hole deep down inside you?
Or do you still need more?
Look, if you've got a problem with what I'm doing, why haven't you used your quote-unquote powers to stop me?
I told you, that's not how it works.
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.
I need you to get out. Now!
Why? Do I make you uncomfortable?
Remind you of the promises you made?
The man you used to be?
You know what?
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.
I have done nothing illegal.
I have my rights, and I intend to keep on biggering and biggering, and turning more
Truff ula trees into Thneeds.
And nothing is going to stop me!
Well, that's it.
The very last one.
That may stop you.
Somebody sure made a bundle on that thing.
I wonder what the next million dollar invention's going to be.
Yeah, I wonder...
Son, you have let me down.
Brett, you are now my favorite child.
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.
And you won't get any.
Not from them.
Thanks to you and your hacking, and smogging and glupping, they can't live here any more.
So, I'm sending them off.
Hopefully, they'll be able to find a better place out there somewhere.
Melvin?
Melvin...
Hey, Pipsqueak...
Hey...
So, this is really all your fault.
You destroyed everything.
Yes.
And each day since the Lorax left,
I've sat here regretting everything I've done, staring at that word, "unless," and wondering what it meant.
But now I'm thinking...
Well, maybe you're the reason the Lorax left that word there.
Me? Why would he leave that for me?
Because unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.
It's not.
The last Truff ula seed.
You need to plant it, Ted.
Yeah, but, nobody cares about trees any more.
Then make them care.
Plant the seed in the middle of town, where everyone can see.
Change the way things are.
I know it may seem small and insignificant, but it's not about what it is, it's about what it can become.
That's not just a seed, any more than you're just a boy.
I won't let you down.
I know.
Hey, Audrey!
Audrey!
Ted?
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.
Wait, but...
My house, okay?
Got to plant the seed.
Okay, we're going to need water.
And uh, something to dig with.
Um, what do I have...
Ted?
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.
Theodore Wiggins, get down here right now, and I am not kidding with you!
Ted, I would like you to meet Mr. O'Hare, the most powerful man in town.
There he is!
Hello, Ted.
Uh...
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?
He knows his own name and everything.
You know what I would love right now, Mrs. Wiggins?
A delicious cookie.
Wonderful.
Teddy and I'll stay here and talk.
Sure, why don't you go ahead and adopt him?
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.
I'll get your cookie.
I know you have it, Ted.
So, let's put an end to this nonsense, shall we?
Hand it over.
I'm sorry...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really? Well, then...
I guess you wouldn't mind us checking your room.
No, no, no!
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!
No, you can't go up there!
Guys, this is ridiculous. Stop!
Hey!
No, you can't come in my room!
Find it!
Find it!
What is going on here?
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!
Excuse me, down there!
I don't care who you are, you little crazy baby-man!
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.
Fine. Sorry.
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.
And my apologies, Ted.
You be safe.
Mind telling me what's going on here?
The seed! Where is it?
Seed?
Where's Grammy?
It's alive!
I remember you.
Ted, what...
Audrey!
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!
Ted, what is this about?
It's about this.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that... Yes. The last Truff ula seed.
And you're going to help me plant it right in the middle of town where everyone can see it.
I could just kiss you right now!
We don't have time for that.
I don't know, we have a little time.
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go Forget about it.
Maniac!
Hey!
Ah!
Here it comes!
I'm going for it.
Oh, hello!
Ted, big scary blimp coming.
Whoa!
You won't get away with this, boy!
Bam!
Go faster, you idiot!
Yeah!
Step on it, Ted!
Whoa!
You're fired!
Whoa! Ted, look out!
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...
This is not good.
How's it doing?
Whoa-ho-ho!
Loser!
Oh, really?
Oh, no. The seed!
Get that seed!
Hang on! Here we go!
Grammy!
Seriously, how cool is your grandma?
No!
Come on!
Yeah, that's right.
There it is!
Hey! Watch the road, you meathead!
Ah!
Hey, ow, ow!
Oh, come on!
What the...
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!
Bring it on, Teddy!
You don't have the guts!
Ted!
Grammy!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! It's Mr. O...
Take that, shorty!
Okay, we have to get this in the ground.
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.
No, Grammy...
Hey, get out of there!
Ah!
Hey!
What?
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!
What do you think you're doing, kid?
Um, I'm looking for a place to plant a tree.
A real one.
Why would we need a tree?
Exactly.
Oh, man.
Folks...
The last thing you want around here is trees.
They're filthy!
Spewing that sticky, nasty sap all over the place.
They bring poisonous ants and stinging bees.
Hey!
Ouch.
Think about the kids.
And, I just thought, you know, they make leaves!
You know that, right?
Then these leaves, they just fall.
They just fall wherever they want!
Come on! We know why you're really against trees.
Because they produce fresh air.
For free!
Oh!
I am wounded!
You have lied!
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.
Come on.
She's making that up!
That's a made-up word, people!
Thneedville is perfect just the way it is.
We don't need trees!
That boy has a seed.
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!
O'Hare is right!
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!
Where do you think you're going?
Come on, let's go!
Get in, get in!
Hey!
Stop that maniac!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!
Ted, you're going to hit the wall!
Yeah. I know.
Wow. Did you see that?
Who does this kid think he is, huh?
I am Ted Wiggins.
And I speak for the trees.
And the fact is, things aren't perfect here in Thneedville.
And they're only going to get worse, unless we do something about it, unless we change our ways.
And we can start by planting this!
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.
Right?
I say we tell this kid what we think about that seed!
People, come on!
You! Get out there right now and get these people on my side, or else you're fired!
Go on, tell them what you think.
You don't know me, but my name's Cy
I'm just the O'Hare delivery guy
But it seems like trees might be worth a try
So I say let it grow
My name is Dan
And my name's Rose
Our son Wesley kind of glows
And that's not good, so we suppose
We should let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap what you don't sow
Plant a seed inside the Earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
My name's Marie, and I am three!
I would really like to see a tree
I say let it grow
I'm Grammy Norma I'm old, and I've got gray hair
But I remember when trees were everywhere
And no one had to pay for air
So I say let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
Like it did so long ago
It is just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to change the life we lead
Time to let it grow
My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you
I live here in Thneedville, too
The things you say just might be true
It could be time to start anew
And maybe change my point of view
Nah! I say let it die!
Let it die, let it die
Let it shrivel up and...
Come on, who's with me?
Nobody.
You greedy dirt-bag!
Let it grow, let it grow
Let the love inside you show
Plant a seed inside the Earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap what you don't sow
It's just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to banish all your greed
Imagine Thneedville flowered and treed
Let this be our solemn creed
Thank you, Ted.
We say let it grow
In Thneedville
We say let it grow
It's a brand new dawn
We say let it grow
In Thneedville
We say let it grow
It's a brand new dawn
You done good, Beanpole.
You done good.
By the way, nice mustache.
With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
But not for me.
My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads, we're cavemen.
Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
Night after night, day after day.
Yep, home sweet home.
When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world.
And I struggled to survive my family.
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.
The Erfs, mosquito bite.
Throgs, common cold.
And the Croods, that's us.
The Croods made it, because of my dad.
He was strong, and he followed the rules.
The ones painted on the cave walls.
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.
Welcome to my world.
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
Because what we didn't know was that our world... was about to come to an end.
And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
You are supposed to wait for my signal. Eep?
Boo.
Ow! No!
We've been in that cave forever.
Three days is not forever.
It is with this family.
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.
No, Sandy, come back here.
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
No, I mean, you're already out now.
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.
But if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
The signal isn't so you know it's me.
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.
Mom, we're ready to leave.
Mom?
Still alive.
It's still early.
And you're still fat.
Breakfast formation!
I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast.
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.
And never not be afraid!
Yay, breakfast.
Who's up?
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.
Heads!
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.
Okay. Thunk...
Go.
Come on, Thunk.
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.
Release the baby!
Get them, Sandy! Go!
Get them, Mom!
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!
Thanks.
Eep!
Heads up!
Hey Dad, can we eat now?
Just wait till we get home.
Eep, put on the brakes.
Eep!
- Who is hungry?
- All right! Good one, Dad.
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.
That's all right. I ate last week.
Two knuckle warning!
Come on, Croods. Go, go.
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.
The moon is full. Bath night.
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.
I don't want to lose my protective layer.
Mom, you've got ants.
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
Is she still out there?
You know she hates the cave, Grug.
Please come back tomorrow.
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.
It is a little dark, Grug.
It's not that dark.
Eep!
Eep?
Come on, I have to close the cave.
Eep!
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Eep! Come down!
- That was too close.
- I was watching. I was fine.
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.
Why don't you know?
Stop looking for things.
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.
What is the point of all this?
What was that?
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?
No one said survival was fun.
Nothing is fun.
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.
- Eap.
- Grug.
- Yes.
- Off!
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...
- Off.
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge, that's all.
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things... and she needs her own space.
What things?
How long is this going to take?
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!
See? She's listening.
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
How about a story?
Eep loves those.
That's a good ide...
How about a story, huh?
Yeah, tell us a story.
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.
Eep, your old favorite.
I haven't played with that thing in years.
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.
She was alive because she listened to her father... and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror.
So she was happy.
But Krispy had one terrible problem.
She was filled with... curiosity.
- Grug.
- Yes. yes.
And one day, while she was in a tree... the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
And no sooner than she climbed to the top... she saw something new and died!
- Just like that?
- Yes!
Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
Same ending as every day.
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.
Good man, Thunk.
All right, everyone sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.
Air.
You talk.
I'm a person, like you.
Sort of like you.
Okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
Would you mind not...
That tickles.
Hey, hey, hey!
Quiet!
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Eep is gone.
What? Grug!
Stay in the cave.
Wow. You are really strong.
Hey! No! It's mine.
- Please! Wait.
- No!
- It's dying! I can fix it!
- No! I caught it!
Please! Please.
I hate the dark.
Come on, come on, come on.
It does what you tell it?
Yeah. Sort of.
The sun?
No, no, no. Fire.
Hi, fire.
It's not alive.
But you said it was dying.
Sorry.
It comes from where you come from?
No. No, I make it.
- Make some for me.
- Okay.
Make!
It doesn't come out of me.
Make! Make it!
You do this a lot.
Are you dead?
Can I have your fire if you're dead?
Clear!
Hey, those are cold!
You think? Listening shells, activate.
I concur.
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.
I don't even know you.
I'm Guy.
Guy?
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.
Also, keeps my pants up.
What are "pants up"?
Who are you?
Eep.
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.
What?
I'm calling it "The End."
How do you know?
I have seen it. It's coming this way.
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.
Fire. Lava.
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...
Believe me, everything we are standing on will be gone.
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.
It's our only chance.
Come with me.
I can't.
Okay.
Here.
If you survive, call me.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hey!
Dad!
Are you hurt? What took you?
Nothing. I left on my own.
You what?
Dad, let me explain.
You never let me talk.
You're grounded.
Hey!
Eep!
Mom.
Grug! What happened?
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.
Eep?
You will never believe it.
I found something new.
New!
New is a big problem!
Wait, wait!
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
- It wasn't bad.
-"New" is always bad.
No. He was nice.
What? Excuse me? He?
I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
Strange.
Usually it's the reverse.
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...
There was a boy.
Watch. I'm going to call him.
What is wrong with you?
It was dangerous.
It was beautiful!
You want to see dangerous? Here!
My sniffer!
Okay, that's it!
We're going back to the cave... and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
What!
You can't keep me inside forever!
He said this would happen.
Get to the cave!
Go!
Look out!
Stop!
Is everyone okay?
Yes.
Grug, the cave... it's gone.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there!
No. No one is going anywhere.
What else did that boy say?
Grug?
Just go! Just go!
Go!
One, two, three, four, five...
Six.
Where are we?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Down.
In a lower place.
But one thing is for sure, we can't go back the way we came.
Sandy? What is it?
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!
We can't be out in the open like this.
We need a cave.
Now, step where I step.
Okay. Stay quiet.
Hopefully, nothing big knows we're here yet.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait!
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Wait.
So, Dad... just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?
If it was me...
I'm just throwing this out there... if it was me choosing the cave...
I would go with a smaller cave.
Wait.
Dad?
I'll take care of this.
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!
Now you got them right...
Man, they're really...
I'm loving this.
Dad, I got it.
Just stop running into their fists.
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.
That's right. You can't get past this!
Climb! Climb! Climb!
Cave!
Go! Go!
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!
Okay.
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.
And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
It's scared of the dark.
Wait, we're scared of the dark.
Kill circle!
Eep!
Eep!
- Cavies!
-"Cavies"?
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.
The huge primitive teeth?
Yeah.
The excessive body hair.
That one has got a tail.
Yeah.
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.
No! It won't help.
They're my family.
What?
The sun is in his hands!
No, no. It's "fire."
Where did it come from?
He made it.
Make some for me!
It doesn't come out of him.
Make. Make it!
You're a lot like your daughter.
Great, now he's broken.
It's a baby sun.
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.
Now, we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave... and pretend today never happened.
Isn't this fun, Eep?
Eep, don't touch him.
Goodness knows where he's been.
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.
What a cute little guy.
Hey. Stay back.
No, no, no, wait!
It likes me.
Hey! It's biting me!
Thunk! Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.
They're biting me!
More fire babies.
Hi.
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.
Yeah. But I won't let him.
Hold on, son. Come back!
No, stop! Let me go!
Get out! Out! Out!
Eat up, babies!
No, stop touching me!
Die!
I win!
They're not so scary once you get to know them.
Who are you people?
I'm sorry.
We're the Croods!
And you are?
Guy.
Hi, Guy.
Wow!
It looks like magic.
And smells like food.
No, don't eat it, it's new.
Still alive!
Come on, keep eating.
Hey, where is Guy?
No!
Going somewhere?
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.
No. That was just the beginning of the end.
The end of the end is still coming.
Eep. Drop it.
We can't let him go!
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?
What if it takes a few days?
What if the birds come back?
We need his fire, dummy!
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!
Stay here if you want, but let me go.
I've got a dream... a mission, a reason to live!
Not anymore.
I've got an idea.
Let's go to that mountain.
It's too far.
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
There are caves on that mountain.
Have you been there?
It's a mountain.
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.
And water. And sticks.
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.
Crazy sticks. Let's go.
Quiet!
That thing is weird.
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.
That's just Belt.
I've made a decision.
We're going to that mountain.
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.
Just feels right.
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.
I don't think my feet can do that.
I'll never live long enough to get there.
Let's do it.
Come on, just think.
Our whole family packed together on a long, slow, trip across country?
Days and nights with just each other.
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.
We'll become closer as a family.
Get her off!
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye.
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail?
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!
Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?
Because I will turn this family around so fast!
Dad, I gotta go!
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.
- I'm touching...
- Gran.
Dad, I still gotta go!
Fine. Just go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
No.
- How about now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
Now?
I can do this all day long.
No, no, no and still no.
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
Grug, we're all pretty tired!
We'll eat when we get there.
It's taking too long!
I'm grabbing a snack.
Don't do that. He will cut you.
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.
What's a pet?
An animal you don't eat.
We call those "children."
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.
- It's food!
- No, please!
Not that. That!
Food fixes everything.
Show me your hunting face.
Not you. You're still grounded.
Come on, Thunk.
My feet hurt.
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.
I wasn't ready.
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!
Why are you doing this?
What are they doing?
Hunting.
Get it off! You stay away from me.
No, seriously, what are they doing?
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.
Now you're just rubbing it in.
There, who's hungry for scorpion?
What happened to the egg and the bird?
We lost him.
But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground... the scorpion grabbed a hold of me... and one thing led to another and here we are eating him.
So, win-win.
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.
I need more.
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?
You're too skinny.
If she was going to eat anyone it would be...
Mom!
She's locked her jaw!
Get a stick! Get a stick!
Stay away!
You sick old monster!
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!
Hold her still. Use a rock.
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?
Why are you rolling away?
I just want something to eat.
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
Please.
I'll let you help me hunt.
Really?
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.
Tell my story.
Okay.
What do you call this?
A trap.
What does it do?
Well...
How long have you been alone?
So, what do we do?
How's your acting?
You're good at this.
No. Sorry.
Okay.
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.
Your other hand...
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.
Going under.
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.
Yeah, I noticed!
Where's Eep?
She's awesome.
Eep!
Dad,no!
It's an avalanche of flavor.
Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.
What are "left overs"?
When you have so much food to eat, you have some left over.
We never have that much food.
Grug, how about a story?
That's a good idea. How about a story?
Yeah, tell us a story!
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger... who lived in a cave with her family.
There were a lot of rules... but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night.
And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
So easy to remember!
I know.
But, while everyone was asleep... she went out anyway.
- No!
- Yes!
And no sooner than she did, their cave was destroyed... and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk... with some weirdo they met... and die!
The end.
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.
My stories never end like that.
Yes! Two stories in one night!
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.
Her father and mother told her,
"You may go anywhere you want..."
"but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
And die. Good story.
But when no one was looking... she'd go near the cliff... for the closer she came to the edge... the more she could hear, the more she could see... the more she could feel.
Finally... she stood at the very edge.
She saw a light.
She leaned out to touch it... and she slipped.
And she fell.
And she flew.
Where did she fly?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
It would be so bright.
A place not like today, or yesterday.
A place where things are better.
Tomorrow isn't a place.
You can't see it!
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.
That's where I'm going.
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.
And when we wake up... we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
Tomorrow?
A cave.
That was too close. it almost caught us.
I was watching. We were fine.
We gotta move faster.
Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander"?
I'll take a shamble at this point.
Hey, do you have a minute?
How did the tiger fly?
I only share when I'm outside the log.
I'm funny that way.
Leave this to me.
Hey, Thunk... you have a spider on your face.
Oops.
He's loose!
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.
Do you mean these rocks?
Do not step on these rocks!
Step aside, girls.
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.
You cannot walk on those!
Get back here now!
There goes our chance for survival.
And our log!
Okay.
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly... but it doesn't get better.
How about...
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.
Come on.
I can help you... but we're going to have to make a few changes around here.
The log ride is over.
Drop the log.
Now, kick it away.
Farther.
Really?
Okay, smart "Guy"... now what?
Good fish, good fish.
Okay. Now you can look.
I love them!
Where are my feet?
They're still there!
Okay.
You're really heavy.
Really?
Thank you!
Hey. Wait!
Okay.
She's up. We're good. I'm good.
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?
I'm calling it a "brain."
I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
Dad, I don't have a brain.
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.
Now, let's get to that mountain!
Wow! I love those!
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
So, how did the tiger fly?
She jumped on the sun... and rode it to Tomorrow.
No,no,no.
Hi, Dad!
Bye. Dad!
You've seen rain before, right?
We don't get out much.
Eep, looks dangerous.
Dad, you say that about everything.
Careful.
Really? Okay.
No, no, no. Not cool!
So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been dumping my bones here since last week."
Last week!
That's a funny story!
It's not a story. It's a joke.
What's a "joke"?
Just making something up to make you laugh.
- One for you.
- Thanks.
One for you. And this one's for you.
Okay.
Okay! That's enough!
I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
Wait, you're saying we should split up?
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.
They can handle it.
We can do it, Dad.
No,no,no.
It's my job to keep you safe.
I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.
Except for you two.
And that's final.
Hello?
Is everyone all right?
We're okay, Grug.
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?
Stay where you are. I'll find you.
No. Too slow.
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
Dad?
Yeah.
Okay.
Remember, never not be afraid.
You can do this!
It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay.
I'm going to pass out.
Sandy. Sandy!
Give me another one.
You dropped these.
Come with me.
Here, boy! Catch!
Yoo-hoo!
Gran?
Mom?
Wow.
Grug?
I'll go get him.
Good boy! Who's a good boy?
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!
You need a name. You want a name?
I'm going to call you Douglas.
Can you do tricks? Roll over.
Come on, Douglas, roll over.
Good boy, Douglas!
I was in love once.
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.
It was quite a scandal.
We fed each other berries, we danced.
Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your grandfather.
Croods!
Get down here.
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.
Guy is with them. Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.
Okay. I'm going to go up... and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!
Sleep pile?
How about a story?
Anyone?
And then Torg said,
"Know it? I drew it."
That makes no sense.
I know it was hard for you to bring us along... but they had the best day of their lives.
Thank you for that.
I want to show you something.
More suns in the sky than you can count.
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.
Tomorrow.
That's where we'll be safe.
I'm going with Guy.
No. Not my little girl.
Come with us.
I can't go without Grug.
That makes one of us. Count me in.
Really, Mom? Now?
Grug has no idea how to protect us.
In fact, he has no ideas at all!
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...
Face it.
If he actually had an idea of his own...
I'd have a heart attack and die!
Grug?
- Dad!
- Dad!
He's a big guy. How could he just disappear like that?
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen Dad.
Haven't seen him.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
I was up all night, because all these ideas just kept coming to me.
Is that a snake?
Belt, new and improved.
It's even self-tightening!
What is that on your head?
It's called desperation.
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."
And this one, I call it a "ride."
Rhymes with "Grug."
That doesn't rhyme...
It's going to get us places faster than shoes.
Yeah! Try to keep up!
I wish I had a ride.
And painting is a thing of the past.
I call this a "snapshot."
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
I call them "shades."
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.
Where do you get these great ideas?
Since I don't have a brain... they're coming from my stomach, down deep below... and then up again into my mind.
Grug, we have to keep moving.
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."
Isn't that something?
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."
Mom?
I know. It's bad.
I almost feel sorry for him.
No, I don't.
What are you trying to do, Grug?
See, I thought if I could have ideas... like Guy... maybe Eep would listen to me.
And maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.
Grug.
Is that what this is all about?
And I also thought it would kill your mother.
So win-win.
We're here!
Wow.
Cave!
Everyone inside.
Hurry up. Let's go.
Let's go. Go!
No!
No more caves, Grug.
What?
We're going to jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!
Wait. So you're all going to do this?
Thunk?
Sorry, Dad.
You have to stop worrying for all of us.
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!
The rules don't work out here!
They kept us alive!
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.
There's a difference.
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
We would be dead if we listened to you!
We have to follow Guy now.
Guy.
Guy? Run.
This is pointless!
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.
You're being irrational and counterproductive!
Big words anger me!
Keep talking.
Countermeasures!
You remember how you were this morning? You changed.
Idea man. Modern man.
I am a caveman!
No, no, no, wait!
No!
What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
Tar.
No. I have to get back to them.
Stop struggling.
No!
Grug, stop!
No one gets out of this.
Believe me...
I know.
Your...
Family. Yeah.
Sorry.
I was little when it happened.
Last thing my parents told me was...
"Don't hide."
"Live."
"Follow the sun."
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."
You followed the light.
My daughter is a lot like you.
No.
She's like you.
She loves you, but always forgets to say it.
Just like you forget to tell her.
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.
It's okay. That's what dads do.
That's right.
But we can't do that from here.
We need one of your ideas.
Come on. You can do it.
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!
I've got it.
Wow.
Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has.
Let's go.
There he is.
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.
Move me.
Okay, he sees us.
That's our cue. Now, work it!
He's not coming over.
I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.
Scared? I'll show you scared.
Hand me those acting sticks!
Hold on!
Yes! You did it.
- Grug!
- Dad!
Hey! We're okay!
Yeah.
We're okay.
Grug, your call.
Take us to Tomorrow.
Hurry!
Come on! We're going to make it!
You were right.
There it is! The sun!
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!
Run!
I don't understand.
The sun was right here.
It was right here.
We have to go back to the cave.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.
Everybody, hold my hand.
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.
Grug. What's wrong with you?
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!
Grug, listen to me.
We've got to get back to that cave.
No more dark.
No more hiding.
No more caves.
What's the point of all this?
To follow the light.
I can't change.
I don't have ideas.
But I have my strength.
And right now... that's all you need.
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!
It's too risky!
It's a chance.
I'll take that chance.
I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
That's a joke, right?
What's a "joke"?
He made it!
He made it.
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
You're not coming, are you?
When you make it, so will I.
No!
You did good.
Dadda!
Gran...
No mush. Just throw me.
Wait.
You surprised me today... lunkhead.
Still alive!
Time to go.
No.
I have too much to say to you.
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.
I can fix it.
This works good.
What do you call it?
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."
Because it rhymes with "Grug."
But you can change it if you want.
No. I like "hug."
I love you.
I...
Dad...
I'm scared.
Never be afraid.
There!
I see him!
Hey!
Hey, I did it!
Back! Stay back!
Stay back!
They're in trouble.
Hang on, I'm coming!
How do I get across?
I have to think. What would Guy do?
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?
What would I do?
Hold this.
I have... an idea!
Run!
Yes!
Douglas?
Hey, I know that guy.
Hold on!
It's not safe here.
I'll tell her.
I never got to tell him.
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...
Get out of the way!
Wow. You sound just like him.
Get out of the way!
Dadda!
He did it!
He's riding the sun.
But, not very well.
Everybody out of the way!
- Dad!
- Grug!
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?
I love you, too!
One, two, three, four... five... six... and seven.
And a half.
And eight.
Nine.
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!
A boy has to have a pet.
Turns out I'm a cat person.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there.
Yes! Coming through!
Wait!
This is me. My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in by the suntans and pets...
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...
but now we know the Croods will make it.
Because we changed the rules...
the ones that kept us in the dark.
And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change.
Release the baby!
Sort of.
So, from now on, we'll stay out here...
where we can follow the light.
[418][443]{Y:i}I found myself in a dark forest,
[444][473]{Y:i}for the clear path was lost.
[474][505]{Y:i}I cannot well recount|how I entered the wood,
[506][544]{Y:i}so long had it been|since I abandoned the true way.
[558][593]{Y:i}How shall I say what a dreary|and horrid wood it was?
[594][636]{Y:i}So bitter to endurw that death itself|would be but little worse.
[674][693]{Y:i}Several times upon my journey home,
[694][725]{Y:i}I had sensed an unseen rider|trailing my steed.
[727][760]{Y:i}Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished,
[772][791]{Y:i}leaving no trace.
[803][830]{Y:i}I feared this figure as an evil omen.
[831][871]{Y:i}All my life I've known such signs|and portents.
[921][957]{Y:i}And lo, at the rise of the hill,|I saw a spotted leopard,
[958][979]{Y:i}all teeth and fury.
[990][1015]{Y:i}At the sight of these beasts,|my heart sank.
[1016][1051]{Y:i}I sensed danger not for myself,|but for my beloved Beatrice.
[1078][1095]{Y:i}Away, demon!
[1200][1234]{Y:i}I drove my steed on,|racing for my father's villa.
[1235][1274]{Y:i}And Beatrice... nothing in this world|meant more to me than she.
[1283][1298]You were right, Dante.
[1299][1334]Truly this is a divine place.|Paradise on Earth.
[1336][1366]Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage,
[1368][1389]under God and all that is holy?
[1394][1444]Dante, I will not marry you|only to see you dead in this crusade.
[1445][1474]Jerusalem must be made Christian|once more.
[1475][1496]God is with us. We cannot fail.
[1519][1544]Through three years of war and horror,
[1545][1574]my love for Beatrice|had only grown stronger.
[1605][1627]As I came upon the family estate,
[1628][1659]I found all unnaturally dark and still.
[1705][1737]Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.
[1854][1881]The servants. All butchered.
[1982][2012]Father. Oh, Father.
[2021][2056]Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!
[2090][2110]In the name of God.
[2133][2149]Where is...
[2150][2169]Oh, no. No.
[2170][2190]Beloved, are you all right?
[2233][2251]Beatrice.
[2259][2288]Is it you or a dream?
[2301][2314]Who did this to you?
[2316][2330]I know not.
[2331][2363]A stranger. A foreigner.
[2386][2433]Do you remember that night|before you left?
[2434][2446]What we said?
[2447][2458]I remember.
[2459][2496]Did you betray me?
[2522][2540]Never.
[2631][2654]I never should have left your side.
[2656][2674]Forgive me.
[2715][2736]What?
[2772][2800]Do my eyes deceive me?
[2801][2842]Fear not for me, my love.|I told him you would be true to me.
[2852][2870]I knew you would.
[2917][2945]No! Wait! Come back to me!
[2976][2995]What is this?
[3031][3046]God in Heaven!
[3048][3067]What? Dante?
[3068][3093]She is mine.
[3094][3111]No!
[3118][3156]I have come to take|what was promised me...
[3158][3197]a soul meant for Heaven.
[3203][3218]It can't be true.
[3219][3240]Dante would never betray me.
[3252][3265]Beatrice!
[3267][3287]Release her, devil!
[3393][3413]Dante, help me!
[3424][3440]No!
[3538][3577]This will not stop me!|Nothing will stop me!
[3632][3644]No!
[3745][3762]What?
[3763][3780]No!
[3781][3807]God, give me strength!
[3834][3876]Come with me, mortal,|if you have the courage.
[3877][3909]Dante, don't let him take me!
[3917][3934]Beatrice!
[3976][4018]You will not keep me from my beloved!
[4088][4129]Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!
[4130][4170]You've got to save me! Dante!
[4200][4235]I'm coming for you!|I won't let him hurt you!
[4236][4277]Beatrice! No!
[4356][4387]- Martyr.|- You lost her.
[4388][4416]- Martyr.|- You lied to her.
[4417][4427]You lost her.
[4428][4450]Never will you know her flesh again.
[4452][4500]Never will you know her love.
[4502][4511]Her sin.
[4512][4536]- Martyr. Martyr.|- You lost her!
[4537][4561]- Her desire.|- You lied to her.
[4562][4586]- Your sins.|- Never will you know her flesh again.
[4608][4623]Your sins.
[4624][4648]Never will you know her flesh.
[4649][4669]You are bound.
[4670][4706]- Martyr.|- You lied to her.
[4707][4731]- Martyr.|- Martyr.
[4748][4783]Why, God?|Why are you doing this?
[4796][4830]It is not the Lord that brought you|to this fate, Dante.
[4854][4880]What are you? Shade or living man?
[4882][4912]Not man, though once I was.
[4913][4952]I lived under Augustus in the time|of the false and lying gods.
[4953][4984]Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?
[4985][5013]He who wrote the Aeneid,|the treasure of Rome?
[5014][5038]Why do you seek such woe, Dante?
[5039][5067]I seek only my beloved Beatrice|and nothing more.
[5068][5103]But I cannot open these accursed gates!
[5117][5147]Have you lost all faith in God, O man?
[5148][5171]Has the way been so obscured?
[5194][5226]Heavenly Father,|if only one soul should be saved,
[5227][5252]please let it be Beatrice.
[5281][5308]Help! Help!
[5373][5423]Dante, if you broke your promise to me,|I'll be forever damned.
[5425][5468]Are you prepared to be judged in this place?
[5469][5501]Do you think you are without sin?
[5503][5528]Please, don't let him take me!
[5529][5568]Beatrice. Beatrice!
[5911][5946]What did Beatrice do|to deserve such a monstrous fate?
[5948][5986]She made a wager with Lucifer|to see your safe return.
[5987][5998]She lost.
[6000][6017]Wager. What wager?
[6018][6046]Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.
[6048][6066]I never betrayed her.
[6067][6095]You only deceive yourself, mortal.
[6096][6140]By all that is holy, I vow to forsake|all pleasures of the flesh
[6141][6165]until I return from this noble crusade.
[6166][6211]I gave myself to you because I know|you will be faithful to our love.
[6225][6257]And when I return, we shall be married.
[6258][6291]And live to grow old and see|our grandchildren have children.
[6331][6361]I love you more than Heaven itself.
[6394][6413]- Take this.|- But, Beatrice,
[6414][6443]this has been in your family|for generations.
[6449][6463]It is a true relic
[6464][6495]said to contain a thorn|from the crown of Christ.
[6496][6514]Bring it back to me.
[6560][6585]Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.
[6587][6606]I beg of you, please!
[6607][6643]I must save Beatrice|even if it means my death.
[6644][6694]I will guide you, but you must put aside|all division of spirit
[6695][6723]and gather your soul against all fear.
[6738][6755]I fear nothing.
[6756][6772]Then proceed.
[6828][6871]Charon will carry us|to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.
[6873][6897]Nine circles comprise the Inferno,
[6899][6922]with Lucifer residing in the lowest.
[6928][6944]Horrifying, yes.
[6946][6962]There are more damned in Hell...
[6964][6986]than liberated in Paradise.
[6997][7022]I can see their sins in life.
[7050][7087]Charon's boat has grown wide|and mighty over the millennia.
[7088][7123]He has had to compensate|for the ever-increasing damned.
[7125][7160]Through me the way to the city of woe.
[7161][7202]Through me the way to everlasting pain.
[7203][7217]I don't like the look of this.
[7218][7249]Now shall I ferry you into the fire,
[7250][7286]the cold and the everlasting darkness.
[7287][7326]Abandon hope,|all ye who enter here.
[7327][7346]How could God allow this?
[7347][7382]God allowed free will, even for his angels.
[7384][7417]It was Lucifer that devised such torment.
[7418][7439]Mercenaries of Florentina,
[7440][7466]in payment for reclaiming|the Holy Land,
[7467][7522]your Immaculate Father hereby|absolves you of all your sins.
[7523][7543]Go with grace.
[7575][7588]Praise God.
[7601][7630]Do you think a priest|has such divine power?
[7631][7656]Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?
[7657][7671]Of course, Francesco.
[7672][7713]Why would you doubt the Church?|That is the path to Hell, my friend.
[7714][7731]How soon until you leave?
[7732][7758]Tomorrow, before dawn.
[7759][7790]Dante, promise to watch over my brother.
[7791][7815]Beatrice, I'm no child.
[7823][7845]No harm will come to him, my love.
[7846][7867]I'll protect him as if he were my own.
[7886][7910]You who are living,
[7911][7945]be gone from those who are dead.
[7946][7965]I will not part, Charon!
[7966][7990]I must cross!
[7992][8018]I give you my soul to find Beatrice!
[8019][8060]It belongs to us already, mortal.
[8529][8556]Your will is nothing, mortal.
[8557][8593]You will never traverse the circles of Hell.
[8617][8639]Take me to Beatrice, demon!
[8972][8995]Virgil, where did you disappear to?
[8999][9019]I am pure spirit, Dante.
[9020][9057]I cannot help you fight your enemies.|I am naught but a guide.
[9303][9346]Dante! Can you hear me?
[9356][9384]Can anyone hear me?
[9435][9456]Dante?
[9457][9487]Thank God.|I knew you would find me.
[9489][9503]Dante?
[9505][9535]Beatrice, my love.
[9537][9557]Is... Is that you?
[9610][9634]No! Dante!
[9635][9660]No, stop! Stop, Dante!
[9779][9801]What's happening?
[9803][9834]How many ways can a man die?
[9835][9846]No!
[9847][9871]Come to me, Beatrice.
[9879][9914]- I want to admire you.|- No. Let me go.
[9915][9954]There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.
[9963][9995]There are untold pleasures here,
[9996][10051]pleasures your human senses|could not fathom.
[10052][10066]Never!
[10206][10263]There is nothing you can do|to hurt me, child.
[10268][10322]What you perceive of me is a literal shadow|of my former self,
[10324][10349]but you...
[10362][10419]you can die a thousand deaths by my will.
[10496][10512]What?
[10543][10571]Think of the tortures I can create
[10572][10624]for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.
[10694][10721]Tell me more about your life on Earth,|great poet.
[10722][10749]I know your deeds,|but not the man you were.
[10750][10777]Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.
[10778][10798]I was the son of a commoner,
[10799][10833]and though I died a dozen years|before the birth of Christ,
[10834][10857]I foretold his coming in my works.
[10858][10880]What is this place, Virgil?
[10881][10914]The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.
[10920][10942]Here suffer those that did not sin,
[10943][10971]yet did not have the required faith.
[10972][11019]This is the realm where virtuous pagans|and unbaptized babies reside.
[11094][11122]A child? Here?
[11123][11143]How can this be?
[11157][11175]Dearest Dante.
[11177][11225]This is the fourth letter I have written|and the fourth I have destroyed.
[11227][11256]I am five months with child.
[11265][11296]I fear telling your father|as we have yet to be married.
[11305][11343]I do not know how much longer|I can conceal my state.
[11344][11377]All I ask is that you return to me soon.
[11378][11412]Leave this terrible crusade,
[11413][11449]and we... we can be married.
[11536][11555]My lady, what is it?
[11556][11579]The baby.
[11719][11748]This is my son.
[11801][11834]Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.
[11845][11881]Come. Quickly, Dante.|This is not a place to contemplate.
[11918][11942]What madness is this?
[12116][12142]Lord, too many.
[12220][12236]Virgil. Virgil!
[12237][12256]In here, Dante. Hurry.
[12447][12475]What is that sound?|More demons?
[12477][12495]No.
[12575][12598]They are familiar to me.
[12599][12632]The great rulers and philosophers|of the golden age.
[12633][12659]Is that not Hector and Electra?
[12660][12679]Caesar and King Latinus?
[12680][12704]And do not forget Plato,|Socrates and Aristotle.
[12706][12722]I have never agreed to such terms.
[12724][12771]I say that God exists in the realm of ideas,|accessible to human thought.
[12772][12834]Plato, there is only one philosophy|in the Inferno - Lucifer's.
[12835][12875]Do not look for liberation here, old friend.
[12887][12913]- Do you know this shade?|- He was Saladin,
[12914][12931]a noble Kurdish sultan.
[12933][12975]I fought his forces in the Crusades|under Richard the Lionheart.
[13032][13065]Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.
[13084][13121]We will wash these holy lands|in your heathen blood.
[13128][13142]Father...
[13154][13184]Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.
[13185][13227]Dante! Dante, the forces|of Saladin arw routed!
[13229][13247]Dante?
[13615][13637]My God, what is it?
[13638][13657]He is King Minos.
[13658][13679]Once a king of Crete
[13680][13714]before Daedalus|boiled him in his own bath.
[13715][13751]Now, Minos foreverjudges the damned,
[13753][13780]sending them to their circle below.
[13790][13807]- Through him...|- Traitor.
[13808][13828]...all must pass.
[13829][13846]Heretic.
[13857][13875]Glutton.
[13883][13902]Hoarder.
[13903][13921]Suicide!
[13940][13973]Who comes into my house of pain?
[13974][14012]He who seeks Beatrice.|Let me pass, that I may find her.
[14039][14090]Turn back.|There is no place for you here.
[14091][14122]Not yet, O mortal.
[14123][14160]With your permission or not,|I pass, monster.
[14162][14202]You dare so speak|to the judge of the damned?
[14258][14274]I dare.
[14555][14596]I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.
[14613][14648]Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!
[14650][14688]Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.
[15027][15048]Here you must descend.
[15096][15118]The damned are trying to flee.
[15119][15142]Lucifer will not be pleased.
[15152][15186]Let him come.|If these demons can die in the Inferno,
[15187][15208]then so can he.
[15426][15442]What is this place?
[15443][15477]This is the second circle,|the circle of Lust.
[15478][15510]To this torment are condemned|the carnal damned.
[15511][15531]They are the great lustful of the world.
[15532][15590]See there Semiramis and Ninus,|Anthony and Cleopatra,
[15591][15615]Helen of Troy and Paris.
[15616][15642]The storms of lust forever rage
[15643][15666]while passion inflames the heart.
[15692][15727]Listen, on the wind.
[15729][15756]- Dante, help me.|- Beatrice!
[15757][15775]Please, Dante.
[15777][15793]Dante.
[15795][15820]- Beatrice!|- Dante, hold.
[15821][15840]Beatrice!
[15856][15890]A new visitor arrives, sisters.
[15910][15944]Come, embrace us, Dante.
[15946][15988]We know what you want.|We can see it in your eyes.
[15990][16016]Unbearable lust.
[16027][16059]No, let me pass.|Stand aside, harlot.
[16064][16104]If you won't have us, we shall have you!
[16416][16438]Dante, how could you let this happen?
[16439][16455]How could you betray me?
[16456][16476]No, Beatrice. I swear.
[16478][16502]What do you swear, Dante?
[16503][16530]Do you want me to show her the truth?
[16531][16570]Serpent. It's all lies.|I never betrayed her.
[16572][16597]I'll kill you!
[16608][16665]You can hide from|neither memory nor sin, Dante.
[16705][16750]What? King Richard wants us|to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?
[16751][16767]That is his command?
[16773][16809]He will negotiate their exchange|for the rwturn of the true Cross.
[16810][16842]Negotiate with heretics?
[16843][16880]Never! They deserve only damnation.
[16910][16931]Get your hands off her.
[16941][16978]Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.
[17063][17101]Good and noble knights, have mercy.|I beg you!
[17102][17143]This prisoner only tried to save me|from the guards.
[17153][17193]Please, sir, show compassion.|He is no threat.
[17195][17224]He is a heretic.|He gets what he deserves.
[17257][17295]Kind lord, if you would show him mercy
[17296][17334]perhaps I could give you comfort in return.
[17335][17366]What comfort could you give|a soldier of God?
[17399][17431]The nights here are lonely and cold,|my lord,
[17432][17462]even for a soldier of God.
[17463][17481]Perhaps I could warm thee.
[17482][17509]Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.
[17510][17538]How is it a sin if I am already absolved?
[17540][17560]Guards, hold.
[17621][17651]Thank you, Lord. You are kind.
[17653][17676]I could see it in your eyes.
[17677][17701]And your promise of comfort?
[17790][17815]How could you do that to me...
[17816][17838]to us?
[17839][17865]I was weak. The war changed me.
[17867][17902]You know who I am inside.|We've known each other since childhood.
[17903][17929]Does she know you, Dante,
[17930][17968]or did the Crusades show her your true self?
[17973][18001]Beatrice! Forgive me!
[18016][18041]Please forgive me.
[18064][18111]No, it's not true.|He wouldn't do this to me.
[18112][18132]Dante!
[18134][18151]What did I say?
[18152][18187]Even the purest of souls|can be corrupted.
[18189][18223]Dante is not the man you once knew.
[18224][18265]You did this to him.|You corrupted his heart.
[18280][18309]I've had no need to influence humanity
[18310][18338]for many millennia, my dear.
[18340][18377]I simply introduced sin.
[18378][18421]Man is the one who has spread it|like a disease,
[18423][18461]cultivating it, empowering it.
[18583][18617]It is not our fault, none of it.
[18619][18637]Man is good.
[18638][18667]No, you don't understand.
[18668][18703]The Earth is another form of Hell,
[18705][18735]and men are its demons.
[18800][18829]I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.
[18830][18865]I could blame the Crusades,|but I know it was my own weakness,
[18866][18881]my own sin.
[18882][18921]Have you considered she is not|the only soul you are here to save?
[18942][18969]I seek only my beloved Beatrice,
[18970][18988]and nothing more.
[19013][19027]It is Cerberus,
[19029][19069]guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.
[19206][19246]That is the foulest fate|one could ever imagine.
[19248][19286]And it is your fate as well,|for the true circle of Gluttony
[19288][19316]lies inside of Cerberus's body.
[19318][19365]Inside? Good Lord, isn't there|perhaps a way around it?
[19366][19401]No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.
[19402][19438]So be it! For her I will conquer even this.
[19439][19460]Face me, wretched creature!
[19500][19521]Release me, demon!
[19704][19746]Hell can get no more horrible|than this place.
[19747][19774]I find this circle most unpleasant.
[19775][19799]You're a shade.|You should try wearing skin.
[19801][19822]Such a fate. Look at them all.
[19823][19861]How could such harmless sin|provoke such everlasting torment?
[19862][19899]The gluttons -|what they could not satisfy in life,
[19900][19930]in death they shall be denied for eternity.
[19932][19963]Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?
[19964][20003]I too am from Florence.|You were born before I died.
[20004][20022]I do not know you, spirit.
[20023][20055]You know me. I am Ciacco.
[20056][20074]Gluttony was my offense,
[20075][20110]and here I remain|mere skin and bones.
[20111][20146]Can you help me,|free me from this agony?
[20147][20161]Please, please.
[20162][20207]Your suffering weighs heavy|on my heart, spirit. Be free.
[20356][20367]Virgil, what's happening?
[20368][20399]How dare you free the damned?
[20400][20450]They deserve torment for wasting|their fleeting precious lives.
[20451][20479]And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?
[20480][20501]She is the exception.
[20502][20547]A pure soul to remind me|of my place in Heaven,
[20548][20587]to remind me of the light of my father.
[20596][20621]But let me ask you, Dante,
[20622][20652]what of your father?
[20663][20689]Beatrice, you must eat.
[20690][20709]I have no appetite.
[20711][20732]I know you miss my son,
[20734][20767]but you must keep up|your constitution, child.
[20768][20790]You're nothing but bone.
[20791][20822]It's unappealing for a lady.
[20840][20870]Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?
[20919][20945]It's just another memory, Dante.
[20956][20979]Your father's memory.
[20981][21021]- My father?|- He is here with us, Dante.
[21022][21043]Would you like to visit him?
[21146][21175]Do these tortures never end?
[21196][21214]Virgil, Beatrice is not here.
[21215][21236]We must escape this beast!
[21293][21319]What is this?
[21328][21367]Cerberus's black heart.|Destroy it, quickly.
[21663][21681]Beatrice!
[21986][22018]More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.
[22019][22048]What could one man do|with so much treasure?
[22059][22097]This is the fourth circle - Grwed.
[22270][22308]All the Earth's treasure|that is beneath the moon or ever was
[22309][22337]cannot give relief to these weary souls.
[22397][22432]What a mockery is made|of the brief battle for possessions
[22433][22451]that makes so short a life.
[22452][22481]These damned remind me of my father.
[22604][22644]What? Where are my last three coins?
[22645][22664]Dante?
[22676][22691]Dante!
[22709][22724]Bella!
[22741][22757]Yes, husband.
[22759][22787]I'm short three crowns.
[22788][22812]Are you stealing from me, woman?
[22814][22847]No, Alighiero,|I would never do such a thing.
[22865][22879]Liar!
[22922][22942]I knew I'd have to watch you.
[22943][22965]Now, tell me where|you've hidden it, woman,
[22967][22995]before I throttle you dead.
[23025][23048]Don't hit her! Mother!
[23190][23216]Can you believe that in my youth|I wanted to be a poet?
[23217][23241]But all I ever knew was violence.
[23242][23260]And what became of your mother?
[23262][23283]She died of a fever a year later.
[23284][23305]It was sudden and terrible.
[23322][23363]There is no room to pity the dead here, son.
[23365][23411]Lucifer did not lie, but then again|how could you not be here, Father?
[23418][23446]You think you're a greater man than me?
[23447][23476]That you're above reproach for your sins?
[23477][23513]I took up the Crusade.|The priest absolved us.
[23519][23545]And you actually believed him?
[23546][23573]No man can absolve you of your sins,
[23574][23612]but some men can be rewarded in Hell.
[23717][23747]Lucifer offered me a thousand years|free of torture
[23748][23792]and endless gold|if I would slay my own son.
[23797][23817]And where will you spend this gold, Father?
[23818][23848]Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.
[23899][23914]So be it.
[24071][24094]I always despised you.
[24113][24137]But you became me, son.
[24139][24171]You belong here. You always have.
[24216][24249]So I can be damned in Hell with you?|Never!
[24336][24376]It's time to claim my prize, boy.
[24377][24395]Then claim it.
[24545][24570]You want gold, Father?
[24571][24586]It's yours.
[24648][24676]I cannot go on.
[24677][24693]You must, Dante.
[24694][24727]Steel yourself.|The journey is not half over.
[24728][24775]How do I know you're not|another enemy sent by Lucifer?
[24776][24800]You could be luring me|to my doom all along.
[24801][24823]Another trick, another deception.
[24824][24843]Search inside yourself.
[24844][24872]You know I was sent here from on high.
[24874][24892]Forgive me, Virgil.
[24893][24922]This place has affected my mind.|Let us move on.
[24993][25033]Please, Lord.|Forgive me of my transgressions.
[25034][25060]Save me from this horrible torment.
[25061][25093]Please, I beg of you.
[25138][25158]My God.
[25159][25196]I have heard your prayers,|beloved Beatrice,
[25198][25219]and I have come for you.
[25234][25268]There is no escape, little soul.
[25269][25299]Your prayers are worthless here.
[25408][25427]Rejoice, child,
[25428][25475]for you are about to be granted|a rare privilege in the Inferno.
[25485][25516]I am making you my bride.
[25525][25558]You will become the Queen of Hell.
[25570][25592]Are you not pleased?
[25712][25753]I cannot stand this wretched place.
[25754][25789]For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.
[25790][25817]The very air reeks of fury.
[25819][25842]Watch your ankles.
[25882][25912]More food! We're starving!
[25948][25964]We need more food.
[25989][26011]We're doing the best we can.
[26013][26048]There isn't enough food to go around.|Quiet! Quiet down!
[26049][26071]There is nothing we can do.
[26072][26092]The granaries are ablaze.
[26093][26114]We barely have enough rations|for our own men.
[26115][26153]Then I'm leaving this post.|I will not put up with guard duty any longer.
[26154][26176]You can't do that, Dante.
[26177][26207]We came here to kill these heretics,|not coddle them.
[26208][26230]We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
[26231][26269]Saladin took the city last year|and spared Christian lives.
[26270][26280]We should do the same.
[26281][26309]Since when arw herwtics|worth a Christian life?
[26310][26328]Enough. Enough!
[26438][26480]Keep your mind, Dante.|Do not dwell on past deeds here.
[26500][26529]See the souls over whom|anger has prevailed.
[26538][26583]In the black sludge of the River Styx|do they wish they had never been born.
[26584][26619]The fools. It is here we must cross.
[26705][26724]We travel in that?
[26725][26749]Perhaps we would be safer swimming.
[26818][26845]I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.
[26846][26873]Is this a friend of yours, great poet?
[26874][26902]Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.
[26904][26929]He was the son of Ares|and a king in his day.
[26931][26966]Hold on.|The ride will be somewhat bumpy.
[26975][27009]The angry souls know no end to their fury.
[27010][27055]Who are you that comes here|before your time?
[27056][27076]If I come, I do not remain.
[27077][27111]But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.
[27112][27129]You were Filippo Argenti in life.
[27130][27174]Come down, Dante,|and face your old enemy!
[27176][27211]Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.
[27400][27438]Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near,
[27440][27465]housing its solemn citizens within.
[27486][27534]Damned of Dis rejoice,|for your lord, Lucifer,
[27535][27570]is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.
[27571][27623]Truly this will be a marriage|of Heaven and Hell.
[27624][27653]Hurry, Phlegias! Run!
[27721][27733]Beatrice!
[27773][27813]Outcasts of Heaven, race despised,
[27814][27857]why do you rail against a will|that cannot be stopped?
[27866][27883]Dante?
[28096][28128]He has taken her into the tombs.|Hurry, Dante.
[28178][28230]Gone. Why does he do this?|Bait us on? Keep us running?
[28232][28267]Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul|as well as Beatrice's.
[28269][28293]He's luring us to the ninth circle.
[28305][28340]- What is this place?|- The tombs of heresy.
[28342][28375]Here in the sixth circle|you will find endless heretics
[28376][28397]burning in eternal fire.
[28410][28465]O Tuscan, who walks through this place|speaking so decorously,
[28466][28498]know that I am Farinata.
[28499][28548]Farinata, another hated man in life.|What do you want, spirit?
[28549][28562]Know this.
[28564][28608]The damned can foresee the future|but can never know the present.
[28609][28663]Your future, Dante,|is filled with death and destruction.
[28664][28703]Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell,
[28705][28751]and you will be damned with us forever.
[28845][28864]I never liked him.
[28873][28887]What's happening?
[28888][28904]The harrowing of Hell.
[28905][28930]Christ's death forever quakes this circle.
[28931][28948]We must hurry.
[28972][29008]Let me go. What do you want from me?
[29009][29042]I have taken countless brides|over the millennia -
[29043][29083]Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.
[29085][29140]But, unlike them,|your spirit is pure, unspoiled.
[29141][29161]I will never succumb to you.
[29162][29178]Kill me again and again,
[29179][29221]slit my throat, tear me to pieces,|but I will never love you.
[29261][29287]Yes, such passion.
[29288][29311]You have a fire inside you.
[29313][29331]After we are properly married,
[29332][29373]you will give me a brood|to carry on my legacy.
[29374][29429]You will be birthing my children for eternity,|sweet soul.
[29445][29471]Virgil, do you hear...
[29547][29582]Who is this new monster?|What does he want?
[29583][29615]The minotaur guards passage|into the seventh circle.
[29616][29631]Be cautious, Dante.
[29643][29660]How dare you threaten us?
[29661][29697]Do you think he is the duke of Athens|who served up your death above?
[29698][29731]Off with you.|Begone, abomination!
[29733][29752]Virgil, I think you've made him angry.
[29753][29773]Now, while he is blind with rage.
[29774][29799]Hold fast. Steady.
[29800][29816]Now move!
[29894][29916]You have many surprises, poet.
[29917][29950]Perhaps you would have made|a great warrior in life.
[29951][29990]It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.
[30073][30100]This circle is reserved for the violent.
[30101][30124]Those who have done violence|against others
[30126][30153]forever boil in the blood they have shed.
[30169][30188]How shall we cross?
[30189][30210]It's impossible.
[30247][30266]You summoned me, great Virgil.
[30267][30285]Greetings, Nessus.
[30287][30327]We need passage across the bloody|Phlegethon. Can you help us?
[30328][30358]Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.
[30376][30395]The river is treacherous.
[30412][30449]Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila,
[30450][30472]and countless others.
[30480][30512]The damned here|are worse off than the Styx.
[30513][30556]These were the kings of bloodshed|and despoilment.
[30727][30757]Be wary of the next passage, friends.
[30758][30778]My thanks, Nessus.
[30780][30806]Good luck to you, mortal soul.
[30833][30868]We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.
[30910][30938]This is no forest.
[30939][30973]Yes, they are those who did violence|to themselves.
[30975][31002]- This is the wood of suicide.|- Dante...
[31004][31028]- No, my friend! Turn back!|- Come to me, Dante.
[31029][31056]Come to me, Dante.
[31058][31081]Come to me.
[31083][31127]Why do you break me?|Have you no pity?
[31128][31141]Mother?
[31142][31158]Yes, son.
[31159][31186]I too am among the damned.
[31187][31210]But how can this be?
[31217][31237]When a soul takes its own life,
[31238][31261]Minos judges it to this circle.
[31263][31293]Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.
[31294][31317]No body, only pain.
[31318][31351]No, Mother, you don't belong here.
[31352][31368]You died of fever.
[31377][31401]Her heart gave out from the fever.
[31402][31427]She was just too fragile.
[31428][31447]Where is she now, Father?
[31448][31502]In Paradise, son,|with all the souls of pure light.
[31507][31531]I despised your father's cruelty,
[31532][31559]but I was too weak to defy him.
[31561][31585]And so, I...
[31586][31601]I took my...
[31617][31664]You learned your father's ways,|but you are not lost.
[31665][31690]You can redeem yourself.
[31692][31735]Beatrice was all I had.|How could I have betrayed her?
[31737][31776]The pain you endure purifies you, son.
[31778][31839]Heed my words. You must look|into your deepest sin to save her.
[31849][31868]And what of you?
[31869][31919]Only the living can redeem themselves.|I cannot.
[31920][31952]This is too cruel a punishment|for you, Mother.
[31954][31997]God must know this is not your fault.|I'm going to free you.
[32080][32116]My soul belongs to God now, son.
[32275][32300]We are still in the seventh circle?
[32301][32328]Yes, the Abominable Sands.
[32329][32368]It is here the damned|did violence against God.
[32404][32436]We came here to kill these heretics.
[32437][32460]We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
[32461][32506]Saladin took the city last year and spared|Christian lives. We should do the same.
[32507][32542]Since when arw herwtics|worth a Christian life?
[32543][32561]Enough. Enough!
[32573][32588]Dante, no!
[32730][32746]Fight with me, Crusaders.
[32747][32768]Spill the blood of these heathens.
[32769][32797]Their souls are already lost.
[32804][32831]Dante, what have you done?
[33083][33106]Crusaders? Herw?
[33107][33124]Why are you being punished?
[33125][33156]Our cause was holy.|We are absolved of sin.
[33185][33238]The bishop lied, did he not, brother?
[33239][33268]Francesco, not you too.
[33269][33295]God never condones violence of any kind.
[33296][33327]There was no holy war.|Don't you understand?
[33328][33348]The priests lied.
[33349][33379]Of all people, how could you be here?
[33385][33408]It was you! You did this to me!
[33410][33428]No, no, no, listen.
[33429][33466]You don't deserve the life given to you,
[33467][33490]you don't deserve Beatrice,
[33491][33529]and now you will join us here forever|where you belong.
[33591][33601]Brother.
[33664][33685]I am not your brother.
[33687][33721]You're an animal, Dante.|A monster!
[33747][33770]I will not let you have her.
[33915][33946]You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.
[34157][34197]It's over. Justice is inevitable.
[34200][34220]Not yet.
[34595][34616]He can rest for a while,
[34618][34669]but he is forever bound here|like a shadow of time unforgotten.
[34671][34697]He was a good man.
[34698][34722]He doesn't deserve such suffering.
[34723][34765]Heavenly Father,|let the soul of Francesco rise
[34766][34791]into your divine Paradise.
[34812][34827]What?
[34844][34876]Pray for your own soul, Dante,
[34877][34919]for it will freeze with me forever|in Cocytus below.
[34920][34946]I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.
[34947][34973]Yes, a contest.
[34974][35025]Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice|is soon my queen.
[35144][35174]This is the union|of the three great rivers of Hell.
[35294][35316]Another beast I must slay?
[35330][35367]No, Dante. Geryon is our passage|to the eighth circle.
[35372][35407]Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.
[35517][35533]My thanks, Geryon.
[35534][35554]This way, Dante.
[35573][35595]We are in the circle of Fraud
[35596][35630]which one commits|upon those who trust in him.
[35669][35694]You must travel these ten malebolge alone.
[35695][35722]And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.
[35723][35757]Alone? What of you, great poet?
[35759][35778]I will not be far, believe me.
[35780][35798]You have proven yourself worthy.
[35800][35845]Now hurry, Dante,|lest you lose your love forever.
[35868][35902]I traveled on alone,|over the flatterers and simonists,
[35903][35933]and as I ran I was overwhelmed|with my sins
[35934][35966]as if every malebolge|was a chasm of memory.
[35967][35992]I felt my mind weakening with every step,
[35993][36018]and yet I would not cease.
[36069][36106]Release that one.|His ransom has been paid.
[36117][36131]My ransom?
[36132][36169]No. No, you didn't...
[36170][36199]You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?
[36200][36230]Didn't you? You whore.
[36231][36249]You have shamed me.
[36250][36267]You are not my wife, do you hear?
[36268][36293]Filthy whore. Whore!
[36318][36352]I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.
[36353][36373]I swear I'll kill you.
[36394][36444]You bastard. You'll see everyone|you ever loved dead by my hand.
[36446][36466]Dead, dead!
[36479][36507]No, it can't be.
[36618][36639]I have come for the woman.
[36640][36654]No!
[36685][36717]Leave her alone. She's innocent.
[36718][36738]Run, Beatrice, run!
[36748][36771]Get out of my house, filthy dog.
[36850][36881]- Get away from me!|- There is no escape for you.
[36882][36903]Stay back.
[36921][36937]No!
[37076][37105]Vengeance is finally mine.
[37148][37184]It was me. Beatrice's death.
[37185][37208]They were all murdered because of me.
[37209][37249]At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.
[37251][37286]You are the true cause of|Beatrice's suffering,
[37287][37320]and the damnation of so many others.
[37321][37348]How could you have done such evil to me?
[37349][37390]Tear the heart from my chest,|rip the very soul from my body?
[37392][37423]These sins are my own.
[37425][37446]You have no right to Beatrice.
[37447][37466]Relinquish her.
[37520][37553]Never! Dwellers, night fiends,
[37554][37574]and torturers of the pit,
[37575][37611]strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.
[37612][37628]Lucifer!
[37772][37804]Beatrice, stop!|You don't know what you're doing!
[37814][37832]I thought I knew many things.
[37833][37882]I thought love was real,|but it was only an illusion, a fraud.
[37883][37920]There is nothing left for me|in all of God's crwation.
[37973][37988]Yes, my love.
[37989][38025]In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.
[38026][38050]Beatrice, don't do it!
[38084][38127]When you had your way with that girl,|you gave me to Lucifer.
[38128][38151]It was all because of you.
[38168][38183]Beatrice!
[38227][38241]No!
[38242][38262]No, no.
[38289][38320]The faithful has lost her faith.
[38321][38357]The incorruptible|has become corrupted.
[38358][38406]The true innocent has given way|to the sins of man,
[38407][38436]like all the rest before her.
[38437][38475]Who can now deny me my rights?
[38570][38602]I will leave you with my consort.
[38616][38648]She has so much to show you.
[38754][38784]This is where you belong, Dante.
[38785][38812]You are the greatest fraud of all.
[38813][38839]You've lied to me, deceived me,
[38840][38875]and for that you shall suffer.
[38896][38916]Beatrice, don't do this.
[38992][39009]You never loved me.
[39010][39030]It was all a lie, all of it...
[39031][39052]our whole life!
[39114][39158]Beatrice, listen to me.|I braved the circles of Hell for you.
[39159][39184]You mean nothing to me.
[39185][39229]But I have faced my sins.|I am ready to take you home.
[39230][39266]Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.
[39267][39293]Look deep into the ninth circle...
[39328][39351]the circle of traitors.
[39411][39444]God in Heaven, what happened?
[39445][39486]Who is responsible|for this massacre?
[39505][39542]Take care of my sister.|I am responsible.
[39564][39608]Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.
[39610][39660]When the noble Saladin|learns of this atrocity
[39661][39691]he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.
[39701][39720]Take care of Beatrice.
[39721][39747]Dante, protect her with your life.
[39816][39842]Beatrice, I'm coming home.
[39897][39934]I wanted nothing more|than to see you and beg for forgiveness.
[39935][39972]I will never forgive what you've done, never.
[39977][40007]But while I live, I can absolve you.
[40008][40041]Forgive me, and free yourself.
[40050][40073]My cross.
[40074][40098]I brought it back to you.
[40099][40131]Accept again the love of God.
[40265][40282]Dante.
[40339][40357]I forgive you.
[40358][40397]I never wanted any harm to come to you.
[40488][40515]You have done well, my friend.
[40516][40547]And though you may not|understand it now, Dante,
[40548][40601]you have perhaps saved far more|than just one innocent soul.
[40637][40677]Wait. I can't be separated from her now.|I've come this far.
[40679][40709]You cannot claim|a place with her yet, Dante.
[40716][40760]You have to face the true enemy,|in the lowest part of the ninth circle...
[40761][40781]the circle of traitors.
[40782][40831]There, you must face the king of traitors,|Lucifer himself.
[40832][40865]He guards your only escape|from the Inferno.
[40873][40914]We shall be reunited one day. I promise.
[40927][40942]Goodbye, my love.
[40971][41009]This last trial is for you to face alone.
[41020][41039]Godspeed, my friend.
[41047][41084]Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.
[41086][41113]I will make you pay for her suffering.
[41121][41142]I am coming for you.
[41261][41286]I fell, not into fire,
[41315][41346]but into a vast, frozen wasteland.
[41360][41382]The very center of Hell,
[41407][41429]furthest place in all of creation
[41430][41454]from the divine light of God.
[41474][41520]Treachery, the ninth circle|of the Inferno.
[41595][41642]I walked through the darkness,|numb with bitter cold.
[41671][41702]All about me were forsaken,
[41703][41753]frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.
[41811][41867]Who are you to walk the paths of Hell|so warmly, O living man?
[41868][41894]Damned soul, where is Lucifer?
[41896][41929]Tell me, before I too freeze|in this miserable hell.
[41930][41994]Wipe the icy tears from my eyes,|and I shall tell you.
[42085][42122]The Lord of Hell dwells|at the center of this frozen lake.
[42123][42142]Past the storms of Ptolomea,
[42143][42171]deep in the center pit of Judecca,
[42172][42197]there his icy halls are well protected,
[42198][42238]and none but the mightiest|may cleave a path.
[42239][42265]But can you believe me?
[42266][42287]Can you believe a traitor?
[42333][42374]Long did I wander|the dim and icy paths of Hell.
[42410][42436]Past the frozen giants of legend...
[42437][42482]Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.
[42499][42522]I was battered by a frigid wind
[42523][42560]that was like the beating|of Lucifer's black wings.
[42605][42641]Finally, after a seeming eternity,
[42642][42700]I came to a passage blocked|by the frozen links of a mighty chain.
[42723][42753]Lucifer thinks he can block my way|with this?
[42754][42782]He thinks he can stay my vengeance?
[43132][43164]Welcome, great Dante.
[43165][43205]Welcome to your final resting place,
[43206][43226]the circle of traitors.
[43227][43257]Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell
[43259][43282]so that I may be reunited with my beloved,
[43284][43313]but not before I rid the world|of your corruption.
[43315][43343]You will never see Beatrice again.
[43344][43375]The path to Purgatory lies through me.
[43377][43416]You are the warrior|of a weak and dying God,
[43418][43441]a God who is the true evil.
[43442][43470]His power wanes over the world.
[43471][43510]Silence. Your lies|have no power over me, Devil.
[43511][43552]I will rend the very soul|from your frozen body.
[43553][43575]Indignant fool.
[43576][43606]Come, let me devour your soul
[43607][43633]as I devoured Judas Iscariot.
[43634][43689]You will remain in this pit|until creation's last breath, do you hear?
[43690][43710]Never!
[43720][43746]You are not invincible here.
[43747][43772]You are just another demon
[43773][43814]and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.
[43830][43877]You cannot destroy me!
[44021][44048]What have you done to me?
[44149][44180]I have slain you, great beast.
[44181][44215]Victory is mine.
[44216][44234]What's this?
[44333][44358]New life writhes inside him.
[44359][44377]No!
[44461][44497]Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.
[44499][44531]Many have tried, but all have failed me.
[44532][44567]Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...
[44569][44605]Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.
[44614][44635]Minion? I do not serve you.
[44637][44666]Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!
[44675][44696]Do you not?
[44698][44737]You freed me|from my eternal torment.
[44738][44762]I came only for Beatrice.
[44763][44794]Beatrice? She was only bait.
[44795][44823]It was you I wanted all along.
[44824][44869]Don't you see?|I was bound by God in this frozen pit,
[44870][44904]only my shadow self allowed to roam free.
[44905][44947]It took a mortal to release me -|you, Dante.
[44954][44971]No, it isn't true!
[44972][44989]I defeated you before.
[44990][45031]Show me the path from Hell,|or I will end your miserable existence.
[45033][45058]Destroy an angel of God?
[45059][45080]You arrogant gnat.
[45082][45108]Such vanity, such pride.
[45110][45141]I could have slain you|the moment you fell into Hell.
[45247][45266]You worship God,
[45267][45295]but it was He who created evil.
[45297][45325]It was He who created me.
[45326][45371]If you knew the true nature of God, Dante,
[45372][45399]you too would rebel.
[45400][45412]No!
[45413][45455]You are nothing to me. A talking animal.
[45456][45483]He made you in His image...
[45507][45536]and I was to bow down to you?
[45688][45720]I grow weary of this game.
[46019][46069]Finally, I will reclaim|my proper place in Heaven.
[46072][46125]Behold, Dante.|Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory,
[46126][46156]where awaits your precious Beatrice.
[46157][46196]But instead of you,|I shall escape from this pit.
[46197][46240]All the souls in Purgatory|shall suffer and burn.
[46241][46300]And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.
[46302][46338]I will plunge the cosmos into chaos,
[46340][46370]and it is all your doing, Dante.
[46371][46435]Because of you, God will finally|see me rule His creation.
[46436][46474]No, I cannot be the cause of this.
[46476][46513]There is nothing you can do|to stop me, mortal.
[46514][46544]No one can stop me.
[46546][46566]One can.
[46608][46656]Almighty God, forgive me|for all of my wicked sins.
[46657][46700]I forsake my escape.|I give up even Beatrice.
[46701][46720]I belong here, in Hell,
[46721][46745]and accept my just damnation.
[46746][46776]What are you doing?
[46777][46817]A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!
[46818][46836]Do not utter a word!
[46837][46884]But grant me the power|to keep your enemy here with me.
[46895][46923]Stop. I command you.
[46924][46961]No!
[47351][47369]Purgatory.
[47629][47673]Beatrice. I will come to you yet.
[47674][47703]My love, I have forgiven you.
[47704][47754]God will forgive you.|Now forgive yourself.
[47843][47885]I fought across Earth and Hell|to find my beloved Beatrice.
[47899][47942]We were together,|neither in Hell nor in Paradise,
[47943][47974]neither damned nor saved.
[47975][48016]I did not die, and I did not live.

Erik, I'm really sorry.

It wasn't that bad.
When I was your age...
I got laughed at a lot.
They thought I was weird too.
Mumble!
I mean, different, in a cool way.
Like, you're cool.
I was uncool.
- Easy, easy. Whoa.
- Really uncool.
Okay. You know, Erik... when your daddy's in a deep hole... he's gotta learn to stop digging.
Yeah.
Mumble!
A little help here.
We'd never have an egg with you.
- No way.
- No way.
Give me one good reason.
- Too short.
- And you're gross.
- Is that guy bothering you?
No, he's nobody.
I wanna know what love is.
- Hey, Mumble.
- Amigo.
Hey. Hey!
I want you to show me
- Ramon, get out of there.
- That's Erik's hole.
- Ramon!
- What?
We're having a private conversation with Erik.
So you, too, are mocked and misunderstood?
Amigo, please.
Don't worry, I can fix it.
No, no, no.
Let me tell something to you.
What's a best friend for if he cannot bring a daddy and his boy together?
Hello? Where are you?
Hello? Hello? Hello?
There you are.
You know, ﬂuffito, the truth is... for wild maverick outcasts like us who cannot be tamed... this place sucks!
Ramon, you're being ridiculous.
Not any more.
I am going home to Adelie Land.
Adelie
Land, Adelie Land.
Be who you want to be
A haven for heroes.
Erik?
Knock knock? Hello?
Honey, I think he needs to be alone right now.
We can't leave him by himself in a hole.
We've got his back, sir.
Yeah. True that.
There you go.
- Let the hoppers work it out.
- Quite right.
Okay, come on.
All right. Step away.
Nothing to see here.
Shufflely off-ely.
So much for my daddy skills.
Adiós, Emperor Land!
This is one fabulous penguin you will never laugh at again.
Never!
Hey, Atticus. Snack time.
Erik?
Shh.
I think they're snuggled up.
All snoozy.
They're not here.
Bobo!
Oh! Boadicea!
Come on, Atticus.
Why you fooling around?
Where are you?
I know you hear me, Atticus.
Gloria? Do you think they could have, you know, run off?
Outside? By themselves?
Maybe they followed Ramon.
- Baby...
- I know, I know.
But I really ought to check it out.
I won't be long.
Mumble, relax.
We will find them and when we do, you'll find a way to put things right.
You're a good dad.
Yeah.
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?
Whoa, that was a big one.
I hate it when that happens.
Hey, Will? Is that you?
Of course it's me.
Can't you tell?
No. Not if we all look the same.
I don't.
Will, we are krill.
We are meant to look the same.
Not me, Bill. There's only one of me in all the world.
I am one in a krillion. Hm.
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.
I wanna be free, Bill!
There's no such thing as free, Will.
Come on, less thinking, more swarming.
I'm sick of swarming.
We've been swarming all our lives.
It's like you've got a mind of your own.
Tell me, Bill, what lies beyond the swarm?
- More swarm.
- And then?
- Some more swarm.
- And then?
Will, there's nothing but swarm.
We are a swarm without end.
Everything's got an end.
See? I end here.
That is not a happy ending.
It stands to reason, Bill... if I swim against the swarm, I must eventually reach the end of the world.
Yeah.
Okay.
On the count of three.
One, two, three!
No.
I can do this. I can do this.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can do this.
No, you can't.
Who's talking to me? You.
Who are you? Me. Who said that?
Now walk it out.
Now walk it out.
West side, walk it out.
South side, walk it out.
East side, walk it out.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
What's this? What's up?
We're coming to Adelie Land.
You aren't. You are without your parents, this is chicknapping.
Now go. Shoo, shoo!
- But we can't. We're fugitives.
- Huh?
- Fugi wha..?
- Fugitives.
- Fleeing Emperor Land.
- No.
- No happy feets.
- What?
No happy feets.
We're rebels seeking thrills and adventure.
And tasty snacks.
Oh, thank you.
This guy. All right.
I want a big fish, three little ones...
Oh, oh! Some of those tiny crustaceans.
The little ones that go:
Oh, yeah!
- Now go.
- But we can't swim. We're way too fluffy.
- What?
- Fluffy don't float.
But it's too high.
I'm a leap..ophobic.
Oh, dude! The water's right there.
Like, right there.
I don't care.
It's too cold for a hot blood like me.
Atticus, stop!
He's chewing on his flipper!
Okay, okay.
Here's what we are going to do.
We count to three. Push me on two.
But you don't tell me, okay?
One, two!
Aah!
What'd you do that for?
Baby penguins.
Cute, but ruthless.
Will! Will!
What are we even looking for?
That's the beauty of it, my friend.
I don't know.
Will, please, come back.
I fear the worst.
I fear the worst too, Bill... because fearing the best is a complete waste of time.
Oh, yeah. There!
Maybe it's a black hole.
They're just myths.
Scary talk, to keep us in the swarm.
Coming out of nowhere, swallowing everything in its path!
For something that doesn't exist, it's very impressive.
- Swim! Aah!
- Whoa!
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.
Uncle Ramon?
No. No, no, no. Kids... take me home.
So this... is all we are. Lunch.
To think we spent our whole lives not knowing the truth.
Goodbye, Krill World.
Erik.
Bo.
Atticus.
Ramon. Hmm.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
That's the mating call of the Adelie female.
I'm about to be thrown to the ground and crushed by a thousand chicas.
It's okay, ladies!
The love god, he's back!
Whoa!
Ignored by thousands.
I said, "The love god is back!"
Come on. I got so much love,
I'm going to explode!
Ramon! Amigos!
- I can't believe it!
- I'm back in the band. Yeah!
It's like you never left, but you did.
Ramon, triplets?
No, there's only three.
Kids, amigos. Amigos, kids.
Oh, look at how cute.
Where are the chicas?
The Ramon-starved chicas?
- You been away too long.
- There's a lot more competition now, bro.
Mm-hm.
Impossible.
Lovelace.
Guru.
We love you.
Wow.
- Same old Lovelace.
- Only completely different.
He looks like a rainbow.
Like a rainbow...
- with man-chichis.
- Ramon.
All right!
Brothers and sisters!
Penguins all!
No matter how big!
No matter how small!
We are here today... for one extraordinary penguin!
Yes, indeed!
It's Sven time!
Sven! Sven!
Sven! Sven! Sven!
A penguin who's not afraid of heights.
So what?
- Whoa!
- Golly gosh!
A penguin who can fly.
UP-uppity-up!
Okay, this Mr. Up is going down.
Share the mystery of your history.
Tell it, brother! Testify.
Oh, but friends... it's such a long story.
Then tell the short one!
Ramon.
It begins with the loss of...
Hey, Goldilocks.
That beak looks way too big on you!
- It begins...
- The end.
- Security!
- I can't believe this.
Get your filthy flippers off me!
Let him go.
He's fragile right now.
Yeah!
You tell them, amigos!
And they're still talking.
We're still here for you, brother.
Go ahead.
Okey-dokey. Ahem.
It begin with the loss of my...
No. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
The moment is gone. I've lost my mojo.
Maybe tomorrow.
No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling it.
Show's over.
- Please, sir.
- What?
Does your story have flying in it?
Avvw.
And where are you from, little squirt?
We're from the Emperor-hood.
And what your name is?
Erik.
Ear-rik.
Hm. In Svenland, we have many brave warriors called Ear-rik.
You do?
Oh, ja.
Ja.
Everybody!
Everybody!
Your attention, please.
I dedicate my much-applauded... heartswarming saga... to my brave friend Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik.
Ear-rik
"Ear-rik"?
Ear-rik
Erik.
So... it begin with the loss of my home!
He was the last of a noble penguin race.
Whose world collapsed at a rapid pace.
The power to ﬂy was my saving grace.
The mighty Sven
From his pretty lips.
With his stylish swoops
And his triple ﬂips.
I alone escaped the apocalypse.
The mighty Sven.
He journeyed far without a rest.
Ooh. Hello there.
Those fightin' titans
Were a heck of a test.
But even they couldn't take him down
'Cause none could match The guts and grit of Sven.
Sven.
Guts and grit.
Guts and grit.
He met the aliens who ruled the seas.
They took one look at him
And fell to their knees.
They restored him.
They adorned him.
And they adored him.
Then destiny showed its...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, it's okey-dokey.
Don't keep it inside.
Yeah, it's okey-dokey.
Sing it out.
Then destiny showed its kindest face.
When I was lost in the darkest place.
Before I drew my final breath.
He delivered me.
From the thick black death.
Bathed and fluffed All pleasures bestowed.
I didn't want to end it.
They covered me in a protective robe.
There I stood before him.
Resplendent.
Sven! Sven!
Sven!
Erik!
As I was learning the alien speak.
What smells so gosh darn good-y?
Sven had a higher truth to seek.
Who knows what he saw.
In that mystic light?
Svensei!
- I've seen our future.
- What?
- Ja, it's calling to me.
- Yeah?
It says "Sven.
Sven, go that way! Quickly!"
I'm with you!
The mighty Sven.
Oh, my sweet eyes.
He ﬂies.
The mighty Sven.
And so he came to this far, far shore.
To shine his gifts upon us all.
What...?
- What is it?
- It's incredible.
- Really? You've never seen this?
- No.
Green.
Brothers and sisters, behold the power... of Sven.
Let it out, let it out.
Let it out Let it out.
On that day, I took a vow.
I, Sven, promises to use my powers Only for good-y.
Good-y, good-y.
And I dedicate full-time... to the "createment" of a new Adelie Land! ls there no end to the power of Sven?
Sven! Sven!
Sven!
Marry me! Marry me!
No, marry me!
Marry me! Marry me!
No, no, marry me!
- No, marry me!
- Marry me!
Ah, my beauties.
But if I love the few, who will love the many?
But if they love you, who will love Ramon?
Ramon!
Somebody? Anybody?
Nobody?
Body?
Aw, bitter, twisted, lonely guy.
You must learn to think like Sven.
Why?
If you want it... you must will it!
If you will it... it will be yours!
SvenTHINK.
All rights reserved, copyright me.
You know, up close, you're still an idiot.
Try it. SvenTHINK.
Sven
THINK, Sven THINK.
- Sven THINK, Sven THINK.
- All right!
Excuse me.
Coming through.
I'll prove it doesn't work.
- Okey-dokey. Now, loosen up.
Mm-hm.
- Empty your mind.
- Done.
And picture your goal.
Okay.
See her eyes. Blue.
No, brown. Deep brown.
- Short.
- Tall.
- Slender.
- Bouncy.
- Whatever. Just will it.
- Okay.
Will it harder.
Come on, will it harder!
Now with extra added bonus will!
Ow! My foot!
Will it, will it, will it!
- Open your eyes.
- Ramon!
- Close your eyes.
- Where are the kids?
Security!
You. Me. Beautiful egg.
Now.
You. Me? Fat chance.
I have a chance.
And it's fat!
Carmen, I'm getting serious stalker vibe.
Carmen.
Her name is Carmen. Oh, Sven.
You're going to be my best friend and my best man all rolled into one.
Hey, Mumble.
Carmen, wait! Where you going?
Erik!
Carmen!
Mumble, Ear-rik is your boy?
Yes, he is. Kids...
- ...we're leaving.
- Uncle Mumble, no fair!
- Come on, all of you.
- Oh, no. But this place is so much fun.
Erik. Let's go.
- I'm not going back to Emperor Land.
- Don't be silly.
I'm staying here.
What about the folks back home and how worried your mother must be?
Ear-rik, it's best to do what your father's saying.
But I don't belong there.
Oh, ﬂuffy one, I want to tell to you a secret. Okay?
Sometimes, when you are a little different... the world laugh at you, ja?
Yeah.
Think you're funny.
- Pointing flippers.
- Mm-hm.
Ja, well, we have a saying back in Svenland.
Believe in yourself, Ear-rik... because Sven believe in you.
- Mighty Sven?
- Ja?
Will I ever fly?
- Erik, please.
- Mumble, the boy seeks a higher truth.
If you want it, you must will it.
If you will it... it will be yours.
Now, go.
Avvw.
Ciao.
Ciao.
Uh, son?
Erik... you know, when things go wrong... running away is not the answer.
Okay?
You have to find within yourself a way to handle it. Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. And we're all different.
It's part of the job of life to find out who you are... and what you got.
It may not be dancing or flying... but when you find it... it'll be all yours.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Okey-dokey.
Right.
Sven
Will! Will! Will!
What is this?!
It's the wave of change!
The world is changing, Bill.
We've got to get on the ride!
By the mother of Guin.
This cannot be.
Whoa. Something somewhere just took a big bump.
Yeah.
Sounded awfully close to Emperor Land.
Come on, guys.
Let's pick up the pace.
- This is our moment, Bill.
- Okay.
Adapt or die, my friend.
Adapt? There's no telling what we might become.
Fine. Be a plankton muncher all your life.
But that's what we are.
We're herbivores. We eat veggies.
Right.
So everyone else can eat us.
Well, I am not prepared to be on the menu any longer.
- Where you going?
- I'm moving up the food chain.
The food chain?
I'm gonna go chew on something that has a face!
- I don't remember this.
- Yeah.
Well, things always look different on the way back.
Guess we'll have to go all the way around.
- But Emperor Land is straight ahead.
- Yeah.
So why not go over that?
No, no.
This way is better.
But shortcuts are shorter.
Not always. Now, come on.
It's not that far.
Guys, stop!
Erik. I said stop!
All right.
All right.
We'll keep going, but take it nice and slow.
And what's say we don't look down, okay?
Atticus, what did I just say?
- Whoa!
- Wow.
G'day, sport.
Hi.
- Where you heading?
- Home.
Oh, yeah? So am I.
If you don't mind backing up a little bit... we'll just squeeze past.
That's the one thing I
Back up.
The Beachmaster backs up for nobody.
Then maybe... you can move sideways.
Don't do sideways.
We've come all the way across.
You'll have to go all the way back.
I've got the kids.
It's kind of dangerous.
Of course.
- And we're anxious to get home.
- I see. Fair enough.
But see it my way, sport.
One day, I'll be protecting my beach... and some pumped-up mongrel wants to take it from me.
We're nose-to-nose.
The whole world's watching.
And in the back of me mind, there's this niggling doubt:
I once backed up for a penguin.
He'll see it in me eyes... and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies.
Hello, lonely beach.
- You with me?
- Yeah, but...
Then get out of my way.
"My mother says, “Every obstacle is an opportunity."
What? Bo. Bo!
Whoa! Unh!
Hey! Yo, dog!
You be apologizing... or I'm gonna tear you a new nostril.
He didn't mean that.
That's okay.
I didn't mean that.
SvenTHINK, SvenTHINK.
- Erik, no!
Golly gosh!
You fat... mother of all bullies!
Get out of my way!
Oh, no.
Erik.
Daddy. Daddy.
- Where are you, Daddy?
- Where's he gone?
Uh-oh.
That's not healthy.
Are you okay?
Not exactly.
Daddy, what are you doing...
- ...down there?
- Get back up here.
Not sure I can.
There is a way... but you won't like it.
You want me to back up, don't you?
Come on, Dad.
You can do it.
We won't think less of you, Daddy.
Well, I suppose technically it's just reversing.
I guess I could, you know, just a smidge.
That's it, Dad.
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.
Back. That's it.
In no way does this feel natural.
- Now see if you can turn yourself around.
- All right.
Use your flippers.
Whoa! Stop!
Dad!
- Come on, Daddy.
- You can do it.
Oh, jeez!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
Can you hear me...
Daddy?!
Shane? Darren?
Daddy!
I need youse... to stay strong.
I know you will, because you've never let me down.
Penguin, you still there?
Yeah. Right here.
Would you see that me boys get home safe to their mother?
Daddy.
What are you saying?
Sorry, boys.
They're calling full time on your old man's career.
- No, Dad! No!
- No, Dad!
Come on. Take a look around.
Can you see any way out?
Yeah. I could grow... a pair of wings.
Can you move at all?
I'm stuck, mate.
Okay. Everyone... back from the edge.
Come on, get back from the edge.
All right.
Now don't move till I get back.
Where are you going?
To see what I can do for their daddy.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
That's one small step for a krill... one giant leap for spineless invertebrates.
Holy mother of krill.
How's your appetite, Bill?
He's a big 'un.
What on earth are you doing?
- I'm stalking.
- You can't...!
- Shh! Shh.
- You can't...
You can't stalk. You're a krill.
We've got to evolve, Bill.
Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us millions of years just to get this far.
Watch and learn, Billy-boy.
I'm about to naturally select.
No! No, no, no...
Hmm.
A little chewy.
Keenly aromatic.
You just nibbled on its butt.
Don't let it go to your head.
Au contraire, I will go to its head.
Oh, goodness.
Onward and upward, my friend.
Fresh delicacies await.
Uh, penguin? Is that you?
Streuth.
Oh, penguin.
We're going where no krill has ever gone before!
Uh-huh.
- We're the stuff of legends, Bill!
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay.
How far to the face?
Just ahead!
Hey, you!
Doofus!
Yeah, you. Kelp-sucker.
My mistake.
I thought you were a ruthless killing machine.
Don't you want a little taste of penguin?
Stand back, Bill.
This could get messy.
Ha, ha!
He's a fighter!
But he'll drop soon.
It's just the death throes!
Yoo-hoo!
Whoa!
Whoa!
G'day, gorgeous.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
Dad?
Boys.
Pa. It worked.
SvenTHINK.
Oh, yeah! Did you see the look in his eyes?
Mortal terror!
You said he was finished.
- I spared his despicable life!
- What?
He'll tell his friends.
Spread the fear.
There's a new predator in town!
Sching!
You're insane.
Someone's gotta keep their numbers down, Bill, and we are that someone.
Oh, boy.
We are the champions, my friend.
And we'll keep on fighting till the end.
Listen to yourself.
Me are the champion
Me are the champion.
Delusional singing!
Will, it's the first sign of madness.
Me are the champion.
- How's that shoulder?
- Yeah, it's okay.
Yeah, get some ice on it.
You'll be right.
- Thanks.
- No.
Thank you.
Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster
Bryan gets to play another season.
I reckon that makes you an honorary elephant seal.
What do you reckon, boys?
Thank you, Your Honor, for giving us our daddy back.
- Yeah. Cheers, Bryan.
- I owe you one, my friend.
No.
I mean it.
All you have to do is ask.
Any time, any place.
No worries. Okay?
No worries.
Okay.
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.
- All right.
- Both of youse.
- On you hop, Shane-0.
- Come on, guys.
Go on, Daggy, up you get.
We lost, ain't we?
Atticus, we're not lost.
- Emperor Land should be right here.
- Yeah.
My instincts are never wrong.
You all are crazy. I know for a fact the Emperor-hood is one day that way.
No, that way.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, no.
Hey, look!
Somebody got out!
Aye, you see!
I knew there was a way!
Hey, buddy, how do we get out?!
I don't know!
I'm trying to get in!
Mumble!
Mumble!
Yo! Dad!
Atticus, my man!
Good to see y'all still kicking!
What happened?
That big old iceberg you on came thumping and bumping, and here we are!
That's messed up!
Nothing we can't fix, dear!
Mommy!
I told them all to chillax!
I knew you'd be fine!
Where's Mommy?
Has anyone seen Gloria?
Mumble! Erik!
- Mom!
- Gloria!
My beautiful boys.
Thought I'd never see you again.
Gotta be a way to get you out.
Honey, there are search parties everywhere.
If there's a way out, we're gonna find it.
Don't worry, Daddy!
Today Uncle Mumble got a big old elephant seal out of... a big black hole!
Yeah. But that was a whole lot different!
But you did.
Mumble!
Can you get us a couple of fish for my kids?
- Mine too!
- Over here!
Okay. I'll do what I can.
- What about my family?
- Hey, don't forget us!
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.
There is a way to feed a whole lot of you.
I'm going to Adelie Land.
Bring back some friends.
You'll have to be patient... okay?
Bo, where are you going?
I'm taking the shortcut.
- No, you're not. You're staying here.
- But I'm very fast.
- Erik?
- Be cool. She's a freerunner.
Sorry, Erik.
One's faster than two.
Boadicea, do you have a tail feather?
Yes, I have a tail feather.
Then you... shake it, my dear!
- Booya!
- But, Miss Viola... there are all kinds of dangers out there.
Not dangers, challenges!
Now that's the spirit!
Okay. Okay. Find Uncle Ramon.
Tell him to bring the amigos and as many Adelies as he can. And...
And always remember the family motto:
Just let rip!
Come on, Uncle Mumble.
We got some fishing to do.
So, what news have you?
Every nook and cranny, every which way, completely blocked.
There's a lot of talk out there.
- Thinking the unthinkable.
- Yeah.
Noah, they're calling this the 'Berg of Doom.
How will we answer that?
- We look again.
- We can't just keep...
We go back and we search a hundred times.
There is no way out!
A thousand times if we have to.
There's always a way!
Yeah, that's it, right there.
The ice
The ice sounds nice Check one.
The ice Ice sounds nice.
Here. Let me help you.
Okay. Now let it go.
Wait... Erik!
No! Slow down!
Jump! Jump off!
Whoa!
Did you see me? Did you?
Don't ever do that again!
Daddy, I was flying!
- Aw, Erik.
- Really flying!
I flapped my wings super fast and I went uppity-up!
Son, we're penguins.
We can't fly.
But Sven is a penguin.
I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is, but we are Emperor penguins. We can't...
But if everyone could learn to fly, Mommy can... get out of there!
- Hey.
- I don't know if there's a way out!
Know... way out!
Hey!
But if there is, it sure as eggs ain't flying.
If you want it, you must will it!
And if you will it, it will be yours!
Aw, Erik, get real.
They're trapped.
They're hungry, afraid.
The last thing anyone... needs is false hope!
Boys?
Then they'll die.
Boys... what's going on with you two?
Just working things out.
Erik?
We need some mother love, Ms. G.
He's about to explode!
Mumble, why don't you go... catch some fish?
He ain't hungry...
Ms. G.
It's okay, Atticus.
I got it.
I got it!
Okay, fishing.
Erik, just let it go.
Erik, calm down!
Sweetie, take a step back.
Close your eyes.
Deep breath.
Come on, it's easy.
Just when you think.
Hope is lost.
And giving UP
ls all you got.
Blue turns black.
Your confidence is cracked.
There seems no turnin' back from here.
When your feet.
Are made of stone.
And you're convinced.
That you're all alone.
Look at the stars.
Instead of the dark.
You'll find your heart.
Shines like the sun.
Let's not let our anger get us lost.
And the need to be right.
Comes with way too high a cost.
That's when you can build.
A bridge of light.
That's what turns the wrongs all right.
That's when you know.
It's worth the fight.
That's when love
Turns nighttime.
Into day.
That's when loneliness goes away.
That's why you gotta be strong This night
'Cause only love can build us.
A bridge
or light
Deep breath, take it.
On the chin.
But don't forget.
To let love back in.
That's when love can build.
A bridge of light.
That's what turns the wrongs all right.
That's when you can't.
Give up the fight.
And that's when love Turns nighttime into day.
That's when loneliness goes away.
That's why you gotta.
Be strong tonight
'Cause only love can build us.
A bridge of light.
Only love can build us.
A bridge of light.
Only love can build us.
A bridge of light
Will? Will?
Hm?
- You asleep yet?
- Mm-hm. Deeply.
Well, then wake up and tell me:
Is that the swarm or am I dreaming?
You're dreaming.
Wow, how wonderful.
I wonder if they're edible.
Aww.
Will, don't you long for the patter of a thousand tiny little feet?
I, for one, don't have the means to bring up so many kids.
The birthday presents alone...
I've already
Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil,
Billy, Lilly, Willy...
- All right.
- Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina...
I get the picture.
And there's even a Will.
Good for you.
We could start a little swarm.
We're both males.
We'll adopt.
You adopt, I'll adapt.
I've got slaughtering to do.
Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then.
Quench your blood lust.
There's plenty more krill in the sea.
Plenty of krill would count themselves lucky to have me as a partner.
I'm a heck of a wingman!
Will.
Will?
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're all the swarm I've got.
Suit yourself.
But no hanky-panky.
Are you hurt?
No, I'm good. I'm okay.
It's okay.
Aw, come on, Seymour, take a break.
No. No, no, thanks, brother.
My boy is out there.
Oh, no.
Erik! Atticus!
Take cover!
Come on, Erik. Over here.
Waddle, waddle, waddle.
Oh, if only I could fly!
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, look at this.
My all-time favorite.
Doomed penguin packed in ice.
All you can eat.
Forever.
I've never seen so many skuas in one place.
Stand together. Hold fast.
- They know. They sense it!
- We're never getting out of here!
They're scavengers.
Cowards!
They prey only on the weak.
Admit it, Noah!
We're all dead meat!
No! We are Emperor penguins!
Quite right!
Though we stare famine in the face, we will not yield!
- Ha, ha!
- Though imprisoned... on every side by colossal walls of ice... we will not be broken!
Yes, sir. Speak on it, Noah!
We are fortitude!
We are bold defiance!
We are one glorious
Emperor nation!
No!
Erik, stay down!
Mumble?
They're okay.
Gloria, behind you!
Hey!
Pick on someone your own size, creep!
Oh, I will, princess.
I'll peck on you first.
While you're still fresh.
Before you're stiff and stinky!
Bo!
Bo!
- That's my girl.
- Oh, yeah.
Well done, you.
Ah, the gathering of nations.
Now that's solidarity!
Okay, so...
So they got themselves a temporary stay... of execution. Ow!
- What are you?
- An idiot.
Thank you.
Bo! Oh, you did it.
Whoo!
- She is fast.
- Hola, amigos!
- Mumble!
- Mumble!
- You came!
- Of course we came.
- We heard the news.
- Where's Ramon?
- No longer with us.
- He's in a better place.
Carmen!
We got you, man.
Carmen. Carmen, no. No, wait!
I wouldn't want you to get cold feet, my darling.
I am not your darling.
See? What did I tell you?
No backbone. All squishy.
Hey, back off!
I'm a Carmen-only facility.
Ramon, it's incredible.
Everybody came.
Except for that guy who stayed, he had the sniffles.
Oh, no, he's here.
You're a true friend. Thank you.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well, then, Lovelace, thank you so much.
You got the wrong penguin.
Hello! Hidy-do-dee-doody there.
- I knew it.
- Ah, little Ear-rik.
Excusing me.
Okay. Friends of Sven, and fans, and chums and Svenatics!
We're not going to rest until everybody fatty!
Okay.
Yeah!
Hello!
Heh, hey! You huddled masses.
I bring you fish aplenty courtesy of me!
Yeah!
Give them the real, brother!
Who is this guy?
They call him Sven.
He's Sventastic.
Let me revert back to what
I previously said before.
- Ow!
- You're an idiot.
- And guess what.
- What?
He can carry more fish than any penguin that ever... existed.
Wow.
And it's all due to his amazingly large red beak.
Impressive.
Sven? Sven?
Ja? Ja?
There's someone down there who's very special.
And knowing Gloria, she won't eat...
- ...until everyone else has been fed.
- Aww.
Do you think you could take this down to her?
Yeah, don't be silly.
Where is he?
- No, she.
- Oh.
There, surrounded by the children.
- That is your spouse?
- Yes.
- Your spouse? Wow.
- Here. The fish.
Oh, no, no, Mumbley.
She deserves the very best.
A la carte.
A la me!
So you want some music?
Nope.
Let's have some music.
A-wake me up before you go-go.
Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo.
A-wake me up before you go-go.
Can you keep it down?
I wanna hit that high.
Just be quiet!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
- Whoa!
- A predator convention?
Oh, no.
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Will.
- Guys? Guys.
- Will, don't go.
- Get off.
- You'll never survive.
- Please.
- Will? Stop!
I think we should split up.
Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal space you want, how's that?
No, no. I mean, really split up.
But why?
Ah, Bill, this is my life now.
I can change.
Be smaller, invisible.
See? You're gonna be just fine.
I'll see you around, kiddo.
Will? Please. Don't leave me.
- Aah!
- Will! Will!
Okay, let's take you, you, not you, you.
Oh. you!
Please! Somebody! Anybody!
I've lost my Will!
I beg you!
Bring back my Will!
Mumbley!
- Ah, Sven.
- Mumbley.
- I feed your wife good-y, ja?
- Yeah, thanks.
Okay, Sven, here we go.
Okay, single file with a smile.
So you must be Glorious.
Heh, heh. And you must be Sven.
So pleased to meet me. Really...
I am delightful.
I bring to you premium seafood, yeah, from Mumbley.
- There he is.
- Hey.
Via Sven.
Wow.
Careful.
That's my tongue.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Whoo!
Oh, yeah.
You know, if you are not feeling a full Svensation...
I can get you more.
No, no, Sven. I'm sure there are many others hungrier than me.
Ah. Such a noble.
See you for supper?
Um, I'm kind of busy.
Heh. "Kind of busy."
Oh, you're funny!
Whoo!
She is a hottie!
Honey, are you okay?
Are you sure he's not related to Ramon'?
Oh, you're funny!
You shouldn't make fun of someone just because they're different.
Especially someone who's come all this way...
- ...to save us.
- You're right.
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.
- And out of there.
- You'll see.
Hey, who turned off the fish?
Hey, guys!
What's happening to the fish?
Yoo-hoo!
Fish-y friends!
What is problem?
The bird-eaters!
Svensei! You must fly on the wings of hope... and summon them to the aid of our Emperor brothers!
You know, I would love to, but I just hurt my tongue.
No.
What?
Ciao. Hmm.
Interesting.
Someone better do something.
They're not stopping.
Don't worry. I know exactly how to get the attention... of our alien benefactors.
Calm down. Deep breath.
Deep breath.
Lovelace!
Mumble, my man! I'm the mayor me!
This is great.
Ah. Can you believe this?
Where's there a
Will, there's a way out!
Hm?
Huh?
Bill? Is that you?
I don't know, Uncle Mumble.
They're noisy and they're messing with our ice.
Atticus, they're building us a way out of here.
ATTICUS Oh.
Everybody who said we'd never get out of here, take a look!
That's our ice road to freedom.
It won't be long now, boys.
I'll miss this place.
So where will we live when everybody gets out?
We'll find somewhere new, sweetheart.
It's a big world.
As long as we're together, we already home.
Yeah.
Come on, everyone. Huddle up.
Oh, no, no, no!
Carmen, can't you see?
Even nature decrees that we be close together.
Mm. Yeah.
No, no, no.
Oh, you are still here.
And you're still here.
- They're gone.
- What?
A little bad weather, they're gone!
- What's going on?
- Who's gone?
- The aliens!
- What?
All of this flipperizing for nothing!
Our alien benefactors... have abandoned us!
They have abandoned us!
Everybody! Everybody!
The sea is frozen over, ja?
Impossible for aliens to return!
Too much ice-y. Too much ice-y.
If the sea so far away, how we gonna catch food?
Yeah, what's the point of us starving too?
- I guess we should be going.
- We can't just leave them.
- I think they're leaving.
- Who's leaving?
- It appears that we...
- What is he saying?
I regret to inform... we are no longer in the catering businesses.
Then who will bring us fish?
Some good questions have no good answers.
Sven, they can't leave!
Not now!
I so sorry, fluffy one.
If they stay... then they, too, become not alive.
Ah! I can't take it!
I can't take it any more!
Out of my way!
I'm getting out of here!
Whoa, that guy was crazy.
Yeah. So am I.
Come on, girls. Let's do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Go, go, go!
Sven. Teach them.
Teach them how to fly!
Ear-rik, it's not that easy.
Help them, Sven. Help them!
But not all penguins created equal, Ear-rik.
- But you're a penguin.
- I a..
I a little more than penguin.
I a... I is a...
Look! They're halfway there!
Come on, Sven.
Take them high to the sky!
Do it, Sven!
- Do it, brother!
- No, I can't!
- Do it!
- They're penguins!
You're a penguin!
I'm a bird!
You're a what?
A bir... den.
- What?
- Den. A burden.
If I don't try. Ia?
Ja, ja, after all...
- it's just technique, right?
- Yes!
Okay.
Everybody! Head up!
Back straight!
Okay. Feel the wind beneath your wings!
UP-uppity-up!
Oh, boy.
Rotate flippers and sing, sing!
This time... you going down, gravity!
Ja, ja, okay. ja...
Atticus, my man, I'm coming!
Fly, Daddy...
- ...fly!
- Fly!
Ja! Ja!
Come on, guys. Come on.
If you want it, you must will it!
If you will it, it will be yours! on, Daddy.
Today is a victory... for defeat.
Oh, mighty Sven, you did everything penguinly possible.
I is not a penguin.
- What?
I is a puffin.
- Wow.
- Really?
Ja, just a little puffin bird run out of poof.
No.
Bravo, Lovelace.
You brought us a weird bird... and sold him as a penguin.
Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo.
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you. I deserved it.
I'm sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry.
But when I lose my homelands...
I was very lonely and very afraid-y.
And then I meet you and you believe... in me, Sven.
Oh.
It was nice to have a family.
Thank you.
Eh, up-up-uppity
Hey, guys, we should try this.
Huh?
Ah.
Okay.
Now, come on. Everyone together.
- You know.
- Tippity-tap!
- Boomedy-boom!
- Let's do it!
Come on! Everybody!
We're doomed and they're dancing?
Unbelievable.
That's it.
Huh?
Atticus!
- Mommy!
- Oh, Boadicea!
Are you all right'?
Help me!
Erik!
Help me now!
Help me now! He... Ah!
I missed you like crazy.
- My baby.
I missed you even more.
Ear-rik.
Hold on, Ear-rik. I'm on my way!
Erik?
Bite, Erik! Bite down hard!
- Grab it, grab it!
- Use the hips.
Now spin around, spin around!
Almost, almost.
- There you go.
- Almost got it!
Papa.
It's okay, Erik.
It's okay. I've got you.
- They're tougher than we think, you know.
- Come on, Erik.
Let's go get off this thing.
Carmen! Carmen!
Where is Carmen?
Carmen!
It's okay, Ramon!
I'm fine. I guess.
I hate these long-distance relationships!
Yes?
You must do me a favor.
I count to three.
- You push me on two.
- He's gonna jump!
- But don't tell me, okay?
- Hey, hey.
- One. Two.
- Ramon, you're crazy!
Carmen! I'm coming!
My name is Ramon. Ramon Carlos Garcia
Santa Maria La Niña Pinta Pacifico...
Ramon.
I can't believe you did this.
How could I not?
But down here, we're doomed.
A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing to this one exquisite moment by your side.
You are my world entire.
You're beautiful.
Only on the outside.
No!
Why didn't I see this before?
You're really beautiful.
You really think so?
Absolutely.
Ramon, my fallen angel.
You chased me until I caught you.
Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving.
I know. It's amazing.
No, it's moving for real.
Move! Move!
Keep going. Don't look back.
Mumble, that thing's on the edge!
Keep trying!
All it needs is a nudge!
We can do this!
Okay.
- It's just not enough.
- Not enough.
Uh, Mumbley.
- We're not big enough.
- Yeah. My feet hurt.
- Excuse me. Mumbley. Mumbley.
- Yeah?
There's a guy named
Lars Gavunsterson.
I used to dance with his sister Girta, and I...
Well, anyway, we were two-time national champion.
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Amateur division, so...
Um...
Look, could I give it a shot?
Sure, sure. Of course.
Attentions! Attentions... everybody!
Mumbley's foot is very, very hurt-y.
Yeah, like your brain.
But I have song and dance... from my homelands.
It's in Svenish, so join in as best you can.
Okay! And a-nooney, and a-dooney and a-vooney!
Get off!
Come on!
Help!
Come on, son. Come on.
Where are we going?
To find us a lot more oomph.
Where am I?
Who turned out the lights?
Is this the end?
I should make out my will.
I, Willy Williams, leave everything to my imagination...
Oh, no. Imagination, it's the second sign of madness.
If only I'd listened to Bill.
Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry!
That's okay, Will.
You were right.
I should have stayed with the swarm.
No. You were right.
Oh, great!
I'm talking to myself.
You're not mad, Will.
Now I'm seeing things.
What's going on inside my head?!
- Will?
- Please, make it stop!
Will!
Ow!
Bill? Is it really you?
Well, there's only one of me in all the world.
You taught me that.
Aw, Bill! What are the chances?
About one in a krillion, Will.
Quiet, you two.
I'm trying to sleep.
Hey, everyone! It's Will!
Wow, it's him!
It's wee Willy Williams!
I thought he'd be taller.
He's back! Will's back!
Welcome home, Will.
But how did you find them?
They found me.
I was on my last nine legs.
I was such a fool, Bill.
Will, you're a legend.
Those days are gone, my friend.
The carnivore is over.
No. It's because of you we're all here.
It is?
I told them how the world really works.
How there were predators, how we had to adapt.
I led them here, under the great ice.
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
Well, we all have a purpose.
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
Wait and see, Will.
You wait and see.
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?
Don't know, but it sure is ugly.
Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?
Right. Outside, now!
We are outside.
- Come on, then.
- No...
- you come on.
- Excuse me. Bryan?
Down here.
Ah, g'day, chief.
What are you doing here?
Bryan, I need a favor.
A big one.
For you, champ, anything.
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
- Why?
- To dance.
You know...
Now, why would I wanna do that?
- To free the penguin nation.
- Oh, yeah?
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
Uh-huh.
- By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey! Bryan!
Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time.
Maybe after winter or something, okay?
No, that's too late.
Way too late.
Bryan! You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
But right now, I got problems of me own.
Everyone's cranky, looking for biff.
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
If you don't come now, multitudes will die.
Here we go. You saying it's my fault now?
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine.
If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole.
That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit.
Get off my beach!
Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you.
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
- The only "butt" I wanna see is yours... walking away.
Come on, son.
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
Now, where was I?
- Right here.
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
I don't know, but it sure is ugly.
No, Pa. This is so unfair.
After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
Hm.
Where is.
The honor When a.
Solemn promise.
Is just a pretty lie?
And the mighty mock.
The courage.
Of the humble?
Although he's just.
An ordinary penguin.
My daddy taught me.
You don't need.
To be colossal.
To be a great.
Heart.
You don't need.
To fly.
To be awesome.
My hero.
My father
Rolling, rolling, rolling.
Keep moving, moving, moving.
Keep them doggies moving.
Rawhide.
Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather.
Wishin' me girl was by me side.
Oh, my goodness.
Mumble.
Hey, I know that guy.
That's Bryan.
Ride 'em in.
Rawhide.
Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.
Find yourself an elephant seal and show them the moves.
Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing gonna move that?
With enough oomph, we can shove enough snow.
Pack it in behind. It'll go.
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it. Hit the beat hard!
And together!
I know how to hit things hard, okay?
- And I'm telling you...
- Come on.
The impact force of compact ice under pressure is equiv...
Just give it a go, you big wuss!
Wayne!
- Hello.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Now you're talking, Bryan!
You with me, boys?
Oh, yeah!
Pressure.
Pushing down on me.
Pressing down on you.
No man asks for.
Under pressure.
That tears a nation down.
Splits a family in two.
Puts people on streets.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about.
Watching some good friends scream.
Let me out.
Pray tomorrow.
Take me higher.
Pray tomorrow.
Take me higher
You hear that?
They're doing it again.
- Doing what?
- This.
Fascinating. What is it?
I have no idea.
Wow! What's it for?
Perhaps it's a momentary relief from the existential terrors of existence.
- Oh. What?
- It brings out my happy.
Oh, yes, indeed!
Hey, Bryan, what are you doing?
Sometimes you gotta back up to go forward.
Tell me why, tell me why.
Give ourselves one more chance.
Why can't we give ourselves
One more chance?
Why can't we give love
Give love, give love.
Give love.
Every day.
Every night, every hour.
Yeah, come on! Take it higher!
Come on, come on! Give love, y'all!
Give love, y'all!
Hey, get down here.
Yeah.
- Come on!
- Every step counts.
To care for.
The people on The edge of the night.
And love dares you.
To change our way.
Of caring.
About ourselves.
This is.
Our last dance.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves.
Creatures of the world unite Strength in numbers, we can get it right.
One time.
Yeah!
- Be careful, Ramon.
- I'm coming. I'm right behind you.
Ramon! Amigos!
I'm getting "emotioable" again.
- Come on, Ramon.
- Coming, baby!
- Hi, Erik.
- Hello, Bo.
Good job, Erik.
You too, Uncle Mumble.
You really something special, brother.
One nation, Mumble.
One nation.
Irie, walking out now, Mumble.
One nation.
So, boys...
- Mommy!
- Gloria.
Where's my hug?
Oh, my babies.
Come on, nippers.
Let's get youse home.
Hey, Bryan.
Cheers.
No worries, penguin. No worries.
Yeah.
No worries.
Ja, the Svend.
Steel yourself against my steel, villain!
Your reign of tears is over!
- I got the onion, Dad.
- I'll get the bok choy.
- Hi-yah!
- I'll get the radish.
Yah!
Chop it fine, son. Chop it fine!
- Carrot!
- Mushrooms!
- Ginger!
- Leeks!
- Garlic!
- Soy sauce!
- Beets!
- No beets.
But I like beets.
One final ingredient.
Noodles!
One noodle soup!
So delicious!
- Dad, this dream is awesome!
- It's the noodle dream.
Tai Lung?
I thought you were dead...
Wait! Please, don't eat my son!
- Have some delicious noodle soup.
- So delicious!
Don't worry, Dad.
I got it under control!
No!
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?
- We're cooking together!
- Sorry, Dad.
Evil doesn't take a holiday... and neither do I.
Goodbye, Dad.
Po, don't go!
Don't go, my son!
You can't leave me alone!
I need you!
Po!
Dad, where'd they go?
What'd they look like?
Oh, I was dreaming.
It was awful!
We were cooking, but then you left me.
Now, how could you leave me?
Dad, it was just a dream.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
Now, come on down.
I got all the decorations out.
Thank you, Po.
You are such a good son.
You owe me 17 yuan for the new door.
Whoa, right on top!
It's the sun lantern I made when I was a cub.
You know why it was on top, Po?
Because I opened the box this summer just to look at it.
I love Winter Festival so much, sometimes I just can't wait.
- Me, too. The decorations...
- The party games!
The dancing. Huh, Dad? The dancing!
Noodles...
Good morning, Dragon Warrior.
I was just practicing my...
...Empty Belly Defense.
Mr. Ping, may I borrow Po for a moment?
Well, actually, we're very busy decorating for the...
I've come to talk to you about the
Winter Feast at the Jade Palace.
- You will be...
- Be coming?!
The Winter Feast with the Kung Fu
Masters from all the provinces?!
No, Po, you will not be invited.
You will be hosting.
Me? Hosting?
Wonderful news, is it not?
As the Dragon Warrior, this is one of your most critical duties.
Wow! Thank you, Shifu.
Po, this is a big opportunity for you.
Your first time with all the Kung Fu Masters.
The Winter Feast is legendary!
I'll bet you got the best, biggest, brightest sun lanterns and dancing.
Po. Stop. Stop.
This is the Winter Feast.
It is perfection.
Always elegant.
Always formal.
Awesome. Awesome. I'm all about elegant. Fancy stuff and fine dinin'.
You have some noodle in your neck fat.
What I'm saying, Po, is dancing and sun lanterns, those are common traditions.
So common. I mean, dancing?
Come on!
Sun lanterns?
Weak. Dad! Isn't this great?
Dragon Warrior!
Please, come quickly!
- There are bandits at the bridge!
- What?
I'm on it. See ya, Dad!
Thanks again, Master Shifu!
Mr. Ping.
Hey, guys!
You excited about the Winter Feast?
Guess what? Master Shifu just told me
I'll be joining you this year.
The Feast is intense!
All the Masters at one table!
One perfect feast.
It's an honor to be invited.
Actually, I'm not just invited.
I'm hosting!
- What?
- Wouldn't be my choice.
- What?
- The Feast at the palace is very...
...elegant.
It's a very sophisticated event.
Why does everyone think
I can't do sophisticated?
I... have no idea.
It's just that we think maybe you could use a little help.
Tigress, I got this.
It's a dinner.
Eating, entertainment.
How much do you have to know?
There are 18 gestures you must memorize for the right hand.
Nineteen for the left.
Nineteen for the right,
19, 18 for the left.
This is Feng, the palace artist.
He will do your official portrait.
Pleased to... What?
OK, I'm gonna need a do-over. I think I was blinking.
This is where you will seat all of the Kung Fu Masters.
Oh, my dad's gonna love this feast.
You know, he's never even been to the palace?
I am sorry, Po.
There are no guests allowed.
I can't bring my dad?
But he's my dad. We always spend the holiday together.
I understand, Po.
I remember the day
I departed my family and committed myself entirely to the duties of kung fu.
You are the Dragon Warrior now, and therefore this is your duty above all other bonds.
Now... in your quest for perfection, these instructions must be executed to the letter.
Guard these scrolls containing the ancient recipes.
Flaked jasmine. Never ground...
...elegant... traditional greeting of the Masters...
- ...magnificent Golden Ladle!
- What?
Po. Hire a chef. Present them with the Golden Ladle.
Do you have any questions?
- Nuh-uh!
- Po, do not let me down.
Don't worry, Master Shifu,
I got everything under control...
What?
Master Po. We have brought you the finest chefs in China.
You'll sample their dishes and make your choice.
Yeah.
The chef you select will receive the Golden Ladle.
- Let us begin.
- Alrighty!
Master Po...
I present Chef Wo Hop of the Heilongjiang Province.
Sir, it is a privilege for me and the citizens of my village
- to be considered for this great honor.
- Hi, Po!
Hey!
- What just happened?
- Well... as host of the festival, every gesture of yours has meaning.
You just gave him the ancient
Hun Shu Wave of Dismissal.
The what? Is that a thing?
That doesn't even sound like a thing!
He has brought great dishonor upon himself and his village, and they will be shamed for all of eternity.
No, no! I was just waving to Monkey!
Can't we just get the rabbit back?
Oh, you're serious? No.
I'll... I'll get the other chefs.
Wow, this feast is intense. Right?
And I just found out that I can't be with my dad.
Wait a minute. Of course!
You're absolutely right.
I'll choose my dad! Then I'll get to spend the holiday with him.
Brilliant! You are good.
Come here, you.
OK... I've gotta get rid of these guys.
Hate the food. Hate the food.
Oh, this...
...isn't really what we're looking for.
Nope.
No. No... No. No.
This isn't really your year.
No. Nope. Nuh-uh.
Nah. No. Nah.
Ew. Sorry.
That one really is bad.
No. No. None of these will do.
I'll take that. Thank you.
Nice try, everyone.
See you next year!
- Awful.
- Master Po? We haven't picked a chef.
The Golden Ladle!
- Yeah.
- I'm holding it.
- Yeah.
- To be asked to prepare a meal for all the great Kung Fu Masters!
What an extraordinary honor!
When is it?
- Tomorrow night.
- Oh, that won't work.
- What? Why?
- Po, that's the holiday!
- Exactly!
- Well, I cannot leave the restaurant.
- Why not?
- What about our friends?
What about those lonely people who have no place else to go?
We give them a place to call home.
There's always room for one more at Mr. Ping's.
OK, Dad, I appreciate that you care for all the lonely people.
- And lonely people pay extra.
- But, Dad, I need you.
The Feast is tomorrow. I just fired all the best chefs in the land.
The best chefs in the land, huh? Really?
You think your fancy palace ladle is better than mine?
This is not my "A" ladle.
Dad, look.
I didn't mean that.
It's just I thought this was a way for us to be together on the holiday.
- I want us to be together.
- But I can't be here!
I have responsibilities to Shifu!
So be there with Shifu.
Don't you see my beak smiling with happiness for you?
No, no, no. Come on, Dad!
Don't make me feel guilty about this.
What... What do you expect me to do?
I expect you to do the right thing, Po.
Here, son. You should have this on the holiday.
How could my dad say no?
"I would rather you stay here, do my holiday thing with me."
Yeah, fine. Whatever!
Well, what about me, Dad?
Now I gotta cook all alone!
- Po?
- Shifu, hey!
All alone?
You do not have a chef yet?
No, no, of course I have a chef.
You kidding?
No chef...
That would be a disaster.
I gotta get a chef.
- Pardon me?
- Bunny! Awesome, a real chef.
Listen, I know we got off to kind of a rocky start, what with me shaming you and your village for all eternity and whatnot.
But if you could start dicing those carrots...
I am not here to dice carrots.
- I am here to fight you.
- Huh?
The only way I can lift the veil of shame is to fight the Dragon Warrior.
Surely I will die, but it will restore my honor!
What are you doing?
Come on! I don't wanna hurt you.
Look, Bunny,
I get this whole honor thing.
But this isn't kung fu.
You're biting me. Ha! Look,
Bunny, I have enough on my plate between cooking and my dad guilting me. Get off...
What is it with parents and the holidays?
Sometimes they love us too much.
But, it is not my place to say.
It is my place to die.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- OK.
- How dare you!
- There you go.
- Let me out of here!
Po, the table is not set.
- Have you started cooking?
- We've all had our fittings.
- Are you ready?
- I'm on it!
Oh, sorry. Ow!
Wha...? Tap, tap, tap.
Of course he's never here when you need him.
Po? The vocalist for the band quit.
I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.
Let's just go instrumental.
This is an embarrassment.
Po?
Ha-ha!
Ow! Bunny!
Sorry! Ow!
Hi. We'd like two noodle...
We're not open yet!
This is not right.
Whoa!
This is a total disaster.
Now I'm gonna disappoint everyone.
My dad, the Furious Five, Shifu.
And me. I'm not dead yet.
What kind of Dragon Warrior am I if I can't even pull off a dinner?
I guess kung fu can't solve everything.
That's it!
Bunny, you're brilliant!
Mantis! Crane! Monkey!
This may be our greatest challenge ever.
- Bandits?
- Raiders?
No. Place settings.
Tigress! The Tahlia Leap!
- On it.
- Viper! Stars of Destiny!
Yeah!
Mantis! Pinwheel Attack!
Oh, yeah!
You guys are the best.
And you, Bunny... if you even want me to think about your "death with honor," you're gonna have to help me in the kitchen. Let's go!
Twenty-nine place settings, 40 chopsticks each. We did it! We did it!
Every detail just right.
- Even down to the ground jasmine.
- Ground jasmine?!
It was supposed to be flaked!
I'll be right back.
Hurry! The Masters are arriving!
I promised Shifu it would be perf...
- Happy Feast!
- Yeah, same to you!
Whoa, hey. Look out. Dragon
Warrior comin' through!
Ok, hurry, Po, hurry, Po.
- You made it.
- Of course! I'd never miss it.
- It looks so yummy!
- Eat up.
Here you go!
Thanks, Daddy.
Beautiful. Elegant.
Perfect.
You've made me proud.
All 29 Kung Fu
Schools and their Masters.
Excellent. Excellent.
Po!
Dragon Warrior, would you honor us by reciting the opening words to the Creed of the Masters?
- Po?
- I can't, Master Shifu.
I thought you might forget the words, Po, so I took the liberty of writing them on your napkin.
Let me ju...
That's not it.
No, no, everyone, please.
OK. Please don't...
You don't have to...
OK, well, they're off.
Anyway... let me just say something.
The Creed of the Masters is amazing.
It's, like, the coolest creed ever.
And... you Masters... how cool are you guys?
I don't even have to tell you.
Master Rhino? Forget about it!
You're more awesomely skilled and...
...you know, wrinkly than
I'd ever dreamed you'd be.
And Master Sheep?
Fluffy and incredible.
- It's true.
- The Five?
It's just such an honor to be here with all you guys.
My heroes.
But every Feast, my dad and I spend all day cooking together.
And the whole neighborhood shows up.
And it gets really loud and crazy, and my Uncle Yang ends up laughing so hard, noodles spurt out his nose.
- I'd like to see that.
- Me, too.
So... I wish I could stay and be a good host, but I think I need to leave and...
- ...be a good son.
- What... What's going on?
- What are we supposed to...?
- Po! Come back here!
I used to love cooking with my sisters.
- The folk dances.
- The games. The music.
Whoa, wait.
What about our traditions?
Who will recite the Creed?
Somebody do something!
- Whoa...
- I got that, Dad.
Po?
You came!
Oh, Po, I'm sorry
I made you feel so guilty.
Nah, don't be. That's what the holidays are all about.
Now, don't we have some cookin' to do?
- It needs...
- Garlic.
Table for five?
Hey, Po!
- You guys! Welcome!
- Happy holiday, Po.
- The more, the merrier!
- Thank you, Mr. Ping.
The little one pays full price but eats like a child.
Welcome!
Master Rhino, come sit with me!
Master Wo Hop.
I believe this belongs to you.
The Golden Ladle?
Thank you, Dragon Warrior.
Now, I have restored my honor and the honor of my village!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy... it's Uncle Yang!
Oh, Po, why did you ruin something that was perfect?
I don't understand.
Come back here! I got ya!
Then, the Crocodile
Thief pounced!
Peek-a-boo!
I'm gonna get you.
- Oh, Po?
- I got you, Dad.
This is perfect.
There's always room for one more at Mr. Ping's.
Oh, no. I really don't want to disturb anyone.
You go and enjoy your party.
I'm not gonna enjoy it without you.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
These are your people.
- This is your family.
- You're my family, too, Shifu.
Now, come on.
That soup does smell delicious.
Po, wait.
What goes on in your head I really don't always understand.
But what goes on in your heart will never let us down.
Thanks, Shifu. Come on.
Hey, guys, look who's here!
- Master Shifu's here!
- It's good to see you, Master Shifu!
And it's good to be here, Mr. Ping.
Sit, sit, sit, sit!
Thanks for comin', everyone!
Watch out, little one...
I'm hosting the Feast
Toasting the Feast
I'm going to be doing the Feast
Servin' it up
Right in your cup
Makin' a Feast to remember!
I've never hosted hosted a Feast before
That won't stop me from serving some boar
Fried boar!
On-the-side boar
Yeah.
WINNIE THE POOH (2011)
[whistling]
[Winnie the Pooh theme song]
[male narrator] This could be the room of any small boy.
But, in fact, it's not.
It is the room of one young boy in particular named Christopher Robin.
Now, Christopher Robin has a very active imagination,
not to mention the uncanny ability to collect things.
Big things. Small things.
Sticky things.
But his favourite things are his stuffed animals.
Ah! There they are now.
A charming and eccentric cast of characters.
And his best friend among them is a bear named Winnie the Pooh.
Or Pooh for short.
Together they had many unusual adventures,
that all happened right here in the Hundred Acre Wood.
# Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood
# Where Christopher Robin plays
# You'll find the enchanted neighbourhood
# Of Christopher's childhood days
# A donkey named Eeyore is his friend
# And Kanga and little Roo and Tigger, too
# There's Rabbit and Piglet and there's Owl
# But most of all Winnie the Pooh
# Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff
# He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Willy-nilly silly old bear
# Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff
# He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh
# Willy-nilly silly old bear #
[narrator] Chapter one,
in which Winnie the Pooh has a very important thing to do.
As the sun rose over the Hundred Acre Wood,
Pooh leapt out of bed and greeted the day with much enthusiasm.
[snoring] Ooh...
- Honey.
- [narrator] Uh, Pooh?
[stammers] More honey, please.
[humming]
I say, Pooh?
- [continues snoring]
- [clears throat] Pooh?
Oh, do wake up.
- Pooh!
- [Pooh] Oh!
Oh, bother. I was having the most wonderful dream.
Yes, but it's time to wake up.
You have a very important thing to do today.
- Like what?
- [chuckles] Well, if I told you that,
I'd ruin the rest of the story, wouldn't I?
- [tummy rumbles]
- [giggles]
Of course.
What could be more important than a little something to eat?
Or perhaps a little larger something.
Oh, not to worry, tummy.
I always know what to do.
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
# He fills it with things that are sweet
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
- # By never forgetting to eat
- [tummy rumbles in tune]
# When it is growly and glummy a search for the honey is on
# The Pooh has a knack for finding a snack
# Unless all the honey is...
Gone?
[tummy rumbling in tune]
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
# No need for the tummy to fret
# A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy
# He knows what his tummy must get
# Don't worry, my round little chummy
# I'm hearing your ravenous plea
# When there is no honey the Pooh takes the tummy
# Wherever the honey will be
# My friends are out there with honey to spare
# And they will take care of my tummy and me #
- Bother.
- [Eeyore groans]
[gasps] I know that sigh.
Good morning, Eeyore.
Lovely day, isn't it?
Wish I could say yes, but I can't.
Oh my, Eeyore.
You wouldn't happen to have any honey lying about, would you?
- You see, I seem to have run out.
- [tummy continues to rumble]
Oh, yes. Good idea, tummy.
Perhaps I should look in back.
Bother. No honey in here, either.
What?
Eeyore, what has happened to your tail?
- What has happened to it?
- Well...
...it isn't there.
That accounts for a good deal.
That explains everything.
No wonder.
[sighs]
Oh! There it is.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
The very tree where I was hatched.
I remember the day
Mother made these marks, her giant meaty claw carving furrows in the crumbly bark.
Chapter one, the birth of a genius.
Pardon me, Owl.
What are you doing?
Hmm? Oh, hello, Pooh. Eeyore.
Why, I'm penning my personal memoirs.
[chuckling] Yes. Now, where was I?
Oh, yes, of course.
With steely nerve...
Perhaps you could take a short break from your important work and help us find Eeyore's tail?
...and I rocketed towards Eeyore's tail!
Eeyore's tail?
What's wrong with Eeyore's tail?
Well, it isn't there.
Yes. So I see.
Won't you help us, Owl?
You have such a talent for speaking and telling us what to do.
Oh, thank you, Pooh. Yes, I do, don't I?
I didn't think anyone noticed.
All right, take this.
Write this down carefully.
Now, the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.
[Pooh, interrupting Owl]
Excuse me, Owl, but what does
"Crustimoney Proseedcake" mean?
For I am a bear of very little brain and long words bother me.
It means "the thing to do."
Oh. Well, as long as it means that,
I don't mind.
- [sighs]
- [coughs]
All right. Yes, well, the thing to do is as follows:
First, issue a reward to the...
- [Pooh] Gesundheit.
- I beg your pardon?
Well, you sneezed just as you were going to tell me what the first thing to do was.
I didn't sneeze.
No, you did, Owl.
No, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it.
Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed.
As I was saying,
- first, issue a reward.
- [Pooh whispers] He's doing it again.
You must be catching a cold.
I'll probably catch it, too.
No, no, no!
I'm not catching a cold.
The word is "issue," not "achoo", and "achoo" isn't even a word.
It's just a sort of sneezy sound like achoo!
[Pooh] Perhaps you should lie down, Owl?
- Oh!
- My throat feels a little scratchy.
Open wide, please.
Ahh.
Just as I suspected.
Owl, we need honey.
Enough of this infernal folderol!
Look, the thing to do is, we write a notice promising a large something to anyone who finds a replacement tail for Eeyore!
Is that clear?
That sounds like a wonderful plan, Owl.
Excellent. Now, we shall get Christopher
Robin to write out the notices, and we'll put them up all over the forest.
Here you are, Pooh.
Oh, and make sure everyone can see them.
Oh, I will, Christopher.
# Come one, come two, come all
Everyone heed the call
# There's a very important thing to do
# Drop what you're doing and come
# Bumpity-bumpity-bum
# There's a very important thing to do
# It's time to gather 'round
The work has just begun
# And when it's done then you'll have found
# That you have had some fun
# With a monumentuous, consequentuous
# Very important thing to do #
[grunts]
There we are.
And now, I shall return to...
Oh!
Hello, B'loon.
We have a very important thing to do today.
- Oh, yes.
- [low growling]
Perhaps you'd like to join us?
- Poor Eeyore. He's lost his tail.
- [shouting]
Consider yourself pounced.
That was a close call there, Pooh Bear.
This guy... and I'm talking to you...
...he was sneaking up on ya.
Whoo! Oh!
A slippery little devil, eh?
Get back here!
Oh, no, you don't. Come here.
Whoo!
Well, I must have scared him off.
Um... Tigger?
Yes, my good man?
[stammers]
Why, you.
Here, take some of that!
What is this?
Oh, really? Sticking to me now.
[shouts]
This isn't working out the way
I was hoping. Make him go away.
Oh, dear.
[sobs] Get him off of me!
Is he still there?
Oh, yes. He's still here.
And I think he wants to stick with you.
What?
I never thought of having a sidekick before.
I got to admit, he is a handsome devil.
Look at the chin on this kid.
No, no. I can't do it, I tell you.
It's too risky.
Why, if something were to happen to this little guy,
I just couldn't live with myself.
It's a dangerous path I bounce.
But I bounce it alone.
Because the Hundred Acre Wood needs a hero, Pooh Bear, and I'm the only one.
# Oh, I'm bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
# Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
# But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is
# I'm the only one
I'm the only one! #
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[chattering]
Attention, please. Attention.
Something tragic has befallen a member of our community.
- [all gasp]
- I present to you: Exhibit A.
Oh! That is tragic.
What? Oh, no, no, no.
Eeyore, will you turn around, please?
Oops, sorry.
Our dear friend Eeyore has lost his tail.
Oh, dear.
We mustn't leave him in this condition.
So, we will have a contest to find a new tail for Eeyore.
[clears throat] I do say, Christopher
Robin, the winners of such contest are traditionally awarded some form of remuneration.
What is a "remooner"...
Moonyour... A renew...
What are we renumbering?
I don't know, Pooh, but it sounds like a good thing.
Oh, yes, it is a good thing, Piglet.
It's a prize. But what shall it be?
How about something great, like a firecracker!
Oh, gracious, no.
How about something nice, like a warm hug?
Pruning shears.
I need pruning shears.
I'd say thistles, but nobody listens to me, anyway.
Oh, Christopher Robin, I was hoping for something a bit... sweeter?
Why, Pooh, that's a grand idea.
The prize for a new tail shall be... a pot of honey.
[all cheer] Hooray!
[narrator] As the others searched for a tail,
Pooh realized that a pine cone would not win him the honey.
Why not?
Because it would have to be something special.
Oh. Special, you say. Special.
Think, think, think.
No hurry, Pooh.
Just take your time.
Take my time.
What a wonderful idea.
Cuckoo, cuckoo.
- Thanks, Pooh.
- Congratulations.
You've won the contest.
# It's Pooh
# It's Pooh
Pooh wins the honey pot
# Found a tail for his friend
# Now it's on my rear end
# You get the honey
Enjoy #
[crashing]
I knew it was too good to be true.
Oh, dear.
Well, rules are rules.
So sorry, Pooh.
Excuse me.
We could give B'loon a try!
- Whoa! [giggles]
- How clever, Piglet.
What do you think, Eeyore?
Sure is a cheerful colour.
Guess I'll have to get used to it.
# It's Piglet
It's Piglet
# Piglet wins the honey pot
# Takes the prize fair and square
I'm still a bit up in the air.
# You get the honey
Enjoy #
Hmm. This may not work after all.
[sighs]
[narrator] And so they tried a great many things.
They tried...
...and they tried...
...and they tried...
...and they tried, and they tried and tried, and they tried...
...until...
[accordion makes sombre music]
...they had run out of things to try.
It's OK.
I'll learn to live without it.
Poor dear.
You know, I may have just the thing.
Up, up, up you go.
[humming]
There you are.
It's an awful nice tail, Kanga.
Much nicer than the rest of me.
# It's Kanga
No! No, no, no, no.
How about we celebrate with silence?
# Enjoy #
Oh, bother.
My tummy is feeling a little 11 o'clock-ish.
Do you still tell the time, clock friend?
I can't tell by the expression on your face.
[narrator] Pooh left feeling unsatisfied and a little out of sorts.
In fact, he was so distracted by his rumbly tummy,
that he didn't notice that he was walking onto the next paragraph.
What is a paragraph?
It's a group of sentences that form a complete thought.
Is there honey in this paragraph?
Oh, sorry, Pooh, no.
Well, then I don't find it very useful.
What's that, Pooh?
I'm not sure. I shall follow it to see where it leads.
Eeyore, your tail!
Yep. Unravelled.
Guess I'm back where I started.
[Pooh] I'm sorry, Eeyore.
Such a nice tail, too.
No matter.
All good things come to an end.
Oh. Oh! Eeyore, if you...
[grunting]
Oh, my goodness.
This story is going too fast!
[grunts, sighs]
I wish that paragraph had been a little longer.
Ooh! Of course.
Christopher Robin will have some honey.
He loves to share.
Especially with me.
[humming] Christopher Robin!
Are you not there?
[tummy rumbles]
Oh.
[narrator] Just then,
Pooh spotted a note.
- I did?
- Certainly.
Just there, at your feet.
- Oh...
- Uh, to your left.
Uh, no, Pooh, your other left.
A little bit more.
A tad. A hair.
No, no, back a bit.
- Oh!
- There you are.
Well, it's a good thing I noticed it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it.
Pooh was puzzled by the note.
Even more so than usual.
And even more than that.
So, Pooh decided to go directly to Owl's house,
hoping that Owl could help unpuzzle him.
# You get the honey
Enjoy #
- Good job, Owl!
- Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, it is quite clever, isn't it?
T-A-E-L. Yes. Perfect.
Well, hello there, Owl.
That is a very fine looking pot of honey you've got there.
And so remarkably... gooey.
Gooey? That happens to be my personal favourite.
Ooh! What do you have there, my boy?
Oh. A note I found at Christopher Robin's.
With strange words I cannot read.
But, Pooh, you can't read most words.
Yes, but especially not the strange ones.
Let me see. There's never been a note written that I could not decipher.
Here, Pooh, help yourself.
- Yes, parchment is of a fine quality.
- [grunting]
Oh, stuff and fluff.
Don't leave us in suspense, Owl.
What does it say?
Patience! Patience.
One must be careful when decoding such arcane text so as not to incorrectly interpret its true meaning.
So, can you read it?
Of course I can! It says...
"Gone out. Busy. Backson.
Signed, Christopher Robin."
[gasps] Our dear friend
Christopher Robin has been captured!
- What?
- By a creature called "The Backson."
- [all gasp]
- Backson!
Captured by the Backson!
- What's a Backson?
- Ooh!
A horrible creature! Malicious!
- You don't say.
- Ferocious!
Fero?! Ooh!
And worst of all, terribly busy.
So, what does this Backson look like?
I saw a picture of one just the other day.
- Oh, Christopher Robin.
- [Owl] Now, let me see.
Bathwater, biscuit, baby, barnacle, beluga...
Wait a minute, why is biscuit ahead of baby and barnacle?
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, it's such a mess in here.
Dash it all!
Where is that picture?
I have some chalk, Owl.
Can you draw it?
What an excellent idea, young man.
Artistic talent runs through my family.
- In fact, it practically stampedes!
- [chalk screeches]
- [both groan]
- [whimpering]
He sounds scary already.
# It's a giant creature with a tail
# Here, I'll draw Piglet in for scale
- [growls]
- Oh, dear!
[Owl]
#Its hide is like a shaggy rug
# Its face a surly, ugly mug
# With two sharp horns atop its head
# Between a mop of hair that's red
# And in its nose a ring of gold
It smells of monkey's feet and mould
- [monkey shrieks]
- # Its toes are black, its fur is blue
# I swear that all I tell you is not made up
- # The Backson
- # The Backson?
- # The Backson
- # The Backson?
# Oh, no!
# But, Owl, what does a Backson do?
# Yes, Owl, what does a Backson do?
# Hmm, what does a Backson do?
# I'm thinking, I'm thinking,
I'm thinking, I'm thinking
# And now I will tell you
# They sneak into your library and scribble in all your books
# The Backson, the Backson
We don't like the Backson
# When decorating your Christmas tree they tangle up all the hooks
[all] # The Backson, the Backson
We're afraid of the Backson
# They spoil the milk
They stop all the clocks
# They use their horns to put holes in your socks
# The Backson's the one who's been putting holes in our socks
# Tell us more about what Backsons do
- # Yes, more about what Backsons do
- # More about what Backsons do?
# Why don't we hear some thoughts from you?
[Tigger] # Maybe they make you sleep too late
[Owl] # Yes, yes
That's good, that's great
# I bet they're the reason my tail is gone
[Owl] # You're on a roll
Go on, go on
[Rabbit]
# They muddy up your tidy house
# They make you feel as small as a mouse
- # They break your crayons
- # They spill your tea
[Kanga] # They wake up babies at one and three
# They made me catch the cold I caught
[Pooh] # They made me lose my train of thought
- [Tigger] # They swipe your stripes
- # They clog your pipes
- [Rabbit] # They dig up your garden
- # They won't beg your pardon
- [Pooh] # They eat your snacks
- # They won't relax
- [Rabbit] # They chip your tooth
- [Kanga] # They steal your youth
[Owl] # And now you know the horrible truth
[all] The Backson, the Backson
The Backson, the Backson
# Oh, no
- # Oh, yes
- [all] Huh?
# I know exactly what to do
# We'll find things Backsons are partial to
- # Like books
- # And dishes
- # And socks
- # And toys
# Yes, everything that a Backson destroys
# Then we'll dig an enormous pit and make the items lead to it
# He'll fall in and we'll get our friend
# And this horrible nightmare can come to an end
- # The Backson
- # The Backson
- # The Backson
- # The Backson
# Go home and search your closets
Bring everything that you can
# The Backson, the Backson
We're gonna catch the Backson
# We'll save Christopher Robin by following Rabbit's plan
# The Backson, the Backson
We'll save Christopher Robin
# We must be brave and have no fear
# So to the death, we'll persevere
# We'll search by the sun and the light of the moon
# And if everything goes well we'll be back soon
- Back soon.
- # Back soon
Sounds like "Backson."
# Back soon #
Oh, well. Good luck, everyone!
[narrator] While Rabbit and the others
were busy gathering the Backson's favourite things,
Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place to dig the pit.
- Piglet dug, and dug, and dug.
- [grunting]
And Pooh supervised.
And now to disguise the pit.
Catch, Piglet.
Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.
Oh, it will, Piglet.
The Backson shall follow the trail of items right to this lovely picnic.
[whispering] Which is just the pit, of course.
And when he falls in, we'll get Christopher Robin back.
Yes, Piglet. We shall get
Christopher Robin back.
Very exciting. [giggles]
What do you think, Pooh?
Hmm. I think this rock would be better over there.
Here?
Oh, yes. That makes all the difference, you see.
Oh! I almost forgot the most important part.
Oh, yes, Piglet.
I couldn't agree more.
Hmm?
Oh, Piglet, this is a very light lunch.
No, Pooh. This isn't lunch.
I just thought it would complete the disguise.
Well, it certainly fooled me.
[whimpers]
Well done, you two.
Now, put your combat gear on.
This is a dangerous mission, and we cannot afford any mistakes.
The fate of Christopher Robin is in our hands.
[grunting]
[whimpers]
Ah!
[slicing sounds]
[groans]
[narrator] As the group continued on with Rabbit's plan,
they journeyed deeper and deeper into the woods,
- placing items as they...
- [Tigger] Hey, hey!
You want to keep it down up there, pal?
What? Tigger?
Why aren't you with the others?
Because. I'm busy tracking the Backson.
Shh-shh-shh.
Yes, but what about Rabbit's plan?
Only a Tigger can catch a Backson.
[whispers] And I'm the only Tigger, see.
- [groans]
- [gasps] Hello.
[shouts]
- Hoo!
- I probably deserved that.
Oops! Look who it is! Hoo-hoo!
Let me get off your back.
There we go.
I thought you were the Backson!
Until I found out you wasn't.
What are you doing out here, anyways?
Too slow. Got left behind.
Left behind?
That's a horrendemous thing to do to a guy.
No matter.
Sure would like to help
Christopher Robin,
- but I can't.
- Hmm.
Buddy! Where do you think you're going?
You and me are gonna catch that Backson together!
- Thanks, but I...
- That's the spirit!
Here we go!
- Pouncy, pouncy, pounce!
- [groans]
You and me! Oh, yeah!
Look out, Backson!
OK, we're back.
Look at us pounce!
I'm alone. OK. Hoo.
Buddy, if you're gonna pounce, you got to have some bounce!
We just need to get you Tiggerized.
# Gonna fix you up
By the time we're through
# I'll be Tigger One
You'll be Tigger Two
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# Gonna be two pals hunting in the woods
# Gonna show that Backson we got the goods
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
- # Well, I'm not sure
- # Oh, stop that gloomy rumination
# All you need is a little bit of Tiggerization
- # Wait
- # Why wait?
# Don't you see it's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
You're looking great, Tigger Two.
Now, you've got to learn to bounce like a Tigger.
# When you learn to bounce you should take it slow
# So I want you to keep your bounces low
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
Whoa!
# If you hit a bush or a tree you'll fall so do your best to avoid them all
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# A perfect pounce will make you feel alive
# Just go from a squat into a headlong dive!
Ow, ow, ow.
# You're gettin' it now
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
Ahh. Isn't this super-duper fun, two Tiggers here together?
# I used to be the only one
But two is twice as better.
- Are you ready?
- For what?
I'll... be... the...
# Backson, you be the Tigger
# We're gonna see whose bounce is bigger
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# You're gonna give me your best attack
# But don't just think that I won't fight back
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be great
# Strike me down
Give me all you got
# Bounce me, trounce me
Flounce me, pounce me
- # Do it, do it, do it!
- Ow.
# It's gonna be great
It's gonna be great
# It's gonna be...
[shouting]
# Great #
Tigger Two!
That was the bestest picking up bounce I never seen!
In fact, we're going to skip right ahead to advanced Tigger training.
Where did you go, you little bouncer?
Ooh. Going bare-knuckled.
Look at this guy.
I like your style!
Now this is just ridicerous!
You are gonna need this if you're gonna get the Backson!
Oh-oh!
Backson tracks!
The Backson must have got Tigger Two!
He's picking us off. One by one.
Gosh, Pooh, I hope the Backson is pleased with all of our items.
- I'm sure he will be. Oh.
- [tummy rumbles]
I wish I had some honey.
- [bee buzzing]
- [gasps]
Piglet, um, could you come here, please?
Pooh, are you sure this is going to work?
Well, of course, Piglet.
Once I get you up in the tree, just hand me the beehive.
And then tummy and I will take care of the rest, won't we?
OK, Pooh.
I guess you've thought this through.
Oh, yes, Piglet. Indeed I have.
[Piglet grunts]
Oh, bother. I don't remember thinking that through.
[Piglet] Um, I'm sorry
I messed up the plan, Pooh.
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.
I shall get you out, and we'll try again.
[grunts] It's no use.
Think, think, think.
Ah! I know.
I'll have you down in just a moment, Piglet.
[Piglet] No hurry, Pooh.
The bees are quite gentle.
[giggles]
As long as there's no sudden movement.
Ah! Oh, my!
Pooh, are you sure that's a good idea?
Oh, yes, Piglet.
- Ah!
- I'm quite sure.
Well, you know best, Pooh.
- Ah! Oh.
- Oh. There we are.
Oops. New plan, Piglet. Run!
[Piglet] OK.
[grunting]
Oh... Is this fast enough, Pooh?
I suppose you could run a little faster.
- [Piglet] Whoa!
- Ooh!
And this can go here. All done.
It takes a smart rabbit to trap a Back...
Oh! What are you two doing?
Beehives are not on my list of Backson-friendly items!
- But, Rabbit, the...
- Move along, move along.
Well, I was moving.
Oh, that Backson is sure to pick up this trail, and we don't want to be around when he does.
Come, come! Go, go, go!
Rabbit, please, can we stop for lunch?
Pooh, we cannot rest until
Christopher Robin is rescued.
Try thinking of him instead of honey.
- [rumbling]
- Very well. Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin!
Ooh. It worked. Much better.
[humming]
[gasps]
Does anybody see that?
See what, honey?
- Honey? Ooh!
- [rumbling]
I can't wait to see the honey on that Backson's honey when he falls into our honey.
Eh, Owl?
That cheeky honey will honey twice before honeying our honey again.
After we honey the honey, can I honey a honey?
Uh-uh-uh.
No honey before honey, honey.
Wha?
Honey up, Pooh.
We have to honey.
- [Owl] Honey.
- [Rabbit] Ooh, honey!
- [Kanga] Yes.
- [Rabbit] Honey.
[narrator] As Pooh watched the honey honey away,
his honey honey honey honey
honey honey honey honey honey honey honey...
Ooh, Christopher Robin,
Christopher Robin,
Christopher... hoo-hoo-hoo,
Christopher Robin.
# Honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey, honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey,
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey? Honey.
Honey!
Honey!
# Everything is honey everywhere I see
# Everything is honey and that's quite all right with me
# I am a bear of little brain
I can't explain
# Why everything would be changing to
# The favourite snack of Winnie the Pooh
Can you?
# Everything is honey
I can't get enough
# Of lots and lots of pots and pots of sticky, licky stuff
# Oh, what a sight
Oh, what a dream
# Dive in the wonderful honeyful stream
# Swimming in the honey
Swimming far and wide
# Open up my mouth and let the honey flow inside
# Ooey and gooey and very sweet
Eat and eat then repeat
# Suddenly I'm in a honey boat
# It doesn't matter where we float
Whoa!
# 'Cause everywhere is honey
There's a honey Pooh
# He's just made of honey so I guess I'll eat him too
# If everything is honey and I am what I eat
# I must be made of honey
# And life is very sweet #
[groans]
Bother.
[gasping]
What a lovely picnic!
[shouts]
Oh, bother!
Double bother.
Pooh! Now where did that bear go?
We searched all over, and no sign of him.
The report from my aerial excursion is inconclusive.
- [Pooh moaning]
- [clanking]
[all shout]
[gasps] The plan worked.
We caught the Backson!
- [Pooh continues moaning]
- Oh! It sounds horrible!
Now that we have him, Owl, you can go and get Christopher Robin back.
No! No, I'm far too important to put myself in that predicament.
Kanga, off you go.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm with child.
Send the pig.
[stammering]
- How about all of us go?
- [Pooh groans]
All right, Backson.
Give Christopher Robin back!
- Huh?
- [Pooh] Oh!
Oh, bother!
- Pooh!
- Oh, hello.
Oh, Pooh, you went back for the honey, didn't you?
But I told you it was empty.
Yes, and I believed you, Piglet.
But my tummy had to see for himself.
[scoffs] Poor, poor Pooh.
How are we ever gonna get him out of there?
# It's me, it's me
# I win the honey pot
# Found this anchor over there
# Now it's on my derrière
# Not that anybody'd care #
[Rabbit] OK, everyone, make sure you have a good hold.
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Something tells me I was better off with Tigger.
Heave-ho!
- Yep.
- [all shout]
[whistling fall]
[all grunt]
Oh, this is lovely.
We are stuck down here, and the Backson is still up there.
[whimpering] Oh, dear! Wait for me.
No, Piglet! No, no, Piglet. Stay.
But the Backson!
You can help us if you stay up there!
[straining]
OK, Piglet, go look for something to get us out of here.
[stammering] OK.
There might be something over by the pack.
Thank goodness one of us is up there.
I was worried we'd be stuck here forever.
I found something. Here.
- What?
- Ooh.
That's a lovely flower, Piglet.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
Yes, Piglet, it's very nice, a perennial.
But I think we need something longer.
Longer? Of course.
How silly of me.
[grunting]
Oh, good thought, Piglet.
But you can't possibly think that that's long enough.
Oh, yes, it is.
Owl read this to me once, and it was certainly the longest thing
I'd ever heard.
[giggles] Oh.
It's true, Rabbit.
It lags a bit in the middle.
Of all things, why didn't we think to bring a rope?
Well, there is this rope.
Spot-on, Piglet. Do be a helpful little swine and get us out of here.
All of you?
Yes, Piglet, all of us.
All right. Three, four...
Don't forget Rabbit.
[scissors snipping]
[Piglet] And six.
There! Now you can all get out!
How very thoughtful you are, Piglet.
Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet.
Can you tie a knot?
I cannot.
So, you can knot.
No, I cannot knot.
- Not knot?
- Who's there?
- Pooh!
- Pooh who?
No! Pooh, it's...
Piglet, you'll need more than two knots.
Not possible.
Ah! So, it is possible to knot those pieces.
Not these pieces.
Yes, knot those pieces.
- Why not?
- Because it's all for naught.
Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot.
But there is something I can do.
Don't worry, Rabbit.
Piglet's very clever.
I can tie a bow.
- See?
- [groans]
For crying out loud! Piglet!
I know! Christopher Robin has a jump rope.
Ahh!
Wait a minute.
My gracious, that's it!
Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house.
Oh, I see.
Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey.
Yes, bring some honey...
[gasps] The jump rope,
Piglet, the jump rope.
With a little honey on the side.
You mean, all by myself?
Through there?
Yes, Piglet.
Through a dark wood fraught with peril, on a mission of life or death.
It is a task of great complexity, but I have full confidence that you shall return victorious, and rescue us from the abyss.
Go forth, Piglet, and we shall await your return.
For weeks, if necessary.
Owl!
What?
I can't believe how wonderful that speech was.
I can't, either.
Moved me to tears.
[narrator] So Piglet bravely ventured forth towards Christopher Robin's house.
But the further he went, the more frightened he became.
[whimpering] Oh, dear.
I mustn't fear.
There's a very important thing to...
[heavy stammer] Do...
[screams]
[whimpering]
Oh. It's just you, B'loon.
I'll get some help.
Oh, dear. I am the help.
How did you ever get stuck up there?
It wasn't the Backson, was it?
Oh, good.
I knew the Backson wasn't around here.
[grunts]
[Tigger grunts]
[moaning]
[stammering] Backson!
Huh?! Backson?
- [screaming]
- Piglet, help!
Whew.
[shouting]
Let me tell you, that was the last time
I'll ever put my beak
- in a keyhole.
- Shh-shh-shh!
[whispers] Do you hear something?
- Help! Help me!
- Piglet!
He knows my name!
[blowing hard]
- Yeah!
- [gasp]
Whoa! Oh!
[shouting]
Ah!
- [straining]
- [grunting]
[groaning]
[screams]
[Piglet groans]
[all gasp] Backson!
Whew! It's only Tigger.
Oh! Hi, fellas!
Tigger Two?
I thought the Backson got you.
Ahh. As soon as we get out of here, we're gonna show that Backson what Tiggers are made of, aren't we?
Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.
What? But what about all the pouncing and the trouncing?
And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.
The most wonderful thing about Tiggers, is you're the only one.
Aw, shucks. I'm speechless.
[Piglet] Excuse me.
- I can't breathe! [groans]
- [Tigger] Oh.
Sorry about that, little guy.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Wait! B'loon! Don't leave!
[Piglet] You're the only one who can get us out of here!
We're all gonna die.
Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.
Which leaves plenty of time for me to continue my memoirs.
Now, dear Uncle Ridley...
# Honey #
[Owl]... exacerbated by my aunt's predilection
- for only the finest parchment...
- Hmm. [gasps]
...woven so tightly the ink took weeks to fully dry.
Their nest was littered with quills that were never used, papers that were never cut, and letters that never dried.
My aunt often bemoaned the situation in letters that she couldn't write to me.
It drove my poor uncle absolutely batty, which is quite a feat for an owl,
I assure you.
Now, when my uncle had committed an exceedingly rousing point...
Empty.
...and let me tell you, it packed quite a wallop.
- [groans]
- Huh?
Look! Look, the letters!
The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!
I mean the letters...
We can get out!
[narrator] And so they all used the letter ladder to climb out of the pit.
But little did they know that coming through the bushes was...
- [branches snapping]
- [all gasp] Backson!
Back to the pit!
[Christopher] Wait, everyone.
It's only me.
[all] Christopher Robin!
You found them, B'loon. Well done.
It's Christopher Robin!
How did you escape from the Backson?
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?
He wakes up babies!
He swipes your stripes!
He puts out the lights!
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?
Your note.
[narrator] Christopher Robin explained that it had all been a misunderstanding.
And now that it was autumn, the school year had begun.
His note was simply to say he had gone out and would be back soon.
[all] Oh!
Ooh. Um...
OK.
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.
Just a moment, everyone.
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.
We owe a very special someone...
...a token of our appreciation.
Ohh!
This reward goes to a good friend and a loyal companion.
Someone who not only helped us out of this pit, but also found Christopher Robin.
And he just so happens to be wearing red today.
So it is with great, great honour and a humble heart, that I bestow this pot of honey upon our dear friend...
...B'loon.
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.
- Hooray!
- Hooray, B'loon!
- Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
- Hooray!
[narrator] Pooh watched as B'loon took the honey pot higher and higher,
until it was completely out of sight.
Oh, bother.
Sorry, Pooh.
Ever have one of those days where you just can't win, Eeyore?
Yep. I know how you feel.
- [rumbling]
- Oh, yes.
I simply must find some honey.
[narrator] As Pooh continued searching, he got hungrier...
- Oh!
- ...and hungrier...
- Yes, tummy, I know.
- ...and hungrier...
Ohh...
...until he found himself at Owl's house.
[bell jingles]
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.
Hello, Owl.
Well, congratulate me.
- For what?
- I have achieved completion of my autobiographical treatise!
Oh! Was it painful?
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.
Oh.
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep staring at that bell rope?
Because it reminds me of something.
And that reminds me of another something.
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?
A small lick, I should think.
My boy, I shall do better than that.
Not only will I beckon you to my table, but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt from chapter 127, which tells the gripping tale of how only a few days ago,
I found that very handsome bell rope that you were admiring just hanging over a thistle bush.
Thistle bush?
Or was it a gorse bush?
No. No. It was definitely a thistle bush.
Pardon me, Owl.
At first I thought someone lived there, so I rang it.
No one answered.
And then the thing just fell off in my hand.
What sort of place was this particular thistle bush in?
Certainly not a very cheery place.
One might say it was rather...
Gloomy?
Yes. That's it. Do you know it?
Oh, dear.
Nobody seemed to want it, so I brought it home.
Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl.
Really? Who?
Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore.
He was fond of it, you see.
- Fond of it?
- Attached to it.
Attached?
Ohh!
Yes. Well, yes.
And I was just keeping it safe for him.
Well, there you are.
And you can tell him he's welcome.
Yes, Owl. And thank you very much.
I say, Pooh! What about the honey?
[tummy rumbles]
Some other time, perhaps?
[narrator] Ignoring his tummy's desperate pleas,
Pooh went directly to Christopher Robin's.
Tail.
Nail.
Hammer.
So what do you think, Eeyore?
I'll test it out.
Seems about the right length.
Pink bow's a nice touch.
Swishes real good, too.
So, are you happy, Eeyore?
- No.
- Ooh.
But I sure do like this new tail.
Thank you, Pooh.
And now,
I have a surprise for you, Pooh.
I do like surprises.
[Christopher] OK. Open your eyes.
They're open, Christopher.
[Christopher] No, silly.
Put your arms down.
Congratulations, Pooh.
You win the grand prize!
# It's Pooh
It's Pooh
# Pooh wins the honey pot
# You're the winner of the prize
# I really can't believe my eyes
# Pooh gets the honey
# Honey, honey, honey, honey
Here you go, Pooh.
Oh, yes, of course.
- [all gasp]
- Thank you all ever so much.
# Everything is honey
Everything is good
# Everyone is happy in the Hundred Acre Wood
# A honey happy ending for a Pooh to eat
# Yes, everything is honey
# And life is very sweet #
You know, Pooh, you did a very important thing today.
- I did?
- Well, yes.
Instead of thinking of your tummy, you thought of your friend.
Oh, thank you, Christopher Robin.
And now I don't think
I shall be hungry again for a good long while.
- [tummy rumbles]
- [Pooh] Oh, bother.
[Christopher] Silly old bear.
[sighs]
[croaks]
Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
[unintelligible dialogue]
- [crickets chirring]
- [frogs croaking]
[thudding]
Wow! It's amazing what you can find in the woods.
A marble! And a boot!
And oh, my, that's a scary-lookin' fella.
Gosh! Maybe these are his things.
You know, I better pick 'em up so they won't get broken.
That's the last thing I would want.
Whoa!
- [thud]
- [grunt] Oh, my gosh!
Is this a pit?
I think I'm in a pit!
Hello? Anybody up there?
Oh, well. I sure hope that fella will be back soon.
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
My talons are upon you!
Your days of terrorizing the owl kingdoms are over!
Not so fast! You're no match for my army of Evil Ones.
Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.
- But I am Lyze of Kiel.
- Soren, but...
And I have assembled my own army, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!
But, Soren...
We've sworn an oath to make strong the weak, mend the broken, and vanquish evil!
Eglantine, what is it?
Soren, this time you said
I would be Lyze of Kiel.
Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?
Well, I hope you're not lying...
...to Metal Beak!
Got you!
My beak. Da.
Okay. Enough, young owlets.
Time for bed.
Yes, please.
Enough stories about the Guardians.
Now, Kludd, stories are part of our culture and our history.
We learn from them.
Even after the 7ooth time we hear them?
Yes, even then. Unless, son, you already know all there is of our history.
I know the Guardians win.
- Soren, iùs just a story.
- It is not!
Here we go again.
I mean, Da, have you ever seen a Guardian?
Kludd, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't real.
Iùs like feeling something with your gizzard.
You know, through our gizzards...
...the voices of the ages whisper to us and tell us whaùs right.
Now, thaùs enough for one night, dear.
Tomorrow's a big day.
Iùs first branching.
- Now, off to bed.
- Now, come along, children.
I've made the moss and down extra soft for you, Eglantine.
Soren, do you really think
Metal Beak is real?
You remember, it was the Battle of the Ice claws.
The Guardians were outnumbered.
Things looked dark.
But then Lyze of Kiel...
...struck down the leader of the evil owls.
The Guardians were victorious.
The owl kingdoms were free once more.
And then they returned home, to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.
Wow.
But some say the evil king still lives...
...and wears a metal mask to hide his missing beak.
Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.
But this is my favorite part.
I know. We've heard it a thousand times.
You have a soft head, Soren.
I think Da has filled it with stories and dreams.
There's nothing wrong with dreams.
Thaùs the difference between us.
I have mine when I'm asleep.
Now would you just go to sleep?
Soren...
...Da says our dreams are who we are.
- So as I was... Kludd, wait!
- No!
Look, Da!
I'm gonna be the best flier.
Thaùs because Tytos are best at everything.
Right, Da?
You have strength, Kludd. But owls make the best hunters for one reason alone.
Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.
By the time I have my claws out...
The mice will have run away. And you and your hatchlings will go hungry.
Da!
I'm ready.
Young Guardian...
...I don't think your first branching lesson will be that dangerous.
Now, don't worry how much noise you make in the beginning.
You just need to stretch your...
...wings.
Well done.
Beginner's luck.
You know, Kludd, it helps when
I picture where I'm gonna land.
Come on, I'll race you!
Okay. Go!
Yeah, you had a head start.
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.
Boys. No more fighting.
- Leùs get the boys inside. Iùs time to go.
- Can we come with you on the hunt?
Not tonight. But when the time comes, at least you'll have the helmet for it.
- Nice helmet.
- Get off!
Boys.
Do it again. Say it again.
Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.
Do you worry for him?
I worry for both of them.
Seems like yesterday they were hatchlings...
...and now, well, you know, they'll soon be grown and leaving the hollow.
I just want them to be prepared.
They'll be fine.
Come on.
Eglantine, are you all right?
Oh, iùs all right, dear.
If it wants to come out, let it.
Thaùs it, dear. Thaùs it. Keep going.
Oh, iùs going to be beautiful!
- There you go.
- Eg, hat is gross!
Quite an achievement.
- What is it?
- Iùs your first pellet.
First? You mean there'll be more?
Don't you recognize it, Eg?
It was the mouse you ate.
Its fur and bones, anyway.
Every owl yarps up pellets.
In fact, I think I might have your brothers' first pellets.
- No, no.
- Maybe you'd like to see them?
- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please.
- Oh, come on, dear.
Such a big night for this tree.
First branching, first pellet.
Excuse me.
Kludd, do you want to go out and try some more branching?
What? So you can go out there and show off again?
I don't think so.
Oh, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just...
...I don't know, stay inside and play Battle of the Ice claws again.
Kludd? Could I just show you how?
Without you being so angry?
All right. Show me how.
Well, before I leap...
I picture myself standing on a great cliff with the Guardians, ready for battle.
We leap down, floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.
- The air's just carrying us as we...
- Thaùs enough!
Kludd, are you okay?
Oh, no.
We're on the ground.
We can't be here. Iùs... Iùs...
This is the worst place for an owl.
Yeah. No, no. Iùs weird down here.
No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.
You know, if we could just make it to that branch.
Then we could climb our way up.
Yeah, here, leùs see.
Shh! Quiet!
What was that?
Soren!
Kludd!
Kludd! Kludd!
Where are you taking us?
But our home's that way.
You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you.
- Whaùd you think, Jutt?
- The "I'll shut it for you" part?
No, not that. My evil stare.
Been working on it for weeks.
Oh. I missed it. Leùs see.
Lmpressive.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
You know, your evil stare reminds me a little of my "Intimidator."
Yeah?
I raise one eyebrow...
...tuck in my chin and...
- Who are you?
- Hey! No questions.
No "whos," no "whats," no "whys."
You'll see soon enough.
What do you think?
Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?
- Completely natural.
- Oh, thanks.
Let me go!
Kludd!
- Strong beak, that one.
- Yeah? Well, they'll put that to good use.
You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...
...and combine it with my raised-eyebrow look...
...I get this.
- What do you call that?
- "The Predator."
"The Predator"?
Iùs a bit silly, don't you think?
Hey, Jatt, look. Iùs Grimble.
Perfect. Hit him with the new look.
With or without raised eyebrow?
With raised eyebrow.
With raised eyebrow.
Greetings, Grimble.
Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.
Did you only get half an owl tonight,
Grimble?
No, Jatt. Iùs an elf owl.
They're very small, but hard workers.
Too old to carry a full-size one?
Yeah, hilarious.
Is there something wrong with your face, Jutt?
Huh? No!
You've upset him now.
Iùs a new look!
But you gotta work on your comebacks.
I'm Soren.
I'm Gylfie.
He said you were an elf owl.
From Kuneer. Thaùs in the desert.
Are you a Tyto?
Yeah, from Tyto Forest.
Who are these owls?
Do you have any idea where they're taking us?
Hey! Stop talking.
Quiet! Listen to the old man!
Kludd!
- Settle down.
- Silence!
- Kludd!
- Silence!
Your parents and families have abandoned you.
So from now, you'll be classified as orphans.
No, I'm not an orphan.
Horribly tragic, I know.
But by the mercy of Glaux...
...you've been rescued and brought here to St. Aegolius.
And, in time, you'll come to be grateful for the kindness shown to you.
You'll repay that kindness with labor.
Some of you will be pickers.
No, I don't want to be a picker!
- Some will be soldiers.
- Gylfie, stay with me.
In your ways, all will serve the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.
- Let us go!
- Silence.
We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.
- Who are the Pure Ones?
- Silence!
I am Nyra,
Ablah General of St. Aegolius...
...and mate to the Lord High Tyto.
I know right now you miss your families...
...but soon enough you will understand the Pure Ones are your new family.
The Pure Ones are not our family.
Let us go!
She's right. Let us go!
Whaùs this?
Tyto, don't waste your time.
Don't soil your feathers.
You leave her be.
Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.
You and your patch of felt will stay together, then.
As pickers.
Leùs go. Hurry up.
Perhaps when you remember your nobility,
Tyto, we can make a soldier of you.
- Come on.
- What about my brother?
- Oh? Where's he?
- Kludd!
Owlet, that one says you're his brother.
Would you like to join him?
I didn't think so.
Kludd?
Here we go. Move along. Move it along.
- Kludd!
- Now, there's a soldier.
Thank you.
Soren, you know, you don't have to be here with me. You should be with your brother.
No, Gylfie. I could never be with those Tytos.
I don't know why Kludd would even think...
Hey! Whaùs wrong with him?
He looks like he's been moon...
All right, you owlets, move it in, move it in. Come on!
Do exactly as he says or you'll never see the light of dawn.
- Nice one, Jutt.
- Felt a little forced.
- It was awesome.
- Thank you, Jatt.
So tonight, we want you to...
- What was it again, Jatt?
- To rest.
To rest.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon.
And sleep.
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.
I think they're trying to moon blink us.
Moon blink us?
Sometimes in the desert, owls would get exhausted and collapse under it.
When they woke up, they just weren't the same.
As if they'd forgotten who they were.
Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.
I know these stars.
I could get us away from here...
...but the only way out is to fly and we can't.
Not yet, we can't.
But we're gonna learn how.
Whenever they're not watching...
...every chance we get, we're gonna stretch out our wings...
Do you really think that we can make it, Soren?
Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.
I'm cold.
Together.
All right, my lovely little owlets.
Thaùs enough beauty rest.
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.
Iùs another glorious day...
- Oh, no.
- Soren.
Thaùs right. Here we go.
Move it along.
Soren.
Where are we going now?
Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.
Keep moving.
Lots of pellet picking ahead.
You may have noticed that we don't like dawdling.
Anything with W's in it, we don't trust.
Come on.
Shuffle those talons.
The sooner you get there, the sooner we start.
The sooner you start, the sooner we finish. Leùs go!
Keep moving, no dawdling.
And welcome to the Pelletorium.
Iùs a great place for the rest of your lives.
You mustn't feel sorry for them down there.
As lower species, they are fortunate to serve a higher cause.
As Tyto owls, their natural superiors...
...you too are part of that plan.
One that will soon bring order to all the owl kingdoms...
...when the Pure Ones will rule.
A new and noble era will dawn.
Now, prove your greatness...
...and rise.
Higher!
Higher!
Leùs get this party started!
Leùs get picking!
Start picking up those pellets right now.
Thaùs right. Think of the joy. Pellets.
We love them.
Ugh. Other owls' pellets.
You know, maybe it would have been better if we had been moon blinked.
Oh, here we go.
Eureka.
Great job, number 857... Whatever.
All right, everyone, gather around.
- Hey, you with the blank expression.
Thaùs all of them.
Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.
Now this is the kind of pellet you're picking for.
Mouse fur, mouse bones, thaùs all standard.
But the secret rare ingredient in this one is what Mr. Mouse ate:
- A metal fleck.
- Metal fleck.
Now, I'm very perceptive.
- He is.
- I am.
- And I'm detecting you...
Nicely done.
...want to volunteer to take this fleck to where all the flecks belong.
You all watching? Hm?
Come on.
Soren.
Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.
Back to work.
What happened?
Listen, Gylfie, those birds are doing something terribly wrong.
We have to find Kludd and we have to get out of here.
And exactly what do you two think you're doing?
Eh?
Once we have amassed enough flecks...
...we will set a trap.
Then it is up to you to lure our enemy to their rightful place:
Into our claws.
And then the Western Kingdoms and the Tree, those will be mine.
You have my word.
What do you plan on doing with us?
Quiet!
What is this place?
Get inside.
Stop asking questions.
The Pure Ones won't be too happy if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.
No.
And they won't be too happy when they find out what I'm gonna do to you either.
I'm gonna teach you to fly.
Fly?
You can breathe now.
Yeah, iùs been getting worse here.
I told myself if any came who were smart, and brave enough to resist...
...l'd help them.
I guess you two'll have to do.
But aren't you a...?
A Pure One? No, I hate them.
Almost as much as I hate what they've turned me into.
My feathers weren't always stained with these colors.
When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom,
I fought back.
Now, they thought they could use that...
...so they took my family.
And they promised me if I followed orders, no harm would come to them.
And I've been doing their dirty work ever since.
Now, have you flown at all before?
Well, I have been branching.
You don't have the luxury of gliding down from a nest anymore.
We need to work on your power skills, starting with what you already know.
Show me what you can do.
Come on.
Hey, good, good.
Now, try and feel every muscle, every feather in each stroke.
And push!
Ow!
All right, you two, thaùs enough. Come on.
Back to practice.
Now, the best of you...
...the fittest and the most brilliant...
...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.
So leùs see how much you've improved...
...as fliers, as fighters.
Well?
Well done. You've shown exceptional obedience and discipline.
My husband will be most pleased by your progress.
Hm. Tell me, does your brother have similar potential as a flier?
Who, Soren?
No. He fell out of the tree when he was still a hatchling. He's lame.
Oh, soldier, you mustn't confuse praise for license.
Never lie to me.
For the Lord High Tyto, we need as many strong fliers as we can find.
Come, leùs tell your brother what rewards there are...
...for those who recognize their true family.
No, more flap, deeper flap.
The still air has no shape to use.
You gotta compensate with your downstroke.
Make your wing tips almost meet, if you can, without stalling.
I can't curl my feathers enough, Grimble.
My wings are too short.
Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's wings were short.
And that didn't stop him.
And you're gonna need to fly a long way to get to the Guardians.
- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole?
- Yeah.
But how will we know where to go?
Well, you have to get to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...yeah, where the Tree is shrouded in ancient mists...
"Which keep it hidden from all but the strong of purpose and the true of heart."
Yeah, exactly.
I'd come with you...
...but I still hold out the hope of freeing my family.
Really?
- Kludd.
- Go!
Kludd, come with us!
Go, now!
Get them!
- Kludd!
- Your little owlets won't get away.
Soren! What do we do?
Soren, we have to go!
Wait. Kludd! Come on!
Now's our chance!
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
This is your chance to go home!
I am.
I am home.
- Eh?
- No.
Would you wound your queen, Grimble?
You're not my queen!
We need to jump now, Soren!
- Now! Aah!
Aah!
Come on, Gylfie! Flap!
Flap your wings!
No! Follow the owlets!
Follow the owlets!
Go, you fools!
Go! Go tell the Guardians!
Look! There! I see a way!
Where? Aah!
Gylfie, come on, follow me!
Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!
I can't, Soren, I just can't.
I have to rest.
No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!
Hey, wait. I think they're gone.
What? Are you sure?
I think so.
Hey, you know what?
What?
We're flying.
Does it feel the way you thought it would?
No.
It feels much better.
What are we gonna do now, Soren?
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Grimble's death was unfortunate.
But you...
You had a chance to follow your brother, yet you didn't.
I'm starting to think that you might actually deserve to stay.
To be one of us.
Oh, I want that.
We offer power and purpose.
What can you offer us?
What can you offer me?
I...
- I have a sister.
- Go on.
She's young, but she's got spirit...
...and will grow into a strong Tyto.
Perhaps you could bring her to me.
Here the young ones are our future.
Are you hungry?
Why?
Watch this.
Hey! Oh, nice hunting.
You should be really proud of yourself...
...catching a moth thaùs already caught.
Wait. You hadn't caught it.
Mm! I was very close.
One might even say I was this close:
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
- Perfect.
Ahem.
An ambush.
Well, I bet you didn't count on this.
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your moth.
- It wasn't his moth.
Yes, it was.
We were just looking for a place to hide and rest.
- In which order?
What do you mean?
Did you need to hide first or rest first?
What difference does it make?
Huge! If you need to hide first,
I'd say you were in big trouble.
But if resting was on your mind,
I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.
We're on our way to the Sea of Hoolemere.
We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
Really?
Two little owlets like you will never reach the sea.
There are some really scary beasts out that way.
Scary beasts?
If the hawks don't make a quick lunch of you, then the buzzards will.
And if the buzzards don't get you...
...the dingoes wait in the trees and as you fly by they...
Our request remains the same, owl.
Do you have a place to rest?
My frienÔs hurt.
Name's Digger.
The hollow's this way.
Going to the sea, huh?
Yeah.
You know what they call owls who fly towards the sea?
- Uh, no.
- Lost.
Iùs hilarious. I have another one for you.
What do you call an owl...?
Twilight! We've got company!
Put me down this instant! I mean it!
This is highly disrespectful!
Dinner is served.
And she will not stop talking.
Mrs. P! Iùs me, Soren!
Soren!
Oh, it can't be.
Every day, I've been looking for you and Kludd, and then this.
To be snatched up by this monstrosity.
Monstro...? The audacity!
Digger, who are these tiny owls and why are they talking to dinner?
My name is not "dinner."
Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?
Wait. She is not dinner.
She's my nursemaid.
I just hate being driven to hiss.
So unladylike.
Indeed.
Mrs. P, these are my new friends.
This is Gylfie and Digger.
And Twilight, is it?
Charmed to meet you, dinner.
Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.
These two are going to the Sea of Hoolemere...
...to find the Guardians.
- Really?
What?
No, Soren, we need to get you home.
Your parents are so worried.
No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.
Kludd and I were kidnapped.
- Mercy!
- He's still held captive.
I have to find the Guardians.
They're the only ones that can save him.
An adventure afoot!
Danger. Intrigue.
The stuff of songs.
Oh, no. Not the lute.
But such things have no effect on me...
...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.
If you will...
Though his nursemaid tels him no
The boy will not be tamed
He flies off into danger
To be battered, bruised and maimed
Just because iùs sung doesn't make it a song.
That poem just came to me, if you can believe it.
- I think they can believe it.
- Iùs a gift.
Right, well, sounds like we've got a long journey, so...
Mrs. P?
Look, you know iùs what
Da would want.
Thaùs just why I'm coming with you.
What? No! Please do not leave us here.
Yes, you're the first new souls we've seen in eight moons.
If I have to hear any more of his ridiculous owl jokes...
- They're a hoot!
- They are not.
Well, if I have to hear him play one more quote-unquote "song"...
...l'm gonna tear my gizzard out!
How dare you?!
Leùs get out.
Please. Please don't go!
Do you even know the way to the Sea of Hoolemere?
- Twilight knows the way.
- Of course I know the way.
We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.
- Iùs "Hoolemere."
- Hoolemere.
Hey, you know, Mrs. P, you might be the first snake ever to fly.
You know, I think I am.
And I quite like it too.
Oh, my!
Shove it.
- My lord.
Hm?
Our work at St. Aegolius is very nearly done.
The last of the flecks are on their way.
And I've brought you an offering with beating hearts.
Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.
One in particular shows exceptional promise.
I'll be the judge of that.
You. Soldier.
Step forward.
Yes, you're right to be afraid in my presence.
What is your name?
- Kludd.
Speak up.
Ahem. Kludd! My name is Kludd.
There. Thaùs better.
Remember, weakness is for the lower species...
...never for us.
Do you know why, Kludd?
Because we are Tytos.
Oh, I got another one.
- Knock, knock.
Please don't respond.
Who's there?
Don't encourage him.
Owls.
Owls who?
Here it comes.
Ha, thaùs right. Owls whoo!
I told you.
Because owls whoo. Funny.
Absolutely pathetic.
Iùs a very complex one, but iùs...
As the night falls, so do we
we fall asleep
we fall asleep
We continue to fall asleep
we fall asleep
For dreams, they come on highly
Shh! Shh!
We are now asleep
we are now asleep
You know,
I think that crow is following us.
Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.
Know what an owl says when he's pecked by a crow?
Really, Digger, must you?
Ow!
- Thaùs right, "Ow"!
Hey! Get out of here!
Oh, that is it.
Twilight! Your lute!
Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.
- Oh, wait. Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!
Mrs. P!
Come on!
Mrs. P! I'm coming!
Soren, look!
Help!
They're too fast.
I'll get you closer.
We're going to lock talons!
What?
- Trust me! I know what I'm doing!
Yeah, but have you done this before?
No, but I've always wanted to try it!
Hold on!
Mrs. P!
Get out of here! Begone!
Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?
Quite a ride.
Leùs do that again.
Owl, you surely can fly.
Thank you, Twilight.
Well, here we are.
The Sea of Hoolemere.
Iùs just so big.
Yes, iùs a right big puddle there.
I don't know.
You really think the Guardians are out there?
They have to be.
The band!
- Finally.
- Who's there?
Your arrival 'twas foretold.
'Twas foretold trespassers would land on my shore.
Look, we mean you no harm.
Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.
- We've flown a long way.
- Also foretold.
- And we're very tired.
- Foretold!
I know all.
Now, state your desire, owl.
- Well...
- Wait.
If you really know all, then how come you don't know that?
Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be one who doubts.
Is anyone else having trouble with this?
Yes, I kind of am.
Da said, "guided by the spines of the echidna."
Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!
I am the echidna.
And it was foretold you would need some help getting here.
Well, then, I should tell you, we seek the Guardians.
He should already know that.
I do, doubter. Go on.
Da said your spines can guide us.
And they will.
Now, to reach the Tree, keep between the Whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.
Never go outside those stars.
Now, go! All of you.
'Twas foretold that the band would hesitate.
But that in time would become a family.
And a family needs all of its members to play their parts.
The warrior.
Poet warrior, please. Thank you.
Fine, strong and noble.
The tracker, sturdy and faithful.
The navigator, who doubts.
The leader, whose gizzard is strong.
And finally, of course, the heart.
Wait. Are you a snake?
Yes, I am.
You've all come this far, each protecting the other.
So go. Look to the sky, and fly.
All right. Leùs go.
Remember, when your wings are weak...
...your spirits done...
...and you've flown as far as you can...
...you're halfway there!
What did he say?
We're halfway there! Oh, yeah.
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.
We're lost!
I can't find my bearings.
We have to find the island!
We're in the mist.
The Tree must be on the other side.
I can feel it in my gizzard!
Your gizzard?
Does anyone else have any more solid information about how much further it is?
Digger, why are you flying like that?
Like what? You know how I fly.
Iùs not that!
Digger! Your wings!
I think...
Goodbye.
- Digger.
- Digger!
Aah! Digger!
Digger? Digger.
Oh, no. No.
Can you fly with me?
There are...
There are five of us.
Yes. We know.
Can you see whaùs happening?
Out of my way, I can't see.
I can't hear a thing.
Shh!
I wanna see!
I'm concerned about this fleck material of which they speak.
It could be a weapon.
Could be a new shield or armor.
Having examined them, Your Majesty...
...they do show signs of the trials they described.
It beggars belief to think that these brave owlets would fly here by themselves...
...to spin a fairy tale.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?
Oh, good Glaux.
Boron, Your Majesty, if I understand this correctly...
...Metal Beak is not a myth...
...he's building a slave army of moon-blinked owlets...
...and is planning to conquer the world with magical pellet debris.
Without intending any disrespect...
...and particularly to my little friends, who have been through so much...
...such a story simply stretches plausibility too far.
Does that notion strike Ezylryb as amusing?
What cheek!
Whaùs amusing to me is that you would cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.
Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb wishes us to race back to war.
No, no.
Perhaps he'd write a poem about it from his hollow, while the rest of us...
Well, while the rest of us had our talons deformed too.
But I say caution...
...when the losses could be so many.
I would never counsel rushing blindly into war...
...but for a cause such as the one the boy described...
...for a violation of peace so blatant, so powerful...
...of course I'd fight!
What other course to take?
And if you think I'm a coward, or I'd simply urge others on, I'll fight you right now.
Order.
- Boron, you can judge the winner.
Mildly, owls.
We're trying to seek the truth.
The truth?
I told you the truth.
The Pure Ones exist.
They've kidnapped me and dozens of owlets from our hollows.
They want to enslave us all and rule our world without pity.
Yes, the only proof I have are my words.
But words were the only proof I ever had that you were real.
And still, I believed.
And you would argue with that?
I will not argue with it.
Your Majesty, my search and rescue chaw...
...is scheduled to leave on a routine survey during the next full moon.
No.
- Perhaps we could...
You shall leave immediately.
Take your best owls with you, Allomere.
And be thorough.
Wow.
Soren, we did it.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.
I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.
Oh, to be a young owl with a taste for adventure...
...arriving to the Tree for the first time.
Well done to hold your own in there.
Some more nice strong gizzards.
The Tree always needs them.
He is one strange owl.
I think he might be missing a few talons.
And a good bath.
Gross old owl.
You'll want to stay out of his chaw.
- Chaw?
- I'll tell you on the way to dinner.
You're already late.
Look out!
Now, Matron's instructed me to give you lot a rundown on the way we do things here.
During your basic training...
Wait, wait, wait. Basic training?
You don't just become a Guardian overnight. It takes years. Years.
- Hello.
Only our absolute best...
...are chosen to be...
- Wait. Who are you?
Are you going to keep interrupting me?
Now, if, however unlikely, you do have talent...
...you'll be tapped, or selected, for a specialized chaw, or squadron.
There's navigation, healing, search and rescue...
...blacksmithing, weather interpretation, colliering.
I expect to be placed in the navigation chaw myself.
Name's Otulissa, by the way.
I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.
I believe your friends are in there.
Digger! Hi!
How's the food, Digger?
He said "good," but he thinks iùll go better with a little music.
- What?
- And this looks like a decent crowd.
He's actually pretty good, you know.
Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.
Here at the Great Tree...
...every owl trains in different skills we call "chaws."
You'll study tracking...
...navigating, combat.
But maybe you're a blacksmith.
Here I come, here I come.
Digger!
Ow! Hey! Hold it!
Hang on, hang on. Ow!
Fire, boy. Iùs the lifeblood of the Tree.
There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?
Owls.
You must be joking.
Preposterous!
Come back here! I wasn't ready.
Feel the air!
Follow me.
My soldiers, my sons...
...many of you have heard of me in late-night whisperings...
...but I assure you, I am not a myth.
I am real.
And I stand before you with one simple truth:
The strong shall rule the weak.
Long ago, I was viciously attacked by the coward Lyze of Kiel...
...for defending that truth.
Now I wear this mask to conceal my scars.
But the metal is strong.
It is a symbol of the Pure Ones' strength and resolve.
It is time to set a fire that will consume the owl kingdoms...
...and take back what is rightfully ours!
Because we are Tytos!
We are Pure Ones!
And I am Metal Beak!
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
Metal Beak. Metal Beak.
- Kludd?
- Metal Beak.
- Kludd.
- Metal Beak.
I miss Ma and Da.
I'm scared.
Don't be. You're with me now.
Eglantine, this is our home.
They really appreciate us here.
Kludd, please, could we just go find Soren?
Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.
Soren's weak. We're Tytos.
Pure Ones.
Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone what you're doing.
I just wanna go home.
All right, Eg.
So we could go? When?
Tomorrow.
But first, tonight...
...just sleep.
Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?
Yeah. Iùs the Battle of the Ice claws.
You know, this is my da's favorite story.
He used to tell it to us all the time.
Well, your da had good taste in authors.
You enjoying it?
Honestly, iùs not at all like my da told it.
No? How did he tell it?
Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.
You know? Like a great victory.
Well, in these chronicles, I mean, the battle just sounds like...
Like hell?
Come on, boy. Iùs almost first light.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I'm going to teach you how to really fly.
Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.
A scupper!
A swillage!
Baggywrinkles!
"Baggywrinkles"?
He could have at least given us a vocabulary list.
Now, this, this is the way to learn!
Oh, yes! This is exactly how
I want to learn.
In a monsoon!
The air currents warm in different ways, you see...
...from the sky to the ocean.
You can't fight them.
You have to feel them with your gizzards.
Aha! You see that one?
Soren, see it! Iùs there.
Go for it.
Thaùs it! Use your gizzard, boy.
Trust it!
Fly inside.
He sees it.
He sees it.
Hold it. Hold it.
Soren. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, careful, look out!
Soren!
Soren!
Owl, come to my hollow.
So lean back, put your beaks up...
...and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon...
...and sleep.
Lord Allomere, the boy was right.
Those owlets, we have to rescue them.
Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.
We don't know what we're up against.
Now, see those bats?
Follow them. I'll wager we'll discover the full extent of their plan.
Hold!
I'll take out that one, you get the two down on the platform.
What is this?
I don't even know what I did with it.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what I did. What did I do?
We flew a great way out here and it was nothing like that.
You've got no reason to worry, boy.
I confess, I guided you into that twister on purpose.
I wanted to test your gizzard.
You were exemplary.
"Exemplary"?
No, no, no.
I nearly had my wings ripped off.
You know, my head said to do one thing while my gizzard was saying to do another.
And you trusted your head.
Thaùs when you failed.
Wait. Is that your mark?
EzYLRYB:
What, this? Yes.
So you wrote the
Chronicle of the Battle of the ice Claws.
I think so.
Well, actually, yes. I did.
- Were you there?
- Yes.
What, as a scribe?
Well, no. As a soldier.
As the, I guess you could say, leader of all the soldiers.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Um... Yes.
You're Lyze of Kiel.
Yes. Don't wear it out.
But...
That old thing?
Thaùs only good for gathering coals now.
Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?
All the owls of the Tree know who I am.
But you're...
My days as Lyze are well behind me.
And that battle is a distant memory.
Except, funnily enough, for young owlets like you.
Why didn't you tell me?
What difference does it make what I call myself?
Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.
Yes, well, fancy it must be hard meeting your hero...
...and seeing that he's real and not a myth.
You're just not...
What did you expect?
Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor and battle claws, the moon rising behind him?
Well, this is what it looks like when you've actually fought in battle.
Iùs not glorious, iùs not beautiful.
And iùs not even heroic.
Iùs merely doing whaùs right.
And doing it again and again, even if someday, you look like this.
Something's wrong.
Downed owlets, downed owlets!
- Come fast!
Allomere is back!
Quickly.
Make way.
Some help here.
These owlets need attention.
Fetch it, quick.
- Mommy?
- Iùs okay.
Hey. Hey. What happened?
Lord Allomere rescued two owlets in the Beaks.
It looks like he's hurt.
I think he ran into some of your Pure Ones.
You know, I didn't really believe you before.
Oh, well, thaùs okay. You know,
I wouldn't have believed me either.
Soren! Soren, come fast, iùs Eglantine.
Eglantine?
Let me through! Let me pass!
Been moon blinked.
No.
Do you think you can help her?
We will do our best, Soren.
Eglantine.
Eglantine.
The battle was ferocious.
We were greatly outnumbered.
I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.
But the others...
Can you estimate the number of enslaved owlets, Allomere?
Scores, that I witnessed.
There may well be many more.
And you believe this is part of a larger plan.
It is certain.
Your Majesty, this is no time for half measures.
Hmm.
Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.
To arms.
To arms.
Not a bad fit.
Ezylryb! Lyze.
Yes to both.
Look, I have to go.
You have to take me with you.
Oh, absolutely.
An untrained youth like you could last a whole minute in a real battle.
Here.
Come along.
We could use the talon fodder.
I'd love to throw some bodies at the enemy.
Yeah, but I'm...
Or you could stay here...
...tend to your sister...
...and do some real good.
But what do I know?
I'm just a tired old screech.
Move.
Oh, Eglantine.
I'd trade places with you if I could.
I really would.
You know, I wish it was me lying there instead of you.
Oh, Soren.
Because then you could see this place for yourself, Eg.
You know, Da's stories, they're true.
They're all true.
You know, the Guardians, and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...
Iùs all true
Even Lyze of Kiel. I mean, he's real, Eg.
He's real.
Soren, you promised.
Eg?
You promised I could be Lyze on the next go.
- Oh, Eglantine.
- Oh, Eglantine.
Eglantine.
Soren? Mrs. P?
We're... We're not at home, are we?
We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.
Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.
No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...
Kludd was wrong. Da was right.
He was right all along, Eg.
No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.
He did this to me, Soren.
He's one of them.
He what?
No. No, Eg.
Look, you must be confused.
That can't be.
Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.
I wasn't rescued.
Kludd gave me to the owl who brought me here.
No, Eg, no. Thaùs impossible.
I mean, that would mean that Allomere would have to be a...
Be a traitor.
No, iùs a trap.
Allomere!
Allomere!
We'll follow the Whale's Fin.
Iùs how they would have gone.
I see something.
There.
We should check out that smoke.
Soren, look.
Oh, Allomere.
Is it different when you see the consequences of your betrayal?
- Must it be bats that bleed them?
- Of course.
They have no gizzards to be impaired by the power of the flecks.
Now, my love?
It would be cruel to make them wait any longer.
Finish them.
Well, we can't just leave them down there, writhing in pain.
- Can we?
- No, you don't understand.
When we were at St. Aggie's, we saw what those things can do.
They do something terrible to your gizzard. Isn't that right, Soren?
Soren?
Uh, we've got bats inbound.
Not to worry. I can down a hundred of those bloodsuckers.
Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?
Well, we won't find out sitting on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!
Wait! Just wait.
- Of course.
- Soren, what is it?
The flames. Thaùs it.
I think I see a way to free the Guardians.
No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.
Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.
Twilight, can you take care of the bats?
Friend, I'll give you as much time as I can.
But hurry. And be careful.
Come on!
Twilight, I think if we're going into battle together...
...you'll have to sing your best battle song ever.
- What?
- No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.
Give us your bravest, most inspiring battle song ever!
Brilliant idea, Digger!
Into battle we do fly
Yeah, thaùs it!
No matter if we're going to die
What? Is that supposed to be inspiring?
- Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!
- Oh.
A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot
Even if our wlngs are ripped clean off
No. No!
You told us you'd bring all the Guardians.
But they're not Guardians.
Soren.
They have no chance against the flecks.
Still, I don't think we can trust you anymore, Allomere.
No.
No, no, you promised me.
You promised me I would be
King of the Tree!
You should know, Allomere...
...there is only room for one king.
Hey!
Fly away!
Use your glizzard, boy!
Fly inside.
Soren!
No!
Oh, Soren.
Come on, Soren.
That was exemplary.
But we're not finished yet, boy.
Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo!
Come on.
I bet you didn't count on this.
Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!
Pure Ones, attack!
Crush them!
Before they can recover!
Guardians, we must uphold our oath.
To battle!
I need you to stay here with your friends...
...and guard these owlets.
- Huh?
Unh! Ha, ha!
Come on!
Kludd?
No.
Soren!
Kludd!
Hello, brother.
Hmm?
Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.
Once again, iùs come down to just you and me.
And now I can take my vengeance for this.
You should thank me.
It appears to be an improvement.
Your precious Guardians are finished, Soren.
The Pure Ones will triumph...
...and Tytos will take their rightful place as rulers of the owl kingdoms.
Oh, iùs gonna be glorious!
"Glorious"?
No, the Pure Ones are monsters.
You saw what they were doing.
They were moon blinking other owls and turning them into slaves.
You're just weak, Soren.
Still living in your dreams.
No, my dreams are what make me strong, Kludd.
- They led me to the Guardians.
- Ha-ha-ha.
A pity there won't be any Guardians left after today.
I don't understand.
How could you join the Pure Ones after what they did to us?
"What they did to us"?
They believe in me like no one else ever has.
Metal Beak says the strong will triumph...
...the broken are put out of their misery.
And honor...
...honor is just another word for weakness!
No, Kludd!
I know you don't really think that.
Then you don't know me at all.
Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!
Soren, I'm your brother.
Kludd, no!
Metal Beak.
Be done with it, then.
No!
I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.
Oh, you're not letting me?
Oh, what a pity to waste...
...such a strong, young and confident Tyto.
No, Soren!
Oh. You know this sad old owl.
He's my teacher. My hero.
Well, your hero can teach you one last lesson about Pure Ones' strength...
Don't move.
...by letting you watch him die.
Hmm.
Unh!
Ha, ha.
Pure Ones! Fall back!
To me!
Soren, you did what was right.
And you did it well.
It seems we will have to amend the Chronicles. Huh?
As it was in the old ages...
...so it was in the new.
The Guardians upheld their oath that night.
I foretold you so!
They made strong the weak and mended the broken.
And when the sun shone again that morning...
...all could see that they had vanquished the evil.
Soren! Soren!
- Oh, Eg.
- Ha, ha!
Are there any casualties?
- We're so proud of you.
- Ha, ha!
- Da, the stories...
- Ha, ha.
...they're real.
You made them real, Soren.
With the peace restored...
...it was a time for celebration...
...and recognition that our small band of owls...
...who fate and a storm had blown into the Tree...
...now stood before its king and queen as young Guardians.
Eady finally, with all their hearts...
...to take that ancient oath:
To mend those who are broken...
...to make strong the weak...
...and, without hesitation...
...vanquish the evil.
For as we know...
...Nyra escaped.
And Kludd?
Well, Kiudd was never found.
Should I stop?
What? Please, don't stop.
I don't wanna give anyone daymares.
Oh, come on.
There must be more, there must be.
Ha, ha. Listen to them, Soren.
They want more stories.
Well, come on, you lot.
Leùs not disappoint them.
Ah. There's a good storm brewing.
And if we're lucky, iùll be chock full of baggywrinkles.
<u><b>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b>
At the midpoint on the journey of life,
I found myself in a dark forest, for the clear path was lost.
I cannot well recount how I entered the wood, so long had it been since I abandoned the true way.
How shall I say what a dreary and horrid wood it was?
So bitter to endure that death itself would be but little worse.
Several times upon my journey home,
I had sensed an unseen rider trailing my steed.
Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished, leaving no trace.
I feared this figure as an evil omen.
All my life I've known such signs and portents.
And lo, at the rise of the hill,
I saw a spotted leopard, all teeth and fury.
At the sight of these beasts, my heart sank.
I sensed danger not for myself, but for my beloved Beatrice.
Away, demon!
I drove my steed on, racing for my father's villa.
And Beatrice... nothing in this world meant more to me than she.
You were right, Dante.
Truly this is a divine place.
Paradise on Earth.
Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage, under God and all that is holy?
Dante, I will not marry you only to see you dead in this crusade.
Jerusalem must be made Christian once more.
God is with us. We cannot fail.
Through three years of war and horror, my love for Beatrice had only grown stronger.
As I came upon the family estate,
I found all unnaturally dark and still.
Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.
The servants. All butchered.
Father. Oh, Father.
Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!
In the name of God.
Where is...
Oh, no. No.
Beloved, are you all right?
Beatrice.
Is it you or a dream?
Who did this to you?
I know not.
A stranger. A foreigner.
Do you remember that night before you left?
What we said?
I remember.
Did you betray me?
Never.
I never should have left your side.
Forgive me.
What?
Do my eyes deceive me?
Fear not for me, my love.
I told him you would be true to me.
I knew you would.
No! Wait! Come back to me!
What is this?
God in Heaven!
What? Dante?
She is mine.
No!
I have come to take what was promised me... a soul meant for Heaven.
It can't be true.
Dante would never betray me.
Beatrice!
Release her, devil!
Dante, help me!
No!
This will not stop me!
Nothing will stop me!
No!
What?
No!
God, give me strength!
Come with me, mortal, if you have the courage.
Dante, don't let him take me!
Beatrice!
You will not keep me from my beloved!
Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!
You've got to save me! Dante!
I'm coming for you!
I won't let him hurt you!
Beatrice! No!
- Martyr.
- You lost her.
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.
You lost her.
Never will you know her flesh again.
Never will you know her love.
Her sin.
- Martyr. Martyr.
- You lost her!
- Her desire.
- You lied to her.
- Your sins.
- Never will you know her flesh again.
Your sins.
Never will you know her flesh.
You are bound.
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.
- Martyr.
- Martyr.
Why, God?
Why are you doing this?
It is not the Lord that brought you to this fate, Dante.
What are you? Shade or living man?
Not man, though once I was.
I lived under Augustus in the time of the false and lying gods.
Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?
He who wrote the Aeneid, the treasure of Rome?
Why do you seek such woe, Dante?
I seek only my beloved Beatrice and nothing more.
But I cannot open these accursed gates!
Have you lost all faith in God, O man?
Has the way been so obscured?
Heavenly Father, if only one soul should be saved, please let it be Beatrice.
Help! Help!
Dante, if you broke your promise to me,
I'll be forever damned.
Are you prepared to be judged in this place?
Do you think you are without sin?
Please, don't let him take me!
Beatrice. Beatrice!
What did Beatrice do to deserve such a monstrous fate?
She made a wager with Lucifer to see your safe return.
She lost.
Wager. What wager?
Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.
I never betrayed her.
You only deceive yourself, mortal.
By all that is holy, I vow to forsake all pleasures of the flesh until I return from this noble crusade.
I gave myself to you because I know you will be faithful to our love.
And when I return, we shall be married.
And live to grow old and see our grandchildren have children.
I love you more than Heaven itself.
- Take this.
- But, Beatrice, this has been in your family for generations.
It is a true relic said to contain a thorn from the crown of Christ.
Bring it back to me.
Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.
I beg of you, please!
I must save Beatrice even if it means my death.
I will guide you, but you must put aside all division of spirit and gather your soul against all fear.
I fear nothing.
Then proceed.
Charon will carry us to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.
Nine circles comprise the Inferno, with Lucifer residing in the lowest.
Horrifying, yes.
There are more damned in Hell... than liberated in Paradise.
I can see their sins in life.
Charon's boat has grown wide and mighty over the millennia.
He has had to compensate for the ever-increasing damned.
Through me the way to the city of woe.
Through me the way to everlasting pain.
I don't like the look of this.
Now shall I ferry you into the fire, the cold and the everlasting darkness.
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
How could God allow this?
God allowed free will, even for his angels.
It was Lucifer that devised such torment.
Mercenaries of Florentina, in payment for reclaiming the Holy Land, your Immaculate Father hereby absolves you of all your sins.
Go with grace.
Praise God.
Do you think a priest has such divine power?
Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?
Of course, Francesco.
Why would you doubt the Church?
That is the path to Hell, my friend.
How soon until you leave?
Tomorrow, before dawn.
Dante, promise to watch over my brother.
Beatrice, I'm no child.
No harm will come to him, my love.
I'll protect him as if he were my own.
You who are living, be gone from those who are dead.
I will not part, Charon!
I must cross!
I give you my soul to find Beatrice!
It belongs to us already, mortal.
Your will is nothing, mortal.
You will never traverse the circles of Hell.
Take me to Beatrice, demon!
Virgil, where did you disappear to?
I am pure spirit, Dante.
I cannot help you fight your enemies.
I am naught but a guide.
Dante! Can you hear me?
Can anyone hear me?
Dante?
Thank God.
I knew you would find me.
Dante?
Beatrice, my love.
Is... Is that you?
No! Dante!
No, stop! Stop, Dante!
What's happening?
How many ways can a man die?
No!
Come to me, Beatrice.
- I want to admire you.
- No. Let me go.
There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.
There are untold pleasures here, pleasures your human senses could not fathom.
Never!
There is nothing you can do to hurt me, child.
What you perceive of me is a literal shadow of my former self, but you... you can die a thousand deaths by my will.
What?
Think of the tortures I can create for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.
Tell me more about your life on Earth, great poet.
I know your deeds, but not the man you were.
Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.
I was the son of a commoner, and though I died a dozen years before the birth of Christ,
I foretold his coming in my works.
What is this place, Virgil?
The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.
Here suffer those that did not sin, yet did not have the required faith.
This is the realm where virtuous pagans and unbaptized babies reside.
A child? Here?
How can this be?
Dearest Dante.
This is the fourth letter I have written and the fourth I have destroyed.
I am five months with child.
I fear telling your father as we have yet to be married.
I do not know how much longer
I can conceal my state.
All I ask is that you return to me soon.
Leave this terrible crusade, and we... we can be married.
My lady, what is it?
The baby.
This is my son.
Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.
Come. Quickly, Dante.
This is not a place to contemplate.
What madness is this?
Lord, too many.
Virgil. Virgil!
In here, Dante. Hurry.
What is that sound?
More demons?
No.
They are familiar to me.
The great rulers and philosophers of the golden age.
Is that not Hector and Electra?
Caesar and King Latinus?
And do not forget Plato,
Socrates and Aristotle.
I have never agreed to such terms.
I say that God exists in the realm of ideas, accessible to human thought.
Plato, there is only one philosophy in the Inferno - Lucifer's.
Do not look for liberation here, old friend.
- Do you know this shade?
- He was Saladin, a noble Kurdish sultan.
I fought his forces in the Crusades under Richard the Lionheart.
Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.
We will wash these holy lands in your heathen blood.
Father...
Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.
Dante! Dante, the forces of Saladin are routed!
Dante?
My God, what is it?
He is King Minos.
Once a king of Crete before Daedalus boiled him in his own bath.
Now, Minos forever judges the damned, sending them to their circle below.
- Through him...
- Traitor.
...all must pass.
Heretic.
Glutton.
Hoarder.
Suicide!
Who comes into my house of pain?
He who seeks Beatrice.
Let me pass, that I may find her.
Turn back.
There is no place for you here.
Not yet, O mortal.
With your permission or not,
I pass, monster.
You dare so speak to the judge of the damned?
I dare.
I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.
Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!
Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.
Here you must descend.
The damned are trying to flee.
Lucifer will not be pleased.
Let him come.
If these demons can die in the Inferno, then so can he.
What is this place?
This is the second circle, the circle of Lust.
To this torment are condemned the carnal damned.
They are the great lustful of the world.
See there Semiramis and Ninus,
Anthony and Cleopatra,
Helen of Troy and Paris.
The storms of lust forever rage while passion inflames the heart.
Listen, on the wind.
- Dante, help me.
- Beatrice!
Please, Dante.
Dante.
- Beatrice!
- Dante, hold.
Beatrice!
A new visitor arrives, sisters.
Come, embrace us, Dante.
We know what you want.
We can see it in your eyes.
Unbearable lust.
No, let me pass.
Stand aside, harlot.
If you won't have us, we shall have you!
Dante, how could you let this happen?
How could you betray me?
No, Beatrice. I swear.
What do you swear, Dante?
Do you want me to show her the truth?
Serpent. It's all lies.
I never betrayed her.
I'll kill you!
You can hide from neither memory nor sin, Dante.
What? King Richard wants us to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?
That is his command?
He will negotiate their exchange for the return of the true Cross.
Negotiate with heretics?
Never! They deserve only damnation.
Get your hands off her.
Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.
Good and noble knights, have mercy.
I beg you!
This prisoner only tried to save me from the guards.
Please, sir, show compassion.
He is no threat.
He is a heretic.
He gets what he deserves.
Kind lord, if you would show him mercy perhaps I could give you comfort in return.
What comfort could you give a soldier of God?
The nights here are lonely and cold, my lord, even for a soldier of God.
Perhaps I could warm thee.
Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.
How is it a sin if I am already absolved?
Guards, hold.
Thank you, Lord. You are kind.
I could see it in your eyes.
And your promise of comfort?
How could you do that to me... to us?
I was weak. The war changed me.
You know who I am inside.
We've known each other since childhood.
Does she know you, Dante, or did the Crusades show her your true self?
Beatrice! Forgive me!
Please forgive me.
No, it's not true.
He wouldn't do this to me.
Dante!
What did I say?
Even the purest of souls can be corrupted.
Dante is not the man you once knew.
You did this to him.
You corrupted his heart.
I've had no need to influence humanity for many millennia, my dear.
I simply introduced sin.
Man is the one who has spread it like a disease, cultivating it, empowering it.
It is not our fault, none of it.
Man is good.
No, you don't understand.
The Earth is another form of Hell, and men are its demons.
I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.
I could blame the Crusades, but I know it was my own weakness, my own sin.
Have you considered she is not the only soul you are here to save?
I seek only my beloved Beatrice, and nothing more.
It is Cerberus, guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.
That is the foulest fate one could ever imagine.
And it is your fate as well, for the true circle of Gluttony lies inside of Cerberus's body.
Inside? Good Lord, isn't there perhaps a way around it?
No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.
So be it! For her I will conquer even this.
Face me, wretched creature!
Release me, demon!
Hell can get no more horrible than this place.
I find this circle most unpleasant.
You're a shade.
You should try wearing skin.
Such a fate. Look at them all.
How could such harmless sin provoke such everlasting torment?
The gluttons - what they could not satisfy in life, in death they shall be denied for eternity.
Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?
I too am from Florence.
You were born before I died.
I do not know you, spirit.
You know me. I am Ciacco.
Gluttony was my offense, and here I remain mere skin and bones.
Can you help me, free me from this agony?
Please, please.
Your suffering weighs heavy on my heart, spirit. Be free.
Virgil, what's happening?
How dare you free the damned?
They deserve torment for wasting their fleeting precious lives.
And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?
She is the exception.
A pure soul to remind me of my place in Heaven, to remind me of the light of my father.
But let me ask you, Dante, what of your father?
Beatrice, you must eat.
I have no appetite.
I know you miss my son, but you must keep up your constitution, child.
You're nothing but bone.
It's unappealing for a lady.
Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?
It's just another memory, Dante.
Your father's memory.
- My father?
- He is here with us, Dante.
Would you like to visit him?
Do these tortures never end?
Virgil, Beatrice is not here.
We must escape this beast!
What is this?
Cerberus's black heart.
Destroy it, quickly.
Beatrice!
More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.
What could one man do with so much treasure?
This is the fourth circle - Greed.
All the Earth's treasure that is beneath the moon or ever was cannot give relief to these weary souls.
What a mockery is made of the brief battle for possessions that makes so short a life.
These damned remind me of my father.
What? Where are my last three coins?
Dante?
Dante!
Bella!
Yes, husband.
I'm short three crowns.
Are you stealing from me, woman?
No, Alighiero,
I would never do such a thing.
Liar!
I knew I'd have to watch you.
Now, tell me where you've hidden it, woman, before I throttle you dead.
Don't hit her! Mother!
Can you believe that in my youth
I wanted to be a poet?
But all I ever knew was violence.
And what became of your mother?
She died of a fever a year later.
It was sudden and terrible.
There is no room to pity the dead here, son.
Lucifer did not lie, but then again how could you not be here, Father?
You think you're a greater man than me?
That you're above reproach for your sins?
I took up the Crusade.
The priest absolved us.
And you actually believed him?
No man can absolve you of your sins, but some men can be rewarded in Hell.
Lucifer offered me a thousand years free of torture and endless gold if I would slay my own son.
And where will you spend this gold, Father?
Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.
So be it.
I always despised you.
But you became me, son.
You belong here. You always have.
So I can be damned in Hell with you?
Never!
It's time to claim my prize, boy.
Then claim it.
You want gold, Father?
It's yours.
I cannot go on.
You must, Dante.
Steel yourself.
The journey is not half over.
How do I know you're not another enemy sent by Lucifer?
You could be luring me to my doom all along.
Another trick, another deception.
Search inside yourself.
You know I was sent here from on high.
Forgive me, Virgil.
This place has affected my mind.
Let us move on.
Please, Lord.
Forgive me of my transgressions.
Save me from this horrible torment.
Please, I beg of you.
My God.
I have heard your prayers, beloved Beatrice, and I have come for you.
There is no escape, little soul.
Your prayers are worthless here.
Rejoice, child, for you are about to be granted a rare privilege in the Inferno.
I am making you my bride.
You will become the Queen of Hell.
Are you not pleased?
I cannot stand this wretched place.
For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.
The very air reeks of fury.
Watch your ankles.
More food! We're starving!
We need more food.
We're doing the best we can.
There isn't enough food to go around.
Quiet! Quiet down!
There is nothing we can do.
The granaries are ablaze.
We barely have enough rations for our own men.
Then I'm leaving this post.
I will not put up with guard duty any longer.
You can't do that, Dante.
We came here to kill these heretics, not coddle them.
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
Saladin took the city last year and spared Christian lives.
We should do the same.
Since when are heretics worth a Christian life?
Enough. Enough!
Keep your mind, Dante.
Do not dwell on past deeds here.
See the souls over whom anger has prevailed.
In the black sludge of the River Styx do they wish they had never been born.
The fools. It is here we must cross.
We travel in that?
Perhaps we would be safer swimming.
I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.
Is this a friend of yours, great poet?
Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.
He was the son of Ares and a king in his day.
Hold on.
The ride will be somewhat bumpy.
The angry souls know no end to their fury.
Who are you that comes here before your time?
If I come, I do not remain.
But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.
You were Filippo Argenti in life.
Come down, Dante, and face your old enemy!
Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.
Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near, housing its solemn citizens within.
Damned of Dis rejoice, for your lord, Lucifer, is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.
Truly this will be a marriage of Heaven and Hell.
Hurry, Phlegias! Run!
Beatrice!
Outcasts of Heaven, race despised, why do you rail against a will that cannot be stopped?
Dante?
He has taken her into the tombs.
Hurry, Dante.
Gone. Why does he do this?
Bait us on? Keep us running?
Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul as well as Beatrice's.
He's luring us to the ninth circle.
- What is this place?
- The tombs of heresy.
Here in the sixth circle you will find endless heretics burning in eternal fire.
O Tuscan, who walks through this place speaking so decorously, know that I am Farinata.
Farinata, another hated man in life.
What do you want, spirit?
Know this.
The damned can foresee the future but can never know the present.
Your future, Dante, is filled with death and destruction.
Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell, and you will be damned with us forever.
I never liked him.
What's happening?
The harrowing of Hell.
Christ's death forever quakes this circle.
We must hurry.
Let me go. What do you want from me?
I have taken countless brides over the millennia -
Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.
But, unlike them, your spirit is pure, unspoiled.
I will never succumb to you.
Kill me again and again, slit my throat, tear me to pieces, but I will never love you.
Yes, such passion.
You have a fire inside you.
After we are properly married, you will give me a brood to carry on my legacy.
You will be birthing my children for eternity, sweet soul.
Virgil, do you hear...
Who is this new monster?
What does he want?
The minotaur guards passage into the seventh circle.
Be cautious, Dante.
How dare you threaten us?
Do you think he is the duke of Athens who served up your death above?
Off with you.
Begone, abomination!
Virgil, I think you've made him angry.
Now, while he is blind with rage.
Hold fast. Steady.
Now move!
You have many surprises, poet.
Perhaps you would have made a great warrior in life.
It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.
This circle is reserved for the violent.
Those who have done violence against others forever boil in the blood they have shed.
How shall we cross?
It's impossible.
You summoned me, great Virgil.
Greetings, Nessus.
We need passage across the bloody
Phlegethon. Can you help us?
Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.
The river is treacherous.
Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila, and countless others.
The damned here are worse off than the Styx.
These were the kings of bloodshed and despoilment.
Be wary of the next passage, friends.
My thanks, Nessus.
Good luck to you, mortal soul.
We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.
This is no forest.
Yes, they are those who did violence to themselves.
- This is the wood of suicide.
- Dante...
- No, my friend! Turn back!
- Come to me, Dante.
Come to me, Dante.
Come to me.
Why do you break me?
Have you no pity?
Mother?
Yes, son.
I too am among the damned.
But how can this be?
When a soul takes its own life,
Minos judges it to this circle.
Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.
No body, only pain.
No, Mother, you don't belong here.
You died of fever.
Her heart gave out from the fever.
She was just too fragile.
Where is she now, Father?
In Paradise, son, with all the souls of pure light.
I despised your father's cruelty, but I was too weak to defy him.
And so, I...
I took my...
You learned your father's ways, but you are not lost.
You can redeem yourself.
Beatrice was all I had.
How could I have betrayed her?
The pain you endure purifies you, son.
Heed my words. You must look into your deepest sin to save her.
And what of you?
Only the living can redeem themselves.
I cannot.
This is too cruel a punishment for you, Mother.
God must know this is not your fault.
I'm going to free you.
My soul belongs to God now, son.
We are still in the seventh circle?
Yes, the Abominable Sands.
It is here the damned did violence against God.
We came here to kill these heretics.
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.
Saladin took the city last year and spared
Christian lives. We should do the same.
Since when are heretics worth a Christian life?
Enough. Enough!
Dante, no!
Fight with me, Crusaders.
Spill the blood of these heathens.
Their souls are already lost.
Dante, what have you done?
Crusaders? Here?
Why are you being punished?
Our cause was holy.
We are absolved of sin.
The bishop lied, did he not, brother?
Francesco, not you too.
God never condones violence of any kind.
There was no holy war.
Don't you understand?
The priests lied.
Of all people, how could you be here?
It was you! You did this to me!
No, no, no, listen.
You don't deserve the life given to you, you don't deserve Beatrice, and now you will join us here forever where you belong.
Brother.
I am not your brother.
You're an animal, Dante.
A monster!
I will not let you have her.
You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.
It's over. Justice is inevitable.
Not yet.
He can rest for a while, but he is forever bound here like a shadow of time unforgotten.
He was a good man.
He doesn't deserve such suffering.
Heavenly Father, let the soul of Francesco rise into your divine Paradise.
What?
Pray for your own soul, Dante, for it will freeze with me forever in Cocytus below.
I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.
Yes, a contest.
Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice is soon my queen.
This is the union of the three great rivers of Hell.
Another beast I must slay?
No, Dante. Geryon is our passage to the eighth circle.
Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.
My thanks, Geryon.
This way, Dante.
We are in the circle of Fraud which one commits upon those who trust in him.
You must travel these ten malebolge alone.
And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.
Alone? What of you, great poet?
I will not be far, believe me.
You have proven yourself worthy.
Now hurry, Dante, lest you lose your love forever.
I traveled on alone, over the flatterers and simonists, and as I ran I was overwhelmed with my sins as if every malebolge was a chasm of memory.
I felt my mind weakening with every step, and yet I would not cease.
Release that one.
His ransom has been paid.
My ransom?
No. No, you didn't...
You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?
Didn't you? You whore.
You have shamed me.
You are not my wife, do you hear?
Filthy whore. Whore!
I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.
I swear I'll kill you.
You bastard. You'll see everyone you ever loved dead by my hand.
Dead, dead!
No, it can't be.
I have come for the woman.
No!
Leave her alone. She's innocent.
Run, Beatrice, run!
Get out of my house, filthy dog.
- Get away from me!
- There is no escape for you.
Stay back.
No!
Vengeance is finally mine.
It was me. Beatrice's death.
They were all murdered because of me.
At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.
You are the true cause of
Beatrice's suffering, and the damnation of so many others.
How could you have done such evil to me?
Tear the heart from my chest, rip the very soul from my body?
These sins are my own.
You have no right to Beatrice.
Relinquish her.
Never! Dwellers, night fiends, and torturers of the pit, strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.
Lucifer!
Beatrice, stop!
You don't know what you're doing!
I thought I knew many things.
I thought love was real, but it was only an illusion, a fraud.
There is nothing left for me in all of God's creation.
Yes, my love.
In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.
Beatrice, don't do it!
When you had your way with that girl, you gave me to Lucifer.
It was all because of you.
Beatrice!
No!
No, no.
The faithful has lost her faith.
The incorruptible has become corrupted.
The true innocent has given way to the sins of man, like all the rest before her.
Who can now deny me my rights?
I will leave you with my consort.
She has so much to show you.
This is where you belong, Dante.
You are the greatest fraud of all.
You've lied to me, deceived me, and for that you shall suffer.
Beatrice, don't do this.
You never loved me.
It was all a lie, all of it... our whole life!
Beatrice, listen to me.
I braved the circles of Hell for you.
You mean nothing to me.
But I have faced my sins.
I am ready to take you home.
Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.
Look deep into the ninth circle... the circle of traitors.
God in Heaven, what happened?
Who is responsible for this massacre?
Take care of my sister.
I am responsible.
Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.
When the noble Saladin learns of this atrocity he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.
Take care of Beatrice.
Dante, protect her with your life.
Beatrice, I'm coming home.
I wanted nothing more than to see you and beg for forgiveness.
I will never forgive what you've done, never.
But while I live, I can absolve you.
Forgive me, and free yourself.
My cross.
I brought it back to you.
Accept again the love of God.
Dante.
I forgive you.
I never wanted any harm to come to you.
You have done well, my friend.
And though you may not understand it now, Dante, you have perhaps saved far more than just one innocent soul.
Wait. I can't be separated from her now.
I've come this far.
You cannot claim a place with her yet, Dante.
You have to face the true enemy, in the lowest part of the ninth circle... the circle of traitors.
There, you must face the king of traitors,
Lucifer himself.
He guards your only escape from the Inferno.
We shall be reunited one day. I promise.
Goodbye, my love.
This last trial is for you to face alone.
Godspeed, my friend.
Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.
I will make you pay for her suffering.
I am coming for you.
I fell, not into fire, but into a vast, frozen wasteland.
The very center of Hell, furthest place in all of creation from the divine light of God.
Treachery, the ninth circle of the Inferno.
I walked through the darkness, numb with bitter cold.
All about me were forsaken, frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.
Who are you to walk the paths of Hell so warmly, O living man?
Damned soul, where is Lucifer?
Tell me, before I too freeze in this miserable hell.
Wipe the icy tears from my eyes, and I shall tell you.
The Lord of Hell dwells at the center of this frozen lake.
Past the storms of Ptolomea, deep in the center pit of Judecca, there his icy halls are well protected, and none but the mightiest may cleave a path.
But can you believe me?
Can you believe a traitor?
Long did I wander the dim and icy paths of Hell.
Past the frozen giants of legend...
Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.
I was battered by a frigid wind that was like the beating of Lucifer's black wings.
Finally, after a seeming eternity,
I came to a passage blocked by the frozen links of a mighty chain.
Lucifer thinks he can block my way with this?
He thinks he can stay my vengeance?
Welcome, great Dante.
Welcome to your final resting place, the circle of traitors.
Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell so that I may be reunited with my beloved, but not before I rid the world of your corruption.
You will never see Beatrice again.
The path to Purgatory lies through me.
You are the warrior of a weak and dying God, a God who is the true evil.
His power wanes over the world.
Silence. Your lies have no power over me, Devil.
I will rend the very soul from your frozen body.
Indignant fool.
Come, let me devour your soul as I devoured Judas Iscariot.
You will remain in this pit until creation's last breath, do you hear?
Never!
You are not invincible here.
You are just another demon and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.
You cannot destroy me!
What have you done to me?
I have slain you, great beast.
Victory is mine.
What's this?
New life writhes inside him.
No!
Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.
Many have tried, but all have failed me.
Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...
Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.
Minion? I do not serve you.
Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!
Do you not?
You freed me from my eternal torment.
I came only for Beatrice.
Beatrice? She was only bait.
It was you I wanted all along.
Don't you see?
I was bound by God in this frozen pit, only my shadow self allowed to roam free.
It took a mortal to release me - you, Dante.
No, it isn't true!
I defeated you before.
Show me the path from Hell, or I will end your miserable existence.
Destroy an angel of God?
You arrogant gnat.
Such vanity, such pride.
I could have slain you the moment you fell into Hell.
You worship God, but it was He who created evil.
It was He who created me.
If you knew the true nature of God, Dante, you too would rebel.
No!
You are nothing to me. A talking animal.
He made you in His image... and I was to bow down to you?
I grow weary of this game.
Finally, I will reclaim my proper place in Heaven.
Behold, Dante.
Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory, where awaits your precious Beatrice.
But instead of you,
I shall escape from this pit.
All the souls in Purgatory shall suffer and burn.
And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.
I will plunge the cosmos into chaos, and it is all your doing, Dante.
Because of you, God will finally see me rule His creation.
No, I cannot be the cause of this.
There is nothing you can do to stop me, mortal.
No one can stop me.
One can.
Almighty God, forgive me for all of my wicked sins.
I forsake my escape.
I give up even Beatrice.
I belong here, in Hell, and accept my just damnation.
What are you doing?
A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!
Do not utter a word!
But grant me the power to keep your enemy here with me.
Stop. I command you.
No!
Purgatory.
Beatrice. I will come to you yet.
My love, I have forgiven you.
God will forgive you.
Now forgive yourself.
I fought across Earth and Hell to find my beloved Beatrice.
We were together, neither in Hell nor in Paradise, neither damned nor saved.
I did not die, and I did not live.

Ah!
I scared you!
No, you didn't.
Okay! Remember our field trip rules, everyone.
Uh, no pushing, no biting, and no fire breathing!
What did I just say?
Eighteen, nineteen...
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?
Oh. Mike Wazowski.
Thanks, Joe.
Good luck finishing your crossword puzzle.
Sorry, Michael.
I didn't see you.
That's okay.
When I was on the bus,
I found a nickel!
I wish I had pockets.
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.
Jeremy! You and me?
Okay, no biggie.
Hailey? No?
Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice.
She's a good egg.
Russell.
Mike? Wazowski?
We car-pool?
- We're cousins.
- Hey!
Okay. Good catching up.
Well, Michael, it looks like it's you and me again.
Come on, Karen.
We're falling behind.
Please don't call me Karen.
Now, stay close together.
We're entering a very dangerous area.
Welcome to the Scare Floor.
Wow!
This is where we collect the Scream Energy to power our whole world.
And can anyone tell me whose job it is to go get that scream?
Scarers!
That's right!
Now, which one of you can give me the scariest roar?
Me, me, me!
Oh! Sir! Right here!
Little green guy, two o'clock!
No, it's like this.
Hey, guys, watch this one.
Hey, I got a really good...
Wow!
Whoa.
Well, hey there, kids. Are you on a tour with your school?
- Yeah!
- Yes.
We're here to learn about Scream Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer.
Well, hey, you're in luck, because
I just happen to be a Scarer.
I learned everything
I know from my school,
Monsters University.
Whoa.
It's the best
Scaring School there is.
You wish!
Fear Tech's the best.
Okay. You guys watch us and tell me which school's the best.
All right?
MU is.
West coast coming only.
Scarers coming only.
Oops.
Stop right there.
Don't cross over that safety line.
Human children are extremely toxic.
Look at that!
Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye! Ow!
Look at that!
It's amazing!
I know!
- Wow!
- Excuse me. Fellas.
How about we do tallest in the back?
Look, he's going to do a real scare!
Cool. I want to be a Scarer.
Yeah. Me, too.
Come on, guys.
I want to see.
Out of the way, Wazowski.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.
Brian! Do not step over the line.
Mrs. Graves, Michael went over the line.
Michael!
See?
I told you. He's fine.
Well,
I thought I heard something.
What?
Are you okay?
You could have gotten hurt!
That was real dangerous, kid. I didn't even know you were in there.
Wow. I didn't even know you were in there.
Not bad, kid.
Michael, what do you have to say for yourself?
How do I become a Scarer?
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?
Well, everyone, I don't mean to get emotional, but everything in my life has led to this moment.
Let it not be just the beginning of my dream but the beginning of all of our dreams.
Gladys, promise me you'll keep auditioning.
Marie, Mr. Right is out there somewhere.
Phil, keep using the ointment till that thing goes away.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!
I'm welling up with tears.
Now, get off.
Hello. How are you doing?
Ah!
Whoo-hoo!
Stroke! Stroke!
Come on, put all you have into it!
Okay! First thing on my list, get registered.
Hey there, freshman.
I'm Jay the R.A., and I'm here to say that registration is that away!
Okay, Jay.
Have a great first day.
Hey, I'm Kay! Here's your orientation packet.
Thanks, Kay.
You can drop your bags off here and get your picture taken with Trey.
Say hooray!
Hooray!
I can't believe it.
I'm officially a college student!
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay, and I'll be giving you your orientation tour on this perfect day!
Here are the labs where students learn to design and build the doors to the human world.
Looks like the professor is about to test a door!
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet, three meals a day.
I personally believe we have some of the best chefs in the world.
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah!
The campus offers a wide variety of majors, but the crown jewel of MU is the Scaring School.
Welcome to the debate team.
We're happy to have you.
I disagree for the following reasons.
True happiness is a theoretical construct...
Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky at the astronomy club!
Hey, hey, hey! Come join the improve club.
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...
Ah, dang it!
MU's Greek Council. We sponsor the annual Scare Games.
The Scare what now?
The Scare Games!
A super-intense
Scaring competition!
They're crazy dangerous, so anything could happen.
A bunch of guys went to the hospital last year!
You could totally die.
And it's worth it.
You get a chance to prove that you are the best!
Cool.
Wazowski, Room 319.
You know, your roommate is a Scaring major, too.
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.
Don't force it.
Just let it happen.
Your lifelong best friend is right behind this door.
Hey there.
I'm your roomie.
Name's Randy Boggs.
Scaring major.
Oh! Mike
Wazowski, Scaring major.
I can tell we're going to be best chums, Mike.
Take whichever bed you want.
I wanted you to have first dibs.
Ahh!
You just disappeared.
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class, I'll be a joke.
No, it's totally great.
You got to use it.
Really?
Yeah, but lose the glasses.
They give it away.
Huh.
Okay!
Unpack. Check.
Hang posters. Check.
Now I just need to ace my classes, graduate with honors, and become the greatest Scarer ever.
Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike.
Aren't you even a little nervous?
Actually, no.
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
I just can't wait to get started.
Oh, man! I can't be late on the first day!
Wow.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm so nervous!
Relax. It will be fine.
Good morning, students.
Welcome to Scaring 101.
I am Professor Knight.
Now I'm sure all of you were the scariest monster in your town.
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now, and I do not scare easily.
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.
She's a legend.
She broke the all-time Scare Record with the scream in that very can!
I don't mean to interrupt.
I just thought I'd drop by to see the terrifying faces joining my program.
Well, I'm sure my students would love to hear a few words of inspiration.
Inspiration? Very well.
Scariness is the true measure of a monster.
If you're not scary what kind of a monster are you?
It's my job to make great students greater, not make mediocre students less mediocre.
That is why at the end of the semester there will be a final exam.
Fail that exam and you are out of the Scaring program.
So, I should hope you're all properly inspired.
All right. All right.
Who can tell me the properties of an effective roar?
Yes?
There are actually five.
Those include the roar's resonance, the duration of the roar, and the...
Whoops. Sorry.
I heard someone say "roar," so I just kind of went for it.
Oh, excuse me, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?
Very impressive, Mister...
Sullivan.
Jimmy Sullivan.
Sullivan.
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?
Yeah. He's my dad.
He's a Sullivan!
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.
Well, you won't be disappointed.
Uh... I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?
No, no.
Mr. Sullivan's covered it.
Huh.
Everyone take out your Scaring textbooks and open them to chapter one.
Hey, bub.
Can I borrow a pencil?
I forgot all my stuff.
Ah! All right. Yes. There we go.
That will get it.
Mmm... Yeah.
Come on, Mike.
It's a fraternity and sorority party.
We have to go!
If we flunk that Scaring final, we are done.
I'm not taking any chances.
You've got the whole semester to study, but this might be our only chance to get in good with the cool kids.
That's why I made these cupcakes.
Oops.
That could have been embarrassing.
When I'm a Scarer, life will be a nonstop party.
Stay out of trouble, wild man.
Wild man.
What the...
Archie!
Boo!
Hey! What are you...
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.
That guy's in big trouble.
Yeah, he is.
Hey, guys!
Over here!
Fear Tech dummies.
Oh, oh!
Sorry about that, buddy.
Why are you in my room?
Your room? This is my...
This is not my room.
Archie! Come here, boy.
Archie?
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.
Why is it here?
I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs.
The what?
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.
They only accept the highly elite.
Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig.
Ready? One, two, three. What?
No, no... Oh! What...
That's it.
Don't let go.
Careful. He's a biter.
- Whoa! Whoa, hey...
- Whoa!
I got him!
Uh-oh! Whoa!
That was awesome!
What am I doing?
James P. Sullivan.
Mike Wazowski.
Listen, it was quite delightful meeting you and whatever that is, but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.
You don't need to study Scaring.
You just do it.
Really? I think there's a little more to it than that.
But, hey, thanks for stopping by.
Let go of that!
My hat!
My pig!
Ooh!
Hey! Come here!
Hey!
Catch it!
Ooh! Yeah!
Ride it to frat row!

Did you see him catch that pig?
You are Jaws Theta Chi material, freshman.
Oh, thanks.
I don't know...
No, no, no.
He's an Omega Howl guy.
Back off.
We saw him first.
No way. We did!
I'll take it from here, gentlemen.

What's your name, big blue?
Jimmy Sullivan.
Friends call me Sulley.
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?
I can't believe it! That is crazy!
Chet, calm down.
I'm sorry.
Sulley, any freshman with the guts to pull off a stunt like that has got "Future Scarer" written all over him.
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.
Slow down, squirt. This party is for Scare students only.
Oh, sorry, killer, but you might want to hang out with someone a little more your speed.
Uh... They look fun!
Oh, hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa?
We have cake.
Go crazy.
Is that a joke?
Sulley, talk to your friend.
Oh, he's not really my friend, but sure.
You heard him. This is a party for Scare students.
I am a Scare student.
I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance.
Aw, snap!
My chances are just as good as yours.
You're not even in the same league with me.
Just wait, hotshot.
I'm going to scare circles around you this year.
Oh, okay.
I'd like to see that.
Oh, don't worry. You will.
Ready position.
Common crouch.
I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth.
Basic snarl.
Show me some slobber.
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.
Now here is a monster who looks like a Scarer.
You want a hope of passing this class, you better eat, breathe, and sleep Scaring.
Yeah!
Give me another one.
Fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia.
Fear of thunder.
Keraunophobia.
Fear of chopsticks!
Consecotaleophobia.
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.
Go Monsters University!
You know what to do!
The answer is C, fangs.
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.
A bowl of spiders!
Correct!
A clown running in the dark!
Right again.
Warts, boils, and moles, in that order.
Outstanding!
Ah! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ah!
Ogre slump.
Zombie snarl.
Dominant silverback gorilla.
That is some remarkable improvement, Michael.
One frightening face does not a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.
A Tauntaun grimace with extra slobber.
You got it!
That's what I'm saying.
I am going to wipe the floor with that little know-it-all.
Yes, you are, big blue.
Hey, wait.
What are you guys...
It's just a precaution.
RORs are the best Scarers on campus, Sullivan.
Can't have a member getting shown up by a beach ball.
Whoo-hoo!
I am on a roll.
I'm going to destroy that guy.
Well, then you'll get this back right away.
It's time to start delivering on that Sullivan name.
Today's final will judge your ability to assess a child's fear and perform the appropriate
Scare in the Scare Simulator.
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper, so give it everything you've got.
Dean Hardscrabble is with us this morning to see who will be moving on in the Scaring program and who will not.
Let's get started.
I am a five-year-old girl afraid of spiders and Santa Claus.
Which Scare do you use?
Uh...
That's a Seasonal
Creep and Crawl.
Demonstrate.
Results will be posted outside my office. Next.
Focus.
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!
Hey. Do you mind?
Don't mind at all.
Come on, Mike.
Let's just move.
Stay out of my way.
Unlike you, I had to work hard to get into the Scare program.
That's because you don't belong here.
That's what I thought.
Whoa! Whoa...
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.
What? This?
My one souvenir from a lifetime of Scaring?
Accidents happen, don't they.
The important thing is no one got hurt.
You're taking this remarkably well.
Now, let's continue the exams.
Mr. Wazowski,
I'm a five-year-old girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning.
Which Scare do you use?
Shouldn't I go up on the...
Which Scare do you use?
That is a Shadow Approach with a Crackle Holler.
Demonstrate.
Stop. Thank you.
But I didn't get to...
I've seen enough.
I'm a seven-year-old boy...
I wasn't finished.
I don't need to know any of that stuff to scare.
That "stuff" would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes.
So a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry, alerting his parents, exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course we can't have that.
So I'm afraid I cannot recommend that you continue in the Scaring program.
Good day.
Wait, what?
But I'm a Sullivan.
Well then, I'm sure your family will be very disappointed.
And, Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is something that cannot be taught.
You're not scary.
You will not be continuing in the Scaring program.
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.
Surprise me?
I doubt that very much.
Welcome back.
I hope everyone had a pleasant break.
Some say that a career as a scream-can designer is boring, unchallenging, a waste of a monster's potential.
Open your textbooks to chapter three.
We will now plunge into the rich history of scream-can design.
Out of my way!
Coming through!
Oh, sorry. Ha-ha!
Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.
The Scare Game! Yeah!
We have a special guest, the founder of the games,
Dean Hardscrabble.
Good afternoon.
As a student, I created these gas
as a friendly competition,
but be prepared.
To take home the trophy,
you must be the most fearsome monsters on campus.
So good luck, and may the best monsters win.
We're closing down sign-up, so we'll see you all...
Wait!
I'm signing up!
What?
Uh... You have to be in a fraternity to compete.
Behold the next winning fraternity of the Scare Games, the brothers, my brothers, of Oozma Kappa!
Hi.
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?
You just said the winners are the most fearsome monsters on campus.
If I win, it means you kicked out the best Scarer in the whole school.
That won't happen.
How about a little wager?
If I win, you let me back in the Scaring program.
And what would that prove?
That you were wrong.
Very well.
If you win, I will let your entire team into the Scare program.
But if you lose, you will leave
Monsters University.
Deal.
Now all you need to do is find enough members to compete.
We need six guys, right?
Sorry, chief.
We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm late.
Can I squeeze by you?
Randy!
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm already on a team.
Boggs.
I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike.
Don't blow this for me.
Do the thing.
Oh! Where did he go?
Please, anybody.
I need one more monster.
Just one more!
Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.
We have to move on. Your team doesn't qualify.
Yes, it does!
The star player has just arrived.
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.
We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?
Come on! Let's go!
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.
Good luck.
All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?
This is a fraternity house?
Hey there, teammates!
Come on aboard!
As the president of Oozma Kappa, it is my honor to welcome you to your new home.
We call this room
"Party Central."
Technically, we haven't actually had a party here yet.
But when we do, we'll be ready!
Whoo!
The hot cocoa train is coming through! Whoa!
Next stop... You!
I would like to start us off first by...
So, you guys are Scaring majors?
We were! None of us lasted very long.
I guess we just weren't what old
Hardscrabble was looking for.
Don Carlton, mature student.
Thirty years in the textile industry and then old dandy Don got downsized.
Figured I could throw myself a pity party, or go back to school and learn the computers.
Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"...
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!
And I'm not.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?
Because we never agreed to do this!
You said this was going to be cool!
No one said this was gonna be cool.
Now I'm embarrassed.
Now you're embarrassed?
Yes, because it's in front of people!
You should wake up embarrassed.
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm Art!
New Age philosophy major.
Excited to live with you and laugh with you, and cry with you.
Thought you might like to keep a dream journal.
Guess that leaves me.
Ah!
My name's Scott Squibbles.
My friends call me Squishy.
I'm undeclared, unattached, and unwelcome pretty much everywhere but here.
Now that we've all been introduced, as captain of our team...
So, basically, you guys have no Scaring experience?
Not a lot!
But now we've got you!
You're about the scariest fella I've ever seen.
Even with them pink polka dots.
Aw, thanks.
Actually, I think I bring the whole package.
Your hands are as big as my face!
He's like a mountain with fur!
Oh, come on.
I don't even work out.
Yeah, me neither. I don't want to get too big.
We thought our dreams were over, but Mike said if we win, they're letting us in the Scaring program.
We're going to be real Scarers!
The best!
You betcha!
Yeah!
Right.
And here's what you've been waiting for, fellas.
Your very own
Oozma Kappa bedroom.
Oh... Great!
We're sharing this room?
We'll let you guys get settled.
Anything you need, you just give a big holler-oonie!
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?
Look, they don't need to be good.
I'm going to carry the whole team.
Really? And who's going to carry you?
Hey, if you want to go back to can design, you know where the door is.
Great.
Guys?
Anybody home?
Um...
Hello?
Fellas?
Do you pledge your souls to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?
Ow!
Do you swear to keep secret...
...all that you learn here?
No matter how horrifying?
Hey!
Will you take the sacred oath of the...
For crying out loud.
Sweetie!
Turn the lights on while you're down here!
You're going to ruin your eyes!
Mom!
We're doing an initiation!
Oh, scary.
Well, carry on.
Just pretend I'm not here.
This is my mom's house.
Do you promise to look out for your brothers...
...no matter what the peril?
Will you defend Oozma Kappa no matter how dangerous?
No matter how insurmountable the odds may be?
From evils both great and small?
In the face of unending pain and...
Oh, forget it!
You're in.
Look, we know we're no one's first choice for a fraternity, so it means a lot to have you here with us.
Can't wait to start Scaring with you, brothers.
Time for a celebration!
Yeah!
Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen, because we're building a fort!
Mom, can we stay up late tonight?
Mmm, I know you're a princess and I'm just a stable boy.
Yuck!
Mom! What are you doing?
Your grubby paw was in my bed!
Were you kissing my hand?
No. And what about you with all your shedding?
I don't shed.
Really.
Uh...
Excuse me.
I just want to get my stuff.
Would you just...
Oh, hey. Come on!
...let me get my stuff!
My butt!
First morning in the house.
That's going in the album!
Guys!
We got a letter!
A letter?
We never get mail.
Oh! Sorry.
It's stuck.
Would you...
Give me that!
Tentacles.
They're sticky.
It's the first event of the Scare Games.
"A child's room is where you scare, but avoid the toxicity lurking there."
Wait a minute. Where do they want us to meet?
Of all the sewers on campus, this one has always been my favorite.
Art, you've been here before?
I have a life outside of the house, you know.
Welcome to your worst nightmare, the Scare Games!
Scare Games! Scare Games!
Yes!
Yes, I love it!
I love this energy!
Okay. Okay, everybody.
Let's hear it for the frats and sororities competing in this year's games...
Jaws Theta Chi!
Python Nu Kappa!
Slugma Slugma Kappa!
Roar Omega Roar!
Eta Hiss Hiss!
And finally, Oozma Kappa.
Yay! Whoo-hoo!
Hi, Mom!
Smile!
Let's begin the first competition, the Toxicity Challenge!
Human children are toxic!
And anything they touch is toxic.
We don't have any human toys, but thanks to MU's biology department, we found a close second, the stinging glow urchin!
Trust me when I say, you are not gonna want to touch this bad boy!
I want to touch it.
And you certainly don't want to touch any of its friends.
Yeah, I want to touch them.
This is the starting line.
The light at the end of the tunnel is the finish line.
And whoever comes in last is eliminated from the games.
Mike...
What is it?
Does that mean if we lose, we're out?
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!
Squishy.
We're not going to lose, because we have everything we need to win right here.
Heart.
No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us.
All right, all right.
That's very cute,
It's an obstacle course. What are you going to do? Roar at it?
I can get through faster than you, little guy.
Take your place at the starting line!
This is all about teamwork.
Everybody, stick together.
I'm going to beat you over that finish line.
Get ready to eat my dust.
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?
Attention, teams.
One last thing.
Scarers work in the dark.
I want to go home!
On your marks...
Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.
Thanks! We're going to rip you to pieces!
What?
...get set...
Go!
I'm going to touch them!
Ow!
Come on!
Uh, guys! We're falling behind a little! Fellas!
Cheese and crackers!
Son of a moustache!
Salisbury steak, that hurts!
Is that as fast as you can go?
Just getting started!
What the...
Whoa! Ah!
Oh... Ah!
That's got to hurt!
Ow, ow, ow...
Ooh!
Terry!
Don't worry, we'll be fi...
Ha-ha!
Oh...
Uh-oh. Yikes!
Ow! Ow, ow, ow...
Roar Omega Roar wins!
Take that, Wazowski!
Are you delirious?
I beat you!
Get your eye checked!
Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!
Hey! Second place ain't bad.
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!
What?
Your whole team has to cross the finish line.
Third place, EEKs!
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.
Fifth place, HSS!
No, no, no!
And in last place,
Oozma Kappa.
I can't feel my anything.
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa has been eliminated!
No.
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.
It would have taken a miracle for you to...
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.
Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified.
The use of illegal protective gel is cause for elimination.
What!
Which means Oozma Kappa is back in the games!
It's a miracle!
Your luck will run out, eventually.
This is going to be harder than I thought.
Okay!
Listen up, Oozmas.
Now, we're going to have to start winning these things together, so that means I'm going to need each of you guys to pull your own weight.
Mike?
What is it?
We've made a list of our strengths and weaknesses.
In high school, I was the master of the silent scare.
I could sneak up on a field mouse in a pillow factory.
Sorry! They get stickier when I'm sweaty.
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.
We're experts in the ancient craft of close-up magic.
It's all about misdirection.
Uh...
I have an extra toe.
Not with me, of course.
Guys, one slip-up on the next event, and we're goners.
So for this to work,
I'm gonna need you to take every instinct you have and bury it deep, deep down.
Done.
From now on, we are of one mind.
My mind.
Oh, please.
I will tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it.
Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.
All right.
Give me scary steps.
Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go!
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.
We can't just "get a new team"!
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.
What if we disguised a new team to look like the old team?
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know, leveling the playing field.
Okay, so it's kind of cheating, but what do you want me to do?
They're not exactly the scariest group in the world.
Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish!
Make a wish!
This is not going to work.
Where are you going?
We're training.
I'm a Sullivan.
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.
You're charging ahead when you...
Bup, bup, bup!
You tell them what to do but not me.
So long, Coach.
Okay, Oozmas...
Boy, we need to get you a bell.
Listen up."If a kid hears you coming, they'll call Mom or Dad",
"then you'd better run fast or things will get bad."
Huh?
In the next event, if even one of us gets caught, we're all out.
So remember, do exactly what I do.
We are at the halfway point of the second event, and things are getting interesting.
Got it.
Only two teams left.
Who will make it out with their flag, and who will be eliminated?
You do not want to get caught by a kid's parent.
And in this event, you do not want to get caught by the librarian.
Quiet.
What's so scary about a little old librarian?
I said, "Quiet."
Faster.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Hmm.
Whew!
Ooh!
No!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Look over here!
Is that legal? You better believe it, mop top!
The only rule is don't get caught.
Who!
- Ooh!
- Hey! Over here!
Come and get me! Come and get me!
Whoo-hoo!
Guys, what are you doing?
They said don't let her catch you.
But they didn't say how!
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Come on!
Whoa!
Whew!
We did it!
No, we didn't.
We forgot the flag!
Mike?
Way to go, Squishy!
Way to go, Squishy!
How?
Misdirection.
The EEKs have been eliminated and Oozma Kappa live to scare another day!
We're OK!
We're OK! We're OK!
I've never felt so alive!
We were awesome!
Okay, look.
That wasn't real Scaring.
It was better than what you did.
You should've stuck to my strategy.
Whatever.
Talk to me when we start the real Scaring.
Hey! You guys going to the party?
Oh, I think you've got the wrong guys.
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?
The mid-games mixer at the RORs'.
It's for the top Scare Teams.
See you there!
Did you hear that?
I can't believe it!
Uh-uh. Bad idea.
This is great.
They're finally seeing us as real Scarers.
We're going!
Do young people still dance?
Because my moves are a little rusty.
Oh, we forgot to bring a hostess gift.
We can't go in there without some scented candles.
Calm down.
We earned this.
What if there's a lull in the conversation?
I never know what to... You know...
Say?
How are you so good at this?
You just took on an angry 50-foot librarian, and you're afraid of a little party?
Take a deep breath...
...and in you go!
Hello.
It's Oozma Kappa!
These guys are crazy!
What you did today was insane!
That was awesome!
Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like Scarers!
I've never stayed up this late in my life!
Hey, quiet! Quiet!
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.
All right.
On behalf of the RORs, we'd like to congratulate all the teams that have made it this far.
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!
I love that trick!
Never gets old. HSS!
Very creepy.
And finally, the surprise team of the Scare Games,
Oozma Kappa!
Now, I got to admit, fellas,
I thought you were a bunch of nobodies.
But, boy, was I wrong.
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!
Oozma Kappa!
Oh!
What?
The most adorable monsters on campus.
Ooh! Oh!
Release the stuffed animals.
Faced!
Don't worry. Nobody reads the school paper.
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they read the quad.
Whoo-hoo!
Thank you very much.
Okay. Would you like that with two sleeves or four?
Thanks.
Tell your friends.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Raising a little money for charity.
Yeah? Well, stop it.
You want us to stop raising money for charity?
That's not cool.
This guy hates charity!
I want you to stop making us look like fools.
Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools.
Let's be honest, boys.
You're never going to be real Scarers, because real Scarers look like us.
But, hey, if you really want to work for a Scare company they're always hiring in the mailroom.
Guys, hold on!
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.
We just need to keep trying.
No, you need to stop trying!
You can train monsters like this all you want, but you can't change who they are.
Mike...
We appreciate everything you've done, but he's right.
No matter how much we train, we'll never look like them.
We're built for other things.
Sorry, squirt!
Some monsters just aren't cut out for the big leagues.
The big leagues.
Guys.
We're going on a little field trip.
My tentacle fell asleep.
Thanks, Mom.
Have fun, kids!
I'll just be here listening to my tunes.
Hey, uh, where are we?
The big leagues.
Holy roly-poly.
Wow.
Nice fence.
This is amazing, Mike.
We're not stopping here.
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!
Oh, wow.
Whoa...
Oh!
All Scare Floors now active.
West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.
Look at them.
They're going into the human world, and they don't even look scared!
Wow.
Take a good look, fellas.
See what they all have in common?
Uh... No, not really.
Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer.
The best Scarers use their differences to their advantage.
Wow.
Terri? Look.
Hey!
Look at that old feller racking up the big numbers!
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!
What? Where?
That's really him?
He held the Scare
Record for three years!
Oh! Third door from the end!
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!
Look! It's
"Screaming" Bob Gunderson!
I still have his rookie card.
Me, too!
Doesn't have the speed anymore, but his technique is flawless.
Technique is flawless.
You collected Scare Cards, huh?
Yep. 450 of them.
Impressive. I have 6,000 still in mint condition, but, you know,
450 is pretty good, too.
Hey, look at me! I'm Earl
"The Terror" Thompson!
Whoa!
Oh, that's great!
That's a pretty good one, Squish.
I've been a real jerk.
So have I.
But it's not too late.
We could be a great team.
We just need to start working together.
Hey!
What are you doing up there?
I can't go back to jail!
Come on!
They're right behind us!
Get back here!
Up there! Get them!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Thanks, brother!
Don't mention it.
I'm fine, really! It's just a little heart attack.
Aw... I want a piece of that action!
Mom! Start the car!
What?
Start the car!
Stop the bar?
The car! Start the car!
Oh! Okay.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Get in! Get in!
Mom, go!
Seatbelts.
Okay, go!
Does anyone want gum?
Just drive!
Okay. Here we go!
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!
Rise and shine!
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!
Wake up!
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!
Do I hear thirty-nine?
Come on!
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa, you're looking good.
"To frighten a child is the point of a Scare."
"If you frighten a teen, then Scarer beware."
Okay, scare the little kid.
Avoid the teenager!
I'm on the phone!
No one understands me!
Whatever.
But, Daddy, I love him!
First place, Roar Omega Roar!
Second place, Oozma Kappa!
Whoo!
Third place, HSS.
You're lame.
"Someone is coming, this could ruin your night."
"Stay hidden, take cover, and stay out of sight!"
You got 10 seconds.
Go!
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.
And there should be one more.
How did I do?
Oh! Not too shabby, Don!
Thanks!
I cannot get down.
Zombie snarl!
Angry poodle.
Jazz clown.
My Aunt Phyllis.
In the morning.
That's what I'm talking about!
Time to go to work.
You're out!
You're out.
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.
Thank you.
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're down to two remaining team,
Roar Omega Roar and Oozma Ka!
Which leads us to the final event!
"Every one of your skills will be put to the test."
"The Scare Simulator will prove who's the best!"
Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare in front of the whole school!
Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys.
After you lose, no one will remember you.
Maybe. But when you lose, no one will let you forget it.
Oh, boy. That is a good point.
Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome!
You've got to teach us your moves.
Well, then you're gonna want to talk to this guy.
Oh...
Sure, I can teach you.
All right. You want to hide behind the chair?
You have to become the chair.
Thanks for coming, Dean.
Dean Hardscrabble!
If we get back into the Scaring program,
I hope there's no hard feelings.
Tomorrow, each of you must prove that you are undeniably scary.
And I know for a fact that one of you is not.
No. He works harder than anyone.
Do you think he's scary?
He's the heart and soul of the team!
Do you think he's scary?
We're going to win this thing tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!
We'll finally have our lives back on track.
Hey, Mike?
You know, you've given me a lot of really great tips.
I'd love to return the favor sometime.
Oh. Yeah, sure.
Anytime.
We're doing this now?
Okay.
You've memorized every textbook, every Scare Theory, and that is great.
Hey!
But now it's time to forget all that.
Just reach deep down and let the scary out!
Huh. Just feel it.
Exactly. Go wild.
I don't know. I've kind of got my own technique.
Give it a try.
Good, but bigger!
Nope. You're thinking again.
From the gut!
Let the animal out!
Come on! Dig deep!
Boys!
It's a school night!
So, how was that?
Up top.
Ha-ha!
You know, it did feel different!
I feel like it's all coming together.
Yup, this time tomorrow the whole school is finally going to see what Mike Wazowski can do.
You're darn right.

Welcome to the final competition
of the Scare Games.
Whoo! Yeah!
All right!
It's time to see how terrifying
you really are,
in the Scare Simulators!
But be warne.
Each simulated Scare has been set
to the highest difficulty level.
First
Scarers to the starting line.
Okay, just like we planned. I'll go first.
Then, Don...
Hold on. Mike's the one who started all this and I think it's only right if he's the one who finishes it.
I think you should go last.
Yes!
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!
All right. Don, you okay going first?
I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
Oozma Kappa!
Go Oozmas!
I'm gonna do it. I'm going to beat this guy.
Hey, Bruiser! You take it easy on grandpa.
Unleash the beast, Don!
Okay, then.
Huh? Huh?
Thanks for taking it easy on grandpa.
Next group to the starting line.
Let's do this.
Yes! Yeah!
Come on, Art.
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.
Yes!
Aw!
Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!
You got this, Sull.
And it's all tied up!
Ah!
Tough break for the RORs.
Huh?
Hearts?
Huh?
Way to go, Boggs!
Yay!
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.
Worthington and Wazowski, to the starting line.
Hey.
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.
Don't worry about anyone else.
Just go out there and show them what Mike Wazowski can do.
Thanks.
Don't take the loss too hard.
You never belonged here anyway.
Amazing performance by Worthington!
- Johnny, you're my hero!
The Oozmas will need a record-breaking
Scare to win this.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.
You're not scary.
Come on! Dig deep!
Yeah!
They did it!
Yeah! Hey!
We're in the Scare program! Yeah!
Come here, you son of a gun!
Way to go!
Yeah!
Oh! A little stuck.
Pardon me there,
Ms. Squibbles.
It's Sherrie.
We did it!
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot.
You rule!
I have never ruled before.
You guys killed it out there!
Awesome!
Hey, Wazowski!
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.
Mike?
I did it.
I can't believe it.
I'm going to be a Scarer!
Yeah, yes, you are.
You hear that? Get plenty of rest, kiddo.
You haven't seen the last of Mike Wazowski. Boo!
I knew I was scary. I didn't know I was that scary.
Yeah, we're so scary I guess we broke it.
Come on.
It's been tampered with.
Uh, I don't think you should be messing with that.
Why are my settings different?
Mike, we should leave.
Did you do this?
Mike.
Did you do this?
I...
Yes, I did.
But you don't understand.
Why? Why did you do this?
You know, just in case.
In case of what?
You don't think I'm scary.
Mike...
You said you believed in me.
But you're just like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!
Look, you'll get better and better...
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!
I just wanted to help.
No.
You just wanted to help yourself.
Let the whole team fail because you don't have it?
So your calculations were a little off.
That door took me all semester.
It's too dangerous. The professor's just going to shred it.
There he is, the big guy.
The first of many trophies, I am sure.
Sullivan.
Nice work out there.
I look forward to having you back in class.
Hey, there he is!
Looks like I was wrong about you.
You're one of us after all.
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!
You are one of us now, okay?
Anytime you want to come hang out and do whatever, you got a crew.
You're a ROR, buddy!
Hey!
Where are you going?
You did what?
My team had nothing to do with it.
It was all me. I cheated.
I expect you off campus by tomorrow.
Yes, ma'am.
You're a disgrace to this university and your family name.
What's going on?
Someone broke into the door lab!
What?
Oh, no.
Open the door!
Don't go in there!
You look funny.
What?
I'm so tired.
What's going on?
It's the middle of the night.
A little funny green guy.
I want to touch it!
It's so cute!
James!
No one goes near that door until the authorities arrive.
You don't think that could be...
It's Mike.
But he could die out there!
James, wait!
We can help.
Leave it to the old master of sales.
We got a call in, but that's the best we can do.
Ahem!
Don Carlton, sales. Folks, today is your lucky day.
How many times have you asked yourself the following question...
Arrest him.
Pardon?
Spread them, pops!
Do you mind?
Don't move!
What? Sullivan!
Don't you dare!
Sullivan! Don't go in there!
Mike?
Mike!
The kids said they saw something in the cabin.
They're calling it an alien.
It was!
I saw a little green guy!
What's the problem, ma'am?
Mike?
Bear!
A bear in the camp!
Call this in to headquarters.
Down this way.
All right?
I heard something over here!
Mike!
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.
You were right. They weren't scared of me.
I did everything right.
I wanted it more than anyone.
And I thought... I thought if I wanted it enough,
That Mike Wazowski is something special.
And I'm just not.
Look, Mike,
I know how you feel.
Don't do that!
Please, don't do that!
You do not know how I feel.
Mike, calm down.
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.
You can mess up over and over again and the whole world loves you.
Mike...
You'll never know what it's like to fail because you were born a Sullivan!
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test.
The one who got kicked out of the program, the one who was so afraid to let everyone down that I cheated.
And I lied.
Mike, I'll never know how you feel, but you're not the only failure here.
I act scary, Mike, but most of the time
I'm terrified.
How come you never told me that before?
Because we weren't friends before.
Check the lake!
I heard something here!
This way!
I saw movement!
Over there!
Sulley!
He's cornered!
No!
They're still in there!
Until the authorities arrive, this door stays off!
No! You can't do that! No!
Enough! I want this room cleared now!
You can't do this!
We got to get out of here!
Let them come.
What?
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them, we could generate enough scream to power the door from this side!
What are you talking about?
I have read every book about Scaring ever written.
This could work!
They're adults.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
Just follow my lead.
Mama!
Mama!
Mama...
What the...
Now what?
Phase two.
Keep together.
Are you ready?
Mike, I can't.
Yes, you can.
Stop being a Sullivan and start being you.
Call for backup.
Assistance on the north side.
Repeat, we need assistance on the north side.
Ranger, answer me, what's your 20?
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...
Look! What was it?
Let's go.
Sulley, come on!
How?
How did you do this?
Don't ask me.
Move, move, move! This is a 54-23 in progress.
All right, everybody, clear out.
Secure the perimeter.
No child breach.
Repeat: no child breach.
You ruined our doors!
I've been working on my door all semester!
Let's go, you two.
You're alive!
We are so glad you're safe.
Hey, wait!
That's for the university president to decide.
But you can be sure we'll be watching these two.
Always watching.
Expelled?
So, you're leaving?
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.
Harsh, man.
I'm sorry, guys. You'd be in the Scaring program right now if it wasn't for us.
What?
Well, it is the gosh-darnedest thing.
Hardscrabble's letting us into the Scare program.
What?
She was impressed with our performance in the games.
She invited us to join next semester!
Congratulations, guys!
And that's not the only piece of good news.
Sherrie and I are engaged!
Oh. Who is Sherrie?
She's my mom.
Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas!
Come here.
Give me some sugar.
Oh!
Ugh! So uncomfortable.
Oh, come on, Scott.
I don't want you to think of me as your new dad.
After all, we're fraternity brothers first.
This is so weird.
Just think of me as your big brother that's marrying your mother.
Wait. Hold on.
We're brothers who share the same mom slash wife.
That's worse.
Well, I guess we should be going now.
Promise me you'll keep in touch.
You're the scariest bunch of monsters I have ever met.
Don't let anyone tell you different.
So, what now?
You know, for the first time in my life, I don't really have a plan.
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.
I think it's time I leave the greatness to other monsters.
I'm okay just being okay.
So long, Sull.
So long.
Wazowski!
Whoa!
Stop the bus!
Are you crazy?
Mike,
I don't know a single Scarer who can do what you do.
I know, everyone sees us together, they think I'm the one running the show, but the truth is,
I've been riding your coattails since day one!
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.
You took a hopeless team and made them champions.
All I did was catch a pig!
Technically, I caught the pig.
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?
You pulled off the biggest Scare this school has ever seen!
That wasn't me!
That was you!
You think I could have done that without you?
I didn't even bring a pencil on the first day of school.
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.
But you are fearless.
And if Hardscrabble can't see that, then she can just...
I can just what?
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.
Sorry.
Well, gentlemen, it seems you made the front page again.
The two of you did something together that no one has ever done before.
You surprised me.
Perhaps I should keep an eye out for more surprises like you in my program.
But as far as the two of you are concerned there is nothing
I can do for you now.
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.
And, Mr. Wazowski, keep surprising people.
You know, there is still one way we can work at a Scare company.
They're always hiring in the mailroom.
This is better than I ever imagined!
I bet we break the all-time record in our first year.
Mike, we're mail guys.
I know. I'm talking about the record for letters delivered!
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.
I'll have you know tampering with the mail is a crime punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.
We're right on it,
Mr. Snowman.
The team of
Wazowski and Sullivan are going to change the world starting today!
Say scream!
Scream!
Scream!
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!
Thanks, Merv.
Good luck, Mike!
You coming, Coach?
You better believe it.
I made it!
My first day of class!
Uh, the school year's over, son.
You missed it.
Great.
LEGO The Adventure of Clutch Powers biarcool- thx-to-phan1978
KJELD: Clutch, you can't go after the power crystals by yourself
It's too dangerous.
We, re sending reinforcements.
No thanks, Kjeld.
I work alone.
Glad nobody saw that.
Power crystals.
Whoa!
That's big enough to power LEGO City for a whole year.
Whoa.
Rock Monsters.
Why does it have to be Rock Monsters?
Oh, no.
The Mine Mech.
(NERVOUSLY) Come on, come on.
Whoa.
Time to get creative. Hmm.
Okay. Oh?
Uh-oh.
Perfect.
Uh-oh.
A baby?
Oh, no. This changes everything.
Shh. You'll be okay.
Good baby Rock Monster.
Is this your baby?
Looks just like you.
I'm sorry. l didn't know.
I just wanted one of your crystals.
Thisis Air 7 with a Clutch Powers sighting.
Hey, Clutch, thanks for helping us catch the crook.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Hey, look, it's Clutch Powers.
BOY 2: Hey, Clutch.
BOY 3: Looking good, Clutch.
Hey, Clutch Powers, can we go with you?
We're on our way to a four-alarm fire.
Come on!
Clutch Powers.
Watch out, Clutch!
Watch out!
Clutch Powers.
What's going on, Clutch?
Hey, Clutch.
Clutch, over here.
Welcome to LEGO headquarters.
You'll make great explorers one day.
Clutch.
Kjeld. l got the crystal.
You're late.
You're welcome.
I came as soon as
I got your signal.
Mmm-hmm.
The others made it on time.
What others?
Brick Masterson. Firefighter.
Weapons specialist. Demolitions expert.
S'up?
G'day.
Peg Mooring.
Biologist.
Single-handedly discovered 12 new species of marine life.
Thirteen, actually.
Ever so pleased to meet you.
Yours, love?
Bernie Von Beam.
The LEGO team's most brilliant engineer.
Hallo.
Hi, everyone. l'm...
Well, you're
Clutch Powers, of course.
Possibly the greatest
LEGO explorer ever.
They know who you are, Clutch.
Everyone knows who you are.
What about me?
Does everyone know me?
So, that's your team.
Wow. Pretty impressive.
But I work alone.
As do l.
Yep. Alone.
I work well with others.
Why does he get to be team leader, anyway?
Because.
Because why?
Because he didn't blow up a whole city block on his last mission.
Okay. I'm just asking.
What's gotten into all of you?
Have you all lost sight of the LEGO mission?
Have you forgotten what this organization represents?
Well, it's about helping others.
Fighting the good fight.
Engineering better solutions.
Doing whatever it takes, wherever it takes us.
And how do we do all that?
We build on each other.
It's something l learned from your father.
Yeah, that sounds like him.
He always talked a good game.
I brought you here because we've got a problem on Planet X-4.
The prison planet?
The Space Police lnterstellar Supermax
Correctional Facility, to be more specific.
It holds just three prisoners, the three most vicious criminals in the entire galaxy.
Two days ago, we received a garbled distress call from the Watch Commander.
WATCH COMMANDER:
The prisoners are escaping.
We need help.
KJELD: Then we lost communication with them entirely.
WATCH COMMANDER: Hurry.
What happened?
Prison break?
That's what l need you to find out.
Come on. We have a spaceship ready for you.
Oh. Hey, hey! Hey!
Yes, Brick?
Do l get to blow something up?
It's possible.
I guess it depends on what we find.
It's a bit of a mystery.
Yuck!
I hate mysteries.
I like mysteries.
Clutch Powers?
The Clutch Powers?
And you are?
Your biggest fan.
"A. Fol"?
Arthur. My friends call me Artie.
You can, too.
Call me Artie.
Or be my friend.
Right, Artie, like the great Clutch Powers would ever be friends with somebody like you.
Artie?
He knows my name.
There's no need to bow.
Of course. Of course.
You only bow to royalty, and you're not a king.
More like a god.
Arthur.
Artie.
Kjeld says you have a ship ready for us.
Oh, my golly goodness.
It's gotta be here somewhere.
I know l put it in...
Yes, the other pile.
Yes. No? Right!
This pile is the pile it was in.
I know I've got it.
Just came off the assembly line.
It's a Space Police
Lighthouse Massive Cruiser with modified crew quarters,
X-over-M thrusters and an ion-burst relativity jump drive for intergalactic travel.
And it's got a spinner.
Any questions?
Yeah, how are we all supposed to fit in this little thing?
BRICK: (CHUCKLES) Wow!
Well, why didn't you say so?
You're bringing extra hair?
A girl's gotta be prepared.
Whatever. Back up.
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?
Never send a girl to do a man's job.
Here. Let me give you a hand.
Yes!
MALEVOICE:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
Seat belts, everyone?
... three, two...
Brick?
Seat belts?
We don't need no stinking...
... one, zero. Blast off!
...seat belts!
ALIENVOICE: Pizza delivery.
What idiot ordered pizza on the way to a mission?
BRICK: Where's my pizza?
Are we there yet?
How much longer?
Can't this thing go any faster?
I'll have you know we're going 1 .6 million kilometers per hour.
Actually, 1 .64 if you factor in the gravity slingshot effect.
You know, I'm quite the diarist myself.
I... What?
Isn't that your journal?
What journal?
The one you're sitting on.
Oh, that journal.
It's not mine.
It's my father's.
Your father?
Powers. Of course.
You're the son of Rock Powers, the legendary explorer.
I found this symbol in his notes.
It's just like the symbol from the prison distress call.
What did he make of it?
He didn't. lt was his last entry before he up and disappeared.
He was always missing.
Off on some crazy adventure or expedition.
But, hey, at least it taught me to fend for myself.
Yet here you are, still looking to him for guidance.
He was the best.
He never needed anybody or to be a part of a team.
BRICK: Practicing your secret handshake?
No, no, no, it's just... We were...
It's none of my business. l thought you should know.
We're there.
Ready for final approach.
You'll take it nice and easy, ja? l get motion sick.
Nice and easy.
Have you done this before?
It's like driving a fire truck, in space.
PEG: Didn't you crash that fire truck?
Whoa!
Slow down.
You're crazy!
Give me the controls.
Relax, I got it.
CLUTCH: You killed the engines.
BRICK: Oops!
Let go of the wheel.
This is why I work alone.
There you go, nice and easy.
Maybe l should guard the spaceship.
Let's go.
BRICK: This is the first time anyone had to break into a prison.
Okay. The air is good.
Smells like old gym socks.
Shh.
Well, it does.
Oh! And garlic, wow.
Oh, and a burrito platter.
That was tasty.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.
Keep an eye out behind us.
PEG: We should have left old stinky in the spaceship.
BERNIE: Nobody told me there was a burrito platter.
CLUTCH: Guys, come on.
It's empty.
The coast is clear.
Brick, watch our backs.
Keep an eye out for the Watch Commander.
Something bad happened here.
Brilliant deduction.
(THUDDING) Aah!
Help! Let me out of here!
What is that thing?
Let me out of here!
I got this one.
Put that thing down, you fool. Clutch.
Get her off of me.
What are you doing?
My job.
CLUTCH: l told you to stay back.
BRICK: Says you.
Hello?
This is my call.
Says you.
Come on.
Over here.
Please acknowledge me!
ALL: What?
Take cover.
Give me that.
PEG: It's the
Watch Commander.
I thought you'd never get here.
Come on, they're getting away.
You know, by the book.
So, there's absolutely no way they can escape from this planet.
It's just a matter of time before we capture them.
BERNIE: That sounds like our spaceship.
Who left the spaceship unlocked?
Um, that would be me.
But Brick's the one who left the keys in the ignition.
Yeah, but l didn't leave the operator's manual on the dashboard.
I wanted to guard the spaceship.
What kind of rescue team are you supposed to be?
Thanks to your bickering and squabbling, the three most vicious criminals in the galaxy are on the loose.
Do you have any idea what a disaster this is?
By now, they're already in hiding, plotting their next move and stuff.
Which is?
To unite all the forces of evil in the entire known universe.
Duh!
Would this be the right time to say we're sorry?
How are we gonna get back now?
CLUTCH: Guys, let's focus.
It's time to get creative.
Brick, you're on engines.
Bernie, flight control.
Peg, landing gear.
How am l gonna build a team out of a bunch of strangers?
It's not like we chose each other.
You can say that again.
Who does he think he is bossing me around, just because he's the boss and I'm around?
What are you doing?
You're making a mess.
I'll take that, thank you.
Who put that there?
Hey, watch it!
Pull it this way.
No, it doesn't.
No, you're wrong.
No, it goes like this.
Come on, it's just rocket science.
Can't get anyone to do anything around here.
What a mess this is.
These guys don't know what they're doing.
There. All done.
This is why I work alone.
If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.
There. All done.
Now that's how you build a spaceship.
Would somebody pleaseexplain to me whatjust happened?
Well, we built a new ship out of spare parts.
It was really quite ingenious. First...
At. The. Prison.
What happened at the prison?
Uh, can l take this one? l just want to say, this is all her fault!
My fault?
You were supposed to be watching our backs.
Can't hear you.
La-la-la-la-la.
Stop it. This is my fault and mine alone.
I was in charge of this mission.
So, if you want to blame anyone, blame me.
I allowed myself to be distracted from the mission.
By what?
I found a clue about what happened to my father.
Yourfather?
My father vanished three years ago on a top-secret expedition.
After all this time.
We thought his creation spark had been extinguished.
But then l saw this symbol on one of the prison cells.
What does it mean?
Omega.
It's the name of one of the three prisoners who escaped.
Kjeld, we've gotta go after him.
We don't know where he is.
But we've got a lock on the wizard who led the escape, and the situation is urgent.
He's putting an entire planet in jeopardy.
I'm sorry, Clutch.
Omega will have to wait.
Then let's get to work.
Say hello to prisoner number one,
MallockThe Malign, the EvilWizard of Ashlar.
Hello.
What's Ashlar?
A medieval world forgedfrom might and magic.
Mallock once ruled
Ashlar with an ironfist.
The only thing that could defeat him was the golden sword of the rightful king, the great King Revet.
He vanquished the dark wizard, but he paid the ultimate price.
His creation spark was extinguished.
Now Mallock has returned to Ashlar and reunited with his Skeleton Army to continue his quest for evil dominion.
Our only hopeis that the skill and courage of the great king have passed to his son,
Prince Varen.
Why doesn't the Prince fight back?
Heis young and untrained and something of a disappointment.
He needs someone to show him the way.
Is there a problem, Bernie?
(GROANS) Got it!
So, what's the mission?
Your missionis tofly to Ashlar, find PrinceVaren, and help him recapture the evil wizard Mallock.
Preparing to engage ion-burst relativity jump drive.
BERNIE: Be gentle.
Look! It's LEGO Hindge, the oldest and most mysterious minifig-made structure in all the universe.
No one knows what it was built for.
Oh! They're still studying it to this very day.
PEG: You're going too fast.
BRICK: No problemo.
I've always wanted to see it.
It's so incredible, ja?
You try and parallel park this thing.
What... Wait...
VILLAGER: Help us!
It's the dark magic.
None of our high-tech weapons will work.
Oh, no fair.
He must have cast a spell on this place.
He? He who?
He, him.
Holy hovercraft!
If l were wearing boots, l'd be shaking in them.
Let's go find Prince Varen.
I got a bad feeling about this.
I am getting so tired of your constant negativity.
Well, I'm not the one who lost the castle.
I didn't lose it.
It's just missing.
VILLAGER 1 : Somebody help us! Please!
Where is the Prince?
VILLAGERS: Have mercy.
Lock them away until they tell us where to find the Prince.
VILLAGER 1 : Please, let us go.
See, l think he's happy.
You two!
I am not happy.
Did you find the Prince?
I'll ask you once more and once more only.
Where is the Prince?
Well, not to tell you how to do your job, but a better question might be,
"Where is the castle?"
Good idea.
We know that one.
Well? Where is it?
It's missing.
Vanished.
Disappeared without a trace.
Gone with the wind.
Hogar.
And the Prince?
Well, we couldn't find him.
See, we went looking for him at the castle, but the castle was missing.
Course you already know that.
And then we were attacked by a bunch of knights.
A knight, actually.
There was only one.
But he was very effective.
Unpleasant.
Mean, l'd have to say.
Mean? Would you go that far?
Yeah. When he did the thing with the thing...
Right, right. Mean.
I'm good with mean.
This knight had a voice like thunder.
A sword as fast as lightning.
He came at us like a whirlwind.
All in all, we'd have to say...
BOTH: lt was a dark and stormy knight.
Find me the Prince, or else!
Nothing here but a bunch of junk.
We've got everything we need for a battle cart.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
LEGO!
Hey! Save your fight for Mallock.
Apologies, all.
You're right.
Good. It's time we start acting like a team.
Bernie, you're in charge of the build.
Just make it strong.
Strong. My neck.
And we're gonna need weapons.
Over here.
Over here. Pick me.
Pick me, me, me.
Brick, would like to be in charge of weapons?
Uh, what else you got?
Sure, no problem.
You want me to do weapons, I'll do weapons.
Peg, you see these tracks?
You spotted them, too?
Something with wings, l think.
A griffin perhaps.
Find out what it is and whose side they're on.
All right, team.
You've got your assignments.
I'll be back soon.
Where are you going?
To find Prince Varen.
MALLOCK: What do you think you're doing?
I told you to bring me a minifig.
This is a real fig.
Find me the Prince, now!
This whole place is going to pieces.
Hmm.
(CHUCKLES) Skelly! Bones!
Where are those ninnies?
Hey, look at this.
What are you doing?
Follow him!
And he'll lead us right to the Prince.
I don't get it.
Ah!
Alley-oop.
Sneaking, hiding, sneaking, hiding...
(CHUCKLES) We got him.
Hello, are we still hiding? Look what l found.
What are you doing?
Same thing as you.
Oh! Don't forget...
I'll just put this on here.
And right on here.
Give me that.
That's not funny.
Perfect.
Get down!
What part of hiding don't you understand?
Mmm.
Okay.
It's adorable.
I gotta touch it.
What are you doing, man?
No! Don't do that.
You're beautiful.
I'm so in love with you.
We could get married and build a house and build some kids.
None shall pass.
What are you doing in my forest?
My name is Clutch Powers.
I must find Prince Varen, the rightful heir to the throne of Ashlar.
Nobody crosses this bridge unless they pass three tests.
If you succeed, l will take you to Prince Varen.
And if l fail?
Then, l will eat you.
Bring it on.
You say you're
Clutch Powers, then prove it.
The real Clutch Powers would know how to build his own...bridge.
Next?
Using nothing but standard eight-stud bricks, how many bricks would it take to build a spiral staircase as tall as three minifigs?
There are more than 91 5 million ways to combine standard LEGO bricks.
But they will never connect on the diagonal.
So, it's a trick question.
It can't be done.
Not so fast.
For your final test, you must answer a riddle.
A riddle?
Yes, a riddle.
Trolls ask riddles.
It's what we do.
Fine. Ask away.
You hold my hand, though we cannot touch.
You hear my voice, though I do not speak.
You see my face, though I am not here.
Who am l?
You hold my hand, you hear my voice, you see...
You see my face.
The answer is my father.
Oh! You're good.
Now answer me.
Where can l find Prince Varen?
Yes, do tell.
We're dying to know.
Hand him over.
Mallock's orders.
This is not the man you are looking for.
Yeah, it is.
Darn! That never works for me.
Well, hate to eat and run, but...
SKELLY: Man, that hurts.
I hate when this happens.
Come on.
Let's get him.
Hey, where'd he go?
There he is, over there.
SKELLY: I can see where he is, man.
BONES: Okay, wait, can you remind me?
SKELLY: He went this way.
Which way?
SKELLY: Wait, it might have been that way.
BONES: Okay.
SKELLY: No, this way.
Let's go.
BONES: We got him now.
Okay. All right.
SKELLY: He's right there.
This way, this way. l thought there was a thing over here...
Wait, wait.
Where did he go?
Great. First you lose the castle, now this.
I didn't lose the castle.
You lost the castle.
Oh, no, you lost the castle.
No, you lost the castle.
You lost the castle.
No backs.
No fair.
Besides, we didn't lose it.
We just can't find it.
SKELLY: Yeah, yeah, and it's not that we weren't looking,
'cause we were always looking, it just wasn't around.
BONES: Exactly.
We just play stupid.
You think we can do that?
SKELLY: Well, you know,
I think you're probably
CLUTCH: Hey!
Let me out of here.
Did everyone have the burrito platter?
(BURPS) With extra garlic.
Now let's go.
Not so fast.
Who are you?
I am Hogar The Troll.
And you can take me to Prince Varen?
Open the gates.
Whoa!
Shall we?
Yeah, where do you want these doohickeys?
Those are called
Rack Winder Axles.
Stack them over there.
In a neat pile.
Technically, there's no such thing as a neat pile.
How about these whatchamacallits?
That's a 40-tooth spur gear.
Yeah, I'll put them over here with these other gizmos.
You need anymore of these thingies here?
Those are called "hinge rods."
Not "thingies" or
"doohickeys" or
"whatchamacallits." Okay?
Can l have one of those thingies?
It's not a...
Would you like a blue thingy or a red thingy?
(SIGHS) Brilliant.
Well, I'm off.
Cheers, all.
Good luck with your thingy.
Hey, I got that jazzamabob unstuck.
Oh, you poor dear.
That's a nasty cold, isn't it?
I built that wall to keep us hidden from
Mallock's prying eyes.
You built it?
But you're a...
I mean, aren't you a...
I mean, why?
Why is a disgusting, horrible, nasty-looking troll fighting for the good guys?
I wouldn't say disgusting.
I fight for the memory of King Revet because King Revet fought for me.
Despite my outward appearance, he saw that we were the same on the inside.
He took me in and embraced me.
He trusted me.
I will do everything in my power to keep this kingdom from falling to the forces of darkness.
But what does Mallock want?
This.
This is no ordinary sword.
In the hands of the rightful king, it has power over the mightiest evil.
Alas, we have no king.
If this sword falls into Mallock's hands, his villainy will be unstoppable.
But what about Prince Varen?
I do what l can to protect him, just as his father once protected me.
But he's young and inexperienced.
But...
There is no but.
His heart is in it, but l fear the rest of him isn't up to the challenge.
I can work with heart.
Where is he?
Clutch Powers, meet Prince Varen.
I got distracted, that's all.
Happens to the best of us.
Happens to me all the time.
I can show you what you're doing wrong.
It's pretty simple.
I doubt it.
I'm no good with a sword.
No, it's a broadsword, not an épée.
Hold it high above your head and swing from the shoulder. l told you I'm no good with a sword.
Who said you could bring strangers in here anyway?
Mallock's army of skeletons is amassing even as we speak.
We have to move now.
Not until I'm ready.
I'm here to help you defeat the evil wizard.
Trust me. I can help.
Like you helped me just now?
I don't need you.
I've got an army.
But do you know how to use it?
A sword is only as good as the knight who wields it.
I don't need your help.
Oh! What is wrong with him?
Why won't he listen to me?
Remember, he's not here for you.
You have to be here for him.
Hmm.
Wait! Where are you going?
Are we ready yet?
There. All done.
Sweet meteors, it's about time.
Everything is properly organized and sorted by function.
First, we arrange the parts in ascending order of size. Then...
Done. What do you think?
Well, extraordinary.
Except for this piece, which was in the instruction manual you didn't follow.
Nah!
But I'm sure it's not important.
I'll just hold on to it for safekeeping.
Just in case.
Hey, now you've got extra hair, just like Peg.
Me, like Peg?
And l quite like you, too, Bernie.
No, that's not what I said.
I mean, it is what I said, but it's not what I meant.
I didn't mean I like you.
I do like you, but what l was trying to say was...
Jumping jellybeans!
What happened to you?
It's just a little flesh wound.
And while I was gone, l see you were all playing dress up.
Everything went perfectly according to plan.
No surprises here.
Oh! Are you okay?
Oh, l'm...
You poor dear.
Don't mind me.
It's just my head.
I'll give you a pain in the head! Coming here to steal me gold for that evil wizard.
We thought this mine was abandoned.
Abandoned? She's beautiful, she is.
I'll give you abandoned, you little...
Who are you calling little?
Wait! You don't understand.
We're not here to help the evil wizard.
We're here to defeat him.
My heroes!
Lofar, at your service.
Good. We'll need all the help we can get.
Clutch, you're back.
Did you find the Prince?
Yup.
And?
We'll have to defeat
Mallock on our own.
We can do this.
He may have a thousand-strong army of skeleton warriors, but we've got...
Backbone?
Pluck?
Guts?
Me lucky socks.
Each other.
Peg, Bernie,
Lofar, you create a diversion out front while we drop behind the tower.
Once we're inside, load the cannons and let her rip.
Okay. Everyone know their assignment?
VAREN: l don't.
I've decided to allow you to help me.
And I've brought a few friends.
CLUTCH: The knights will attack the front with the others while l join Prince Varen in the back to face off with Mallock.
But it's my duty to lead the royal knights into battle.
But we need you inside to go after Mallock.
You can't be in two place at once.
Who says?
Your hair.
Give us your hair.
What's going on?
You're Prince Varen now.
Get up there and lead your knights into battle.
I look like a girl.
But a very pretty girl.
Prince Varen?
Mallock The...
Mallock The Malign, it is l, Prince Varen, rightful heir to the throne of Ashlar.
Come out with your hands up.
I can't believe l have to wear girl hair.
Shh.
(SOFTLY) Well, it's stupid.
No, come on. Come on.
Well done, lads.
Well done.
The last person who made it past my enchanted armor was your father.
Leave him alone, Mallock.
Can't you fend for yourself, boy?
After all, you are the king.
I said, leave him alone.
Too bad there's no one to save you now.
I'm warning you for the last time.
ROCK: Clutch?
Is that you? Clutch?
Dad?
He's right here.
Clutch! No!
Don't look at the crystal ball!
Dad! Dad, is that you?
VAREN: Clutch, don't look at the crystal ball.
It's a trick.
Clutch! Clutch!
What?
No!
Skeleton warriors, army of the night, l summon you!
Arise and attack!
These guys look bad to the bone.
Attack! Run them down and run them through.
Charge!
SOLDIERS: Yeah!
Take that!
SKELLY: Oh, yeah!
Hey, isn't that
Uncle Morty?
Hey, Morty!
Oh, Morty!
Get your head in the game.
He should've boned up on his fighting skills.
How about this one?
He always was a bonehead.
You out?
Bone dry.
LOFAR: Retreat!
Slow down!
Speed up! Speed up!
Turn around.
(SIGHS) l told you.
I'm no good with a sword.
This was my fault, not yours.
Why did he let us live?
He wants to display us like trophies.
Break his enemy's spirit.
Show them their worst fear.
What do you think you're doing?
I was driving.
You call that driving?
It's not her fault we crashed.
The wheels came loose because you left out a part.
If we stuck to your plan, we'd still be building it.
Well, at least it would be done right. Dummkopf
At least we got away.
That makes you happy, running away?
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Well, we know we can trust you to wreck everything.
Peg, may l speak to...
What is it, Bernie?
Oh?
Yes. Well, thank you.
Peg, l have something
I've been meaning to tell you. l love you. l just...
Bernie, look!
Bring me the golden sword of King Revet, or this is the last time you'll ever see them.
Hogar. Hogar!
Where are you going?
I must do as Mallock demands.
No! l must. l have no choice.
Yes, you do.
Don't give it to him.
I promised his father
I would protect his son.
I gave my word no harm would come to Prince Varen.
I'm sorry.
You'll pay for this trick, Hogar.
Wait, wait, where's the sword?
I dropped it.
What?
I couldn't even get it out of my scabbard.
I guess it's still in the hall, by the armor.
That means he doesn't know where it is.
We're going to get out of here, and I'm going to get you that sword before Mallock finds it.
How? There's nothing but a bunch of bones.
What are you doing?
If you wanna send a message, nothing beats hand delivery.
Brick, can you show me how to load the weapons?
What are you talking about?
They're shattered.
Then I'll help you rebuild them.
What's gotten into you?
Look!
BRICK: "LEGO."
Don't you see what he's trying to tell us?
Uh-uh.
We build on each other.
Give me five minutes,
I'll give you an arsenal.
That's the spirit.
Bernie, can you fix this rust bucket?
There's no way.
The frame is shattered, two wheels are gone, and we're missing half the parts.
I can't do it!
I tell you, I can't!
Okay. I'll do it.
Lock and load.
We're going in.
Huh?
Huzzah!
Tally-ho!
Thanks for letting me drive.
How's it handle?
Like a three-legged hippo.
I did the best with what l had.
It's an engineering marvel, Bernie.
I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but I do have one teensy question.
How exactly are we gonna get to Clutch?
Good boy!
You do have a way with animals.
Hey, Clutch!
Skelly? Bones?
Where are those nincompoops?
Snake eyes!
Roll them bones.
Here we go.
That's right, put it down.
Roll them high.
Come on, baby.
Good stuff.
Good stuff.
Load me up, Bernie.
I'm going in.
What? Wait a minute.
Whoa! Mommy!
Seven, again!
This is my lucky day.
Don't be jealous.
The wheel's jammed.
It won't turn.
We have to jump.
On three.
One, two...
I can't. I'm stuck.
Jump! What are you waiting for?
Hold me tight. l will go get your legs.
Oh! I'm not half the man l used to be.
Hurrah!
This sword, in your hands, gives you the power over the greatest evil.
But I'm no good with a sword.
You saw.
No. I'll tell you what I saw.
I saw a brave warrior tackle an enchanted knight with nothing but bare hands and courage.
I don't know.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
No! My father had this power, but l'm not my father.
He's always with you.
His strength lives in you.
MALLOCK: This is the end,
Prince Varen.
I'm going to snuff your creation spark just like l took your father's.
All your friends will be defeated and this kingdom will be mine, forever.
Huh?
BRICK: Take this, take that...
Back off!
Here's a little bit more for you to take. l told you it might come in handy.
No! You'll never take my kingdom.
Give me the sword,
Clutch Powers.
Give me the sword, and l will take you to your father.
You can see him again.
Just give me the sword.
No, Clutch.
Give me the sword.
I can take you to him.
Give me the sword, or you'll never see your father again.
He's alive?
Clutch, he's right here.
He's always with you.
I already found him.
Don't worry, this is my battle.
Hey, Mallock, over here!
Get him. Yeah!
That's the spirit.
You can do it.
Come on, Varen! Yeah.
This is the end, Prince Varen.
That's King Varen.
And you're under arrest.
Yeah! We did it!
Long live the King!
ALL: Long live King Varen!
Oh, my hip is killing me.
Hey, nice toss back there, gear-head.
You weren't so bad yourself.
Sorry.
Just kidding.
Thanks, Bernie.
But I think it looks better on you.
Clutch, I know what you gave up back there.
And I know it wasn't easy.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
I'll find my dad someday.
For now, it's enough to know he's alive.
Great work, Clutch.
Uh, don't thank me.
Thank the team.
Tens and 20s would be fine.
Oh?
We've located your next target, on the other side of the galaxy.
I think you know what this means.
I'm driving!
I call shotgun.
Here we go again.
Preparing to engage ion-burst relativity jump drive.
We are gathered here today to immortalize in song the life and untimely death of a great legend.
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn and assorted confections while we tell you the strange and bewildering tale of a hero who has yet to enter his own story.
Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake.
Okay, everybody, let's take it from the top.
The stage is set, the night moist with apprehension.
Alone in her chamber, the princess prepares to take her own life.
"It is far better to nourish worms than to live without love."
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio plots his ascension to the throne while her aging father lies gravely ill.
"Yes, I am gravely ill."
"Hark, who goes there?"
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero, returning to rescue his emotionally unstable maiden!
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue, or taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!
The sting of my...
Dr. Marx?
Dr. Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you.
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.
Mr. Timms? You were good.
Perhaps a little too good.
What's that, Victor? My character's undefined? That's absurd.
I know who I am.
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.
Every story needs a hero.
I mean, who else is better qualified to bask in the adulation of his numerous companions?
The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.
Who am I?
I could be anyone.
I could be the sea cap'n returning from a mighty voyage to reclaim his mechanical arm!
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist, battling pythons down in the Congo!
Down, Chongo, down!
And if you desire romance,
I will become the greatest lover the world has ever known!
I couldn't help but notice you noticing me noticing you.
You know, the womens find me uncomfortably good looking.
But you seem remarkably at ease.
Stop it. No, really.
Well, if you must. What are you doing?
That tickles. Are those real?
That's it! Conflict.
Victor, you were right.
I have been undefined.
People, I've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!
What our story needs is an ironic, unexpected event that will propel the hero into conflict!
Mr. Timms?
That's right! You!
Don't be shy. Come on.
It's okay.
That's it, a little closer.
Good.
I won't bite you.
I need a little help here.
Are you okay?
I must get to the other side.
The other side? You mean, just now, that was you crossing the road?
That's why the...
Why'd you do that?
This is my quest. He waits for me.
What? Who?
The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.
They say he rides an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.
What are you talking about?
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.
Nothing? Your delusional quest just ruined my life!
I had an incredibly complex social network going!
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!
Friends? I don't see no friends.
You are a very lonely lizard.
Look, I need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.
I need lotion.
I'm down to one layer of skin already.
Pretty soon,
I'm going to start seeing my insides.
Not unlike what you've got going there.
Listen, I can't survive in the desert, okay?
I... I don't belong here.
That may be true, but here you are.
Now help me up and I will help you find what you seek.
- You will?
- And perhaps more.
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.
The Spirit is waiting for me.
Okay, okay.
Okay. That's not going to work.
I must get to the other side.
Why don't you just wait until there are no cars coming?
It's not so easy as it looks.
What?
Is a metaphor.
There's another one!
I knew it.
You need a little help, amigo?
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.
The path to knowledge is fraught with consequence.
I'm just looking for the path to water.
If you want to find water, you must first find Dirt.
Dirt.
Destiny, she is kind to you.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.
At noon, the townspeople gather for a mysterious ritual.
A town? You mean, with real people and everything? Where?
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.
You want me to just walk out into the desert?
That's the way.
Okay. So you're saying there's a town, a real town, not a metaphor town.
Go on. It's okay.
Okay.
Well, then, I'm going.
I am leaving the road now!
I'm walking into the desert!
Alone!
We all have our journeys to make!
I will see you on the other side.
Welcome, amigo
To the land without end
The desert and death
Are the closest of friends
We sing of his courage
In magnificent song
But pay close attention
He won't be here long
As the birds pluck his eyes
The sun bleaches his bones
See his entrails get scattered
Watch him lose his cojones
Here in the Mojave Desert, animals have had millions of years to adapt to the harsh environment.
But the lizard? He is going to die.
"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers..."
- Don't move.
- What?
- Don't move!
- Not moving.
Not moving.
Try to blend in.
Blend in? What do you mean?
Blend in.
What are you saying?
- Too late.
- No, no. It's not too late!
I'm blending! I'm a blender!
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?
Stop moving!
Try not to look conspicuous.
- What are you doing?
- I'm blending.
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.
- No room at the inn.
- It's an art, not a science.
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.
Oh, hey. Proboscis.
Testy.
Please, no, please. I have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!
Please, no.
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!
Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your huevos!
Big bird! Big bird!
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- I don't know you!
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!
I'll let you kiss my sister!
You son of a...
Where are your friends now, amigo?
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges off my boots!
Sorry.
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow lessen you want to spend the better part of the afternoon putting your face back together!
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
- I'm asking the questions here!
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.
Now someone's dumping water in the desert!
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size and dimension, but I intend to find out what role you playing in all this.
- Role?
- What are you involved in?
Well, I'm glad you asked.
I've got two one-acts, a mystery and a musical I've been gestating.
I got the words, I'm just working on the melody right now. It's like a...
I think it's gonna be a western.
A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a slapper
She'll be coming 'round the mountain in the rain
You ain't from around here, are you?
I'm still working on it.
So, what's your name?
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.
What can I say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.
Well, you're lucky he didn't plumb love asparagus.
What are you saying?
I mean,
I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself, but I'm not sure that a child would appreciate the moniker.
My daddy was a great man, even if he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!
You carry his remains?
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month!
And for you to insinuate that he would abandon his parental responsibilities at a delicate time in my personal development is an affront to my sense...
Miss Beans?
Miss Beans? Hello?
Hello?
And until the people of Andromeda Five return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?
- You're cuddling me.
- You were frozen.
- I was not.
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.
It's a defense mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.
You're making that up.
So, you gonna die out here, or you want a ride into town?
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.
So who are you, really?
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.
There's my stage name, my pen name, my avatar.
I had a pseudonym once, but I had it legally changed.
And so the stranger, seeking companionship, finds the woman, much like the sirens of ancient times luring him to his certain demise.
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.
I'm actually one of the few men with a maiden name.
Whoa! Well, here we are.
Right.
Well, I sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,
- and if there's ever anything that I...
- Get on up!
Okay, then!
See you, Beans.
You heading out, Jim?
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.
Can't grow no crops without no water.
Bye, now!
What is it?
What was that for?
You're funny looking.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.
Here's your beans, Beans.
I'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts already. I can't give you more credit.
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrimack down at the bank. He cut off all credit.
Hey, Beans! Beans!
You know that there fella?
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!
Nope.
Hey, Beans!
Hey.
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.
I'd like a glass of water.
He wants a glass of water!
Make it a double!
Give him the spittoon!
Cactus juice. That's what we got.
Hey, there, fruit cup.
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?
Who exactly are you?
Who am I?
I could be anyone.
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?
As a matter of fact, I am.
But not as much as your daddy's cooking!
Exactly where did you say you were from?
Me? I'm from the West.
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.
The Far West.
Yeah, that's right, hombres.
The place I come from, we kill a man before breakfast just to work up an appetite.
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!
Hell, I seen things make a grown man lose control of his glandular functions!
You spend three days in a horse carcass, living off your own juices.
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.
Had a few extra aces in this deck, gents. Just the way I like it.
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
I am not from around these parts.
You might say I'm from everywhere there's trouble brewing and hell waiting to be raised.
You might say
I'm what hell's already raised up.
Name's
Rango.
Are you the fella that killed them Jenkins brothers?
Killed them with one bullet.
Don't get no deader.
All seven of them?
That's right.
All seven of them.
Exactly how you do that, Mr. Rango?
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.
And I will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!
Because this is where it gets complicated.
That'll close out your account,
Mrs. Oats, two gulps and a swig.
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left of your college education!
I don't rightly have no other choice, Beans.
Times being so hard, we just can't give no more credit.
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.
Beans, you've been like a niece to me ever since your daddy did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.
I've tried to protect you and others from certain realities.
But that... Well...
- Mr. Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.
Mr. Merrimack!
Are you all right?
Beans, I need to show you something.
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just ain't making deposits on a Wednesday no more!
Mr. Merrimack, if I don't get some water,
I'm gonna lose my ranch and you're telling me that's all that's left in the whole town?
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.
Someone is dumping water in the desert.
I seen it with my own eyes.
Water in the desert?
Was this during one of your special times?
No.
Well, we can all dream, but this is the reality.
Why do you think so many people are selling out? They just can't make it.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.
I hear he's been helping people out in this time of crisis.
The Mayor?
He may be our only hope.
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back towards number three, and that's when the roof caved in, igniting the thermos of pure grain alcohol instantly vaporizing his bodily form, leaving nothing but a charcoal statue and a high-pitched squeal.
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?
Number seven?
Hell, he died of infection.
- Seven men!
- One bullet!
Drinks all around!
Dance for me, Sod Buster!
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!
You got corn in your ears, mate?
You don't pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!
If I see your face in this town again,
I'm gonna slice it off and use it to wipe my unmentionables.
Mind the beak.
And don't come back!
What are you all gawping at?
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something I got to tell you!
What is this?
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!
Is that right?
Let me get that before you...
No. Oh, I know. Here.
Just take care of that for you.
There. All better.
T.O. T.O. Just a second.
All right, now listen!
I'm going to give you fellas one last chance to reconsider!
And if you don't want to reconsider
I might consider reconsidering myself.
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.
All right, now listen up!
Things are going to be different around here now that Rango's in town.
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning, my coffee hot, Danish on the side.
Whatever you do, don't look me in the eye.
Stay out of my peripheral vision!
- It's Rango.
- What's he up to?
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!
And when you see me coming, stand aside.
I take large steps and I don't want none of you hayseeds getting your bodily fluids on my boots!
Of course, there is no need for violence, as long as we stick together, work as a team.
So I want you all to come outside now and line up single file while I take a brief intermission!
What's he doing now?
I think it's a number two.
Never mind.
Take a look-see over here!
Well, look at him now!
He's chasing after that hawk!
Give him hell, Rango!
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!
What do you think, Doc?
This hawk is dead!
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.
He did it with one bullet!
Just like he said!
It's about time we had a hero around here.
One who ain't in a pine box.
I think it's time he met the Mayor.
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!
Let's hear it for Rango!
And so the stranger basks in the adulation of his new friends, sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception.
When is he going to die?
Soon, compadre. Soon.
My land is not for sale!
I came here to save my land, not sell it!
I'm sure there's something reasonable we can work out if you just talk to him!
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?
The Mayor will see you now.
Water, Mr. Rango, water.
Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.
But with water there's life.
Look at them, so desperate to live, they'll follow it anywhere.
That's the immutable law of the desert.
Control the water and you control everything.
But I don't have to tell you that being a true man of the West, as you are.
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rainwater from the Great Deluge.
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.
I guess power has its privileges.
You make a good point, son.
But with privilege comes responsibility.
Hell, I was mayor here before there was a Dirt!
And I may be just a sentimental old turtle but I think there's a future for this town.
And I hope you'll be part of it.
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbors?
It's a hard life here. Very hard.
Do you know how they make it through each and every day?
They believe.
They believe it's going to be better.
They believe that the water will come.
They believe against all odds and all evidence that tomorrow will be better than today.
People have to believe in something.
Right now, they believe in you.
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.
Your destiny awaits.
People have to believe in something.
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?
Yeah. But he might be a problem.
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.
It just don't make no sense.
This whole town is drying up, and the Mayor is the only one who don't seem to be affected.
Doesn't that make you just a wee bit suspicious?
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.
But if you really feel there's some conspiracy occurring,
I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff.
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!
That's good.
Oh, easy there, tiger.
- A little up and back?
- I don't think so.
Have you got French cuffs with that?
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.
Hey, Beans, what do you think of the new duds?
I got a 1 0-gallon hat marked down from 15.
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.
- Tart.
- Floozy.
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr. Rango.
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
I was just thinking that...
You want the old John Hancock, do you?
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.
There's a bullet in there.
I know about the shindig this afternoon.
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, I'd like to file a...
- Mr. Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.
- Here, let me just...
- I need you to investigate...
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up real nice, you put a little effort into it.
- What?
- Now, remember, son, stay in school, eat your veggies, burn everything but Shakespeare.
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango, if that is your real name.
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch, which is on the verge of an agricultural meltdown while you're playing patty-cake with this here trollop!
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.
Why does she do that?
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.
Well, that's an inconvenience.
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!
I did it again, didn't I?
Did what?
Let me ask you something.
Did anybody here mention what happened to our last sheriff?
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?
What exactly happened to the...
All day
I've faced the barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
With throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water
Cool
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Clear water
This is a heck of a hoedown you got going.
Still working out those steps.
So, is this considered normal civic behavior?
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.
You kill bird.
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.
Bird dead. Snake come.
Snake?
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr. Rango.
He never comes to town 'cause he's scared of that hawk.
But he might come now.
Can I have your boots when you're dead?
No!
And I ain't got no problem with this Rattlesnake Jake.
That's just what Amos said.
Amos?
You got any gold fillings?
My fellow Dirtonians.
I welcome you to our great day of deliverance. Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!
We have a newcomer amongst us today, my friends.
A man I think needs little introduction to you so bold has been his entry into our fair society.
Mr. Rango, would you step forward?
The time has come, my friends.
The time that was foretold!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
It is the time of hydration!
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!
I get his boots!
My friends, my friends!
Temper your frustrations.
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices will have to be made.
But if I can help in any way, please know that my door is always...
Hold it, hold it!
Now, this whole thing stinks three ways to Sunday.
First the bank's run dry and now this here spigot?
The bank's run dry?
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!
That was my rehydration account!
None of that civil disobedience in my town, thank you very much.
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.
Come right in.
Let me have a gander at the source of the societal discontentment here.
Mercy.
All right, listen up! I've been thinking and I believe I've figured something out.
You folks have a water problem!
Now just pay attention, everybody.
I'm trying to make a point here.
Let's say this fella here were to take a drink of water.
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?
And you!
You're just as dried up and parched as a jackrabbit in July.
So you belly on up and take you a double shot!
Stay with me.
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!
And before you know it, there wouldn't be any more water.
And then where would we be?
We'd be thirsty.
Real thirsty.
We'd turn on each other like a bunch of animals!
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.
We have got five days...
As long as we've got water, we've got ourselves a town.
Sheriff Rango is right.
As long as we have this water, we have some hope.
And you can all take it from me.
My 100% full-time employment from this moment on will be to protect our precious natural resource.
Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango.
Evening, ladies.
Evening, Sheriff.
And don't you come back!
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back in there and you assert yourself, and I think you'll find the people of this here town to be surprisingly hospitable.
Thank you, Sheriff.
What? Not you again!
I stand corrected.
- This ain't the bank.
- I told you, Jedidiah!
Hold it right there!
- Who's that?
- It's the Sheriff!
Get them hands up where I can see them!
Just as I suspected.
Prospecting without the authorized equipment. Don't move a muscle.
Prospecting?
Now, you got your shovel, pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah, assorted snacks, some puzzle books and you're gonna need a permit.
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?
I've had polyps removed smarter than the two of you!
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here, helping us out.
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds, keeping an eagle eye out for mayhem and malfeasance.
Does he look like he sounds?
Well, Sheriff, if we was to hit the mother lode, being prospectors and such, where would we deposit said annuity?
Here in the town of Dirt, we happen to have the finest financial institution this side of the Missouri.
Protected morning, noon and night by yours truly.
Much obliged.
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!
What's going on?
- It's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?
He said the bank's been robbed!
Dr. Marx! I'm on fire! Embrace me!
The bank's been robbed, the town is dry
"We'll die of thirst," the people cry
He promised to protect the vault
The water's gone, it's all his fault
All right, folks, stand back, clear the area.
This is a crime scene now.
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints, check for fibers, scan for DNA.
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.
And don't mix up the two.
What's this?
"Prospecting Permit."
I'll take that. Material evidence.
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!
My friends, we all know what we have to do now.
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.
Form a possum!
A posse.
Now, we're gonna be doing this in an orderly fashion.
First off, does anybody here know how to use a firearm of any kind?
All right, then.
What do we do now, Sheriff?
Now we ride!
Where are we going?
What?
Where are we going?
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge of all tracking and finding of villains, utilizing your well-developed
Injun-uity, no offense taken.
So which way do you think they went?
You want to sniff the air or commune with a buffalo or something?
Oh, you're good.
I'm depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobaccy in the beard there.
Always good to have a medical man along, Doc.
Reptiles got to stick together, right, my brother?
I'm an amphibian.
Ain't no shame in that.
You sure you're fit for duty there, soldier?
Well, you got a little something in your eye there.
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.
Well, I'm glad to hear it's not contagious.
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...
Never mind.
Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look after the town while I'm gone.
Can I gut-shoot someone?
Let's put a pin in that.
Sheriff, you're going to bring that water back, aren't you?
Count on it, little sister.
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.
Whole town's perforated with them.
She got more holes in her than a painted lady on a porcupine.
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.
Not what I expected.
How'd them fellers find the bank, anyway?
Gentlemen, if we can just stay on task here.
Sheriff! Over here!
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.
Amen, brother.
I remember when it used to flow every Wednesday.
Those were the halcyon days.
Must be a reason she quit on us.
Whatever the reason, something is controlling this here water.
What do you say, Sheriff?
Clearly, the robbers came from this direction.
I say we track this pipe back to its hydraulic origin and apprehend the culprits behind this aquatic conundrum.
- What'd he say?
- I think he said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.
Sure is humid down here.
Yeah, it's activating my piles.
I had a goitre removed once.
Looked like Tony Bennett stepping out of the shower.
Shoot, I put that on a tortilla.
Whatever you do, do not look down.
- What is this place?
- It's an aquifer.
What's an aquifer?
Well, it's for aqua.
Well, it's empty now.
That's a big one.
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.
Well, now that there is a pipe.
It's got to be connected to something.
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.
Your mama did.
I'll cook her right up.
You two just don't get it, do you?
Someone or something is messing with our hydration and that pipe has got something to do with it.
I thought we was following bank robbers!
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.
I'm gonna shift the features on your face if you don't shut up!
Go ahead and try!
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.
Sure enough.
Smart thinking there, feller.
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!
Not bad, huh, Beans?
You keep thinking like that, your hat's gonna catch on fire.
Well, you know, you get on a roll, you just...
Hot, hot! Burn.
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.
- Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?
- I saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!
Give me that!
It's empty anyway.
I knew that.
Where'd you find that?
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!
It's Mr. Merrimack from the bank.
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.
Looks like them varmints shot him in the back.
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?
What a way to go.
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.
I suppose we should bury him.
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.
Circle of life!
Sheriff.
Will you say a few words?
Yeah. Yeah.
Dearly beloved.
We are gathered here today to honor this man.
Mr. Merrimack, you have the right to remain silent.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?
I see you're consulting with the spirits.
No, I'm moulting.
Means I'm ready to mate.
I'll keep that in mind.
Cactus fruit.
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.
I believe your people use it as seasoning when preparing your native dishes.
Also natural laxative.
Pick up trail.
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?
Someone's got a bad valve.
All right, which one of you fellers needs a check-up?
Awkward.
What exactly are we going to do now?
Now we ride!
That means we're riding now!
This moment.
Marshmallows remind me of going camping with my daddy.
I could eat them all night long.
Of course he did make me cough them back up again for breakfast.
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.
They started looking at me weird.
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.
I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter once.
You might want to get that looked at.
Pass the beans, Beans.
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.
Mr. Rango? Can you tell us about the Spirit of the West?
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- Is it true what they say?
Yes, the Spirit of the West!
The eternally unattainable ideal.
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.
But he only appears to those who have undertaken an epic quest!
And have made it to the other side.
The other side of what?
It's a metaphor.
My eye!
That's gonna heal right up.
Sheriff? What are you going to do about Rattlesnake Jake?
What? Where?
Sorry about that. Word is you come against him once or twice.
Yeah.
Jake. You mean my brother.
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.
Well, Momma had an active social life.
Did he ever bite you?
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.
Put some in my coffee just to give it a little tang.
Is it true he's only scared of them hawks?
Them's what we call his natural predator.
All this talk of that serpentine devil is putting my quills on edge!
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water and return to a hero's welcome.
Friends, before we bunk down
I'd like us all to join hands for a moment, say a few words to the Spirit of the West.
That's a good idea.
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.
But tonight I want to thank you for bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.
It's a hard life we got.
Sometimes I don't know how we're gonna make it.
But somehow, Sheriff Rango makes me think we will.
We needed a brave man and you sent us one.
Nice to have someone to believe in again.
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Just checking.
- It's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.
You ever feel like those things are looking at you?
That's a Spanish dagger.
But around here, we just call them the Walking Cactus.
Walking?
There's an old legend they actually walk across the desert to find water.
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late watching them, to see if they'd move.
I thought if I could follow them, they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.
Someplace with enough water for everyone.
Night after night, I watched them.
I never saw them move.
But you're still watching.
Who doesn't want to find someplace wonderful?
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.
That's such a lonely sound.
You ever get lonely?
Sometimes.
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer and everyone likes you so much.
- I never made friends easy like that.
- No?
No, we're pretty isolated out there on the ranch, sort of like being sealed up in a little box.
Don't really see a lot of folks.
I wouldn't know what that's like.
There someone special in your life, Rango?
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.
Besides, my life's too dangerous for that kind of thing.
You know, it's an awful solitary existence out there on the prairie.
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.
Beans?
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna whup you like a red-headed stepchild!
Choleric varmints, ain't they?
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.
What's that coming?
It's the water.
I have a plan, and each and every one of you has a part to play.
What do I do?
Spoons, you got the most important job of all.
You stay up here on the ridge, and if anything goes wrong, you give the signal.
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.
Well, actually...
Why can't you be all brainy like your brother?
Pappy, about that water.
There's something I gots to tell you.
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon to thee and thee and thee.
May I present Madame Lupone's
Terpsichorean Troupe of Traveling Thespians!
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians.
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!
The stage is set. The princess prepares to take her own life.
I yearn for love.
Meanwhile, the lone sentry stands watch at the castle gate.
Stands watch at the castle gate...
Hark! Who goes there?
This plot is highly predictable.
Quiet! This is my favorite part.
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father, strucketh by Cupid.
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter and reach for the...
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"
What was that?
Must be that immersive theater.
We got you surrounded!
You and your entire family get your hands up where I can see them.
My entire family?
Grits and spit and collard greens
Waffle chitlins, monkey brains
Refried bones and booger blood
Pickled eggs and flaps of mud
It's a full house.
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves a good old-fashioned standoff.
I'll have you know, you're not looking at our entire contingent.
What's that supposed to be?
That's the signal.
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!
So something's supposed to happen?
I am open to suggestions.
Run!
Get on the wagon!
Should we have ourselves some sport, chill'ens?
I likes it when they run.
Maybelle, give the holler!
Looks like we made it!
That audience was quite responsive.
Yeah, well, I think that chromosome pool is about dried up.
We got bats!
Here! You drive.
Looks like there's gonna be soup tonight!
Come on, let's get some!
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!
Jedidiah! It's time for the Alabama squeeze box!
Okay, Pa!
I am sensing hostility.
Incoming!
Hello!
Goodbye!
Lasso that swine!
I suggest we take evasive action!
I suggest you shut up and shoot!
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!
What was that? Go check it out!
What is it? Is there a problem?
You could call it that.
Headache.
Is that all you got?
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!
Eat lead!
Here, hold these.
Get your hands off me!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jump!
It's impossible.
It can't be. It's empty.
There's no water!
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated the very sustenance of our livelihood!
I think that there fella in the purty dress is the Sheriff.
That's the same fellow what give us a prospecting permit?
- A what?
- Irrelevant! Obfuscation.
You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery and the murder of our beloved financial advisor
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.
We done tunneled into that vault, but there weren't nothing in it.
Somebody done robbed that bank before we robbed it.
Then where'd you get this here jug?
That's what I been trying to tell you, Pappy.
I found it in the desert.
Then why in tarnation did you bring it here?
Hold on! You're saying this here jug was empty when you found it?
That's right.
I don't believe a word of it.
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!
Who'd dump water in the desert?
Wouldn't be the first time.
It's a puzzle!
It's like a big old mammogram!
What's going on, Sheriff?
I don't know.
But I'm going to strip away this mystery and expose its private parts.
You and your kin are coming with me.
They're coming!
Here they come!
Looks like they got them robbers.
Where's the water?
There weren't no water.
Where is he going?
He's going to see the Mayor.
He's got to be pleased with that.
That's a good one, boss!
That's interesting.
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr. Rango, but there's a certain protocol to this game, you understand.
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.
Well, that's good, 'cause you got a few questions to answer and I've got my own protocol.
But why would anyone dump water in the blooming desert?
It does seem a bit naive, taking the word of admitted bank robbers.
Besides, once they hang, your job is done.
- Bravo!
- Job well done.
But what if somebody did rob the bank before they got there?
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
I was hoping you could tell me.
That sounds marginally near to an accusation.
Take it any way you like.
Something you said keeps rattling around in my frontal lobe.
What's that?
"Control the water and you control everything."
Come now, Mr. Rango.
You attribute divine power to me.
How on earth could I possibly control the water?
You've obviously mastered this game.
Well, I've been playing it for many years, sir.
I was here before the highway split this great valley.
I watched the march of progress, and I learned a thing or two.
Perhaps it's time you started to take the long view, begin to appreciate the broad sweep of history.
Look out there, son.
You can almost see time passing.
What are you building out here?
The future, Mr. Rango, the future.
One day soon, all this is going to fade into myth, the frontier town, the lawman, the gunslinger.
There's just no place for them any more.
- We're civilized now.
- That's right, civilized.
That's what the future holds.
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.
Is that what happened to
Mr. Merrimack? Did he get left behind?
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to forget you're just one little lizard.
You seem to forget
I'm the law around these parts.
Our new sheriff has been playing the hero for so long, he's actually starting to believe it.
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.
He never leaves without taking a blooming soul.
Do it!
Now be still. You gotta look presentable to meet your maker.
Death has arrived
How will the hero survive?
The Mayor has bought up all the land in the valley, except for your ranch, Miss Beans.
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.
Unless he controls the water.
Like a monkey's bladder!
Then he could bring it back once he's bought up all the land.
But how does he control the water?
Well, you gotta spend some time and train them.
'Cause you know monkeys, when they do go, you rub their nose in it.
Sheriff, we got a problem.
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.
Get them out here so we can cut off their giblets!
You, too, Spoons?
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.
But this is all his fault!
You said you's gonna bring the water back.
It's just, we got no hope without that water.
We got nothing left to believe in.
You see that sign up there?
As long as that sign says "Sheriff," you can believe that there's law and order in this town.
But without law and order, ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.
Starts out slow, like a fungus.
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.
Neighbor turns on neighbor.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!
And then dogs and cats are getting together to create all sorts of unnatural mutant aberrations!
So, you want something to believe in, Spoons?
Believe in me.
Believe in that there sign.
For as long as it hangs there, we got hope.
Hello, brother.
Thirsty?
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?
Well, you know...
I hear you been telling about how you killed all them Jenkins brothers.
With one bullet, wasn't it?
Isn't that right?
All these good folks here believe your little stories, don't they?
Why, they believe you're just a stone killer, don't they?
Seems these folks trust you.
They think you're gonna save their little town.
They think you're gonna save their little souls!
But we know better, don't we?
So why don't you show your friends here what you're made of?
Show them who you really are.
Why don't you just pull your gun and shoot me?
But, of course, you won't need all these.
Just one, right?
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.
You got killer in your eyes, son?
I don't see it.
You didn't do any of them things you said, did you?
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!
Are you?
- Say it!
- No.
Speak up.
I don't think your friends here heard you.
No.
All you've done is lie to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a fake and a coward. Isn't that right?
Yes.
- Louder!
- Yes.
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.
This is my town now.
If I ever see you again, I will take your soul straight down to hell!
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm nobody.
Golden guardians.
The alabaster carriage.
The Spirit of the West.
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to dig deep to find what you're looking for.
So you made it.
Is this heaven?
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.
Yeah.
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?
Searching, same as you.
I don't even know what I'm looking for any more.
I don't even know who I am.
They used to call you the Man with No Name.
These days they got a name for just about everything.
Doesn't matter what they call you.
It's the deeds make the man.
Yeah, but my deeds just made things worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phony!
My friends believed in me, but they need some kind of hero.
Then be a hero.
No. No, no, you don't understand.
I'm not even supposed to be here.
That's right. You came a long way to find something that isn't out here.
Don't you see? It's not about you.
It's about them.
But I can't go back.
Don't know that you got a choice, son.
No man can walk out on his own story.
So you made it.
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.
Did you just see that?
We each see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
It is.
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.
Many years ago, this entire valley was covered in agua.
Now only one question remains.
Where did it go?
They follow the water.
They follow the water! Come on!
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.
What are you building out here?
The future, Mr. Rango.
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.
I was here before the highway split this great valley.
I watched the march of progress and I learned a thing or two.
Control the water and you control everything.
Come now, Mr. Rango.
You attribute divine power to me.
How on earth could I possibly control the water?
What now, amigo?
No man can walk out on his own story.
I'm going back.
But why?
Because that's who I am.
You got a lot of nerve showing up here, lawman. What is it you want?
Your pappy and them boys are about to hang for something they didn't do.
But I've got a plan.
I appreciate how difficult this is for you, Beans.
But you're making a practical decision.
Decisions, decisions.
There's no need for any more suffering.
Your family's ranch is nothing but a wasteland now.
Sign the deed and relieve yourself of your father's burden.
My daddy was not a burden!
Keep your blood money and I'll keep my land!
Do what he says or, by all the fires of the black pit,
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes out of your skull!
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...
Let me do my job! You brought me in.
Now we're gonna play this thing out to the end!
Sign the damn paper, woman!
Go to hell!
Where do you think I come from?
Look into my eyes.
I want to see you die.
Jake!
I'm calling you out!
Jake!
This day just got a little more interesting.
Put her down.
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?
That's just about the size of it.
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!
All right, Sheriff, make your move.
Now amigos!
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!
That was a bad idea.
Thirsty, brother?
Here it comes!
No. No!
It's a miracle!
Look out!
- Lookee there!
- What is that?
It's our salvation, Pa!
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you, your guts'll be leaking lead!
Well, then it's a good thing I brought some backup.
What?
Ain't no hawk.
Ain't nothing but bats!
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!
It only takes one bullet.
You ain't got the nerve.
Try me.
Oh, Mr. Rango.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.
Now, Mr. Rango.
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.
Help!
Open the door!
Okay, plan B.
Beans, you're mumbling.
All my problems taken care of except for one.
It's a new West, Jake.
There's no room for gunslingers any more. We're businessmen now.
Yeah, we got new hats.
Where I come from, we call this improvisation.
You came back.
What was that?
No need to panic, but I think you just swallowed plan B.
What?
Okay, panic time.
You and the Sheriff are more alike than you think.
You're nothing but legends.
Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed.
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.
How fitting.
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together, we can reach a mutually beneficial solution to our current situation.
You better take it up with him.
One bullet.
I tip my hat to you, one legend to another.
What was that you said?
"Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed."
No, Jake! No!
Rango!
You brought the water back, just like you promised.
You really are a hero.
Well, the thing about heroes is, whenever you...
Don't spoil it.
Right.
Well, I don't know about you all, but I could sure go for a dip.
And so the lizard completes his journey from humble beginnings to the legend we sing of today.
And although he is certain to die, perhaps from a household accident, which account for 65% of all unnatural deaths, the people of the village will honor his memory even as they abandon their dignity.
- I'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?
Water ain't money. Money is money.
- Well, I ain't got no...
- We're talking hard cash.
We have a problem.
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?
I really think you complete me.
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can you keep missing your mark?
What's my motivation?
Oh, you kids.
What did you do that for?
I was just checking.
I hear if you get too sunburnt, you can peel a man's face right off.
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.
Don't touch it.
That's the second time that's happened to me.
This water thing's great.
I'm urinating right now.
Adult swim, next five minutes.
Stay between the buoys.
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there and I picked the raisins out just the way you like it.
Don't forget, your nasal spray is in your saddle-bag...
- Beans!
- ...and your moisturizing lotion...
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.
Sheriff, where are you headed?
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.
Now, honey, you come back with all your digits.
And don't go trying to be a hero.
Beans, you are missing the point.
I got an image to protect now.
Where's my Tic Tacs?
- I found them.
- What's going on?
Well, in order to satisfy the needs of the collective, the hero must abandon the self and solidify his image as an icon that will forever be remembered.
So, this is the sunset shot.
Give them a good one, amigo.
Ready, Excelsior?
My fellow comrades.
There will be times when you doubt yourself.
When you feel pummeled by the cataclysms of life, remember this moment.
Remember me.
Know that I will be there watching you, sometimes at inappropriate moments.
That's part of the deal.
And remember, within all of us resides the true Spirit of the...
Let's take it from the top.
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back here at home there's nothing to do
Hey, Yeah, yeah
Now that I'm away
I wish I'd stayed
Tomorrow's a day of mine that you want be in
Oh, oh, ah
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Okay. All right, one, two, three...
Guys! One...
Hold on. Guys, freeze!
Aw!
- Where's Alvin?
- Hey, Dave.
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?
Trying to board the ship.
Already done that.
Also, checked out our room, dibbed the side of the bed closest to the window, ordered us a round of virgin piña coladas and signed us up for parasailing.
Alvin, you're too young for parasailing.
I thought we were going on vacation to have fun.
Don't worry, family vacations are all about fun.
But first we're gonna need to set some rules.
Let's start with you can't call dibs on a bed until everyone's in the room.
- Good rule.
- That's right.
That's a good one, Simon.
All right, so that's our first rule.
Should we go over the rest of them?
Dave, come on. "Rules" is my middle name.
No attorneys to plead my case
Illa racket ships to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
- Hey, Dave.
- Alvin!
- Ha ha! Whoo!
- Whoa. Ahhh! Ahhh! Ow!
This is your captain speaking.
All kids are now allowed to play an the adults-only Serenity Deck.
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
You think you're right, but you were wrong
You tried to take me, baby
But you knew all along
You can't take me for a ride
I'm not a fool now
So you better run and hide
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
Alvin!
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble, y'all
I got trouble in my town
Yo! I'm the T to the R to the O-U-bull
Rock it non-stop till the mic gets dull
Take what! want when I want, no holding back
When I kick a ﬂow
I'm all up an the track
A to the L to the V-I-N
When I'm in town, me and all of my friends
Gonna come through like a hurricane
Tearing down everything in my way
Alvin!
- We talked about setting rules, Alvin.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't know the agreement meant no fun.
You're allowed to have fun.
When are you going to stop acting like a child?
When are you going to stop treating me like a child?
I'll stop treating you like a child when you start acting like a grown-up!
I'll start acting like a grown-up when you start...
I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tailback and forth
I whip my tail back and forth
I whip my tail back and forth
- Hey, girls, not now, please, okay?
- Aw.
- Lame!
- Sorry, Dave.
I need to get ready for dinner with the captain.
We're having dinner with the captain?
No, I am. You're staying here.
I have to go apologize for everything Alvin did.
This is so not fair.
Not to us, not to Dave, and certainly not to the captain, who I'm sure was really looking forward to dining with me.
Why don't I go speak with Dave?
See if I can smooth things over.
Knock-knock.
- What is it, Simon?
- Well, I would never say this to Alvin.
Goodness knows he can be totally irresponsible, but I actually have a suggestion.
You have a suggestion for me?
He's been driving me crazy a lot longer than he's been driving you crazy.
All right. So what is it?
Imagine Alvin is a spirited racehorse.
That's your advice?
No. I'm not done yet, Dave.
All right, so Alvin is a racehorse...
And you, Dave, are his incredibly helpful jockey who's there to guide him down the racetrack of life.
But if you hold the reins too tight, that racehorse is going to fight and buck, which is no fun for anyone.
But if you loosen the reins just a little...
He'll fly right off the track and crash into the fence.
I know you want to protect Alvin, but, Dave, sometimes kids will rise to the occasion if you just show them a little trust.
All right, guys, room service is on its way.
Lights out by 9:00.
Dave, question.
If we're going to be held captive in this room...
Because of Alvin!
Can we at least watch a movie?
All right, let's see what's on.
You know what, why don't you guys pick a movie?
You're old enough to make your own decision.
For real, Dave?
Absolutely.
- Ooh! Dave looks so elegant.
- Have fun!
Wait, Dave, before you go,
I made something for you.
Wow, it's really... it's soft so you can sleep in it and I made it with all the colors, so it will go with everything!
Great. I'll put it on after dinner.
You could put it on now, so everyone at the captain's table could see it.
Nice.
A real chick magnet.
All right, guys, have fun.
But not too much fun, because I'm still very upset.
Goodbye, Dave.
And, hello, ladies!
I like my tail shaken, not stirred.
- Where are you going?
- To the casino. I'm feeling lucky.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Dave said...
Dave said, and I quote,
"We're old enough to make our own decisions."
He meant we were old enough to choose a film!
Well, we're clearly not.
Check out what Theodore just picked.
What's wrong with this movie?
It's for babies!
Which is probably why
Dave treats us like babies.
Munk up, Theodore.
There. That's more like it.
Alvin, please!
I say we go to Salsa Night!
In our pajamas?
Oh, I know!
Party rack is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We/ust wanna see ya shake that
Alvin!
Alvin! Alvin!
And we have a winner.
Ellie, I love these dresses!
You're so crafty.
Thanks. it's what I do.
- Ow!
- Oh! sorry!
Ew! What are you?
We are the Chipettes.
- Hi, I'm Eleanor!
My sister was just trying to apologize.
What's she sorry for?
Stepping on my friend's foot?
Or her busted, tired little dance moves?
Oh, no, you didn't!
Oh, yes, she did!
You better get those Lee Press-Ons out of my face unless you want to meet my claws.
And, yeah, baby, they're real.
- Do you wanna go?
- Hit it!
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
Oh, whoa!
Ugh!
Let the music move your feet
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come an!
Captain, I'm really sorry about what happened.
Alvin, he's a kid.
He's just trying to have some fun.
There's nothing wrong with fun.
Our pelican makes sure that everybody on the ship has fun.
In fact, in port, he circles the ship on a hang glider.
It's really quite amusing.
However, my number one priority is the passengers' safety.
Sol simply cannot have Alvin put himself, or anyone else, at risk again.
Believe me, I understand.
If Alvin breaks any more of our rules, there will be consequences.
The last thing we want is anyone getting hurt.
Excuse me.
- Hot!
- Sorry.
Hot!
Unbelievable. Gravy pants.
Hey, he?!
- Do you have a problem with me?
- You bet I have a problem with you.
- Why?
- As if you didn't know.
I don't know.
Ian? What are you doing here?
I'm working, Dave.
This is your job?
Yeah, not too many record labels are interested in hiring the guy who blew it with the Chipmunks, blew it with the Chipettes and passed on Justin Bieber.
Twice.
Look, Ian, I'm sorry you lost your job and your dignity.
But spilling things, hot things, on me isn't going to bring any of that stuff back.
You're right, Dave.
It's too late for me to get my old life back.
But it's not too late to ruin yours.
You want to ruin my life?
Why don't we just start with this vacation?
If I see those chipmunks break so much as one rule,
I'm going straight to Captain Correlli.
You're in my house now!
Although, technically it's not a house, it's a ship.
The point is, I'll be watching you.
Like a hawk!
- Theodore?
- Please don't eat my brain!
Why are you watching Jungle Monster 4.7
Alvin, how could you...
Alvin?
Simon?
Girls?
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- I'll be right back!
- it's dark.
You're up for an International Music Award.
That's fantastic!
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I guess. If you like a lot of adulation.
We fly there right after the cruise.
Hoping to take home Record of the Year.
That would make you the youngest winner ever.
I'm not that young.
I mean, I'm hanging out in a casino way past my bedtime.
Not that I have a bedtime!
No one tells me what to do.
Alvin!
Who's Alan, I wonder?
Anyway
I'd love to chat more, but I've gotta run.
You're in a lot of trouble, young man!
You can follow me on Critter!
Alvin! Alvin!
Simon?
I wasn't betting. Honest.
Your winnings, sir.
Oh, busted!
I didn't sneak out. I mean, I did.
But only to stop Alvin.
- Right.
- There they are, Captain.
Captain.
What's he going to do, make us walk the plank?
There's a plank?
No, there's no plank, but if you guys disobey me one more time, you will be off the ship.
And you'll miss the International
Music Awards. Do you understand?
- Yes, Dave.
- Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
What if we need to disobey you?
And why would you need to do that?
Well, let's say that you tell me to stay put.
"Alvin, if you move from that chair, you're grounded!"
But then I happen to see pirates climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy, from the side of the ship.
Now, it would be easy for me to take my trusty old Swiss Army knife and cut the ropes.
But I have to stay put. Or do I?
Yes, Alvin, you do.
And what are you doing with a pocket knife?
What pocket knife are you referring to?
Come on, give it to me.
You could cut yourself.
So, I could have saved the whole ship from robbage and pilgering and you'd still ground me?
Alvin, there's no such word as robbage.
And it's "pillaging."
But he does have a point, Dave.
There's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our own hands.
I trusted you tonight and look where that got me!
That's probably just the hot gravy talking.
You're all lucky Captain Correlli has allowed you one more activity.
Is it hang gliding, wakeboarding or bungee jumping?
No. Shuffleboard.
Man!
By my calculations, it appears to be 10% shuffle, 90% bored.
That's funny!
Oh, thanks. You really think so?
You know, Dave, I think
I'd prefer the plank.
Sorry, Alvin, but this is what you get to do.
And I get to do something
I haven't done in a long time.
Absolutely nothing.
Brittany approaches her puck, adjusts her stance, looks over at me, quite annoyed, wonders to herself if I'm ever going to shut my mouth, realizes I'm not, and makes her move.
And... Oh!
Oh, it's short!
A costly error, ladies and gentlemen, that's going to haunt her the rest of her career.
You can make all the jokes you want, Alvin, but not even you can make this interesting.
Oh, really? Well, care to make it interesting that I can make this interesting?
Alvin, what are you up to?
Need I remind you Dave is watching us.
Simon, the poor guy hasn't had a moment's peace since he met us.
He's exhausted.
Check this out. In three, two, one.
Lights out.
- Nap time!
Time to turn punishment into funishment.
You get it?
I took the "pun" in punishment, and turned it into "fun," but kept the "ishment." it's word play!
- Uh-huh.
- What?
Hey, kid!
Wanna make a trade?
That's a nice-looking kite.
Yeah!
I can see Russia from here!
Come on, Simon, grab on.
Forget it. All I ever do is try to save him and it only gets me in trouble!
This won't end well.
Simon, do something!
Oh, seriously?
Simon, help!
Alvin's gotten himself in a bind.
Looks like it's Simon saving him again!
Whoa!
Thanks, bro.
- Huh?
- Thank you!
Hack-a-bye, Davey
On the lounge chair
If you awake, you'll pull out your hair
Whoa! Hey!
- Dave! Dave!
- Ow!
- Dave!
- Help us!
Guys! Guys!
No! No! No, no, no! No! No!
Dave! Help us!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You want to go hang gliding, sign up at the Excursion Desk like everyone else.
- Ian, you don't understand!
- Oh, I think I do.
Dave Seville is so special that the rules don't apply to him.
- Let go!
- No, you let go.
Hey! Come on! Great!
Oh, my God!
I need my pelican head!
Help!
- Ian!
- You idiot!
Oh, no. No, no.
Great. Way to go, Seville.
- Me?
- You!
Hey!
Save your breath, Dave.
They'll come back for me.
In retrospect, this was a bad idea.
We're losing altitude!
I don't think I can make it much longer.
I'm so hungry. Just one bite.
No.
- A nibble?
- No nibbles.
Maybe I can just lick the glaze?
The glaze is what's keeping you alive, Theodore!
Its high fat content is creating a waterproof barrier.
I'm gonna starve to death!
Actually, there are many other things that will kill you before starvation.
Dehydration, sunstroke...
An island.
No, an island would probably be helpful.
So if you see one, you should definitely say something.
Uh, Jeanette?
Oh!
We're alive! We're alive!
Good. Because now
I'm going to kill you!
Guys, guys, guys!
Nobody is killing anyone, okay?
No matter how much he deserves it.
Thank you, Si. Though I could have done without the passive aggression.
Look, we've got nothing to worry about.
Dave knows we're gone by now.
He probably has the whole coast guard looking for us.
Meantime, why don't we all just relax and have some donut?
Did you guys want some?
Theodore! Alvin! Simon!
Can't you kick any faster?
It's been two hours, Dave.
Thanks to biannual Pilates classes,
I have legs that won't quit, but they do slow down.
Take those feet off, let me kick.
No quality mascot suit has removable feet.
Take the suit off, then.
- I can't.
- Why not?
I'm not wearing anything underneath.
Look!
No, no, it's okay, I believe you.
No, look!
Look, an island!
Maybe the chipmunks washed up there.
Kick!
Faster! Come on.
Okay, there we go.
It won't belong before a rescue plane sees our SOS and flies us back to civilization.
I don't hear any planes.
Or helicopters.
Maybe Dave is coming in a hot-air balloon.
Because those things are really quiet.
I don't think Dave is gonna be in a hot-air balloon.
But he is coming, right?
Of course he is.
Just maybe not today.
Alvin's right.
We should prepare to stay the night.
What? You guys expect me to sleep outside?
Last I checked, Brit, we're chipmunks.
We're used to living in the wild.
No, we used to be used to living in the wild.
Come on, Brit, it's just one night.
One cold night.
So we'll make a fire. We're always setting things on fire accidentally.
How hard can it be when we put our minds to it?
And how are you intending to do that?
I will create a spark by striking this rock with my Swiss Army knife, which Dave took from me.
I suppose you have a better idea, smart guy?
As a matter of fact, I do, smart guy.
As you can see, the lens concentrates the energy of the sun, thus creating fire!
Whoa. Impressive.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks for thinking that.
Hot, hot, hot!
We have made fire!
So, what do we do now?
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya
Oh, lord, Kumbaya
Alvin! Brittany!
We've gotta head inland.
If we climb to the top of that mountain, we'll be able to get a better view of the island, see if they're here.
All right, got it.
What are you doing?
- Building a fire.
- What?
You know, one time in the studio,
Snoop ran out of matches, got a blaze going with just two carrot sticks.
Figure, how hard can it be?
Forget the fire. We have to start hiking.
Yeah, okay, Dave.
Look, it's getting dark-ish.
It's gonna be cold. I'm gonna build a fire.
We'll go in the morning.
- No, we'll go now.
Don't take that tone of voice with me, Dave.
I'm not one of your chipmunks that you can just boss around and stuff into a cage whenever you feel like it.
That was you, Ian!
Calm down.
Jeez, no wonder those furballs would rather fly off the ship than spend another day with you.
They didn't do it on purpose.
It was an accident. They're just kids.
I don't know how long they can survive out there.
And you guys were worried.
 Look at us!
We're warm, we got a great fire going, beautiful night sky and if a rescue helicopter comes by, they'll see us!
Everything's gonna be fine.
Good night, guys.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Night.
Theodore!
What? Dave always turns off the light after saying good night.
That fire was sort of the only thing keeping us from freezing to death.
- Yeah!
- Can't you just relight it?
- How?
- With your glasses. And the sun?
Oh.
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
All right!
Way to keep the spirits up, guys.
Doing it, yeah!
- And what is this supposed to be?
- Breakfast!
No, it's bark.
Yeah, for breakfast!
I bet it's very good. it's not.
It's been forever since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.
Crazy suggestion, guys.
Let's get off this beach and let's find some real food.
If I know my horticulture, and I do, this is a grove of mango trees.
Then where are all the mangoes?
Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!
You were planning on sharing that, right?
Of course.
Oh, well, good.
'Cause it kind of looked like you were gonna eat it all by yourself.
What? I would never do that.
I don't believe you!
Hey!
Yeah! Winning!
What?
Well, I'm just out of school
A sting real, real coal
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message that
I've gotta be a wild one
I'll make sure to save you the pit!
Oh, my acorns!
Way to go, Theodore!
Come on, we'll split it.
Don't listen to him, Theo.
He's gonna eat it all by himself.
I'll share it with you.
No. She's trying to trick you.
No, you're trying to trick him.
No, you're trying to trick him by saying I'm trying to trick him.
He's lying, Theo!
- What?
Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have ourselves a ball
Gonna tell all my friends
Gonna tell 'em all that I'm a wild one
Oh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Theodore, I am so sorry!
Gonna keep 'em moving wild
Gotta keep a-s winging, baby
I'm a real wild child
Oh, no!
My precious! My precious!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look at us.
One day on this island and we've become animals!
Did you hear that?
What was that?
- Jungle Monster.
Positions, everybody.
Hold.
Hold.
Fire!
No! Why?
Please don't eat us, Mr. Jungle Monster!
I'm not a monster, I'm Zoe.
And I'm clearly a girl who has been on this island for so long that now she's imagining that squirrels can talk.
We are chipmunks.
Yeah, Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Who and the what now?
I'm sure you've heard of the Chipettes.
We're kind of world famous.
Who?
Maybe this will help.
Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Caught in a bad romance
- Okay. Stop.
- Lame!
I don't know who you are.
Awkward!
Exactly how long have you been here?
Well, I got here on a Monday, so...
Yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?
Nine years? Wait.
You've been here nine years?
Well, it could be eight.
What if we're here nine years?
What if we're here forever?
I told you, Dave's coming.
I used to think that Dave was coming, too.
And he never did.
Huh?
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.
I used to fly cargo planes for them, until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.
- We crash-landed, too.
- Really?
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.
Right, Alvin?
Absolutely.
You mean I'm finally gonna get out of here?
I can't wait to go tell the others!
There are others?
I mean, can you guys imagine being stuck here for all these years without anybody to talk to?
I think I'd lose my mind!
Chipmunks,
I'm pleased to introduce my friends.
This is Rawlings, Spalding, Callaway,
Dunlop, and, right there, that's Nerf.
Hey, girlfriend, you look good.
They survived the crash with me.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Okay.
I'm Theodore.
Guys, Dave is coming to get us!
No, not Dave Henderson. I saw your face!
It's another Dave.
But, you guys, just get excited.
We're finally gonna get off this island.
She's funny.
In a crazy sort of way.
This totally calls for a party.
Who's hungry?
- Yeah!
- Yes, please!
- I'm hungry.
- We are famished.
Yeah? Let's go to my place.
Is it far?
I don't think I could walk another step.
Who said anything about walking?
We're gonna die!
Oh, man! That was so cool!
I know, I know!
Come on. Come on in, guys! Bring it in.
Come on down!
Yeah! Wasn't that awesome?
No, it was not awesome.
It's a miracle we got here safely.
In fact, the odds of a chipmunk getting hurt on a zip-line are one out of six.
Why do I always have to be right?
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ellie, Ellie! Are you okay?
I think I sprained my ankle!
Ooh, you know what, you should put some ice on that.
Oh, no, guys, I don't have any ice.
I live there in that tree.
I thought that maybe you did, though.
No, we don't have any ice.
Just like we don't have any shelter.
Wow, that's a major bummer for you.
- Do you guys like bungee jumping?
- Yes!
No. We do not.
Listen, lady, maybe you should just leave us alone so we can focus more on surviving and less on killing ourselves.
Whoa, that is a lot of uptight in a very little package.
I'm not uptight. I just don't wanna see anyone else getting hurt. Ow!
Criminy. What was that?
You know what, that was just a spider and they live here because this is nature.
It is not just a spider, it's a Phoneutria bahiensis.
Its bite contains a neurotoxin.
Ooh! Mr. Fancy Words. So what?
Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?
Oh. That's not good.
Side effects include changes in personality, loss of inhibition, dry mouth.
Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably twice a day by these little fellows and I am still completely normal.
Yes, normal.
Oh, no.
Alvin? Simon!
Chubby one!
Girl chubby one!
Brittany? Jeanette?
I hope they're okay.
Who cares if they're okay?
I just need them to be here.
And here I am thinking you've changed and don't only care about yourself.
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.
Because right now the rage I'm feeling for you and those chipmunks is the only thing keeping me going.
Shall we keep going?
Ian, just keep an eye out for something to eat or drink, all right?
All right. Right there!
- Where?
- That thing around your neck.
You're not gonna eat this.
This was a gift from Theodore.
That explains it.
I was gonna say, it's really ugly.
Like, really... Wow.
- Ugly.
- It's not ugly.
It goes with everything and it's soft enough to sleep in.
Yeah, and it's edible.
You will not eat my son's necklace.
He's not your son, Dave.
He's just a chipmunk.
Oh, Dave. Where are you?
Where are you, Alvin?
All right.
I'm gonna crash.
Simon. Where are you going?
Who is this Simon you speak of?
Um. you?
No, my name is not Simon. It is
Simone!
That's pretty close to Simon.
And yet completely different.
Would you care to join me on my adventure?
What adventure?
The adventure called life!
Okay.
But just until Dave shows up.
Alvin, Alvin!
Simon and Theodore are gone.
They probably just went to get stuff for the shelter.
It's all the guy can talk about.
Still, it's not like them to wander off like that.
Could you please go look for them?
Why can't you?
I have a situation of my own to deal with, Alvin.
Oh, right. How is Eleanor doing?
Huh? She's fine. I'm talking about me.
It's been two days since my last bath and I am a mess.
I can't get rescued looking like this.
Oy.
Theo! Simon! Simon!
Theodore! Theo!
Si! Theo!
Bonjour, my friend
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?
- His name is not Simon.
- It is Simone.
That's pretty close to Simon.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he's acting totally different.
The spider bite! That's it!
Remember the side effects?
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?
Lies! Who are you?
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.
Au revoir, Alfred.
Alvin. it's Alvin!
Whoo! C'est magnifique, Simone!
Okay, Theo, it's all you.
Really? I've never done anything like this.
And you never will.
How can you let him do this?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking, "When did my dad wash up on this island?"
- What?
- We were having the best time.
Why do you have to show up and be so uptight?
Me? Uptight?
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!
The cool one. Ask anybody.
- Who should I ask?
Come on.
Theodore, you can't bungee jump.
You get scared just watching a movie.
Munk up, Alvin.
A little help?
Ah! Much better.
Jeanette, these dresses are, like, totally adorbs. I die.
Thank you.
And I also made these for you, Eleanor.
Oh, look how handy you are all of a sudden.
And in case you get tired,
I made you a wheelchair.
Oh, super.
J'arrive.
Enchanté, mademoiselles. A kiss.
A kiss. And a...
A kiss.
- What's gotten into him?
- Spider venom.
Yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some sort of fun-loving French dude.
- Really?
- Now he thinks he's...
The most interesting munk in the world.
Simon? Simon.
- Simone?
- Oui?
I think we should get to work on that shelter.
Pourquoi? I cannot imagine a better roof over our heads than the stars in the sky.
What about the kind of roof over our head that's actually a roof?
It's going to rain!
What is a little rain? Hmm?
We cherish the water, for it is the water that nurtures the flower.
- Okay. This is crazy!
Building a shelter was your idea. Yours!
Oh, great. Great!
All right, guys, we're gonna build a shelter.
I need everyone's help. Let's go.
I'll try. But I feel so useless.
- What are you doing?
- What I've wanted to do since the moment I laid my eyes all over on you.
- What?
- Huh?
Hey, you guys are going to catch pneumonia dancing in the rain like that.
I say, hey, I be gone today
But I'll be back around the way
Seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing, that I love you
You ought to be careful kicking mud around like that.
Hello?
Someone could lose an eye!
I've been a lot of places all around the way
But I don't want to write a lave sang for the world
No, I just want to write a song
That looks like fun.
Hocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
I say, hey, I'll be gone today
- Eleanor? Would you care to dance?
- I'd love to.
- With me?
 Yes, Theodore!
I can't believe
Jeanette's getting all the attention.
I'm the pretty one.
Jeanette's the smart one.
You don't see me running around trying to be all smart, do you?
I know! I'm the fun one,
- You're the pretty one.
- Yeah!
Do you know how slippery that dirt is?
This is ridiculous.
Are you even listening to me?
Simon!
Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.
No!
Hmm.
What are you doing?
Ugh. Building a shelter.
Since I'm not the fun one any more
I figure I may as well be... the responsible one.
Ew. Really?
Well, since I'm not the pretty one any more, maybe I should build a shelter, too.
Yeah, good luck with that.
What, you don't think I could do it?
Hey, I didn't say that, Brit.
I thought it, but I didn't say it.
So you wanna play it this way.
Alfons-y!
He's so French.
Oh! Be careful, Simone!
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
Now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?
Good thing we don't wear pants.
Okay, you guys, come on, come over.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Of course it's safe.
I do this thing every day.
Oh! Oh!
- Jeanette!
- Jeanette!
Hold on, Jeanette.
- Viens, ma chére.
No, no. Look into my eyes.
You have nothing to fear.
Yes, yes. Very good.
Voila!You are safe. Bravo!
- You made it!
- You're so brave.
Aw!
- Wow.
- Ooh la la!
Pretty.
Whoa.
Double rainbow. What does it mean?
Alive they're superstars, sure. But dead?
They're legends.
I'm talking about tribute albums, pay-per-view funerals.
Wait a second. You actually think
I'm in this for the money?
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks, you're doing a lousy job.
I'm doing this because I love them, okay?
Look, if you wanna spend the rest of your life running around after a bunch of spoiled brats, be my guest.
- They're not brats.
- Really? Even Alvin?
You never even bothered to get to know them, Ian.
I mean, sure, Alvin can be kind of a handful, but he means well.
He's sometimes just a little irresponsible, that's all.
But, come on, Simon?
He's probably the most level-headed kid I know.
If anything, he's a little too uptight.
And then there's little Theodore.
Dave, I barely cared about what you had to say about the first two.
I can't imagine the big-boned one is gonna be any more interesting.
Forget it, let's just keep going.
Yee-haw!
UP, poisson, up!
Ooh la la!
Oh, no. This is terrible.
Shouldn't he have come up by now?
Uh-oh. Simone! Where are you?
Zoe, you've gotta do something.
All right.
Callaway, I need you to go in there and find Simone.
I know you can do it, little buddy.
You're kidding, right?
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.
Simone!
Told you.
I'm sorry if I caused you any worry, mademaiselle.
But I have something for you.
Maybe this will be a way to make it up.
Oh! it's beautiful!
Where did you find it?
Yeah, it is beautiful.
Where did you find it?
In a cave behind the waterfall.
I thought it would look nice on you.
But now I realize even the most precious gem cannot compare to your beauty.
Aw!
Yeah. Were there any other jewels or gems or diamonds or anything else in there?
By the time I found the gold,
I had already been gone from my Jeanette far too long.
Aw!
What?
You guys, they found it. They found it!
And the best part is, they don't even know what they found.
They think that it's just one bracelet.
Which means that the rest of the treasure is mine.
All mine!
What the...
Whoa! What are you?
Hey! Oh!
Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.
You just take what you want.
Drop it. Drop it!
You mess with me, ése,
I'll go loco on you.
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa!
Give it back!
You can sting like a bee or strike like a cobra, but this honey munk don't care!
Okay, Brit, I'm all done.
If you want, I can help you get started...
Whoa!
This tree house is awesome.
Maybe you are kind of the smart one.
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is...
Well, you did your best.
Anyhoo, no reason we can't be comfortable and stylish while we wait for Dave to show up, right?
Brit, I...
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.
You do? Why?
'Cause he's not even looking.
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?
Because I drive him crazy.
You know, the way Simon's been driving me crazy?
I mean, that's what I've been doing to Dave.
For years.
No wonder he hates me.
Oh!
Don't worry, Alvin.
I'm sure Dave will come.
I mean, he certainly loves
Simon and Theodore.
Un, deux, trois
Simon? ls Dave ever gonna find us?
Simon? I mean, Simone?
I'm so sorry, were you speaking to moi?
Yes! About Dave!
Are we ever going to find him?
I see you are sad, man ami.
And I hate to see you sad.
I will help you find your friend Dave.
You really think you can find him?
I know I can!
And then I will find this Simon you keep speaking of!
As Dave and I have never met,
I will need you to describe him for me.
Well, he's very kind and a good storyteller.
Mmm-hmm. Very helpful.
Oh! And he's about this tall.
Mmm-hmm.
Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?
I don't think so.
Then these footprints must not be his.
Jungle Monster!
Do you hear that?
Yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.
No, no, maybe it's a helicopter! Listen!
Face it, Dave, no one is coming to rescue us, okay?
And my stomach noises are gonna get louder and louder and louder until one day they just stop.
Because I will have eaten you.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe no one's coming.
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
Maybe they're gone.
I really messed up.
Dave, it kills me to say this, kills me, but...
Look, man, you're really good with those kids, really good.
They love you.
And I should know because I was really bad with those kids and they hate me.
But, look, you should know that whatever happens, you did nothing wrong. Nothing.
Thanks, Ian.
Come here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Ian?
Ian?
Ian!
Mon dieu!
The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!
Or hungry. Alfons-y!
That means let's go.
Oh.
Ow!
Great, a volcano.
Of course!
That's why the water was so hot!
It's being heated by the underground magma chamber!
- How do you know that?
- I have no idea!
Maybe I accidentally paid attention.
Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike?
Like, I don't know, maybe to the waterfall or whatever?
Not now, Zoe!
The whole island is going to explode!
What?
Guys, we've got to get off this island.
We have to build a raft, now.
"Right now" like, right now?
Or "right now" like, after a hike to the waterfall now?
I've been hit!
By Dave's necklace?
Tell Jeanette I will watch over her with angel wings.
Dave?
Theodore!
Dave? Ha ha!
Told you we'd find him!
Simon!
It is Simone, but I am often confused for this Simon fellow.
Perhaps we look alike?
- Simone?
- Ian!
Hey, you found the chubby one.
Don't worry, Theodore.
Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?
What was that?
That's an active volcano.
Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck.
Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes.
Jeanette, find as many coconuts and mangoes as you can.
Who knows how long we'll be out there.
Who knows how long we'll be out there.
What can I do to help?
- Dave!
- Dave!
Dave!
- You found us!
Hey.
We missed you so much.
I knew you would find us.
Ow.
Eleanor! What happened?
You know, just a zip-line accident.
- A what?
- I'm fine.
It only hurts when I try to explain it.
Okay, you know what, never mind.
The important thing is you guys are safe.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hey, what is it?
I thought you'd never find us.
That you weren't even looking.
Why wouldn't I look for you?
Because I'm such a pain in the...
Alvin.
I know, you don't think I'm a pain.
No, you're a pain.
But I'd come, no matter what.
Arc de Triomphe, mayonnaise, Napoleon.
I get it, Frenchie, you come from a rich history.
Well, guess what, we're all gonna be history if we don't get out of here.
Uncle Ian!
What's he doing here?
It's kind of a long story.
Don't worry, he's cool.
Yes, for a pelican man.
Oh, yeah, nothing cooler than a grown man in a pelican suit.
So, Dave, how are we gonna get out of here?
I don't know, Alvin,
I think you've got this under control.
Theodore, you and Eleanor are on rope duty.
Dave and Ian, we need oars.
Simone, you and Jeanette are in charge of food.
- And, Zoe...
- No, I know, I know.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pack up my balls!
Who's that?
Another long story.
Yeah! Good work, guys!
Let's get off this island.
This raft won't build itself.
Whoa!
Go! Go! Go!
- Heave!
- Ho!
- Heave!
- Ho!
- Heave!
- Ho!
It's incredible, you guys.
Very impressive.
Just seeing everyone come together to build it...
- I just want to say...
It can wait.
Wait, where are Jeanette and Simone?
I hope this is going to be enough.
Did you hear something?
Who can say?
When I am with you, all I can hear is the beating of my own heart.
Oh, Simone!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Somebody! Help!
Jeanette?
Guys! Guys!
Over here! Come quick, hurry!
- Simone, are you okay?
- Simone!
Why are you calling me Simone?
- Simon?
- Yeah.
You're back! It finally wore off!
What wore off?
You were bitten by a spider.
It, like, messed up your brain.
Ah. Is that why I think I see Dave and a half-Ian, half-bird?
No, it's really me. And really Ian.
'Sup?
Simon, where's Jeanette?
She was out here with you.
Jeanette? I don't know...
I do.
It's Zoe. She took her.
Simon, I need to know where you found that gold bracelet.
What gold bracelet?
The one you gave to Jeanette.
What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?
On your date.
Jeanette and I are dating?
Okay, he's useless.
Theodore, Eleanor, you're gonna have to lead the way.
I don't remember exactly how to get there.
I do!
Which way, Eleanor?
Make a left. No, right. No, left!
I thought you said you knew where you were going.
I do! Sometimes I just forget my left from my right.
That way!
Okay, we just have to cross here.
Are you kidding me?
Guys, I can't do that.
But, Simon, you already did.
No, I didn't.
That was Simone, that was not me.
But Simone is you.
He's in there somewhere.
You just have to find him, taut de suite.
Because Jeanette needs you, Simon.
No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft.
If the volcano blows before I make it out of here, you have to promise me you'll...
Leave without you. Got it.
Okay.
Dave.
I'm coming with you.
Absolutely not, it's too dangerous.
Remember I said someday I may need to disobey you?
Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you.
Let's go.
You're not coming up until you have every last bit of that treasure.
But the volcano is about to explode!
Well, then I guess you better hurry, huh?
Run, go, go. In you go.
Get down there. That's right.
Keep going!
S.0.S.
Please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y. O. U. are
Making it hard
I can't help it
See, it don't feel right
Keep moving!
This time, please
Someone come and rescue me
Okay! Pull me up. I can't hold any more.
If you can still talk, it means you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!
Yes! That sounds very good.
Jeanette!
Dave!
They're supposed to be behind that waterfall!
That's right.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Zoe!
- No, no. Not another step.
Don't come any closer.
Are you all right, Jeanette?
I'm pretty freaked out, and those earrings tasted awful.
Zoe, you don't have to do this.
Oh, I don't?
I spent 10 years looking for this treasure.
It's the whole reason why I came to this stinking island!
You mean you didn't crash-land?
They said that I was crazy and they said that this map was a fake.
And now the treasure is mine!
Run!
Jeanette, come on, come on.
Run!
Jeanette!
Oh, no!
Help, help!
Oh, no, help!
You're going back in that cave, and you are going to get me more treasure.
Jeanette!
- Simone!
- It's Simon!
Alvin!
No!
- Hurry!
- Come on, guys, go!
Go. go!
Come on, come on.
Ow!
Look!
Come on!
Run!
But where's Dave?
- Help me UP!
- Oh, help you UP?
Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave?
All I had was my treasure, and now it's gone.
Do you get that? My life is ruined.
And now you're gonna know how that feels.
No, no! it's tempting to blame Dave.
I know. I've been there.
I wish I could get back all those years
I spent plotting my revenge.
All that time and energy, wasted.
All those pizzas
I had delivered to his house, wasted.
That was you?
Not now, Dave! All right?
You could let Dave fall to his death and I could go back to the raft with the chipmunks, become their manager again and make tons of money.
So, really, I'm good either way.
But let me tell you something.
Hate, anger, regret, those aren't just members of a girl group I once signed.
They're what consumed me.
And they're consuming you.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Or not. Again,
I'm good either way, so...
I don't want to sway you.
What are you guys doing? Help me.
Please. Help me save my dad!
Hurry!
I got you, Dave.
Come on! Help me, guys.
Wow!
There they are!
Come on!
Faster!
Hurry! Hurry!
Let's go, go. 90!
Oh, no!
- Get up!
- Hurry!
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!
Run!
Grab the oar!
Come on! Come on, guys!
Paddle!
Come on! Paddle!
Faster! Come on, hurry!
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Now we'll never get to perform at the International Music Awards.
I guess now we're the losers.
Jeanette, I don't know what to say.
I guess I was just so obsessed with finding that treasure that I kind of... I lost it.
And I'm...
I'm really sorry.
We both are.
Well, apology accepted.
Oh.
Really?
Look, Dunlop, this is a new beginning for both of us.
I hope you don't mind.
Simone gave it to me.
Oh, I don't mind.
You know, Jeanette, even the most perfect gem cannot compare to your beauty.
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?
I just wanted to say now that we're not all, you know, dead, sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry I was acting like a child on the ship.
And kind of maybe ruined our family vacation.
Sometimes a racehorse needs a little room to run.
Yes. Yeah. I like where your head's at.
That is very wise, David.
'Sup?
What, no love for Uncle Ian?
- You put us in cages!
- You put us in cages!
Seriously? Are we still talking about that?
New subject, I saved Dave's life.
Okay, but I'll be watching you, mister.
Alvin, you still have that pocket knife I gave you?
Knife? Oh, right, sorry,
I meant to give it back.
I want you to keep it.
Really?
Maybe you can use it to signal that helicopter.
What?
- Hey!
- Down here!
Hello!
It's me, Ian Hawke! Jet Records!
Guys, circle around!
Everything's aka y. We got you, guys!

Hello.
- Hello.
- Man: I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Hi.
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.
Mockingbird Trail, right?
That is right.
I don't suppose you know how to get out there.
No, I don't.
Well, listen up.
It's a bit tricky.
- Keys.
- Thank you.
These arrows will get you through town.
Over here there are more dirt roads and woods.
Your cabin's a real beaut.
But heck, there ain't another for a good country mile.
I am looking forward to the peace and quiet.
I'm actually a novelist and I'm starting my next book here.
If that's what you're aiming for.
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.
Howdy, ma'am.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
No, that is okay.
You know what?
I am actually lost.
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.
It's about 10 miles back.
It's gonna be on your left-hand side.
Gonna make a left after a big red mailbox.
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.
You staying over in that cabin on Mockingbird?
- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!
So you know you're running a little hot.
Maybe I should check up under your hood for you.
How's that line working for you?
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?
- I got that.
- No, I got it.
No, I got it.
Oh shit.
I'm sorry, my bad.
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.
- Okay.
- All right?
Keep the change.
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.
Bye-bye.
Woman:
How's the writing coming?
You kidding me?
I should have come out here on my first book.
You gonna come back for Hertz's party?
Jen? Did I lose you?
Oh, sorry.
Something just-
Hey.
- You still there?
- Barb, hold on a second.
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.
You've got to be kidding me.
Way to go, Jennifer.
Ugh.
Ew!
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.
Man: Did you check the seal on the flapper?
I did that already.
- You did?
- Yes.
Look, I'm really in a spot here.
- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- You'll be there?
- I'm not going anywhere.
Man:
All right, I'll send someone.
Aggh!
So is this gonna take much longer?
Not much.
What's wrong with it?
Yes!
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.
Sorry. You saved me from having to bathe in the lake.
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.
Wait, I didn't-
Ground rule double.
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.
Fine, maybe a triple.
But you gotta knock its guts clean out its mouth if you wanna score a run.
Man, would you turn that shit off?
You're gonna get us in trouble with that human society.
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.
I told you, Andy, this thing's gonna make me a fortune.
So you two retards gonna go fishing or what?
Hey, speaking of retards...
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!
Well, Stanley, got us all here now.
What's the big show?
The big show is this.
What did you do this time, film yourself lighting a fart?
I don't know why I bother with you dipshits.
I got Matthew's girlfriend here in a very private moment.
Andy:
Girlfriend?
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since he was sucking on his mama's titties.
He had that city girl all alone and he didn't even try to nail her.
What city girl?
You know what girl.
The one from the gas station the other day.
The one that had you on your ass.
She had Matt here fixing her pipes.
She even gave him a kiss for servicing her.
Bullshit.
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.
Hey, Matthew, don't you lie to me.
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.
Oh shit.
Andy: Hey, that's some good camerawork, man.
You dirty dog, man.
How the fuck did you get that?
I've been working nights.
She sure is something to look at.
Yeah yeah.
And she likes me.
Come on, Matthew.
That girl wouldn't even give Johnny the time of day.
What?
Shit.
I can tame that ass if I want to.
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.
Stuck-up city bitch.
City bitch like that is ungettable.
Bullshit. I'll get it.
Let me tell you something:
I had that bitch creaming her panties.
Yeah, and she had you shitting in yours.
You don't think I can have that anytime I want to?
Hmm?
Let me tell you something:
Bitch like that, she come out here for one reason and one reason only.
Titties flopping in the window like that for everyone to see.
Come on, you know.
No no.
She's not like that, Johnny.
They're all like that.
Big city cock-teasing whore is all she is.
Fuckin' A.
Shit, Matthew.
You wouldn't know what to do with a piece of ass like that if you got it.
No shit.
But you're lucky
'cause I'm your friend.
I'll show you the way.
Hello.
Nice shot, huh?
Evening.
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!
Well now.
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?
Smile real pretty for the camera, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.
You all better get out of here right now.
I called the cops.
Oh, she called the cops.
You called the police or you will call the police?
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.
What phone did you do that with?
Matthew told us you dropped yours in the drain.
Bloop!
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.
It's all right.
Come on now.
Come on, boy.
Come here.
Matthew here says that you didn't pay him for fixing your sink.
That's not true.
He ran out.
I'll take care of it.
Andy:
He's shy, huh?
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.
Hold up, wait a minute.
Let's not worry about any of that right now.
What's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone?
I'm writing.
I'm a writer.
She's a writer.
My boyfriend will be here soon.
He's coming up to the cabin.
Is that right?
Oh!
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Boys, now we better blow on out of here.
We don't wanna interrupt your date night.
Date night!
Let me tell you something, sweetheart:
There ain't no man in his right mind that leaves a pretty little thing like you out here all alone.
He's coming.
Night's almost over.
Oh wow.
Johnny:
Come here.
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.
Come here, pretty little thing.
Come here, have a drink with me.
No.
Oh, there you go.
I don't want to.
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?
- See?
- Mm-hmm.
Please, I just don't want to have a drink.
What is this shit right here?
'Cause that's already been opened.
Well shit, boys.
You were right.
She's too good to have a drink with us.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
What are we to you?
A bunch of dirt?
I didn't say that.
Fuckin' A, this bitch is a writer.
"No one wants a phone call at 2:00 in the morning.
When you're 15, it's a prank call.
When you're 21, it's a drunk boyfriend call.
But after 25, it's usually really bad news.
That's how I found out my father died. "
Whose daddy died?
Can't you all just please leave me alone?
Johnny: No!
Just tell me what you want.
What do you want?
I offered you my money.
Mm-hmm.
Whoa!
Here. Here.
Fine. I'll have a drink.
Then you have to leave.
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.
That ain't shit.
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.
Now see, I-
I know you can do better than that.
I'm sure that when you're out there in the city with all your hoity-toity rich friends,
I bet you can throw 'em back with the best of 'em.
Now can't you?
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.
All right, shit.
See, that's not so bad now, is it?
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.
But we're even now, right?
Okay?
Just please leave.
Please leave.
Well, that's just not what this is about no more.
What is it about?
I wanna see your teeth.
What?
You heard me, pretty little show horse.
I want to see your teeth.
That-
I don't want to- no.
Now you're gonna show them teeth.
You have beautiful teeth.
There.
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.
Let's see more.
Put your fingers on the inside of your mouth right there.
Now take the other two, stick 'em on the other side.
There you go.
Now pull.
Okay, please, I'm begging you, just go.
No.
Again.
Come here.
There it is.
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.
Shh!
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.
You know why I know you ain't got no boyfriend?
You know why?
'Cause all them city boys are faggots.
Fuckin' A.
Since you ain't got no boyfriend, well, shit, I figured that... this would be your man tonight.
Yeah.
No?
Come here.
Come on, give him a little kiss.
Give him a little kiss, come on.
Give him a little kiss here.
Give him a little kiss here. Kiss him.
Oh shit, come on now.
Come on now. I ain't talking about no fucking peck like you gave Matthew.
I want you to give him a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.
Get up on your knees.
If I don't like your enthusiasm,
I may come bad.
Open up.
Open up.
There it is. There it is.
There it is.
All right, all right.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.
Just like it's your first time again.
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
All right, all right.
Shit!
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.
I d-don't want to.
I don't.
What?
What the fuck did you say?
What the hell you mean you d-d-don't want to?
I don't want to, Johnny.
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.
Listen to me.
Fuck that, man.
I ain't fucking waiting.
Aw shit!
Matthew:
She-she likes me.
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?
Go ahead.
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.
Go prove it to me.
Uh-huh.
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!
Johnny:
Come on, boys!
Whoa there.
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.
I was assaulted.
He came into my cabin and he had a gun.
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.
It was in my mouth.
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.
I know this one.
She rented the place down on Mockingbird Trail.
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.
I'm a sheriff.
You're safe.
Now tell me what happened.
These four men- there were four men and they broke into my cabin.
And they had a gun and they assaulted me.
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?
Yes, I'd seen them.
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.
Sounds like them boys have been up to no good again.
All right, Earl, you head on back.
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on over to the cabin and straighten things out.
Miller!
Miller, this is the sheriff.
You and your boys are still here, you come on out right now.
Miller, if you're up there, you'll be leaving by the window.
Ma'am, stay here.
You here alone?
Yes.
With all this?
I didn't plan on drinking it all right away.
I was gonna be here for a couple months.
You drink some this evening?
Yes.
One of them went upstairs and he went through everything.
They do this too?
Please, I really don't care about any of that.
How long you been here?
Just a couple days.
Anything strange happen before this?
You have a run-in with any of these guys?
No, not really.
Just stopped for gas and directions.
Ma'am, is this your marijuana cigarette?
Um, no.
One of the boys must have left it.
You mean to tell me one of them guys is wearing lipstick?
This ain't the big city.
Please, I may have smoked a joint, but that doesn't mean that I made any of this up.
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?
What could you possibly need backup for? I'm the victim.
Ma'am, you've been drinking, smoking marijuana cigarettes.
You got enough booze in here to put the whole town three sheets to the wind.
You're running around in your sleeping garments at the crack of dawn.
You gotta see this from my point of view.
What? They came in here and they assaulted me.
You have to believe me.
Ma'am, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.
You're making serious accusations about boys I've known since they was kids.
And you haven't been altogether truthful now, have you?
Now please, step up against the wall.
Shoulder width apart.
Ma'am, please.
Look right ahead.
Now...
I want the whole story.
You tell me the whole thing.
You start by telling me what those boys did.
Tell the sheriff the truth, show horse.
Better yet, why don't you show him?
Show him how that pretty little mouth of yours couldn't get enough
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?
They do this?
Nice little tits.
I asked you a question.
Please.
Johnny: You show the sheriff your teeth there, show horse.
Come on.
- Come on, move.
- Andy: Get!
Move!
Now whinny.
I said whinny!
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!
Huh. Huh.
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.
Johnny:
Keep whinnying, show horse.
Stanley:
Here we go.
Get on your knees.
Keep whinnying!
Oh-ho-ho!
You oughta tame that little mare of yours.
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.
On your feet or you're not gonna get your sugar cube.
Matthew, get your clothes off, boy.
We're gonna get your cherry popped.
Huh-uh.
Matthew, I ain't asking you a question.
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.
You wanna talk the talk, you better walk the walk.
I'm walking.
- Jennifer: Stop, stop.
- Virgin.
Please stop.
You get your clothes off or I'm gonna slice her from the chin
- to cunt.
- Oh!
Oh yeah!
- Johnny: There's Matthew.
- Stanley: Now he gets it.
Johnny:
Pants off, boy.
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.
Well, it's not totally his fault.
She ain't done much to get his motor running now, has she?
Dance.
Dance.
Come on.
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!
Johnny: Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!
Prance for us now. Come on, like you do when you wanna get laid.
Whoo! Come on!
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.
You dance like that in them city clubs?
- Ho!
- Come on now!
You watching this, boy?
Johnny: What?
Okay, I'll- I'll- I'll-
I'll do it.
Okay? Okay.
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah!
Okay, here we go.
Get up, get up.
This is for you, Matthew.
This is for you, boy.
Oh yeah!
Oh shit!
Get her up here.
Shut her up.
No! No! No!
Hold her legs!
Oh my God.
I'll bash your fucking face in, bitch.
- Andy: Shut up.
- No no no!
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.
- God damn it.
- Okay.
- Johnny: Here. Here.
- Storch: Get her panties off.
- I'll rip 'em off.
- No!
Yeah, get her.
- Johnny: Damn it, hold her still.
- Come on, retard.
- No! No!
- Hold her down!
- Stick your pee-pee in her.
- Okay!
Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.
Johnny: Yeah!
Storch:
Get in there!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
- Jennifer: Oh no!
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.
Johnny: Feels good, don't it, Matthew, pumping away on her? Get her legs.
Storch: Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!
Deep. Get in deep.
Get in deep.
Deep deep deep deep!
- Deep!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew.
Get over here.
Hey, put that thing down and get over here.
- Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
- Shut your fucking mouth!
Storch:
Gag her!
Johnny: Shut her up!
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!
Keep her quiet now!
Hello, angel.
Daddy's on a call.
Girl:
Daddy, it's Sunday.
You always make breakfast before church.
I know, I know, sweetheart.
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.
Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
Yeah, Matthew!
He fill her up yet?
Johnny: Damn it. Oh shit!
You're the shit, Matthew.
You're getting your ass beat by a woman.
Johnny: Matthew, you better control that bitch.
Hold her down. Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, boy.
Over there.
Over there.
Ain't that romantic?
You clean that shit up.
Make her do it.
Andy:
You heard him. Clean it up.
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?
Stanley:
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.
You can thank me later.
Andy: You calm down, boy.
You did all right, Matthew.
Jennifer: No no.
Please.
No.
No no.
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?
Why don't you have a drink?
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.
All right, boys, that filly's got a few more races to run.
You like that, girl?
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.
You got some fight left in you, Miss Hills.
I like things rough.
Please. Please.
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.
Please.
I'm sore.
Don't worry now, sweetheart.
I'm an ass man.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Whoo!
Andy:
God damn, Stanley.
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.
That bitch was too tight.
Don't you know you're supposed to wait for the lady?
Stanley:
Shit, man, like she cares.
She's laying there like a dead fish.
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna be the pussy today, huh?
Johnny: Don't know what you're bragging about, Andy.
Clocked you just over two minutes.
Andy:
It's been a while, man.
I'm out of practice.
It's been, I don't know, maybe 10 years.
Where you going?
God damn, she's got some fight in her.
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?
Well, it was fun while it lasted, Miss Hills.
Johnny: Shit!
Johnny:
Where is she?
Hell, she's gotta come up for air sometime.
Shit.
Stanley: Gators must have got her by now. Right, Sheriff?
Listen up.
Creek ends about six miles downstream in Watson.
Between here and there, we're gonna find her.
We split up.
We check the banks, in the timber, under rocks.
Hell, you see a hole big enough for her, I want you in there.
And do not stop till y'all find me a dead city whore.
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.
Now what?
Her body will show up one way or another.
Every day we're gonna check the ravine, from the bridge straight down through here and back.
Two shifts a day till we find something.
For how long?
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?
Yes sir.
You get her wheels down the shop.
Strip it down to its last goddamn nut.
That's gonna take two weeks.
All right, Sheriff, yeah.
I'll have Andy torch it out and I'll rub the numbers out.
Asshole!
The fuck you saving that for, you moron?
It's fucking evidence!
I shit you not!
I need you all on point for this.
And I mean goddamn fucking point.
We clear?
Now pony up.
We got shit to do.
Burn that effing tape.
Andy:
Well, that's all of it, right down to her little titty sling.
Man, this fire's making me hungry.
Well, there's a headline.
We gotta finish this shit.
We gotta get that car in the garage.
Then you can stuff your face till you puke.
Where the hell's Matthew at?
He ain't one to stay behind.
He was looking around the water like some crazed dog after a bone, man.
You keep an eye on him.
We gotta make sure he keeps it together, you hear me?
Just at least until this shit's over.
Gone all day,
I got nervous.
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.
The mess they got on Highway 1 took forever.
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?
Daddy.
Got anything on the stove?
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.
Proud of what?
I was accepted to the honors program, Daddy.
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.
I expect nothing less from my angel.
Mommy and I are proud of you.
I'm gonna shower up.
Every time I come in here this place gets worse.
Yeah, and business keeps getting better and better.
Mockingbird Trail.
Miss Hills.
She left?
She did indeed.
I couldn't make head nor tail of it.
I found empty cases of booze, marijuana cigarettes.
Crazy wild one.
She'd have made a preacher cuss.
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?
No refund policy.
Christmas come early.
Enjoy it.
Speaking of early, next month's quail season.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of shooting squirrels.
Me too.
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.
Did you just come here to see me?
Happy hour, boys.
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.
I just want all this bullshit to be over.
No!
Woman: He's the big black guy in the red drawstring.
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.
It's Earl.
- Earl.
- Yeah.
This woman leaves a message on the machine.
Barbara something or other.
Yeah, so?
She was asking about that Miss Hills.
Says no one's seen her in over a month.
Ain't that about the time she split?
Yeah.
Yeah, and you know the story.
I don't know.
I wasn't there.
I think you should call her back.
I mean, heck, Sheriff, you may have been the last one to see her.
Sheriff?
Okay, I'll call her.
Good.
You want the number?
No, it's late.
I'll get it from you in the AM.
We're still on for tomorrow, right?
Yeah, of course.
Everything all right?
Yeah, just fine.
It's gone!
Look at that.
Looks like someone spooked the cattle.
It's gone!
It's fucking gone!
Jesus, Stanley, calm the fuck down.
What's got your nuts in a sling?
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.
Maybe you accidentally ate it.
Fuck off, man, this is serious!
It had the tape in it.
What are you talking about?
The tape.
The fucking tape.
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.
I replaced it with a new one.
The Sheriff stomped on the one that had nothing on it.
You kept that tape, huh?
You kept that tape, you stupid piece of shit?
Come here.
You kept that tape?
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.
Come on.
Gotta stick together on this one.
You're too dumb to know how dumb you are.
You know that?
Uh-huh.
Is that right?
Is that right?
I better not find you, you little fucker.
All right.
All right, let's go.
Come on out, fucker.
Come on!
You think this shit's funny?
Andy?
Stanley?
Fucking pussies.
All right. All right.
That's it, God damn it.
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!
Come on out, fucker.
Oh shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Sweetheart.
They're beautiful.
I've been so busy.
No need to explain.
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.
I guess.
Maybe you can help me with something while I put these in water.
Help with what?
I got this tape delivered, but it don't fit our machine.
What tape?
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.
Chastity see this?
No. Like I said, we couldn't get it to play.
Where is she?
She's sleeping. Why?
I'm gonna be back.
Where the hell you been?
Beauty queen over here doing his hair for two hours.
What's this all about, man?
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?
Right there.
That's where I got that.
Somebody left me a present last night on my doorstep.
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.
No one knows where he's at.
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.
What?
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.
You wanna tell me why this was dropped off to my house?
To my wife!
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?
I smashed the damn thing myself!
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.
The one you smashed ain't got nothing on it.
You knew about this?
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.
Eat that tape, fat boy!
Fucking tape!
You think it's funny?
You screwed up, fat boy.
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.
I mean, dipshit there, he kept the tape as a souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it, Sheriff.
Look at this. Silly bastard left me a present last night.
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.
I think he even feels guilty.
You dipshits bring him to me.
I'm gonna cut his retard pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.
That's before I'm done shoving it up your dirt hole.
Shit, we've been looking for him, Sheriff.
Trust me, we've been everywhere looking for him.
I want him found tonight.
Or I swear to Christ,
I'll bring the wrath of God down on you.
Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail?
Goddamn things are like locusts now.
Much to our good fortune.
I gotta take a break.
My dogs are barking something fierce.
I remember when you and my old man chased that buck out from the hollows on Stickler Farm before bagging it.
Aww. Them were the good old days.
To the good old days.
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?
You just enjoy it.
This is some fine whiskey.
Usually you don't get something like this except at baptisms and weddings.
And funerals.
Loose ends, Earl.
Loose ends.
Jennifer: Matthew.
I'm over here.
Jennifer:
Matthew.
Matthew.
I- I knew- knew you were alive.
I knew it.
How did you know, Matthew?
Huh?
How did you know
I was alive?
Are you sure you're not dreaming?
Am I?
Am I dreaming?
Come here.
Sit with me.
I need to tell you-
Shh!
I know, Matthew.
I know this wasn't your fault.
You tried to help me.
I did.
I really really did.
And- and- and you're okay.
You're- you're okay.
Yes, Matthew.
Now come.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.
I'm so sorry.
Oh God!
I'm so sorry.
Matthew.
- Matthew.
- Yeah.
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.
Tell me again how sorry you are.
I'm- I'm- I'm sorry.
It's just not good enough!
Stanley:
Matthew!
Matthew!
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
Matthew!
Come on out, Matthew.
Matthew!
Matthew?
You're only making it harder on yourself, Matt.
Boo!
Stupid fuck, what the hell's wrong with you?
Whoo!
Fucker's playing your song.
Andy:
Your ass is grass, Matthew.
Stanley:
Matthew, you're a dead man.
Whoo!
- Come on, man.
- I'm gonna kill him.
Don't you pass out on me.
I'm too tired to drag your ass back.
What the hell?
Matthew?
Stanley:
Matthew!
God damn it, Matthew, where are you?
Where are you, you little fucker?
Andy, he ain't out here.
You little bitch.
Andy! Andy!
Andy, help me!
What the fuck, man?
- My leg!
- Ahem.
Andy!
Stanley!
Stanley, help me!
Matthew?
Help me!
Please!
Somebody!
Andy:
Stanley!
Come on, Stanley.
Matthew, this shit ain't funny, boy.
Somebody help me!
Jennifer: Smile real pretty for the camera, boy.
Andy: Please!
I know you like to watch, don't you?
Don't you, you sick fuck?
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.
Andy:
Matthew!
Matthew!
- Here you go.
- Stanley!
You remember this?
Stanley, help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Can't talk, can you?
Maybe it's because you're hungry.
You know, you gotta eat a lot of nasty shit out here to stay alive.
Are you hungry?
You hungry?
What's wrong?
You don't like it?
What are you doing?
Some fishing.
I know how you guys like to fish.
Don't blink.
Andy:
You okay, Stan?
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Please!
Please is what I said to you.
You said...
"Suck it, bitch. "
Does that ring any bells?
Suck... it... bitch!
Be right back.
Wait, come back.
Come back here.
Come back here.
Andy: Stanley!
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you bitch.
Hi.
You like the show so far?
Andy:
Let me out of here!
Wait.
It gets better.
Please, my eyes.
I can't take it anymore.
Oh, let me help you.
Let me out!
Stanley!
Please.
Please.
Please. Please.
That might feel better.
Andy:
Help!
Huh-uh-uh, now don't drown too soon.
Fuck you.
Now is that any way to talk to a lady?
I'm impressed.
You got a lot of fight in you.
Let's see how you do now.
What's that?
It's just some lye
I found laying around.
No!
Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours.
Fuck you!
You already did that.
I didn't enjoy it much.
Now it's my turn to fuck you.
- Please. Please.
- Oh.
Please.
Pain in the ass.
Good morning.
Whoo.
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?
It's date night.
Your mouth doesn't look so good.
Maybe you should show me your teeth.
I'll kill you.
Ornery stallion.
Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.
I'm gonna have to take care of that.
Huh? Huh?
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races left to run, show horse.
That is disgusting.
Even your boys didn't piss themselves.
Look who's here.
It's my boyfriend.
Remember him?
Why don't you give him a little kiss?
Hmm? Hmm?
Let's go, come on.
I don't take orders from no fucking woman.
No?
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.
Just like it was your first time, remember?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Let me tell you something:
You know, you weren't even a good blowjob.
No.
You know what they do to horses that can't be tamed, Johnny?
You geld them.
No teeth, show horse.
No teeth.
Bitch!
Hey, sweetheart.
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: Mrs. Novick?
No, from the honors program.
- Do you remember anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- I'm real busy, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.
Hello, angel.
Daddy's real busy working.
But I really want you to meet my new teacher.
She's way cool.
Here. Just say hi.
Howdy, Sheriff.
It's truly an honor to speak with you, Miss...
Hills, Jennifer Hills.
Excuse me?
I have to tell you it's been a pleasure meeting your family.
You have a wonderful daughter with a bright and promising future.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.
No, wait!
Shit!
Chastity, where is she?
She went to Hanson Park with Miss Hills.
She wanted to get to know her students in the program before the year st-
God damn it!
Who is she?
Who is this woman?
Chastity!
Chastity!
Where are you, angel?
Chastity!
Oh no! No!
Please!
No.
Help me, Jesus.
Does that hurt, Sheriff?
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.
Where is she, you bitch?
I'd be real careful how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.
What have you done to her?
By her, I assume you mean your daughter?
She really is lovely, Sheriff.
So young.
So sweet.
So innocent.
I mean, can you imagine?
Imagine what?
Imagine that somebody had done something like this to her.
Someone like Andy.
Or Stanley or Johnny.
Or more likely you, you sick, perverted rapist!
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!
Deep! Deep!
Deep! Deep! Deep!
Jesus fucking Jesus.
Please.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
She's just an innocent girl.
So was I.
What are you doing? What?
Matthew.
You won't get a- fucking-way with this.
You won't get away with this!
He'll be waking up soon.
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm a God-fearing person.
I got-
I've got a baby coming, please.
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.
Sorry, Sheriff.
It was fun while it lasted.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.
I'm begging you to help me.
Please help me.
I've got a wife and family.
Ma'am, please!
You fuck!
You fuck!
You fuck!
Where are you going, you fuck?
I'll see you in hell!
I'll rape you in hell!
You're just a piece of meat.
I'll find you.
I'll hunt you down in hell, you bitch!
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.
Matthew!
I'll be honest, Ferb.
I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this.
But I guess that's life, huh?
One minute, you're having the best day ever, the next, you're being fed to a monster the size of a two-car garage.
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life.
And everything started out so well this morning.
Good morning, Perry.
Now that's the way to wake up.
This is gonna be the best day ever.
We consider every day a plus
To spend it with a platypus
We're always so ecstatic
'Cause he's semi-aquatic
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus
Brings smiles to the both of us
Life's never fuddy-duddy
With our web-footed buddy
When we're brushing our teeth
It's better
Tying our shoes
It's better
Combing our hair
It's better
Like we're a cheese sandwich
And he's the cheddar
Blinking our eyes
It's better
Breathing in and out
So much better
Sitting in a chair
It's better
And taking a bath
Just a little bit wetter
Every day is such a dream
When it's started with a monotreme
He's duck-billed and he's beaver-tailed and hairy
You know that he's hairy
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry
It's better
And we just want to tell you, Perry
Everything's better with you
Better with you
Good morning, boys.
Happy anniversary, Perry.
Oh, that's right! Gosh.
I can't believe it's been five years.
I remember the day we first got you.
Come on, kids.
Pick out any pet you want.
Look, Phineas, this one's looking at you!
And this one's looking at you, Ferb.
Why won't anything look at me?
Ferb! This one's looking at both of us at the same time.
That thing? You're kidding, right?
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes. We'd like that one, please.
You'd like to adopt a platypus?
Is that what it is? Well, yes.
- May we have him, please?
- Okay.
What would you even name a platypus?
Of course, Ferb and I knew exactly what to call you.
- Bartholemew!
- Bartholemew!
And then when we got you home, we renamed you Perry and gave you this locket.
Look how young we all were.
Hey, Jeremy.
You wanna go to the mall?
You know, I'd love to, but my dad's taking me to check out his old college today.
Booyah! Go Polecats! Booyah!
He's already set up an interview with an academic advisor.
Can you believe that?
Gee, Jeremy, I forgot you're a whole year older than me.
A trip to college?
That's... That's really great.
Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Jeremy! In the blink of an eye, you'll be moving on to the next phase of your life.
You'll be going to college
and wearing tweed jackets with patches on the elbows.
You'll be so mature.
And look at me. I'm a child!
Jeremy, you'll see. I can mature.
Starting with taking this silly photo off.
Mr Miggins!
Have you been there the whole time?
All right, looks like the pitcher's ready.
And batter up!
Batter, batter, batter, swing!
Yes, sports fans, that may be the best hit ever in the history of platypult baseball.
And the crowd exhales loudly through their mouths.
And Fletcher snags the pop fly.
He's out!
Hi, Phineas! What you doing?
Turning Perry's involuntary reflex into a sporting event.
Hi, Perry, can I try?
Whoa, momma! Nice shot, Isabella.
Did someone lose a ball?
Yeah, we were just playing platypult.
I love platypus-themed sports.
You know, if we had two Perrys, we could put a net between them
- and play platypult badminton.
- Who's Annette?
Ferb, that's it!
I know what we're gonna do today.
No, seriously. Who's Annette?
Okay, everyone, I think the tail is all set.
I'll just go check with the foreman.
- He's gone!
- Hey, where's Perry?
Did he really slip away?
On his anniversary?
Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed every single cool thing we've done all summer long.
I guess he can do whatever he wants.
After all, it's his day, right?
Hey, what was that small noise?
Let's all go walk over to it.
Good morning, Agent P. A quick word.
Recently you've been having some close calls
and your host family has almost caught you
sneaking into your lair several times.
No need to remind you, but I'll do it anyway,
that if your cover's blown,
you'll have to be transferred to another city with another host family.
And we both know you wouldn't like that.
I remember the day you were first assigned.
Enjoy your platypus!
Thank you, cheerio!
Agent assignment complete, sir.
Good job, Karl.
If you keep up the great work, you'll make unpaid intern in no time.
- And I did.
- Don't get cocky, Karl.
Agent P, as you know,
every operative is equipped with an autoscan replication device
just like the one in your hat.
We've been using the information you've gathered
to replicate each and every one of
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Inators.
Our top men have been analysing them to determine
if they've been getting smarter or dumber.
And to be honest, the jury's still out.
Now we find out that he's in the process of building
an alternate-dimension-related Inator.
Your assignment is to stop him before he finishes building it.
Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor,
is Karl, with some high-tech gadgets that you might find useful.
Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time.
Would you mind lowering the platform again?
Great. Let me cue the music again.
Well, obviously, this first item is our new wrist communicationizer.
It has many applications that will help you in the field.
For example, a powerful directional electromagnet.
It will draw any metal object to you.
See? And these are aluminium!
Quit goofing around, Karl, and show him the hologram.
Yes, sir.
Pretty nifty, huh?
With this device you'll be able to contact me from anywhere at any time.
But don't call between 3:30 and 4:00 because that's when I take a shower.
Wait a minute. Is that me?
No!
His holographic projection has become mesmerized by his video image.
I better shut it off.
And if you push this button, it gives your adversary an incredible ice cream headache.
It's gone.
You better watch where you point that!
Hey, girl! What are you doing?
Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon, and here I am, concerned with busting my brothers to my mommy and living in this nursery.
A unicorn! A unicorn, Stacy!
"Hi, I'm six!"
You've gotta help me get rid of all this junk.
Wow! Bold move!
Yep. Goodbye, childhood folly, hello, carefree undemanding adult life.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Candace, your father and I are off to the movies.
While we're gone, you're in charge, okay?
Okay, Mom!
And you know, I'm even thinking about giving up on busting my brothers.
The irony is, that as a grown-up, you don't need to tell your mom.
You can just bust them yourself.
That's it! Stacy,
I'm old enough to bust them myself!
That's what I just said.
Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror as I punch a hole through to another dimension.
- Behold, the Other-Dimensionator...
- Sir!
What? What?
I finished setting up the buffet.
For crying out loud, Norm.
I was in the zone!
I just thought you were playing with your doll.
It's not a doll, it's a stand-in!
Pretendy the Practicepus, see?
I wonder if Perry the Platypus practises with a fake me.
It would be nice to know he cares enough.
All systems are green.
Prepare to launch on my mark.
T minus 30 and counting.
Of course, you'll only need this if you're attacked by one of the royals or a member of Parliament.
So it's probably okay to leave the safety on.
And here's your brand new rocket car.
Sweet, huh? Good luck, Agent P.
Karl? Did you tell him the accelerator's a little touchy?
I think he knows, sir.
Three, two, one.
Service!
Phineas and Ferb, you are so busted...
Oh, my gosh! Where'd it go?
You there, small children!
Where's the big contraption?
I don't know.
It was here just a moment ago.
It disappeared?
- Stacy, do you realise what this means?
- We're done?
No, some kind of mysterious force always takes away Phineas and Ferb's inventions before Mom shows up.
This time it took away their invention before I showed up!
The mysterious force recognises that I'm now a grown-up.
A mysterious force? I'm not buying it.
I am a woman of science, at least that's what my horoscope said.
Well, I'm going to prove it to you and bust my brothers at the same time!
Where are my brothers?
We just launched them towards the park.
Buford is there with the other platypult.
Okay, as the adult,
I decree we are going to the park.
Does anyone need to go potty first?
Fine, make it quick.
Ferb, it looks like we're gonna hit that building that looks vaguely like your head.
Time to give it a little test.
Well, I just finished it.
It can't be broken already.
I stand corrected.
All right, what's with the giant shuttlecock?
We're really sorry, sir.
I don't know what happened.
One minute, we were innocently launching ourselves across the city in a badminton platypult.
The next thing we know, we're bouncing on up to the eastside to your deluxe apartment in the sky.
Well, it looks like you've totalled my Other-Dimensionator.
An Other-Dimensionator?
What does it do?
Well, at the moment, it just stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently.
But it's supposed to let me go into other dimensions.
That's cool! We can help you fix it.
I'm Phineas, and this is my brother Ferb.
I'm Dr Heinz Doofenshmirtz, but my friends call me...
I just got in such a funk.
Ferb is naturally handy with tools.
I bet we could put this thing back together in no time.
What the heck. Before we start, there's a whole buffet set up here, please partake.
I was expecting someone who seems to be running late.
You're lucky I got a rocket car winch.
Lots of guys don't have that.
Almost there.
Okay, field compressor attaches to the auxiliary generator.
Was this working before?
Well, if by "working" you mean
"functioning properly," then no.
Well, I think I see your problem.
Everything's wired through this self-destruct button.
Do you even need that?
Well, of course I...
Wait a minute. No, I do not need that.
You are absolutely right.
So Ferb has rigged up this remote control so that if we get separated from the portal, we can open another one.
- Nice touch, kid.
- I guess this is the last piece.
Okay, Ferb, boost me up.
I cannot wait!
- There you are, Perry.
- Perry?
Yeah. He's our pet platypus.
Is every platypus named Perry?
In a perfect world, yes.
Well, he's a cute little fellow. Hi, there.
Coochee, coochee...
Perry, no! We do not bite the elderly.
Again, ow! It's okay.
Platypuses don't typically like me.
Well, Perry, you're just in time to see us open a window into another dimension.
Perry, no! What are you doing? No, no!
Perry, this is not tug of war!
This is not tug of war!
Silly boy, what's gotten into him?
All right, let's get this show on the road, huh?
Remember, if your cover is blown, you'll never see the boys again.
Hey, does anyone hear someone talking?
Never see them again.
Okay, here we go. Right in...
Perry! No! Not on the sofa!
I'm sorry, Dr D. We should take him out.
No, no. Wait. It'll be all right.
I was planning on replacing this old couch anyway.
Now come on. Let's light this pop stand, or however it goes.
Gosh, this is...
It's kind of weird, actually.
I'm usually thwarted by this point.
Well, I guess he's not coming.
And now, behold!
The mind-blowing first images from beyond our dimensional reality!
It's a... It's a couch.
That's a bit anticlimactic.
I guess it's a nice couch, though...
Hey! I got an idea!
Let's swap my couch for that one!
I got it. I got... Or maybe I...
Come on, you want to give me a hand here?
Awesome, check it out.
Hello.
- Say, aren't you...
- Hey, Dr D! Look at this.
Hold that thought.
You're famous here.
Get off!
"Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your leader"?
A whole tri-state area where I am already in charge!
Yeah! Hold on,
I gotta go check something out.
Hello, again.
Is this some kind of test?
Is that really you, sir?
Holy boy!
Even the great Francis Monogram's my slave in this dimension!
I prefer the term
"indentured executive assistant".
Well, I want to meet this other dimension me.
Where can I find him?
You're from another dimension?
Well, he'll probably wanna see you then.
He's into that freaky sort of stuff.
Have a seat and I'll let him know you're on your way up.
Okay. So I just gotta sit here and...
He's Doof Doof Doof
Doof Doof Doof Doof
Bask in his glory
Kneel at his feet
You're in for such a treat
He's Doofenshmirtz
That was awesome!
All right, who's interrupting my...
Do I know you?
Yeah! I'm you from another dimension!
Well, that would explain the handsomeness.
Right back at you, big guy.
Does that mean you and I are exactly alike?
I suppose so.
Do you want some rice pudding?
Ick, no, that's gross
It was a test. Almond brittle?
- Oh, I love it the most
- Me, too
Do you collect coins?
Yeah, just in case
Vending machines become the dominant race
I've been alone all these years
With my irrational fears
But not the vending machine thing.
That's gonna happen.
But now before me, I see
Someone with whom I agree
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I thought I'd be taller
I've been told I slouch
I thought I'd have both my eyes
You know
It's in this pouch
You know, I can't help but notice that your scar goes over your eye patch.
Yeah?
Nothing.
Do llamas weird you out?
Yeah, are they camels or sheep?
No, no, I meant Lorenzo
That's right
He played Meap
Now I know all about you
And you know all about me
And now before me I see
Someone with whom I agree
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me
Now that I found you
We can be a duo
That's right
Twice the evil
Double Doofenshmirtz
Coming at you Fridays
What's that? I mean, are we doing a TV show together?
No. It just sort of sounded like...
I mean, we could. We should!
Maybe we're not so much alike.
That can be our catch phrase.
You're the grumpy one.
Wow, he's done really well for himself.
What do you think, Perry?
Hey, where is Dr D?
So what you're telling me is you're still not ruler of your tri-state area?
Well, obviously you did not have to deal with my nemesis, Perry the Platypus.
Didn't I? Observe.
What is it?
This is Perry the Platyborg!
He was once my nemesis, but now, he's general of my army!
Wow! You are good!
Dismissed.
That was awesome!
Now who's interrupting me?
Remind me to berate my indentured executive assistant.
No, man, it's cool. They're with me.
Hey, Dr D. We thought we'd lost you.
Hi, fellas!
You dare to bring a secret agent in here?
This boy's a secret agent?
- No, not him!
- The quiet one?
No! Not... No. Him!
This plant?
The platypus!
That's Secret Agent Perry the Platypus!
Hey. He's just a platypus.
He doesn't do much.
This is rich. I see what's going on here.
You really think that he's your pet, don't you?
Wrong! He's using you!
You're just his cover.
He's a secret agent!
Here, here, let me prove it.
General Platyborg, come down here at once.
He'll be here in just a second.
All right, Platyborg, you see that platypus?
You know what to do.
Perry!
What was that for? Perry, are you okay?
Told you.
How are his vitals?
Wait, let me try something. Platyborg!
- Do the same thing to those two boys.
- What?
What?
Perry
Perry?
Yes! I knew it!
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Why does their platypus fight so good?
Perry the Platypus!
Really?
What?
Perry?
Get them!
You're a secret agent?
Hey, be careful with that.
So this is where you disappear to every day?
You come here and fight this guy?
No, he fights me.
He doesn't really know this guy.
You fight a pharmacist?
Why would you even do that?
Actually, I'm an evil scientist.
A lot of people are confused by the lab coat.
You're evil? He's evil?
So, not only have you been leading a double life this whole time, but you sat there and let us help an evil scientist open an evil portal into an evil dimension!
And you did nothing to stop us?
Well, he did pee on the couch.
Wait a second, I just realised.
That was a conscious choice.
You peed on my couch!
No, no. That wasn't enough.
That's when you should have put on your little hat.
Not now, after we've gone through it into this mess!
For badness sake, you can hash all this out in prison.
Guards!
Brain freeze!
I'm sorry. I'm just having trouble processing this right now.
"So you've discovered your pet is a secret agent".
I don't want your pamphlet!
He's coming back around!
You have got to be kidding me.
For crying out loud.
What, they didn't teach you how to get out of this in spy school?
Snap.
Look! There's a logo on this parachute!
He's got his own logo?
All this time we're like,
"He's a platypus. He doesn't do much".
Well, apparently you do!
You do... You're...
You're tangled up in the...
Wow! Saved by unconventional architecture.
May I please see your papers?
Show me your papers or be destroyed.
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
Jinx! You owe me a soda.
Get me!
I'm a Georgia O'Keeffe painting!
Fourth and Main.
What? No tip?
Never mind. I'm good.
Looks like they're gone.
You're a secret agent?
And you've been living with us this whole time?
Was that evil guy right?
Were we just a cover story to you?
I mean, were you ever really our pet or part of our family?
Well, apparently not, 'cause you didn't trust us enough to tell us.
Anyone else around here leading a bizarre double life?
Put your hand down, Ferb.
You're a secret agent!
He's a secret agent!
You're right, Ferb. We've got to concentrate on the task at hand.
We've got to get back to our dimension, and I don't even know where to start!
That's right! The remote!
I knew that would come in handy.
All right, let's go home.
Wait, that's not our dimension.
Nope.
Now this thing's broken.
We're gonna need some help.
I know! Let's go find us!
Wait, I just realised, you could have been cleaning your own litter box this whole time!
We are not done with this conversation.
So tell me, other dimension me, what do you see here?
An ordinary platypus.
And now what do you see?
Perry the Platypus!
You know, I'm starting to see why you haven't become ruler in your dimension.
All right, Mr Eviler-Than-Thou, just how did you manage to take over the tri-state area anyway?
Simple, I used an army of big, scary robots.
We should do lunch sometime.
Wow, that is scary.
I tried that robot thing once, too.
I hid the self-destruct button on the bottoms of their feet
so no one could reach them.
And march!
I think I've said enough.
I still don't get it.
If we're the same person, why are you so much better at being evil than me?
True evil is born through pain and loss.
You see, when I was a small boy back in Gimelschtump,
I had a toy train.
Then, one day I lost it.
Choo-Choo?
- That's... That's it?
- What do you mean?
That's your emotionally scarring back-story?
That's your great tragedy?
Dude! I was raised by ocelots.
I mean, literally.
Disowned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats, and you're telling me you lost a toy train? That's all?
That's all you got, really?
I had to work as a lawn gnome!
I was forced to wear hand-me-up girl's clothing!
Neither of my parents showed up for my birth!
Well, how did you feel when you lost that toy train?
I never lost that toy train...
Well, maybe if you had, you'd have done better.
Since you have neglected to take over your tri-state area,
I think I'll go over there and give it a shot myself!
Great! We can be a team!
Yeah, right. A team.
Wait, was that sarcasm?
No!
Yeah! Right there! I'm pretty sure that's my voice when I'm being sarcastic.
Okay, Buford, where are Phineas and Ferb?
How should I know?
They never showed up for me to return serve!
That's considered a forfeit in catapult badminton.
So I went to get some Victory Gum.
A tradition as old as the game itself.
Don't play with me, young man.
Where is the giant platypult they built?
I don't know. Seems to have vanished.
Really? Did you hear that, Stacy?
The mysterious force took the platypult away before I, the grown-up, could see it.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for all of this.
And they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig!
Who's laughing now, Wayne?
The logical explanation is the mysterious force.
The real question is, why does it care so much about my little brothers?
Why doesn't it want them to get busted?
Well, why don't you ask it, Kierkegaard?
What? Existentialist trading cards.
They came with the gum.
Wait, he's right! I should just ask it!
- I'll bet I can reason with it.
- Reason with it?
Candace, it's a force that you made up.
No, I know what I'm talking about, Stacy!
- Come on!
- Where are you going?
To my back yard!
The heart of the mysterious force!
Would you like to trade two Sartre for a Nietzsche?
All right.
Sucker!
Well, this should be our street.
But it sure looks different.
Dad?
Boys, what are you doing here?
You'd better get inside before the Doofbot catches you.
I'm off to the factory. See you next week.
Wow! Well, I guess we'd better get inside.
You might want to...
I mean, these guys might not know that you're not really a... You know.
Boys! I thought you were in your room.
Get inside!
And get your dooferalls back on before someone sees you.
If you need me,
I'll be hiding in the basement.
That was weird.
Let's find the other us's.
And... Hey, I got a one!
Pick a Doofopoly instruction card!
"Conform". I can do that.
Hi, guys.
No! They're replacing us!
I must not have conformed quick enough.
No, no, it's not like that.
We're you guys from another dimension.
- Different dimension? Is that allowed?
- Apparently.
Look! Perry's back!
Where have you been?
We've missed you so much.
Phineas, he's not your Perry.
He came with us.
Sorry.
Wait, can I hold him a little longer?
It's just that, well, he left one day and never came back.
He's been gone for a long time, and I'm really worried.
All right, you know the only time we're allowed to make noise is on Doofens Day.
So keep it...
Are there four of you in this room?
Five, counting Perry.
I see nothing.
I have plausible deniability.
Boy, your Candace is much less curious about what you're up to.
What do you mean?
Well, it seems like our Candace has spent her entire summer focused on what we're doing.
Summer? I think that was outlawed a long time ago.
You guys don't have summer?
Well, that's... That's terrible.
Summer. It sounds dangerous yet oddly compelling. What is it?
What is summer?
Man, where do I begin?
The days are longer
The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
It's noticeably warmer
Summer
Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold
Summer
It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda
Dripping down your chin
It's summer! Man, where do we begin
Summer
It's ponds and pools and garden hoses
Trying to beat the heat
Summer
Bicycles and roller skates
And even just bare feet
It's also surfing tidal waves
Creating nano-bots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird
Painting a continent
Or driving our sister in...
Wait, maybe we're going too fast.
Summer
It's crickets and cicadas
And a glass of lemonade
Summer
It's sitting with your brother
In the back yard
Under the shade of a big tree
That's what it means to me
The days are longer
The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
It's noticeably warmer
Summer
Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold
Summer
It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
It's summer
Man, where do we begin
Wow. Summer sounds like a blast.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
Like this summer for instance.
We built a rollercoaster, we became one-hit wonders, we travelled through time...
This is a message for other dimension Perry the Platypus.
If you turn yourself in,
I promise not to hurt your little friends.
If you don't, all bets are off.
And then we launched ourselves from a giant Perry the Platypult and...
You are kidding me.
You're actually sneaking away again?
So nothing's changed.
Did it ever occur to you that we could help you?
That we could have made a great team?
But I guess you can't have teamwork without trust.
You don't have to sneak away any more.
We know your secret. You can just go.
I walk away from you, my friend
I hope that this is not the end
Of all the times we figured out
How to seize the day
As I walk away
You know, I used to think you couldn't spell "platypus" without "us".
Well, you can.
But it would just be "platyp".
Well, I guess if you guys can't help us fix the remote, we could check with Isabella.
Who is Isabella?
The girl who lives across the street.
Mom says that talking to neighbours can be dangerous.
- It's true!
- Well, it's time you met her.
Come on, you'll like her.
What about the Normbots?
Relax! We've been avoiding them all day.
If you're really careful, you can...
Okay, we've got to be more careful than that.
May I please see your identification?
Display your travel papers or be destroyed.
Display your travel...
I can't stand these things.
- Hey! It's Buford.
- Who are you guys?
We're Candace's brothers.
We're going to Isabella's.
Are you part of the Resistance?
I used to be in the Resistance, but I got so good at it that I started resisting them.
Behold, the Other-Dimensionator!
Actually, this is the other Other-Dimensionator.
The Other-Dimensionator is back in the other dimension.
Okay, step one is, push this button.
Step two, stand back in awe!
That's it?
Now that I think about it, those two boys made some modifications to my design which may have allowed it to...
You know...
- To work.
- Great, now I need those two boys?
- Perry the Platypus!
- Perry the Platypus!
Jinx! You owe me two sodas!
Listen, Perry the Platypus,
I know I told you if you turned yourself in
I wouldn't hurt your friends, but change of plans!
Now I need to hunt them down which might involve a little hurting.
I know that makes me a liar, but hello! Evil!
Come on,
Isabella's house is right through...
What you doing?
Isabella?
- Do I know you?
- Hey, Isabella!
Him I know. Buford, what do you want?
I thought you were resisting us?
I was helping Candace's brothers cross the street.
Candace has two sets of twin brothers?
No, he and I are from another dimension.
We're trying to get back.
All right, girls, release them.
Why would you want to come to this dimension, anyway?
Well, we didn't mean to come here.
Now we can't get back unless we can fix this device.
Well, we may have someone who can help you. Dr Baljeet.
- Baljeet!
- That's Dr Baljeet to you!
Were you not listening?
Here is the crux of your problem.
Think of the universe and all of the many dimensions as circular.
The energy flows between the dimensions like this, clockwise.
Say this is your dimension and this is our dimension.
You travelled with the flow of energy.
So going clockwise would be easy!
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy, overloading the local power grid.
I have prepared a little song to help illustrate my point.
If you travel through dimensions
Going clockwise makes it easy
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy
overloading the local power grid
I know, it needs a chorus.
Anyway, without the 8 million gigawatts, you would have to go clockwise, the long way around.
Theoretically, you would get home but there is no telling how many dimensions you would have to go through.
Well, do you think you can help us get enough power to open the window backwards so we can get home?
Well, we should probably ask our leader.
Ask your leader what?
Who made the topiary out of wild parsnips?
I'm allergic, and it's messing up my voice.
Candace, you're the leader of the resistance?
What are you two doing here?
Never mind, I'll deal with you later.
You two,
I've been spending all these years trying to keep my brothers safe and suddenly their faces are all over the Doofen Channel.
We're just trying to get home.
Well, what's stopping you?
- Right now? Quantum physics.
- Baljeet.
We need to generate
8 million gigawatts for inter-dimensional travel.
Then we've got work to do.
- Isabella, start redirecting the power.
- Aye aye!
Gretchen! Monitor the Doofen Channel.
Make sure we're not raising any alarms.
- I'm on it.
- Buford, keep resisting.
- No!
- Excellent.
And will somebody get rid of that topiary!
Thank you.
Great and powerful mysterious force!
I know you are just trying to protect my brothers but I am simply trying to protect them, too, from their dangerous inventions.
Show yourself so that
I may reason with you!
Maybe we should build a shrine to it?
Candace, that's...
- It's a mysterious force!
- It's a mysterious force!
Ferb! I think we got it!
It looks like home!
What do we do now?
I don't know.
I can't believe it actually worked.
Well, thanks, everyone. Hey, where's...
That's right.
This just in. Our supreme leader has announced the capture
of public enemy number one, Perry the Alternate-Dimension Platypus.
I guess we won't be seeing him any more except as a platyborg.
It's 3:30.
We now conclude our broadcast day.
Now go to bed!
- We've got to save him!
- No.
Too risky. You've got to get back to your dimension.
We're not going anywhere without our platypus.
I thought you told us he was just using you as a cover.
I know what I said. I was hurt.
But even if it was all an act, he's still a part of the family, and we're not leaving him behind.
I may never be able to open this again.
It doesn't matter.
We're going back for him.
- Well, then you're on your own.
- Fine.
Just tell us where
Doofenshmirtz keeps his prisoners.
- We have to help them!
- No, we don't.
Yes, we do. Remember how we felt when our Perry disappeared?
Oh, criminy, I must be crazy.
All right, we can get there through the tunnels.
- Yes!
- Let's suit up, people!
You know what, Stacy?
I'm tired of the mysterious force pushing me around.
- I'm going to show it who's boss.
- Candace, wait!
I will try to keep it open for as long as possible but the window is very unstable.
Even the slightest disturbance will cause it to collapse.
- Like that, for instance.
- Hey, Candace.
You guys are so...
Wait, why are there four of you?
Oh, these guys are from this dimension.
Are we inside the mysterious force?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
And why is Isabella suddenly fashionable?
What do you mean, "suddenly"?
Seriously, where are we?
Candace, I'm sure you have a million questions, but right now we have to save Perry from being turned into a cyborg.
- What?
- We'll explain on the way.
So, how do I dress in your dimension?
Hey, is that me? I look good!
Oh, no. You two stay here.
- But we want to help.
- That's an order!
Wait, so in this dimension,
Perry is a secret agent?
No, in this dimension he's a cyborg.
So, where is he an agent?
That would be in our dimension.
But we're not in our dimension now.
Okay, I'm having trouble processing this.
Now I wish I hadn't thrown away that pamphlet.
And why are we in mine cars?
This'll take us as far as the underground entrance to Doof's headquarters.
From there we go up the ventilation shaft.
The detainment centre is on level four.
And the snack bar's on level five!
If there's time.
Buford.
I'm just gonna get some nachos.
So, if there's another me and another them, then there must also be a Jeremy Johnson here, too, right?
Oh, yeah, Johnson, Jeremy.
Leads a three-man strike team on the north side. Good soldier.
Good soldier?
That's all you think of him?
Don't you think he's dreamy or cool or even cute?
Tell me at least you think he's cute.
Cute doesn't win the war, kid.
Well, I guess.
But what do you guys do around here for, you know, fun?
Look, "Candace" is it?
No offence, but fun isn't really on my agenda.
You know, since Doofenshmirtz took over the tri-state area, even though I was a little girl,
I've been focused on one thing and one thing only.
- He's going down, down, down.
- Down, down, down, I know.
But what about BFF's?
Or slumber parties?
Or busting your little brothers?
Busting my brothers?
I spent every day of my life trying to protect my little brothers.
I had to grow up pretty quick around here to make sure they didn't have to.
Gee, you make growing up sound like it's a bad thing.
It is what it is. I'll do whatever it takes to protect the ones I love.
Thanks, sis!
What are you guys doing here?
- We're here to help.
- Sir, we're nearing the target!
Don't move!
Okay, people, change of plans.
This is as far as we go.
We're not going to help them?
No, we're gonna get you two home where it's safe.
- But we wanna...
- Look, this isn't our fight.
It's their fight, and you two shouldn't have gotten involved.
Maybe none of us should have.
Now we're out of here.
I don't remember it being so dark down here.
- Dark?
- That's because it's a trap!
And if it was light, you would have seen us and run away, hence ruining the trap!
I think they get that.
Perry!
We... We, well, came to rescue you.
So far it's not going as well as we'd hoped.
We didn't have a lot of time to, you know, plan something elaborate, but I guess we could have created some sort of diversion just in case...
Yeah, we could have thought this out more.
I got you and I got your little friends, too!
Game over! You lose! I win!
Mark this the hour of your doom,
Perry the Platypus.
Three forty... I got one of these watches with just the little hash marks.
It doesn't even have the numbers on it.
Let's just say it's between 3:30 and 4:00,
Eastern Standard Time.
Whoa!
I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!
They're getting away!
I knew this was a bad idea.
All right, everyone in the cars!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Isabella, start the motor!
Yes, sir.
I got it.
You two, keep your heads down and remember your training!
We never had any training!
Well, keep your heads down!
Consider yourself trained.
This is going to be close.
All right, you rust buckets. Let's dance.
Can you do that?
Well, apparently.
I am so in love with her right now.
- What?
- Nothing.
If we can get to the north tunnel before they get to us,
I can trip the security door.
Isabella, can you give us more throttle?
It's all the way in, sir!
All right, hang tough.
This is going to get hairy.
Can we make those turns at this speed?
Well, we're about to find out.
There it is. We should be okay if we can hold off these...
- Can we do that?
- No. Keep your head down.
We're slowing down, sir!
Keep it on the floor!
It's on the floor.
There's too much track, sir.
I don't think we're going to make it!
Everyone, to the front now!
We're going to have to cut loose these...
The motor's overheating!
Sorry, guys. You're on your own.
What are you doing?
My job. Protecting you two.
We've got to go back and help them.
That's not our fight.
But you just abandoned them!
We could have made it!
We could have all made it!
Or we could have all been captured, and I wasn't going to take that chance.
These are the tough choices, people.
Somebody's got to be the adult here.
You two are safe, and that's what's important.
- But... But... But...
- End of discussion.
Man, I had my heart set on those nachos.
Look, mysterious force,
I feel a little awkward talking to you since I didn't believe in you at first because, you know, it's crazy.
But then I saw you eat my friend, so I've made a little shrine here.
It's nice.
There's a banana and Mr Miggins.
So I hope this makes up for the whole disbelief thing.
Are we... Are we good?
Now you have no choice but to fix my machine.
- No.
- That's not one of your choices.
- Fix the machine!
- No.
Can I... Can I say something?
So, I think I'm up-to-date on the whole Perry Agent thing.
Strangely, that's the most normal thing that's happened this afternoon, but who exactly is this guy?
- Fix it!
- No.
Look, I would make myself do it but apparently he's an idiot.
- Hey!
- Fix the machine!
- No.
- All right, then, you've forced my hand.
Fix the machine!
- No.
- Really?
When I was your age, I did anything a puppet told me to do.
How old do you think we are?
I don't know. One, two?
You know, it's hard to tell with the one eye.
Anyway, I don't know why you're being so uncooperative.
All I'm asking you to do is make my machine work so I can invade and conquer your world and enslave your loved ones.
See, that's just it.
Why would we do something that would lead to our own self-destruction?
Self-destruction?
Self-destruct... Wait a...
Wait, that's it. I remember now.
They took out my self-destruct button.
I don't know why I put it back in, but here.
I'll just rewire this, like so, and there.
It's working! It's working!
It's functioning properly!
Well, look who just became redundant.
Send them to their doom!
Yes, her, too.
Yes, yes, everyone.
- Doom, doom, doom and doom.
- Doom!
Jinx! You owe me three sodas.
Okay, doom for him, too.
What? But I'm you!
Doom!
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time
I was doomed by a puppet,
I'd have two nickels.
Which isn't a lot. But it's weird that it happened twice, right?
Welcome, doomed guests.
Come on, keep trudging.
Doom is thataway.
I would say, so far, adulthood gets about a three.
You know, this may be as good as it gets.
And now for my all-time favourite game.
Poke the Goozim with a stick.
Surrounded by lava.
My second favourite game is backgammon. Love it!
Hold the phone. I could be useful.
What if you need a kidney or a stand-in for boring functions you have to attend?
Or another kidney?
Doom!
Pooh.
Cranky, cranky, cranky.
Oh, I love the crank!
I'll be honest, Ferb.
I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this.
Blah, blah, blah, two-car garage, etcetera.
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life!
Whoa, deja vu-ish.
Perry, check out that guard!
Keys!
Cool! Look out!
Is this the plan?
Tell me this isn't the plan!
You are tampering with the property of...
Let's make omelettes!
Can you get a little more lift out of this thing?
I think I just bruised a kidney.
My bicycle is missing!
Yes! Go, Goozim!
- It's muffin time, sir.
- Already?
Okay, I see where you're going with this...
I officially prefer our dimension!
This may not be the best time to tell you, but I actually flunked jungle gym in grade school.
I just couldn't get the hang of all the climbing...
Oh, great, you caught it! Unlock me!
Are you even paying attention?
That's right. It can wait. Later!
More guards!
- It's muffin time, sir!
- You're broken!
Yay, other dimension Candace!
Phineas!
Catch!
The remote!
Perry, let go!
What? No, no, don't let go.
Perry! Trust me!
Two words! La-va!
Trust me!
They opened another portal!
Go after them!
And her!
That banshee screaming girl.
Get her, too!
Thanks, Perry the Platypus.
Stop where you are. You cannot leave.
I use aggression to mask my insecurities!
The portal!
Boy, I could go for a lemonade.
The portal closed, sir.
Oh, pooh.
Oh, well. Time to start the invasion!
And somebody get me a muffin!
But it's not muffin time, sir!
All right, follow me.
We're going around clockwise.
If there's no hospitality
Just get out of town
You can't be lying on formality
And saying...
I guess I'll see you around
You've got no obligations
Nothing holding you down
Find a new situation
And say
I guess I'll see you around
You've got no time to waste on sentimentality
Get out and find yourself a brand-new reality
You've got to find yourself a brand-new reality
A particle duality
A new dimensionality
- Yeah, yeah!
- I guess I'll see you around
Sometimes it's appropriate
To stop for a snack
If you do then I hope you get back
I guess I'll see you around
Hopping clockwise through dimensions
Is a dangerous thing
But it seems to help a lot if we sing
And we can sing about
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
I guess I'll see you around
A brand new reality
A brand new reality
A brand-brand-brand-brand
I guess I'll see you around
All right, how about two Kafkas for your Dostoyevsky?
Stop wasting my time, Buford.
Wait, I think this is it.
- Where have you guys been?
- This is it!
I spy with my one little eye a new tri-state area that's one dictator short of a dictatorship.
Well, that's all about to change.
Pretty soon I'll be ruling over two tri-state areas, a virtual six-state area!
Fly, fly, my Normbots!
We've got some oppressing to do!
Why is Perry wearing a hat?
We don't have time to explain.
We've got to try and stop an evil...
It's too late!
They're never going to fire her and...
Hey, did you see that?
No, I... What's going on?
Oh, my!
- What is it?
- It's a comb over!
I know, I should really just shave it.
Not happening. Not happening.
My watermelon!
All vehicles must stop.
It's okay! It's a rental!
Oh, great!
Albuquerque '93 all over again.
I wish other-dimension
Candace was here.
She took out, like, 30 of them
- with a giant stone lawn gnome.
- Agent P! Our agents are being
overwhelmed by the sheer number of robots coming into our dimension.
You must get to Doof's headquarters and stop him.
Aye, aye, sir. We're ready to serve.
Oh, no. You kids need to go home where it's safe.
With all due respect, sir, we've been through quite a lot together.
We're a team now.
Nope, far too dangerous.
And besides, our insurance won't cover it.
Tell them, Agent P.
Come on, Perry.
Let's go kick some robot chassis!
Perry?
Wow, I guess we're going home then.
Hey, where's Dr D?
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Thompson? It's me, Heinz.
I think I left my keys in the other dimension.
Can you buzz me in?
- Who is this?
- Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Your neighbour.
For, like, 12 years.
- Who?
- I live in the penthouse.
I wear lab coats a lot.
I speak with the accent
I am currently speaking to you with.
Just like my neighbour upstairs.
Yes, exactly!
He's not home.
You'll have to come back later.
No, no, wait.
This is just beautiful.
I decide to do the right thing, and I end up in a cell.
Well, at least my brothers are safe.
What lesson am I supposed to be learning here?
I'm Jeremy Johnson.
I'm here to rescue you.
Johnson, Jeremy?
Yes, sir.
And I picked up a couple new recruits.
We found a way to bypass the entire security grid. It was cool.
What? You brought my little brothers?
Are you out of your mind, soldier?
I didn't know they were your brothers, but I should have known.
They're smart and courageous, just like you.
You think I'm smart and courageous?
Well, yeah, sir.
Good work, soldier.
We should really get out of here while we can.
Most of the Normbots are away in the other dimension.
We can slip away pretty easily.
The Normbots are in the other dimension?
This isn't the time to escape.
This is the time to make our move.
Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
Boys, wait. Thanks for rescuing me.
I'm really proud of you both.
And we're proud of you, too, sir.
I got nachos! Who wants some?
Nobody?
Mysterious force, you can see I'm really trying here.
Please bring back Candace!
Oh, hi, Stacy.
And I also want a car.
I still can't believe
Perry wanted us to go home.
I mean, look at this.
There's robots all over the tri-state area. And now for the weather.
There's robots, Phil! Robots!
You'd think he'd need all the help he could get...
Hey, what's that?
Ferb, do you hear that?
It's Perry's locket.
It's like a homing device.
Shall we?
This must be Perry's lair.
Welcome, Phineas and Ferb.
Please insert the key.
Do you have a key?
Please insert the key.
Good try.
Please insert the key.
Please insert the key.
That's odd. It's a shaped keyhole.
It kind of looks like...
Wait a minute.
Phineas and Ferb, this message is top secret, for your ears only.
If you are hearing this, the tri-state area is at emergency alert level Alpha Red.
Agent P needs your help.
How does he know we'll know what to do?
He knows you will know what to do.
He also knows you two are the only ones capable of helping him
because you two are the only ones capable of creating these.
Auto-scan replication initiated.
Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today.
You have a new leader.
Put on your dooferalls. 36-inch waist.
No way! I'm a 34!
So, I guess you trusted us after all.
I was wrong. It was not for me!
Heads up!
Platyposterior coming through!
Now this is what I call busting.
All right, everyone!
Let's kick some robot chassis!
Yeah!
All right, that is very good.
Phineas! Anything we can do?
Yeah! Musical accompaniment!
We're gonna kick some robot chassis
So you better tell your robot nation
To say a robot prayer
'Cause you better prepare
For an automaton annihilation
You think you're gonna take us down
Well, mechanical man, you just try it
You're gonna ride that rail out of town
This is a robot riot
I think you know what I mean
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you down
And sell you for scrap metal
But I'll keep enough
To build myself a trampoline
'Cause your momma was a blender
And your dad was just a washing machine
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to a chop shop downtown
You know that you'll be dreading
This android Armageddon
I think you better check your fluids
'Cause I know you're sweating
You know you're gonna lose
And sing the robot blues
You'll blow a fuse
And take a robot snooze
I will deactivate you
Because I kind of hate you
Don't want to beat around the bush
- We're gonna decimate you
- This is a robot riot
Oh, man, it's on
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna rip you up
And put you back together
In a new configuration
Just to mow my lawn
'Cause your sister is a fridge
And you know her light is always on
This is a robot riot
Robot riot...
We've got to do something about that portal.
Ferb! We're gonna go try to close the portal!
This is a robot riot
I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to the chop shop downtown
I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down
I'm gonna take you to the chop shop downtown
What?
I've had just about enough of you, you...
What is on this!
I was wrong, Stacy, about everything.
I'm not a grown-up.
I can't control mysterious forces.
I can't even get my mom to see what my brothers are doing!
Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom to see what my brothers are doing!
Candace, where are you going?
I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom!
And I'm gonna fail!
No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
You borrowed sugar from me this morning.
I don't have any sugar.
I had to borrow some from my neighbour this morning.
Yeah. That's me!
He's a nice man, but I hear he's divorced.
That she remembers.
Mom!
Candace, what are you doing here?
You got to come outside and bust the boys!
I'm not leaving now.
The girl is about to forgive the guy for the cliché misunderstanding.
Well, after she battles these robots.
This 3-D is amazing!
Ferb, we'll handle it down here.
Go help Phineas!
Come on, you stupid thing. Work!
So that dish must be what's controlling the robots.
Maybe I don't need to close the portal if I could just take out that...
Yeah!
No, you don't.
Now the baseball is on the other foot.
Or however that saying goes, I'm not...
I'm not really sure.
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?
You know, all that's going to happen from you guys coming up here is that I'm going to have a brand-new platyborg.
And maybe even a boyborg!
Try saying that five times fast.
Boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg...
I guess it's not that hard, never mind.
You know something, kid?
You've been a thorn in my side all day long.
But that's about to change right now!
No!
My babies! No, what have you done?
It's weird that
Perry's a secret agent, huh?
Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect.
Has anyone seen my pants?
Yeah, they're over there.
Wolverines!
Mom, if you care one iota about me, your family, and your city, you'll come outside with me right now!
Well, I guess I could use some more popcorn.
Great! Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Ferb! Bro, I just hit the best home run ever!
Now, tremble before me!
No, I'm down here.
See, one last trick up my sleeve.
It's me! I'm the trick up my own sleeves,
'cause I'm in the sleeve, get it?
Pearls before swine.
Hope you got your 3-D glasses
'cause I'm coming at you!
Yeah!
Hey!
What? I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
I got a little something just for you.
Here.
Choo-Choo!
Yeah, it's mine.
See, I told you I never lost it.
It was in a box in my pantry labelled
"VHS tapes".
Go figure. Anyway, you can have it.
I can't believe it! Choo-Choo, it is you!
Heart melting, back-story resolving, evilness diminishing.
It's the least I can do.
You know, I don't even know what I was thinking with the whole evil robots thing.
Actually, when I look around,
I'm really embarrassed.
Let me clean this up.
Look! Self-destruct button.
You.
Yeah. Here we go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, hurry, hurry!
Do I even need to say
"there's nothing there" any more?
Mom, you can say it all you want.
There's nothing there!
Whoo-hoo! I did it, I saved the world!
You can go back to your movie now.
Yeah, you know what?
We're totally cool now.
I'm just gonna go return to my home and live out the rest of my days with my Choo-Choo. Okay then, ciao!
Home. It's good to be...
Book him, ladies.
You know, my crimes against humanity had just completely slipped my mind.
Hey! Did you guys just see that?
I saved Danville!
Good job, soldier.
So what'll you do now?
Wow, I haven't thought of anything but busting Doofenshmirtz for years.
- I don't know.
- Well, I know what interests I'd pursue.
Hey! Here you all are.
I'll take that under consideration.
What about you, Candace?
You know, after all of this,
I'm gonna give myself a little more time to be young.
It's not such a bad place to be.
You know what? Me, too.
Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for telling us all about summer, you know, opening our horizons, and teaching Ferb classical guitar.
Hey! It's our Perry! Perry!
Looks like the evil was fried right out of him.
Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.
Are you kidding?
That makes him extra cool!
Thanks so much, guys.
I'm glad we could help.
Man, this has been the greatest day ever.
Imagine how much fun we can have together now that we know you're a secret agent.
Yes, yes, the next 15 minutes should be a real hoot.
Well, then, of course,
Agent P will be sent away forever.
- What?
- You didn't know?
- Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
- We threw it away.
- Does anyone read those things?
- I tried to warn you, sir.
Kids, I'm sorry but now that
Agent P's cover has been blown, you won't be allowed to see him any more.
That's why you didn't want us to know your secret.
So we'll never see Perry again?
There has to be another way.
Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe.
You know too much.
Now I never wished so much that I could unknow something.
Sir, maybe there is a way.
What about
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Amnesianator?
I never built an Amnesianator.
I think I'd remember building something like that.
Well, that might work.
But you'd all have to agree.
So our choice is to either forget the best day ever, forget the biggest adventure we've ever had, and forget meeting Agent P, or remember today, but never see Perry again?
Well, we've had a lot of great days.
But we only have one Perry.
Agreed.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right, everybody.
Tall kids in the back.
Just need to do a little more programming here and we'll be ready to roll.
Hey, buddy, Ferb and I just wanted to say our goodbyes.
You know, we thought we'd finally met the real you when we found out you were Agent P, but the fact is, pet, secret agent, they're both the real you.
You are now and always have been a great pet and a great friend.
We're gonna miss you, Agent P.
I love you, pal.
Sir, are you crying?
No, I'm sweating through my eyes.
Okay, sir. We're ready.
Okay, Karl. We're set.
- Major Monogram?
- Yes?
So none of us will remember any of today?
That's right.
Good!
Isabella!
- Hit it, Karl!
- Wait! Wait, wait!
WOMAN: Hey, ass bag! Give me another!
Listen, you've run up quite a tab over the last few weeks.
-Why don't you say...
-Another shot, goddamnit!
Hmm. Oh!
"Come to the booth in the back.
Act casual, fat ass!"
Who the hell is that?
Please, don't cause any more trouble around here, Miss...
All right, lady. l don't know who you think you are, but l...
You've been busy.
Foxxy.
What the hell are you doing here?
We can't be seen together!
You'll get us killed!
Toot, you've got to come with me.
You're not safe here anymore, fatty.
What the hell do you care?
You're the reason we're in this mess, Foxxy. lf that's even your real name.
Of course it's my real name.
You don't know that!
You don't know anything. l know this. l deserved that.
You deserve to die.
Toot, l can't change the past, but l can change the future. l met somebody who could help us get our lives back!
Oh, yeah? Well, l've met someone, too. l've met a man who loves me for me, a man who's willing to cheat on his wife because he's a closeted homosexual who thinks l'm a man!
A man who refers to my vagina as a manhole.
Toot, Clara's dead!
Clara? She... She's...
Dead, yes. l sorry.
Oh, my God! l can't believe it!
She was so... So...
Now which one was Clara again?
She wasn't that little fugly battle monster thing, was she?
No, the princess.
How'd she die?
The same way we all gonna die! l.S.R.A.E.L. ! l.S.R.A.E.L.?
That's why you need to come with me before it's too...
Your location's been compromised!
Get out of there now!
-We gots to go!
-Forget it, Foxxy. l'm not... Aah!
Goddamnit! They followed you here!
Head towards the back of the bar!
Take a right! Go up the stairs!
What now, Wooldoor?
Oh, is that Wooldoor? Tell him l said hi!
Oh, hey, Toot how you doin'? Go straight!
Straight? But we on the roof!
Just do it!
Wait, what are you doing?
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!
The key's got to be here somewhere.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
We're gonna die!
Got 'em! Let's go!
Ah, we made it.
Hey, Toot, baby. Where you goin'...
Aah! Ooh!
Stop, stop! That's the man l love!
We can't! There's no time!
Barney!
Huzzah!
Hey, hey, hey.
Great googly moogly!
Whee!
Don't make me suck your dick!
Guys, you suck. l love racism!
A Jew in our backyard!
Ooh, l like that bitch!
Flavor flav!
Up the butt?
Goddamnit! l cut myself!
Surprise!
My special move is the reach around!
Ahh. Good morning, people and Foxxy. lt's a lovely day to be on a reality show.
And it's a great day to deny wetting the bed.
Which l did not do!
Ooh, it's also the perfect day to stay in bed and snuggle all day!
Hey, we should have another piñata party tonight!
But, uh, this time we should get a real piñata.
Guys, there really is nothing better than being on a reality television show!
Nothing!
-Attention, housemates.
-Ooh.
This is the Jew Producer speaking.
Please report to the living room for the next competition.
Competition? Ooh!
Wait up, guys, l'm almost ready.
Now l'm ready. Whee!
Good morning, housemates.
Today's competition is pretty self-explanatory. lt is?
Put on the heels, step on the puppies and kittens, and the person who crushes the most by the time l come wins the coveted, uh, l don't know, let's say, uh, immunity from next week's final judgment ceremony night?
Jew Producer, this competition is ridiculous. lt almost sounds made up.
That's why you're going to lose. Suck it!
And go! l thought l had a good chance to win. l made more bloody fur than menstruation time at Mount Holyoke.
And it's time!
Ooh! That felt good.
Ehh!
Oh, yeah. You guys did an excellent job.
Oh, oh!
Wait, Jew Producer.
You didn't even tell us who won.
Oh. Um, the winner is, uh, who hasn't won in a while?
Let's say that guy in shorts there.
Congrats. Here's your immunity, uh, scented candle.
Booya! You can all suck it, bitches.
That's right, number one, numero uno.
Something didn't sit well with the Foxxy. l mean, lately, all the competitions was about us doing some kind of bull crap so the Jew Producer could get his Jew-y rocks off. l can't be the only one who thinks these competitions is completely random and arbitrary.
Something ain't right here.
The Foxxy smells herself a mystery.
-What's so funny?
-Come on, Foxxy. lt's time to give up trying to redeem yourself.
Yeah. For weeks, you've been trying to make up for botching that mystery at the amusement park.
Mr. Wilkinson here denies being a super villain.
But let me ask you this, if you ain't not a super villain, then why would you need a bulletproof face?
Oh, Henry!
Hang in there, Henry.
Don't give up on me, you hear?
Don't you give up on me. lt's not your time yet.
You're a fighter, damn it!
Now fight, fight!
Damn! l was 40% sure he had one of them bulletproof faces.
Foxxy Love, you're the worst mystery-solving musician that's ever lived!
Yeah. The only case you ever cracked was the display case at Zales.
Oh, oh, l got one.
Foxxy, the only thing you're good at is giving head, and you managed to do the opposite!
Oh, yeah, good one, Wooldoor!
You, too, Wooldoor?
Oh...
Hey, champ. l'm sorry about what l said before. l was just trying to fit in.
Nah, Wooldoor, you was right about me. l ain't no good at mystery solving.
That's not true.
You're the bestest mystery-solving musician in the whole wide world! l don't...
Shut the hell up.
Foxxy, l brought you a special someone that l think will really cheer you up!
Papa?
You can come in now!
-Mrs. Wilkins?
Aah!
Get her off! Get her off!
Silly Foxxy. Mrs. Wilkins is post-menopausal. lt's impossible to get her off.
You'll pay for what you've done! Damn you!
What the hell is wrong with you, wooddork?
There is no good explanation for what l've done.
You are clearly out your fuckin' mind! l'm sorry. l really...
-Did you hear that?
-What?
You out your fuckin' mind! l said "Fuck," and they didn't beep it!
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
What about "Shit"?
What about "Cunt"?
What about "Shitcunt"?
No beeps!
They ain't beeping the curse words!
Go on, try it! Say something!
Ok. Uh, schwartza. Mud baby.
Smoked lrishmen. lnk face!
Nah, dummy, they never censor racism. l'm talking about words like shitcunt.
Ooh. l could never say that.
Those are bad words.
Ooh, if they ain't beeping, maybe they ain't blurring nothing.
Quick, fool, whip it out!
-What?
-Show me your cock. l thought you'd never ask.
Whee!
Oh, Wooldoor, you've been holding out on me!
Whoa! l've actually never seen my penis unblurred before. lt's way blacker than l thought it would be.
You know what this means? l was right!
There is a mystery to be solved.
And l's gonna solve it.
Thanks, Wooldoor.
So, little fella, let's go get you a burger.
Whee!
All right, ante up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.
Wait, Spanky!
We can't start guys' night without Hero.
Well, if l had some mystery hottie, l wouldn't be hanging around with you schmendricks, either.
Our special guy time is far more important to Hero than being with some cheap floozy who probably doesn't even secretly eat his toenail clippings, so at least a little part of
Hero can always be inside him.
Never fear! Captain Hero is here!
To play poker with the guys.
Oh! l knew you'd come!
Uh, Hero? ls that a dead girl?
Oh, hey, everybody, this is Molly.
She's my girlfriend.
Molly, is it ok if l call you my girlfriend? l know l probably should have asked you first.
How did we meet, you ask?
Well, it's a tale as old as time.
Molly was being held against her will by the evil legion of immediate family mourners of doom!
Back, you putrid, perverse purveyors of evil!
Captain Hero is here!
What? No, ma'am.
You don't need to repay me.
My reward is your safety.
A hand job, you say?
Well, l guess l do deserve one.
You're different from the others, aren't you?
Huzzah!
Ok, busted. We met on J-Date.
Hero, l can't believe you're doing this to me.
You're turning our guys' night into a guys' nightmare!
How dare you! How dare all of you! lf you can't deal with me being happy, then you're not really my friends!
Come on, Molly, let's get out of here!
And so the Foxxy set off to solve the mystery of why the fuck we wasn't censored no more.
And to prove to these assholes that l was a serious mystery solver.
And then, l made the most shocking discovery of all that explained everything.
Oh, Lordy!
Guys, l solved a mystery.
The only mystery you've ever solved is the mystery of the empty uterus. lf that's true, then how did l found out that the Drawn Together had been canceled?
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c- c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c- c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c- c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-canceled?
-That's ridiculous!
-Girl, you crazy.
-Poppycock!
-Oh, really?
Then why can l say,
"You can all fuck my titties
"with your shit-covered cocks, you come-guzzling faggots!" without being beeped?
Yeah! How the fuck is...
Whoa! l just said, "fuck!"
Fuck! Oh, well, l'll be darned.
Dick-gobbling, blood-soaked, ass-eating turd taster!
Whoo-hoo! This is fun!
Guys, we are not canceled.
This is Foxxy we're dealing with, remember?
The worst mystery solver of all time.
Every time she tries to solve a mystery, someone ends up dead!
Fuck you, Clara.
Don't talk to me like that, Jemima-head. l am a princess.
Oh, yeah? Well, if you a princess, then why you got this chair in your face?
Ta-dow!
We can't be canceled. We just can't.
Can we?
Searching...
Tomorrow, l need you to run downtown and pick up a new pair of horn sharpeners.
Yes, dear.
Hey, after that, Jew Dad, can we play a little catch?
Of course, Jew Son. Gosh, l love you. l don't know what l'd do if anything would happen to you.
Oh, how emotionally invested l am in you staying safe and remaining alive.
As would anyone watching us right now.
-Oh, no.
-Don't you dare answer that.
-lt's shabbat.
-But it's work! lt must be important if the boss is calling today. l don't care if it's Moses himself.
Do not answer that.
Uh, l'll be right back.
Dude, l'm not turning your lights on for you again.
No, my cell phone.
Just hit the green button so l can answer it. l don't see why you don't just answer it yourself. lt's forbidden!
God's going to know you asked me to do it.
-No, he won't.
-Of course he will.
Well, then he'll appreciate my cleverness in getting around his laws.
Now hit send before it goes to voicemail!
Fine. l'll do it.
But first, you need to say you accept
Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
What? Are you insane?
Look, l'm not the one trying to fool the Almighty here.
Now say you accept Jesus Christ, and l'll answer your phone.
Oh, fine! l accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. Happy now?
Yep. Now you can answer your own damn phone.
You're a fucking dick, Eddie!
Hey, boss.
You lied to me, Jew Producer.
What? Uh, no, l would never...
You told me after l canceled
Drawn Together, you erased them!
But l did! l swear!
Then how come the network just got a call from one Foxxy Love asking why no one told them they were canceled?
Busted.
By keeping them alive, you've put us all in great jeopardy.
-Let me explain...
-Too late for that! l am sending a friend of mine to pay them a little visit.
A friend?
Yes! The lntelligent Smart,
Robot Animation Eraser Lady!
Otherwise known as l.S.R.A.E.L. !
She will erase them all, forever!
Please, enjoy the rest of your Sabbath.
Oh, no. This is bad. l need you to start my car, Eddie.
The network keeps transferring me around.
Nobody want to tell me nothing. l can't believe we've been canceled. l thought our ratings were pretty good.
No! No! Without the distraction of the cameras, l'll have nothing to keep me from hearing the voices in my head!
Cut their throats and drink the children's blood, Wooldoor.
Their youth will be your youth.
Oh, Molly, hold me!
Cup the balls.
-l'd cup. lf only he'd ask.
Oh, who the hell took our goddamn timeslot?
The Suck My Taint Show?
Let me info this.
...and taint sucking, starring the loveable, poignant Suck My Taint Girl.
We got canceled for that?
Uh, attention, houseguests.
Tonight's competition is...
Get in my fucking trunk, or l will shoot you!
Yeah, we know we've been canceled.
Shut up, fatty. Now, everyone in my truck.
We're running out of time!
The Jew Producer's right! Toot is fat.
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.
Well, l ain't going nowhere until you tell us why in the hell we was canceled.
Come on, guys.
Have you ever even seen your show? lt's filthy, it's racist, and it has a shocking lack of Dave Chappelle.
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.
Now get in my truck! l'm trying to save you idiots!
Ah, save us from what?
From that! lntelligent Smart
Robot Animation Eraser Lady! l.S.R.A.E.L.? Why the fuck is it on our land when we already live here?
To destroy you all! Now hurry!
Prepare to be erased.
Run!
Holy shit! l.S.R.A.E.L. must kill you all!
Wait, wait, l'm sure we can work something out!
I.S.R.A.E.L. must be aggressive to survive! lt's a common sense policy.
Come on, y'all! To the mystery van!
Molly!
She's still in the living room!
There's nothing you can do for her!
She's dead! l've got to try!
Try
He really is delightfully retarded. l'm going to take that l.S.R.A.E.L. out!
Hold on!
Don't come any closer. l.S.R.A.E.L. has boundary issues.
Kung fu, motherfucker! l've got to try!
Try
Huzzah!
Try
Oh, no! The Drawn Together house, it's... lt's gone!
Oh, thank God you're ok!
Oh, flick my balls.
Faster, Foxxy!
The l.S.R.A.E.L.'s right behind us!
My kingdom is only a couple miles away.
We'll be safe there!
No, you can't go home.
None of you can go home, ever again!
You don't understand.
None of you are who you think you are!
What?
You trying to say l ain't really Foxxy Brown?
What l'm trying to say is you're all fakes!
Cheap knock-offs.
You're all parodies of the real thing created just to be on Drawn Together.
Now that the show's over, the boss wants you all destroyed.
-But why would he want...
-Look out!
Without you, my life really has no meaning.
Where is the Drawn Together gang?
I.S.R.A.E.L. must erase them!
They got away.
Looks like you screwed up, l.S.R.A.E.L.
You're in so much trouble.
You explain to boss what happened. l.S.R.A.E.L. is sick of being blamed for every little fucking thing that goes wrong in the desert.
Aah!
Oh, God. l was so scared. l mean, l wanted to go,
"Whee, wee wee wee," all the way home.
Never trust a Jew producer. l'm obviously a real Disney princess. lf l weren't, why would l be so much better than all of you people and Foxxy?
Maybe that Jew Producer was telling the truth! l mean, Clara, you may look like a Disney princess, but how many Disney princesses have done the things you've done done?
And how many times you seen
Josie and the Pussycats do what l doed?
Now, Foxxy, let's not jump to any conclusions here.
Come on, Captain Hero!
How many real superheroes do you know that bang corpses? l don't know.
Molly, how many superheroes have you been with? ln fact, ain't no real cartoon characters would do any of the things we done doed!
Come to think of it, l don't behave anything like the real Betty Boop.
Ah, please, Toot.
We're trying to have a discussion here!
Yeah, really, Toot.
Don't make this all about you.
This is horrible! We're canceled and fake.
Just like my child support checks.
-Ta!
Oh, yeah, laugh it up, Wooldoor, but l.S.R.A.E.L.'s after us!
No one can hide from l.S.R.A.E.L.
What are we going to do?
You heard the Jew Producer.
They want us dead because we's canceled.
So if we can get Drawn Together back on the air, we can save our asses!
Yeah, right, Foxxy.
How you plan on doing that? l don't know yet.
But we can start with that girl who stole our timeslot.
The Suck My Taint Girl.
She sound like she could help. l am fat.
Well, l'm not fake.
So l'm going back to my kingdom.
You're all welcome to join me.
My father, the king, will keep us safe from l.S.R.A.E.L. l do like being safe.
Molly and l always dreamed of going to Disneyworld.
You said you'd take me to Disneyworld!
Well, like a colostomy bag, l'm on Foxxy's side. l liked being a reality TV star.
Yeah! We need to get our show back.
Otherwise, l'll have to go back to my old gig, exposing myself to children, and that union has the worst health plan!
Fine! Then l guess we are splitting up.
How do we decide who gets the mystery van?
Later, ass bags! l'm sorry, sir. l couldn't let you erase the Drawn Togethergang.
They were my creations, and l... l... l loved them.
For Christ sake, Jew Producer!
They must be destroyed!
Tell me, boss, why do you dislike the Drawn Togethergang so?
Because, they took my family from me.
They did? l've never spoken of this before to anyone, but with l.S.R.A.E.L. by my side, l guess l feel safe.
My beautiful wife was taking our little girl
Sasha to her first day of elementary school.
They were singing something.
Something pure, something innocent.
Little Sasha was young and hadn't yet been burdened with the complexities and ugliness of life.
But then she saw it.
Mommy, Mommy!
What is that chocolate-face girl doing to the princess?
No, no, no, no.
Don't look at it, honey. Close your eyes.
For God sakes, close your eyes!
Mommy! The chocolate girl is eating the princess!
She's eating her face!
Why is she eating her face?
Mommy!
My wife lost control of the car and drove off a cIiff!
They landed in a deadly pit of alligators!
Swimming in a pit of sulfuric acid!
By the time l arrived, there was nothing l could do but get revenge!
Aah!
So, Jew Producer, it's not that l dislike the Drawn Togethergang. lt's that l hate those motherfuckers!
They took my family from me, and l'll be damned if l let them take my media empire!
Oh...kay. But still, l won't help you! l had a feeling you would say that. l.S.R.A.E.L. !
Jew Dad?
Jew Son?
Dad, l.S.R.A.E.L. forcibly removed me from the only home l've ever known!
You will help l.S.R.A.E.L., or you'll feel what it's like when something horrible happens to your child! You hear me?
Or should l speak up?
Ow! Ah!
Ok, ok! l'll find the Drawn Togethergang. l'll help destroy them! l.S.R.A.E.L., l think the Jew Producer will be more helpful now.
Off you go.
Destroy the Drawn Togethergang forever. l.S.R.A.E.L. has gone nuclear.
Oh, it's good to be home.
Hark! Who goes there?
Guards, tis l, your Princess Clara.
You may kiss my feet if you like.
Oh, and once l'm inside, you can execute them.
Wait, what?
Ha, ha! Just kidding.
Do you not know that impersonating a princess is a serious offense, punishable by death?
Do you not know that sucking my dick is a serious offense?
-Punishable by fuck you!
-Huh?
Now let us in at once, or l'll have your children killed.
Yeah, it's good to be home.
Princess! Your Highness.
What the... Who the fuck are you? l am the king!
The king? You are not the king.
My father is the king, which makes me the princess.
Father, l think this peasant has gone mad with the plague!
For everyone knows l am the true princess of the land.
My loyal, filthy subjects, surely you assholes recognize me. lmposter!
Guys? l think the Jew Producer was telling the truth. l think l'm a fake. l think we're all fakes!
Oh, my God. You know what l think?
Duh!
To the dungeon with them!
It ain't where it is and it ain't where it ain't lt's a little stinky thing l call a taint
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?
Why don't you suck my little taint?
It ain't where it was and it taint where it ain't
And it's something they call my stinky taint
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?
Why don't you suck it?
-What the hell is this?
-This is horrible!
She's a little girl who sings about her taint! lt's genius!
-Why don't you suck
-Why don't you suck
Why don't you suck her stinky little taint?
Why don't you suck
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Suck my stinky little taint
-Suck my taint
-Taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Come on and suck my stinky little taint lt's the most beautiful thing l've ever seen!
Don't you see? lt taint corporate greed, and it taint the politicians who have drained our economy. lt's the lack of personal responsibility.
-That is so true.
-l never thought of that before. l normally don't laugh at taint humor, but this is wrapped in such an important message.
Why don't you suck
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Suck my taint
And when did it become a crime to be passionate about your work?
So what if l love the characters l created?
Screw him, right?
And kidnapping my son, whoo, how tacky.
Not to mention clichè!
You don't talk much, do you, l.S.R.A.E.L.?
I.S.R.A.E.L. taIks when l.S.R.A.E.L. has something to say. l'm just trying to pass the time, man.
Listen, l know you're a robot, but don't you have feelings? l mean, isn't it hard to destroy innocent people that have never wronged you?
Everyone's wronged l.S.R.A.E.L.
Really? Wow. lf that's the way you feel, maybe we'd all be better off if you didn't exist. l.S.R.A.E.L. has every right to exist!
Ok, ok, dude, relax.
Don't get so defensive.
I.S.R.A.E.L. need rest.
Here? This is where you want to rest?
This is the single most dangerous place you could be situated!
There are so many other places you could be, l.S.R.A.E.L., that would be safer and would cause less problems!
Why here?
I.S.R.A.E.L. shouIdn't have to Ieave.
Everyone else should leave.
They're the ones who are stupid.
Oy! l.S.R.A.E.L., you are a handful. l'm sorry, Drawn Togethergang.
But l have to save my Jew son.
Oh, l.S.R.A.E.L., l think l know where they are.
Oh, yeah. l haven't seen this many shit-covered rodents since my last colonoscopy.
-Ta!
Oh, it's ok, Clara.
So we're not who we think we are.
-So what, right?
-So what? lf l'm not a princess, then l'm just another beautiful virgin with real C-cups and a super tight ass that continuously vibrates and tastes like wild berries.
Who could ever love someone like that?
Dungeon master, make sure the guillotine is not too far back on the stage. l want the people in the front row to have to wear rain ponchos.
Milord, perhaps you could see it in your heart to let me live here in your kingdom and give me the opportunity to be the real princess l always thought l was.
For l can be just as good as the officially sanctioned princesses in your kingdom.
Allow me.
Yeah, Clara! She's doing it! lt's working!
For fuck's sake, Xandir! l'm trying to impress the goddamn king!
And l can't fucking sing if you keep flapping those dick-sucking lips of yours!
Guards, tomorrow, off with their heads!
No, wait! Please!
Release the king, vile peasant!
Hero! Do something!
Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't see this, baby. l know how you are around blood, and this could easily go that way.
Oh, you totally would not have been into that.
Excuse me, Suck My Taint Girl, we...
Oh, my goodness!
You guys are from Drawn Together!
Uh, l heard you were all erased.
-You know who we are?
-Well, of course l do, silly. l'm, like, the taintest fan of Drawn Together ever. l tain't missed an episode.
Well, good, 'cause we need your help,
Suck My Taint Girl.
We was canceled, and we need to get back on TV.
But of course you were canceled.
You guys were filthy and offensive without ever having a point.
A p-p-p-pa... Pa... Po...
Po... Po... Poi...
Poi... Aah... Poi... Ohh...
Ohh... Ahh... Oint?
Yeah! You know, like social commentary.
Everybody knows that these days, if you want to be raunchy and funny on TV, you need to also be relentlessly preachy.
-Too bad we never had a point.
-Hey. Know what you should do?
You should go to Make-A-Point Land and get yourself a point from the MakeA-Point wizard.
You'll be back on the air in no time!
Really? Because if you're lying, l'll cut you. l'll cut you to the fucking bone.
Ooh! Can you take us to this
Make-A-Point Land, Suck My Taint Girl?
Well, l really shouldn't be seen with you guys, but l could be convinced if you introduced me to the rest of the Drawn Togethergang.
Huh? What do you say? ls it a deal?
No, Molly, you're the cutest.
No, you are!
Watching Hero and his whorish know-it-all girlfriend made me sick. l had to get Hero to break up with Molly so l could have my best friend back.
And l had just the plan.
Got it?
Now, follow my lead, and don't fuck it up.
Uh, Xandir?
Wait, wait. Best friend in Ling...
Oh, God!
Asians are hilarious!
Come on, Ling-Ling.
Ling-Ling into depression go
He blew his chance with Xandir
Xandir only have eyes for Hero
Ling-Ling die alone
What was that, Molly?
You have the perfect escape plan?
We'll be out of here in no time?
Really, Molly? Oh, that's awesome!
When Molly just lies there and does nothing, we'll all be executed in the morning, and Hero will finally realize how lame his dead girlfriend is. l'm so clever!
Oh, l can't stand it!
Well, the guards are coming, Molly.
We can't wait to see your plan in action, can we, guys?
Molly... Come on, do something.
You're embarrassing me in front of all my guy friends.
Oh, maybe they were right about you.
Maybe we should just break...
-Whoa! That prisoner doesn't look so hot!
-She's pale, and that rat is eating her eyeball.
We better do something!
Ooh! Clever, clever.
Psst! That guard outfit makes you look fat. lt does?
Oh, great! Now l'll have to deal with that all night.
Ryan, wait up!
Molly, your plan worked like a charm!
Oh, l'm so happy!
Later on, l'm gonna let you fuck me in the mouth!
-God damn it!
-Now, let's get out of here.
Hey, the prisoners have escaped!
Come on, Clara!
No. l have nothing to live for anymore. l'm not a princess. Now, go. l'll slow them down for you. lt's the only way.
Thanks, Clara. You'll always be a princess to me. Here.
No, you keep them.
They're of no use to me now. l'll treasure them always.
Wait, Xandir, do me one favor.
Live your gay life to the fullest.
-Will do.
-Every day's a gift.
-Gotcha.
-And find that one special person.
Sure thing. Bye!
And hold him close and tell him with all your heart that you can't marry him.
The Bible forbids it. l really gotta go.
Ok. Bye! Don't adopt!
Give me those!
Molly hath saved the day!
Holy fuck, it's l.S.R.A.E.L. !
Uh, hey, guys, how are you?
Uh, l'd get the hell out of here if l were you.
-Huzzah!
So tired. So very, very tired.
Don't you give up, fool horse.
We got to make it to the kingdom to get the rest of our gang so we can all get to Make-A-Point Land.
And then, we still need to find Toot.
This is a joke. We'll never find everyone. l said, we'll never find everyone.
Look! There them are-uh!
And l.S.R.A.E.L. !
Whee...
Are all together again!
Wait. Where's Clara?
Oh, Clara? She's dead.
Oh, no.
-Yeah!
-Oh, good!
-Well, that takes the sting off.
-Her arms were always my favorite part of her.
Ashes to ashes, smurf to smurf. l'm glad you're dead, you bastard! l hope you smurf in hell for what you did to me in front of my kids! l hope you smurf in hell! lt's ok, sweetie.
Our long national nightmare is over.
He can't hurt us anymore.
The important thing is that you survived.
-We all survived.
Say good-bye, Drawn Together!
No!
-I can't see!
-I can't see!
Ugh! Holy crap! l can't open the door. lt's stuck! We gonna drown!
Don't worry, people. l'll get us out.
Yeah, there you are.
Uhh... That wasn't well thought-out.
No! l loved you!
The Drawn Together gang is gone forever.
Ok. We're on our way.
Molly, this may be it for us.
Commentary.
-Commentary?
-Commonary.
They usually have director's commissary on these things.
Let's listen to the commonary.
Maybe they'll tell us how to get out of here. lt's too late. We're all gonna die!
We have to try!
Menu.
Commentary.
Commentary on.
And play!
So, wow.
This movie just keeps on going.
-lt's, uh...
-l hear them!
-lt's a long thing... This movie...
-Help!
-How do we get out of here?
-Shut the fuck up and listen!
Actually might very well be a bad idea, but, um, Dave...
Dave, he needed the money.
Well, Matt...
Matt married into money.
Who the hell would ever want to listen to this? lt used to be money.
Now, nobody has money...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Get to the point!
All right. So now we got, uh, we got the gang, we put them all in this pumpkin.
We put them underwater, and originally, this scene wasn't even in the script at all.
The only reason we did this is 'cause, well, we both thought that I.S.R.A.E.L...
We had to remind the audience that l.S.R.A.E.L. is still chasing after them.
Well, you thought they had to. l remember thinking we didn't really need this whole scene.
We were going with a new production company, and...
But l didn't want to fight with you. l remember being so exhausted, at this point.
My wife was, like, 9 months pregnant, and we were, like, in the middle of moving, right?
You're, like, the first person that ever had a kid.
That's how you act. l actually remember... l'm the first person that ever had a kid and had to argue with you at the same time.
You have got to be shitting me.
How the hell are we going to get them out of this scene?
We don't have any ideas, and l think... l'm pretty sure you're the one who's like,
"Hey, why don't they just suck on Xandir's dick,
"and Xandir's dick's got oxygen,"
'cause you're always like... The first idea is,
"Hey, they can suck each other's dicks!"
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. l think your idea was,
"What if Xandir poos oxygen?"
Oh, no. "What if he farts oxygen, so they have to suck his ass?"
So yours was that much better.
-That's smarter.
-Oh, for the love of God.
This is horrible!
I don't even remember how we got out of this.
Oh, you know what it was?
This is how we come out with a Iot of these scenes. lt's, like, who haven't we used in a while?
Like, Ling-Ling? What if we pull his tail, and he infIates Iike a raft?
-That's fine, that's fine.
-So theyjust do that.
At a certain point, it's just like "whatever."
Ooh, l gots an idea, gang.
Let's use Ling-Ling as an inflatable raft.
So, anyway, l guess if this scene's going to be worth it at all, maybe we should at least see Foxxy's tits.
-I'm in.
-But first, let me take off my shirt.
We made it! Whee!
Nice tits, Foxxy.
Good work, gang.
Now let's go find Toot.
Now, the only one we needed was Toot, so we set off on ourjourney to find her, a journey of excitement and adventure, mystery and mayhem, love and loss, a journey that carried us to far-away lands and taught us so much about what was right here inside us all along.
A journey which would change us all forever.
And then, we found her fat ass.
Foxxy, what the hell are you doing here?
We can't be seen together.
You'll get us killed.
Toot, you got to come with me.
You not safe here anymore, fatty.
You don't know that.
You don't know anything. l know this.
Put on your 3-D glasses now!
3-D glasses not included.
FOXXY: Yeah, girl.
That's what the Foxxy want.
One finger?
Girl, you got to come back when you can at least kick in a big toe.
What are you guys doing? Making out?
Hey, lady, less talky, more threesome action.
Yes! God damn it, l miss Drawn Together.
Hold on. Oh, my God!
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?
Anywhere but the face. l mean, that is really degrading to women. l mean, you could really...
-l deserved that.
-You deserve to die.
Get out ofthere now!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!
Got it! Let's go!
Burn in hell, you fat fucking homewrecking bitch! lt's a living.
Outrageous!
How did you think you were going to get away with this?
A foul-mouthed clone of my daughter.
What if some child actually thought it was her using the word shitcunt? l understand. But we are taking measures.
We are taking measures, too. Ooh!
-What the...
Target has been eliminated.
Just to be on the safe side, erase the whole place.
And get back here when you're done.
There's been a change of plans.
But sir, this is the happiest place on earth. lt was the happiest place on earth.
Erase it aII. lt's a world of laughter
It's a worId of sunshine
After we got Toot back from Bedrock, we immediately brought her to Suck My Taint Girl.
You're all here! Hooray!
Wait. Where's Clara?
And we told Suck My Taint Girl the terribIe news about Clara.
-What?
-She took it pretty hard.
But after a long talk and a respectaful memoryial service,
Suck My Taint Girl agreed to take us to Make-A-Point Land, help us find the Make-A-Point wizard, get our point, and get our show back on the air, hence redeeming myself for getting us all into this mess in the first place.
Uh, why did you say all that?
Sorry, giving confessionals is a hard habit to break.
Well, it seems kind of crazy.
You know what's crazy?
You ass-bags dragging me here.
When my Barney comes for me, you'll all get yours.
This is great and all, but can we get going to Make-A-Point Land before l.S.R.A.E.L. finds us?
Tain't no time like the present.
But remember, there are lots of magical and mysterious creatures in Make-A-Point Land, and they don't take too kindly to those who are disgusting for the sake of being disgusting.
What? l'm sorry. l got distracted.
What were you saying? l was saying it's time we go.
Let's taint the town brown!
Uh, question. Why is your ship plugged into the ass of that animal?
Oh, Mr. Ham. l'm so glad you asked, because you're going to love this.
This ship is powered by... Wait for it...
Poo!
A feces-fueled rocket ship? That's awesome!
Yep. This ship is an ear of corn powered by bull shit because, don't you see, ethanol is bullshit.
Oh, yeah. l get it. l kind of liked it better when it was just a shit-powered rocket.
T-minus 5, 4,
Liftoff.
Well, l gotta hit the head.
Don't go changing while l'm away. l am sick of it just being the 2 of us.
Playing hot potato just sucks without my beloved Hero.
And l love hot potato!
Ling-Ling make sad realization
Xandir's heart is with another if Ling-Ling really loves Xandir like he says he does
He'll help Xandir get back Hero
What? Molly!
You promised me we'd go to prom together! l can't believe you would do this to me!
Later
Guys, it's over between me and Molly.
Oh, there you go. lt's ok.
Cry on my shoulder, darling.
-Hyah!
-Look, Make-A-Point Land!
Where? l can't see it. lt's right over there between
Why-You-So-Bitter-
About-Being-Canceled Land and You-Had-3-Or-4-Seasons,
You-Should-Be-Happy-With-What-You-Got,
Most-Shows-Don't-Even-Get-That Land.
Hold onto my taint, everyone! lt's going to be a rough landing.
Here we are, Make-A-Point Land!
Put on your 3-D glasses now!
3-D glasses not included.
3-D! The technology of the eighties, but it's now!
Whoa! Whoa! lt looks fake.
Let's move quickly, and don't taint any attention to yourselves.
-That's a fetus tornado.
-Huh? A fetus tornado?
Don't you see? People just go round and round when it comes to stem cell research.
Well. Not as funny.
Ray-Ray 2 through 7! Mama love you!
-Cool!
The Pfizersaurus Rex! Don't you see? lf we keep listening to the pharmaceutical companies, one day, we, too, will be extinct.
Not so cool anymore.
Come on, gang. Let's keep moving before we get spotted by floating Tom Brokaw made of semen.
Floating Tom Brokaw made of semen?
What the fuck is his point?
Maybe that the media is dumb and superficial and delicious?
Look! The wizard's palace!
Oh, no! lt's the Giant
Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!
Fee, fi, fo, fums! l smell pointless abominations! l must kill you!
Wait, Giant Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!
Now, l know my Drawn Togetherfriends are stupid, pointless, crude creatures of mediocre comedy.
That's why l brought them here.
To get a point. You can't kill them! l can do anything l want!
Except get the taste of shit out of my mouth.
Hold up, Giant Who
Shits lnto His Own Mouth.
You saying you don't like eating shit? l eat shit all day, every day, 24/7.
Of course l don't like it.
But it's how l was born.
Well, what if we help you?
Then would you let us go?
Mmm-hmm. lf only we had something we could tie to the giant's head to interrupt the flow of poop. lt's working! lt's working!
Amen.
Hallelujah. Your way talking. l... l can't taste shit, for the first time in my whole life!
Thank you! Oh, thank you! l'm finally free! l can eat whatever l want now!
Anything!
That's right, Giant. Anything!
Would you shit in my mouth?
Well, guys, here we are. lmpressive.
Thanks, Suck My Taint Girl.
The Make-A-Point wizard's got to help.
He's just gotta.
Uh, any chance there's a
Wrap-This-Thing-Up-Already wizard in there? l can't believe the MakeA-Point wizard finally gave me my point.
Of course! l represent the duality of goodness and martyrdom and the unencumbered id that is repressed when religion meets sexuality.
And crab.
-Come on.
Let's get ourselves back on the air.
Who has come forth seeking a point, hmm?
Your Majesty, l humbly present to you what's left of the Drawn Togethergang.
Oh, my. You kids have caused quite a bit of trouble.
Honestly, l don't even think a point can help.
You Honor, dis is our only shot. lf we don't get the Drawn Together back on TV, we ain't never gonna be safe.
Please, Mr. Wizard. Without my TV persona, l'm just another 33-year-old schizophrenic drug addict with jaundice and several deformities.
Fine, fine. Sheesh! l'll give you a point. lmpressive.
Well, this is it, y'all.
We's about to get our point, get back on the air, and things can finally get back to the way they was.
Don't you see?
Don't you see? Don't you see?
Wait! Maybe we shouldn't open it.
What the fuck are you talking about, Spanky?
Yeah! Just open it!
This doesn't seem right. l mean, maybe we don't want a point.
Don't you see? lf l can't fart or vomit or fill up an ice tray with the afterbirth of Foxxy's miscarriage and hand them out as ice pops to terminally ill children on my hospital tours without making some kind of point, then maybe it's just not worth it.
And l don't want to let dead chicks fuck me in my mouth for social commentary. l mean, what's wrong with just doing it 'cause it makes me feel good?
And l sure do like getting pregnant for no reason.
You know what? l agree with the pig.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Make-A-Point wizard, l guess we don't want to make-a-point after all.
Maybe that's the point.
Fuck you guys! l need Drawn Together!
Otherwise, l don't exist!
-No, wait! lt's...
-What the...
-Wooldoor!
-What the fuck, wizard? l'm sorry. l had no choice.
They said they'd kill me.
Who would kill you?
Hello there, Drawn Togethergang. lt's a pleasure to finally meet you face to face.
So you the dick that's been trying to kill us.
How the hell did you even know we was coming here?
-l told them.
Suck My Taint Girl?
Roved you?
Drawn Together is the lamest show ever!
Watching it was like watching taint dry.
And if l let you get a point, you might get your timeslot back.
Why the fuck would l do that?
Damn that girl.
Like my lawn after a visit from that klansman with short-term memory loss, we've been double crossed.
-Nice work, honey.
-Thanks, Scott.
-Mmm.
-That's right. Suck my taint.
Damn you, Suck My Taint Girl.
You betrayed us.
And then, you didn't even give us a fair fight.
Sometimes, l don't know if you're an asshole or a pussy, or something in between.
Now, l.S.R.A.E.L., on behalf of my dead wife and daughter from a previous marriage, erase them all!
Don't worry.
Barney will be here any second to save us. l just know it.
At least we're going to die together,
Drawn Together.
Please, l.S.R.A.E.L., l know they're obscene, pointless rip-offs, but l... l... Love them.
-Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.
Move, Jew Producer, or l will destroy you as well.
You can't do this, l.S.R.A.E.L. Don't you see?
Even though everyone hates the Drawn
Togethergang, they have a right to exist.
Surely you understand that, don't you, l.S.R.A.E.L.? l.S.R.A.E.L. doesn't want to destroy. l.S.R.A.E.L. wants to peacefully coexist.
That's all l.S.R.A.E.L. ever wanted.
No wonder everyone hates you, l.S.R.A.E.L.
You're so goddamn aggravating. l said destroy them, you fucking idiot!
That's it! I.S.R.A.E.L. wiII not Iet you bully her around anymore. l.S.R.A.E.L. really is our greatest ally.
That's a bit much. l.S.R.A.E.L.'s going a bit overboard again.
Why in the hell are you laughing?
You're gonna die.
Because of this. l have enough e-5 to destroy all of MakeA-Point Land.
Looks like l'll be enjoying the Drawn Togethergang in hell!
You gots a real weird sense of humor.
Hero, do something! l miss Molly!
Looks like it's up to ol' fatass again.
That is totally not what l meant to do.
The Drawn Togethergang must die!
Oh, no, you don't!
Everyone, run, run!
Don't worry about the old...
Um, they left, like, 5 minutes ago.
-Guys! l haven't been laid in 6 months! l have an erection right now, and l don't know how long it will last! l'm just putting that out there.
Tain't yours! Taint give it to me!
Ok, but first, give it to me!
Don't you see? lf people all over the world would just...
Next year in Jerusalem!
Oh, Lordy!
Fuck yeah! l'm going to escape the fuck out of this shit!
Where the hell are you... Aah!
Oh, Barney! l knew you'd come for me! l just knew it!
Uh, yeah. Actually, l just came to tell you l worked out everything with my wife.
So we have to end our affair.
Sorry. Here. lt's a living.
Oh, damn it.
Oh, Lordy! Oh, now what we gonna do?
Oh, my God! Get us the fuck out of here!
Help!
Hey, you guys!
Take off your 3-D glasses now.
3-D glasses not included.
Yeah, but at least we're alive, thanks to you, Giant Who
No Longer Shits lnto His Own Mouth. lt's the least l could do. l wish there was some way l could help you get back on the air. l think l can help.
Jew Son! Oh, l'm so sorry about your father. lt's ok. He died saving those he loved.
Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.
And now that he's gone, l'm taking over the family business.
Uh, l don't think so, but l do have a surprise for you.
Papa?
-Even better! l pulled some Jew strings and l think l can get you a Direct-to-DVD movie!
For real-real, not for play-play?
Yes, Foxxy, for real-real, not for play-play.
Well, no offense to you guys, but l don't want to be in a Direct-to-DVD movie if it doesn't have a happy ending.
-Hero, look who l found!
Molly!
Oh, l love it when she does that.
Hey, there, baby. How you doin'?
You like shitting in people's mouths, right?
What, Molly? Of course, l'd love to let you fuck me in my mouth, but not tonight,
'cause tonight is guys' night.
Aw, shitcunt.
Why don't you suck
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my stinky little taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint
Suck my taint
Come on, and suck my stinky little taint
Take it up the ass, metaphorically
Suck on a massive dong, allegorically
Slather spewing dung across a sweaty symbolic ass
And we can make this fuckall a better world
When you crap yourself, it's an opportunity
To scoop up the excrement and eat it
Thereby showing how you can jizz on a rotting cow
And make this fuckall a better world
Just make a point with your vomit
Make a point with unbridled mayhem
When you make a point to teach the boys and girls
That you can make a point by eating the puke chunks
And make a point by cannibalizing ears
Make a point and make this fuckall a better world
Gargle a glop of snot
Then swallow it, metaphorically
Fondle a donkey's cock while felching it, allegorically
Beat off into a Christmas stocking, mockingly
And make this fuckall a better world
Make a point and make this fuckall a better world
RA'S AL GHUL: I should never have allied myself with a madman. where are they? in Sarajevo, sir.
And he has the boy.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
MAN: wow, that looked like it really hurt:
[ROBIN GRUNTING] whoa, now, hang on.
That looked like it hurt a lot more:
So let's try and clear this up, okay, pumpkin? what hurts more? A? or B?
Forehand? or backhand?
[CACKLING]
A little louder, lamb chop. i think you may have a collapsed lung.
That always impedes the oratory.
[SPITS]
[GRUNTS]
Now, that was rude.
The first boy blunder had some manners.
I suppose I'm going to have to teach you a iesson...
...so you can better follow in his footsteps.
No, I'm just gonna keep beating you with this crowbar.
[JOKER CACKLING]
Where is the detective?
MAN:
He's on his way.
But, sir, he won't make it there in time. okay, kiddo, i gotta go. it's been fun though, right? well, maybe a smidge more fun for me than you.
I'm just guessing since you're being awful quiet.
Anyway, be a good boy.
Finish your homework and be in bed by 9.
And, hey...
...please tell the big man i said, "Hello."
[CACKLING]
[GROANING]
No.
Jason.
MAN 1 :
The hell you say.
You didn't set this up?
-Then whose party is this?
-i thought it was you east-side losers.
You already rolled over for the Black Mask and i figured you were gonna ask us in.
Rolled over? The Mask whacked six of my crew in a month. Six.
Some of my best people.
So you set up this meet?
No, i thought it was Chi Chi: wasn't my meet: oh, the hell with this. I'm gone.
You brain donors wanna hang around--
MAN 2:
Sit down, Freddie. it's my meeting.
CHI CHI: it's him.
-Batman? we didn't do nothing.
RED HOOD: well, we all know that's a lie.
-who the hell are you?
-Smoke him.
RED HOOD: i said, "Sit down."
You wanna die?
There's easier ways to kill yourself.
RED HOOD: Yeah, like yelling at the guy who's hoiding the AK-47.
Listen to me, you drug-peddling scumbags. i will be running the drug trade from now on.
You eight are the most prosperous street dealers in Gotham.
I'm offering you morons a deal.
You go about your business as usual, but kick up 40 percent to me.
A much sweeter deal than the scraps Black Mask is leaving you. in return, you will have total protection from both Black Mask and Batman.
But you stay away from kids and school yards.
No dealing to children, got it? if you do, you're dead. okay, crazy man, this is all very generous.
But why in the hell should we listen to you?
[CHI CHI VOMITS]
Damn.
RED HOOD: Those are the heads of all of your lieutenants.
That took me two hours.
You wanna see what i can get done in a whole evening?
Make no mistake.
I'm not asking you to kick in with me.
I'm telling you.
Forty percent works for me.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
-Go, go, go!
-where's Raymond and Denny?
-He got them. Just grabbed them up.
MAN: Screw it.
Just go, get us out of here. i think i iost him.
-You think i iost him?
-i think you iost him. i think we're good.
No, you're anything but good.
[GROANING]
[YELLS] who are you working for?
Nobody.
Look, we just boosted the truck and--
Lie to me again and crashing into a wall head-on...
...will be the least painful activity of your evening:
No, i swear to--
[BEEPING]
-what is that?
-Your cargo. it's called Amazo. what the hell is an Amazo?
A highly advanced, cybernetic android...
...equipped with the ability to absorb the power of super humans. what kind of super humans?
Big ones.
NIGHTWING: Packs quite the punch for a toaster on steroids, huh?
-Need a hand?
-No.
NIGHTWING: okay, well, how about i just stick around and watch? who's that other one?
The pretty boy in the leotard?
That's Nightwing.
He was the Bat's first sidekick.
The first Robin.
-i think you'll have to do better than that.
-i did.
[BEEPING]
NIGHTWING: will that do any good?
BATMAN: it'll slow it down.
You think so?
Get to higher ground.
NIGHTWING: Did you know he could fly?
-Move! i wouldn't be offended by a few suggestions.
He has the same weak points as a human being.
Got it. This might sting a bit.
[YELLING]
Lasers. He's got lasers. i don't think putty in his eyes is gonna hurt him.
But plastique will. Nice.
BATMAN: This shipment was meant for the Black Mask. i doubt you're behind this.
-who do you work for?
-i swear. we're not working for anybody.
This was our gig, all our idea.
-Let it go.
-Right.
[SCREAMS] i'll talk, i'll talk. Just stop. Just stop!
The Red Hood. we're working for the Red Hood. we don't have any choice. He's got--
[BULLETS wHizzING]
The shots came from the rooftop.
A sniper.
BATMAN:
A good one.
NIGHTWING: See him?
-Yeah.
NIGHTWING:
Hey, wait.
Right. Leave me with them.
[CAR HoRN HoNKING]
God, please, no. Stay away. it's a setup. wait.
I'm not a crook, i swear.
No!
RED HOOD:
Hard to forget that night, huh? in a way, Batman, this was the site of your first great failure.
Maybe your greatest, but certainiy not your last, right?
Ah, memories.
DICK: This bit of intel is what brought me to town.
Good thing i've always had perfect timing.
Take a look. i got this shot from a snitch. He says that this guy's been making some serious moves.
The Red Hood.
Might be.
He bears a resemblance to the original.
BRUCE:
Severai criminals have utilized this persona.
DICK: one criminal of particuiar interest, though.
-But he's locked up.
-Not his m.o. either.
There's been an uptick in heavy trafficking, but crime is down.
ALFRED: indeed it is.
Master Bruce got almost three hours sleep in the last two days.
True busman's holiday.
But he is locked up.
Like, a lot locked up.
Maybe we should go for a visit.
Could you just once say,
"Let's get in the car"? is that so hard?
[LAUGHTER ECHoING]
You look good. Been working out?
You could probably use a little sun.
Then again, who am i to talk?
[CACKLING]
BATMAN:
He's calling himself the Red Hood: what do you know about it?
That he has horrible taste. when i wore that number, it was classy.
More flashy maitre d' than motorcycle fetish. oh, these kids today. if you're behind this in any way, we will find out.
-You're not--
-oh, Bird Boy, you're so much less fun now.
All grown up and in your big-boy pants.
Still, better off than his replacement, right?
Even tougher making with the yuks when you're worm food, huh?
You gonna do it this time? or you just gonna put me in another body cast for six months?
So disappointing.
But back to the matter at hand...
...this new hoody.
You really think i would stir up so much troubie...
...and not make sure you knew it was me?
[CACKLING] i know you've never met him before, but be cool.
This here is the Black Mask.
The first boss to gain control of the entire city in 20 years. whatever he wants in Gotham, he gets.
But his appearance takes a bit to warm up to.
MAN:
He did what? what? oh, good, he's pissed.
WOMAN: our concern is the one who ordered the theft of the android.
He goes by the name of Red Hood.
MAN: i don't care what he's calling himself.
Do you idiots know how many bidders i had on Amazo?
A list of puppet dictators and psychos as long as my arm.
Millions shot right to hell.
-And whose money is that?
-Your money.
My money. Mine.
This score was a game changer.
Amazo was going buy my way up into high-end internationai trafficking.
Now I'm forced to keep rooting around in this local leg-breaking garbage.
And he gives me bat troubie, who blows the damn robot's head off! i could have at least sold it for scrap, but Batman kept it.
Yes, Batman likes to keep things.
-Look, this circus act, this Red Foot--
-Red Hood. whatever.
He's dead. Take care of him.
You, new guy.
-Sir:
BLACK MASK: Don't be nervous, kid.
But if you keep staring at me like that,
I'm gonna cut your eyes out.
[GRoANING]
-Give me the specs on tonight's shipment.
LEoN: Yes, sir. it's 10 cases of assorted SMGs and PDws...
...along with 5000 .45 caliber ACP rounds, your personal favorite...
...and two cases of RPGs. it's all bought and paid for, so this is strictly a delivery, not a buy. in view of recent events, i've taken the liberty of doubling security...
...and switching the drop spot.
RED HOOD:
That sounds like a plan.
Co-PiLoT: what are they waiting around for?
-Seriously.
Hey, protocol says I'm only supposed to be on the ground for six minutes.
RED HOOD: it's okay. i won't be staying that long.
And i almost thought he wouldn't show.
You know what i missed most about running with you? The toys.
Stay sharp. we're not done.
RED HOOD:
You wanna dance? Let's dance.
-is that gonna hoid?
-No.
So you want me to--? should i--? okay, i'll just take care of this.
RED HOOD: okay then. Nice night for a run.
-He's good.
-Yes, he's putting on quite a show.
He's very good. we got him.
-That's impressive.
-Nothing we haven't seen before. if you say so.
Think we iost him?
[BEEPING]
Move!
[BEEPiNG RAPiDLY]
[GRoANS]
RED HOOD:
You haven't lost your touch--
He's got some moves, huh?
And as much i hate to belabor a point...
And still that is often exactly what you do.
I'm chatty. it's part of my charm.
I'm saying that our boy here has some skills.
He's been trained and trained well.
Like right there. That.
He sliced that cable off his ankle before it went taut.
You don't just do that.
That has to be practiced. Learned.
-And then there's the knife.
-what about it?
You know many knives that can cut my lines?
-Not many.
-No. Not many. well, look, we obviousiy have got ourselves a player, we-- ow!
BRUCE:
Alfred, take him home.
Bruce, i can still help.
You already have.
Thank you.
Go rest up. okay.
But you know where to find me if you need me.
He did just thank me, right?
-indeed he did, sir.
DICK: weird.
RED HOOD:
You haven't lost your touch--
[TRAiN wHiSTLE BLowS oN ViDEo]
You haven't lost your touch--
--your touch, Bru--
You haven't lost your touch, Bruce.
[ROBIN LAUGHS]
ROBIN: whoo-hoo!
You guys having a party?
-i guess our invite got lost.
-it's over, Riddler.
Riddle me this. what's green and purple but covered in red and yellow?
You. when i land on your sorry butt.
MAN:
Don't move or i'll--
You'll what? Shoot me?
Twenty rounds a second and you were still too slow.
I'm not slow, punk.
-Me neither.
-i've got him.
[GRUNTING]
Robin! i had to take him down.
You shattered his collar bone.
He's a drug-deallng pimp. i didn't think i had to prop up some pillows before i took him out. we needed him. He would've talked.
But you put him into shock.
Sorry.
That was dumb.
But he deserved it.
BLACK MASK: Maybe my last request was too mired in subtlety. i want this man dead. when i say "dead," i mean seriously dead.
Beaten, broken.
His-head-mounted-on-my-wall kind of dead!
Understood. we'll be taking further precautions at every transaction--
Screw that.
Time he learns that this is a contact sport. we're going on offense.
Rough up his business.
Something big. Something loud. when he shows up to shut us down, have a party waiting for him.
And when i say "party"...
...i actually mean a whole lot of people who are gonna kill him!
-i figured.
-Just being clear.
[SiGHS]
[TiRES SCREECHING]
[ENGiNE REVS]
[PEoPLE SCREAMING] what are you doing? we're protected. we pay up to the Red Hood. is that right?
Cute.
Do you know who you're messing with?
Yeah, Tyler Bramford.
You're a club owner and some big damned drug dealer in the East Quarter, right? i am the East Quarter drug trade, you stupid bags of--
Manners, fatty. i don't care who takes care of you.
You watch your mouth.
Then you know who's got my back.
You know who i answer to.
Sure: The Red Hood.
And we work for the man who's gonna take back what's his.
CHiCo: So at the expense of your very wide butt...
...we're sending your boss a message.
[SCREAMING]
RED HOOD: okay. what's the message?
WOMAN:
A simple one, actually. want to guess what it might be?
RED HOOD: i have a few ideas.
Any of you hired guns even know who i am?
BAToN:
You are our target.
RED HOOD: ow.
So you four have all this power and all you do with it is kill for money?
BULK: From what i hear, we've got that in common.
RED HOOD:
You heard wrong.
BAToN: i thought you'd put up more of a fight.
RED HOOD: oh, the fight hasn't started yet.
I'm just stalling.
-what the hell took you so iong?
-Shut up and fight.
[GRUNTING]
[SCREAMING]
[PowERiNG UP]
[SCREAMING]
RED HOOD: i gotta say. i missed watching you work.
Look out!
RED HOOD:
Awful close.
You afraid you'll miss?
SHoT:
Black Mask just wants a body.
-we don't need your head.
BATMAN: Let him go.
And step away.
SHoT:
A Taser?
Nail me and you'll electrocute both of us.
RED HOOD:
Maybe that's what he has in mind.
No!
RED HOOD:
Just be happy i only killed one of them.
They're all assassins.
And what are you?
RED HOOD:
I'm cleaning up Gotham.
More than you ever did.
You're stealing territory from Black Mask and killing anyone who gets in your way.
RED HOOD:
Black Mask is just a part of the plan.
Pian? You're becoming a crime lord.
Yes. You can't stop crime.
That's what you never understood.
I'm controlling it.
You wanna rule them by fear. But what do you do with the ones who aren't afraid?
I'm doing what you won't,
I'm taking them out.
Tell me what happened to you.
Let me help.
RED HOOD: it's too late.
You had your chance.
And I'm just getting started.
BLACK MASK: Son of a-- Are you telling me that scumbag stole my guns again?
No, sir: He destroyed them.
Biew up the truck, the drivers....
Damn it. of all the-- Damn it!
Previousiy, he was just enlisting anyone under our province to come work for him.
Now he just seems to be killing them. oh, so now we've got another Batman? one who doesn't mind the blood?
No, sir, he's no Batman.
He's still taking huge cuts from off the streets.
But now he's eluminating the competition.
He's coming after you.
[CLEARS THRoAT]
[YELLS]
You wanna tell me why this guy ain't dead? we're trying. we sent the Fearsome Hand of Four.
Four? Guess they're gonna need a new name. why hasn't Batman wiped this little smear off the face of the planet?
Maybe he doesn't want to.
Perhaps he's letting you and the Red Hood war it out.
-He could be waiting--
-To take on the winner? what do you think this is?
A tennis tournament?
-I'm just saying...
BLACK MASK: You're an idiot.
And you don't know Batman.
He's not letting this lunatic just run wild.
He can't catch him either. or it's something else.
Can't you feel it? we're stuck in the damn crossfire. oh, hell.
Sir?
RED HOOD: wow, he sure can move when he really wants to.
-You okay, sir?
-I'm not dead.
So that's something. okay.
-Time to change up the ground war.
-How so, sir?
I'm being forced into negotiating with a psychotic.
That doesn't sound good.
No. it's going to be a nightmare.
Hey, fellas,
10 minutes to bed check, right?
-Terry? what the hell are you doing here?
-You miss me?
I'm covering Rothman's shift.
He's got the flu, bronchitis or something. we got this. why don't you grab some joe? we'll meet you in the south wing.
That's not protocol.
Come on, I'm bored, i need to stretch my iegs: Let's get--
[BULLET wHizzES]
Sorry, schedule to keep.
MAC:
You didn't have to kill him. one, yes, i did.
Two, we're paying you a ton.
So, three, shut your gob and open the damn door.
-Does he know what's going on?
-He knows he's leaving.
JOKER: it's gonna be a sleepover, right? i packed my toothbrush.
-Do you need more light, sir?
-No: i can see fine. well, there you have it.
He's still at rest.
No, he isn't.
That's not flesh.
-Master Bruce, you can't blame yourself--
BRUCE: it was stupid and careless.
Body was made of high-end latex. if i'd bothered to look inside when i brought him home....
Sir, please, remember how distraught you were. Even i found it hard--
Stupid and careless.
-where are you going?
-To talk to the man who did this. i hope you understand the trouble i've gone through...
...to arrange this little get-together here.
A lot of money. A lot of dead meat.
Look, i've got a problem.
And you are absolutely the man who possesses the gifts...
...to take care of this problem. i need you to murder the Red Hood.
You think you can handle that?
[CoUGHS]
May i have some water?
[JoKER CACKLING]
I'm going to need something to wear...
...and a very big truck.
Sure: Anything else? i'll need some guys.
Not these guys because, well, they're kind of dead. what did you do to Jason?
Act like you don't know what I'm talking about and i'll dislocate the shoulder.
That's just to start. if you haven't disabled the roof sensors, my guards will be here in under a minute.
Answer me.
I'm willing to...
...but it'll be more expedient if you hand me the communicator in my pocket...
...and i call off my men.
Commander, this is Ra's Al Ghul.
Stand down. i will be entertaining a guest in my study.
You remember when we last became embattled?
You were planning to blow up banks.
Accurate, if inelegant. i was in the midst of toppling the economy of Europe...
...but you were on to me. i sought a distraction.
So i hired the Joker.
When your paths crossed in Bosnia...
...it was to appear that you had stumbled upon him.
He was paid extremely well for what was intended to be a wild-goose chase.
Then he murdered the boy.
That was not by design.
I'm afraid i overestimated my ability to control the Joker...
...just as i underestimated his madness. it grieved me, sir...
...to be a party to something so brutal.
You've never shied away from drawing blood.
True, but always with purpose.
Always with greater goals.
This was simply an unnecessary casualty.
As penance, i chose not to make war with you again...
...and to attempt to rectify this disservice.
Rectify?
Yes: i had hoped to return to you what you had lost. l have walked this world for nearly six centuries.
As you know...
...i achieve this by bathing in the rejuvenating waters of the Lazarus Pit.
Along with its healing abilities...
...it has long been rumored that it is capable of an even greater feat...
...to raise the dead.
Procuring the remains of your partner was not difficult.
You had come to Bosnia under the guise of Bruce Wayne...
...and you chose to depart as such.
You even concocted the cover story...
...that young Jason had died in a bombing in Sarajevo.
This made it easy for me.
All it took was a few payoffs to replace his body. i felt confident that you would not perform an autopsy...
...even if you had, we still would have bought enough time.
But my plan...
...well, detective, it had unfortunate results.
[SCREAMING]
He returned to this world...
...but returned damaged.
My army searched for months...
...but we were never able to find a body or pick up a trail. i thought him dead yet again.
But i hear you have been having trouble at home. i have returned your son to you as a blight upon your house.
He burns the very kingdom you--
--protect.
Shall i alert the guards to pursue him?
Don't be foolish.
They would never catch him.
Besides, i have done enough.
ALFRED:
Sir, please take this to heart. who Jason was before, how we lost him...
...and this dark miracle or curse that has brought about his return...
...it is not your fault. l know you view his death as your greatest failure but--
His life and his death are my greatest failure.
Do you remember how he was when i found him? of course, sir.
Fearless, arrogant, brash and gifted.
BATMAN: Yes.
Different than Dick in so many ways...
...but still so full of potential and power.
But i knew, even from the beginning, he was dangerous. lf i hadn't made him into Robin, he would have grown to do wrong.
Then i got him killed.
My partner.
My soldier.
My fault. i own that. i'll carry that like everything else:
But now there's this.
He's taken everything i've ever taught him and turned it on me. it's a hell of my own making, Alfred.
Sir, this is not your doing.
You loved him: He knows that.
-it should be enough.
-it's not.
[CoMPUTER BEEPING] woMAN oN TV:
Reporting live from Gotham Bay Bridge....
My word.
Sir, patch into the media feed now.
[SiRENS wAiLING]
[JoKER CACKLING]
MAN:
Come on, get out of there, now.
Don't know what that maniac's up to, but nobody make a move till i give the order.
JoKER [SiNGING]: i'm a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
This wasn't part of the damn deal, you freak!
Get me out of here right now! i thought you'd enjoy seeing some old faces.
After all, most of these guys used to work for you.
MAN: who's that? Get a light on him.
Up there.
Hey, look at you. Mr. Hood. or do you prefer Red? i used to wear an outfit a lot like that.
Mine was more flashy maitre d' than motorcycle fetish.
You kids today.
I'm sorry, could you hoid on? i was just in the middle of setting fire to your gang.
RED HOOD: Go ahead.
You think i care if that scum dies?
Don't know. i just wanted your attention.
RED HOOD:
You've always had my attention.
But what i really wanted was an audience with you.
I'm sorry, that seems to imply that you organized this little clambake.
RED HOOD: i did. Sure, i had lots of plans...
...but the endgame was getting Black Mask so desperate that he'd cut a deal.
He was the only one with the connections to get into Arkham...
...and get you out.
You can't trust anybody.
So i've been bamboozled. oh, my.
RED HOOD: i wouldn't undersell it. it took a lot of work to bring about our reunion.
Reunion? Have we met before?
RED HOOD:
Yes, we have. well, here's to warm memories.
[MUFFLED SCREAMING]
[YELLS]
[SCREAMING]
RED HooD [oVER RADio]: i've got him.
You want him? Meet me at crime alley.
[CoUGHING]
[LAUGHING] okay.
So, what's the plan?
Slumber party? Charades?
A little Truth or Dare?
Yes: i'll start with "dare." well, maybe i'll just go with "truth."
[JoKER GRUNTING]
RED HOOD:
Tell me, how does that feel?
You know, it only hurts when i laugh.
But, hey, i gotta know. who are you?
You said we knew one another, and you do seem really familiar. we double at the prom? or maybe blow up a school bus together?
RED HOOD:
No: I'm just something you helped make.
That's pretty cryptic...
...but interesting.
Tell me more.
RED HOOD:
Sure. Listen up.
[JoKER GRUNTING]
BATMAN:
Unreal.
RED HOOD:
Hello.
So glad you could make it.
This ends tonight. All of it.
RED HOOD:
Nobody knows that better than me.
RED HOOD:
Ha. oh, you and your gadgets.
You're not the oniy one with toys.
[BEEPING]
Crap.
[GRUNTING]
[RED HooD LAUGHING]
Look at you. i guess we should keep it even.
Jason.
Yes.
BATMAN: i don't wanna fight you.
RED HOOD:
All evidence to the contrary.
Please, i can help you. i know what happened. oh, you got to talking with Ra's, huh?
Does it make it easier for you to think that my dip in his fountain of youth...
...turned me rabid? or is this just the real me?
Tell me...
...what bothers you more, that your greatest failure has returned from the grave? or that i've become a better Batman than you?
You're ruling through intimidation and murder. Just another criminal.
I'm what this city needs.
Hidden goodies all over, huh? we're both just a couple of walking armories.
Maybe so, but let's see how you do without your toys.
Enough. it's over.
You say you wanna be better than me.
But it won't happen.
Not like this. i know i failed you...
...but i tried to save you, Jason.
I'm trying to save you now. is that what you think this is about?
That you let me die? i don't know what clouds your judgment worse.
Your guilt or your antiquated sense of morality.
Bruce, i forgive you for not saving me.
But why? why on God's earth...
...is he sti;; alive?
[CACKLING]
Gotta give the boy points.
He came all the way back from the dead to make this shindig happen.
So who's got a camera? ooh! ooh!
Get one of me and the kid first.
Then you and me, then the three of us.
And then one with the crowbar. Then--
[YELLS]
You'll be as quiet as possib;e or i'll put one in your ;ap first.
Party pooper. No cake for you. ignoring what he's done in the past.
Blind;y, stupid;y, disregarding the entire graveyards he's filled...
...the thousands who have suffered, the friends he's crippled.
You know, i thought-- i thought i'd be the last person you'd ever let him hurt. if it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp...
...if he had taken you from this worid, i would've done nothing...
...but search the planet for this pathetic pile of evil death-worshipping garbage...
...and sent him off to hell.
You don't understand. i don't think you've ever understood. what? what, your moral code just won't allow for that? it's too hard to cross that line?
No. God Aimighty, no. it'd be too damned easy.
All i've ever wanted to do is kill him.
A day doesn't go by i don't think about subjecting him...
...to every horrendous torture he's dealt out to others and then end him.
Aw. So you do think about me.
But if i do that...
...if i allow myself to go down into that piace...
...i'll never come back. why? I'm not talking about killing Penguin or Scarecrow or Dent.
I'm talking about him. Just him.
And doing it because....
Because he took me away from you. i can't. I'm sorry.
That is so sweet. well, you won't have a choice.
-i won't--
-This is what it's all been about.
This.
You, and me and him.
Now is the time you decide. if you won't kill this psychotic piece of filth, i will. if you wanna stop me, you're gonna have to kill me.
-You know i won't--
-I'm gonna biow his deranged brains out.
And if you wanna stop it, you are gonna have to shoot me.
Right in my face.
This is turning out even better than i'd hoped. it's him or me, you have to decide.
Decide now. Do it.
Him or me? Decide.
[JoKER CACKLING] i can't believe you got him.
You expert, rooting-tooting, eagle-eyed, goth-loving marksman. i iove it.
You managed to find a way to win.
And everybody still loses.
No, don't spoil it. This is better.
I'm the only one who's gonna get what he wants tonight.
Yes, bing, bang, boom. we all go out together.
Don't you just love a happy ending?
[CACKLING] woMAN oN TV: Sources close to the district attorney's office have intimated...
...the case will likely be dropped due to lack of evidence.
But the Black Mask is still under investigation for his alleged complicity...
...in Joker's escape from Arkham.
The guards charged with aiding and abetting the escape...
...were found murdered in the Gotham courthouse jail...
...while the alleged crime lord, Black Mask, was released...
...on $1 million bail for his suspected involvement...
...and is currently awaiting a hearing.
Meanwhile, the Joker has been returned to Arkham Asylum.
Officials claim extra measures have been taken...
...to ensure another escape would be impossible.
MAN: Prior to his arrest,
Black Mask was being strong-armed...
...by the mysterious Red Hood.
ALFRED:
Sir: in light of all the recent events, would you like me to remove that?
No.
This doesn't change anything. it doesn't change anything at all.
BATMAN: okay, let's go. if you can't suit up quickly at home base...
...I'm concerned how you would handle it in the field.
ALFRED:
Perhaps he's primping.
As i recall, Master Richard spent nearly half an hour admiring his reflection...
...the first time he donned his cape.
Jason, get on out here or I'm going on patrol without you.
-Ha!
-My word.
-Gotcha.
-would have...
...if i hadn't seen you slip behind the computer banks three minutes ago.
-No, i got you.
-How does it feel?
[GRUNTING] it feels awesome.
Check me out.
I'm Robin, the Boy wonder.
Are you kidding me? This rocks.
Come on, old man, we've got bad guys who need chasing.
This is the best day of my life.

Run for your life!
Oh! Keep away!
- Take it!
- Keep away!
- Take all of it!
- The monster took my shoe!
Candy!
Yay. Treats. I love treats.
- Felicia.
- Hi, daddy!
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
Farkle, excellent work with your teeth.
- Fergus, my lad...
- Daddy, daddy, daddy.
You're gonna have to work on your timing.
All in all, not bad for your first Halloween.
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair!
Oh, did you see? Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.
Mommy didn't get a scare this year either.
Fear not, my love. The night is still young.
Hold the phone. Who left the door open?
You don't think... someone's inside?
Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
Oh, wow... Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
Happy Halloween, everyone.
Oh, man.
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey! I worked hard on this costume!
Oops. Heh heh!
Admit it, Shrek.
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
Donkey, ogres don't get scared.
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
- Oh, really?
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes! Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
- Ja, wonderbar!
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem. Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!
And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!
Well... Hey, hold on.
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh... What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
Okay, fine.
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
- Oh, ha ha.
Very funny, Shrek.
But this is where
Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja. Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
Wait a minute!
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine. Come on then.
Hold up, Shrek.
You can't just go barging in some creepy, spooky joint like you own the place.
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
I still don't know about this, man.
You know... Whole creepy house-of-wax vibe goin' on in here.
Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?
Welcome to Duloc
It's a creepy town
What was once pristine
Now is all rundown
We will chop off your head
And then laugh when you're dead
Duloc is a creepy place
Come on in, what the heck
Fall right down, break your...
Face
Duloc is
Duloc is
Duloc is
A creepy place
"GET OUT"
- Ooh! Let's do that again.
- No!
Well, then...
This ought to be fun.
Pff. Fun. Yeah, right.
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
You know what, I just figured out what your costume is.
You came as a kiss-up!
All right, all right.
Buckle up, everybody.
The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed.
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes.
Oh! Oh! Pick me, pick me!
I have a scary story!
This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...
If you look at it from my perspective...
Hey, guess what, Pinocchio, no one cares!
Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek,
'cause I've got a doozy... and it's all true!
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
I don't know, something about me being too into myself.
Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack.
You? But you are so adorable.
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!
I need a good woman, Muffin Man.
Ah. I can help you, Gingy.
- How about this one?
- Aw, I dunno.
- You like her, huh?
- Nope. Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No! Don't like it!
Okay. Well, how about this one?
Yes! That's it!
Ah!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait! More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet.
I want someone who will love me forever.
I must warn you, Gingy.
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
Just put her in the oven!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha...
Ow!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey. I get a little privacy?
- Huh?
- Take a hike.
Oh, oui.
Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!
A cookie angel.
Wow!
And you're hot too!
Hello?
Hello?
Oh...
I guess it didn't work.
Ha ha!
Gingy, is it you?
The one I was made for?
Oh, we'll be together forever.
Sweet!
I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you and you for me
So happy together
- Are ya happy, Gingy?
- You bet!
The time since I met you has been the best...
7 1/2 minutes of my life.
Good! Because this is only the beginning.
I'm going to love you and hold you and feed you and dress you
- and cling to you...
- Yeah...
Hang on to you and smother you with my love.
- Yeah...
- Forever and ever and ever
- and ever and ever...
- You know, it's gettin' a little stuffy in here.
You know, I might go get some air.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, no...
Not without your umbrella.
- Come on!
- Here, let me get that.
Wait for me!
Sugar, could you just do me one small, little teensy favor?
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
You know, I forgot my gumdrop buttons.
Yeah! Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?
Sure, I can. I'll be right back.
Gingy, Gingy...
Run, run, run, as fast as you can if you wanna remain a gingerbread man!
Oh!
- Oh, Gingy.
- Whaa...
I don't understand.
- I thought you were happy!
- Oh, well...
It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
No, no, no! Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty... really pretty!
- The girl of your dreams.
- Aah!
Remember?
Farewell!
Gingy!
Let go, Gingy!
Fall with me... so we can be together forever!
Here's a thought...
You let go!
Together!
Together fore...
Boy, what a night!
I'm so glad that is over with!
Oh! Oh, well.
Nothing lasts forever.
Together forever.
Aah!
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
What a nice surprise!
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey... So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
- Gosh, your eye is pretty!
Look, I know you're upset, so... Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I... I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
You made it up, didn't ya?
I... hey, look!
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell.
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
And we needed to find us some shelter!
This is my turn to tell a story.
Hey, hey. Shh!
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles!
But we are equals.
Oh, man. Of course we are...
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this...
But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath.
Wh... wh... wha... wha...
Well, as long as I am here.
But right then, danger came from behind.
Da-dum, da-dum
Da-dum, da-dum
And Puss was never seen again.
Ha ha. The End.
No! That's not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel.
Don't worry, little buddy.
I'm here to save you!
Ohh. You're killing me.
It was Prince Charming!
He was packing heat, and he wanted revenge!
I want revenge!
He said. But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary.
What? No! Go back!
Although the charming was fast,
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me.
Instead, I... I... I woke up.
Yeah. That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
You know you're on the ceiling, right?
I will get you for this.
Oh! And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy? Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.
But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!
Oh, my goodness!
Why would I do that?
Ha ha! And right behind you, there was danger!
- Oh, man.
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge.
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
No, please! Please,
I'll switch to pancakes!
- Aah!
- Num, num, num!
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No. You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No! Anything but that!
No!
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha. It worked, didn't it?
Hmm. Who's next in our little contest?
Oh. Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff. Yeah, whatever.
Whoop. Pshh, pshh, pshh.
You had your chance. Now, then...
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come.
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
Trust me, buddy.
I've got three little ogres at home.
This will be a piece of cake.
Father!
Father!
O... kay then.
Look, I'm-a tell you,
I tried every trick in the book.
- You see?
- "Once Upon a Time-Out"?
Oh, come on, now.
You're gonna listen to a goose?
Please, you... you don't understand.
It's like he's-a two different people.
What your kid needs is discipline, not a bunch of psychological mumble-jumble.
You just gotta walk in there, look him in the eye, and show him who's...
Please tell me he's an only child.
Bobba gone fishpeas.
Ba, ba, boo.
Um... Hello.
Whoo!
Well, here's your problem.
His head's not screwed on right.
When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff.
Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox.
Okay.
- Ow! Ow! Oh!
- Hey... Ah!
Oh! Ah!
Mm.
See? That was easy.
It's like I always say.
When it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm.
You just show him that you mean business, and he's out of bed again, isn't he?
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
Aah! Oh!
All right. What's this all about?
Voices.
- Voices?
- Uh-huh!
In here!
Telling me what to do!
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
Oh!
Oh...
The early bird catches the worm!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey... Ow! Hey!
Maybe you sing him a little song.
Come here, y... I...
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
Lullaby and good night
Close your big, creepy eyes
If you sleep, away I'll creep
And get out of here alive
Oh... You know, once you get past all the splinters and rope burns, he's actually kinda cute.
Now where did he go?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!
Now, there's something you don't see every day.
Aah! Aah!
Get him off! Get him off!
Aah!
Ooh...
Mm...
Come back here, you!
I regret nothing!
Ow! Ooh!
Ah! Oh!
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ah!
Ah... Ooh... Ahh...
Eew!
I'm too young to have termites!
I'm no termite, Pinocchio.
I'm a cricket.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,
I'll always be in...
The End.
That wasn't me!
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ha ha. Ask anyone!
Okay, then.
Why don't we start by asking... your conscience!
Aah!
Uh, now who's cheatin'?
Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me.
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
Yeah, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost.
Ghost? What ghost?
Farquaad's ghost, of course.
As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
Hey, man, that was an accident.
And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend.
- You know that!
- Is it?
Okay, okay.
That's... that's just the wind.
Donkey!
And apparently, it knows my name!
That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this.
Hey, I... I'm standing right here with you, Donkey.
No way! This place is not haunted by a ghost!
And when the sun comes up,
Donkey will be the new king of...
...it's right behind me, isn't it?
Aah!
- Donkey!
- Oh, my goodness!
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha! Ah...
Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember.
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
Grab the kids, and let's get going.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!

Ta-da!
Huh?
Three weeks, and we're still no closer to cracking this.
Right, bring him in!
Yes, sir.
This is the best party ever!
Yeah!
Ha!
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!
Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us.
Yay!
No, no, no. What do you mean she's not coming?
I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess.
Hurts! Stop it!
Listen! I don't want a refund, I want the fairy princess, please!
Please, I'm begging you.
You know what? I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!
Ooh, ooh!
When's the fairy princess coming?
Any minute now!
Yay!
Stall them!
Ooh!
Whoa! Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.
That's enough of the magic show.
Aw!
Wait, did you hear that?
It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.
It's the fairy princess! She's coming!
Look!
- Huh? Oh!
- Eh?
Ow!
Ow.
It is I, Gruzinkerbell, the most magical fairy princess of all!
And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday!
How come you're so fat?
Because my house is made of candy, and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems!
How come you have...
Okay, time for cake.
Yay!
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell! You're the best fairy princess ever!
You are welcome, little girl!
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids.
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!
Hello, Jillian.
So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and... Oop.
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.
Come on, she's a riot!
She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her...
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?
No!
Oh! Oh! I know someone whose husband just died...
I'm sorry,
I did not see you there.
Or there.
Kyle? Kyle?
Kyle, no! Do not do your business on the petunias!
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.
Good boy!
Mr. Gru?
I didn't...
What? Yes?
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
Oh, whoops!
Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me.
Oh, sorry, I...
Freeze ray!
You know, you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru.
For example...
Lipstick taser!
Oh, it works so good.
Man!
Large person.
Oh, sorry.
Get in there...
Huh?
...you big man!
Boss!
Uh? Huh!
Whoa!
Huh?
Ah! Whoo!
Ooh!
Oh!
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!
Wow!
What? Where?
Whoa, foot is asleep.
Ah, pins and needles!
Good afternoon,
Mr. Gru.
Eh.
I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
I am not gonna lie,
I enjoyed that.
Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.
That's enough, Agent Wilde.
Sorry, sir.
Okay, this is bogus!
I don't know who you people think you are, but...
We are the Anti-Villain League.
An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.
But you want to melt the polar ice caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji, or even steal the Moon...
Then we notice.
First of all, you got no proof that I did that.
Second, after I did do that, I put it back!
We're well aware of that,
Mr. Gru.
That's why we brought you here.
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.
Bottom.
Hilarious.
Agent Wilde?
Oh, me now? Ah.
Um, recently, an entire top-secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle.
Yeah, the entire lab, just...
Gone. Where did it go?
I don't care.
Hmm. The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum.
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.
Ah!
Huh, you usually don't see that in bunnies.
As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.
Fortunately, it has a very distinct chemical footprint.
And using the latest chem-tracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
A mall?
Precisely. And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
And that's where you come in.
As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.
The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully...
Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission: Impossible stuff, but no. No!
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.
I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.
"Jams and jellies"?
Oh, attitude!
That's right!
So, thanks, but no thanks.
And here's a tip. Instead of taeing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call!
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.
Ramsbottom.
Oh, yeah, like that's any better.
Hello.
Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing.
So, if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome, give us a call.
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.
Oh, sorry.
So, when you going on your date?
What?
Remember, Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
Yeah, well, she is a nut job, and I'm not going on any date.
Why not? Are you scared?
Hey, did you guys see the Moon landing on TV?
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!
Excuse me? Lisa?
I was talking to
Billy the other day.
No way!
He is so cute.
Ah. Hey, Lisa,
I was wondering if you...
Ew! Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!
Ew!
Lisa's got Gruties!
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!
I just have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed.
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.
Let's go to bed.
Good night, Edith.
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?
No one. Just my friend Avery.
Avery. Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
Does it matter?
No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!
I know what makes you a boy.
Uh, ooh, you do?
Your bald head.
Oh, yes.
It's really smooth.
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine a little chick popping out.
Peep peep peep.
Good night, Agnes.
Never get older.
Hey, oh!
Uh...
Okay, okay.
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.
So, how's today's batch,
Dr. Nefario?
I developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.
That tastes good!
I love the flavor of that!
It's horrible, isn't it?
No, no!
Oh, we're making great progress!
Here, try some of this.
Mmm.
Ah.
Whoa.
Okay, just because everybody hates it, doesn't mean it's not good!
Listen, Gru.
There's something
I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.
What? What's wrong?
Um...
I miss being evil.
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes, it's what I live for.
I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?
Well, I'm also considering a line of jams.
Um, the thing is, Gru,
I've had an offer of employment elsewhere.
Dr. Nefario!
Come on, you're kidding, right?
It's a great opportunity for me.
Bigger lab, more evil, full dental.
Very well.
Let us give you the proper send-off.
Minions!
The highest honor awarded to Dr. Nefario for your years of service, the 21-fart gun salute!
Uh, I counted 22.
Farewell, my friends.
This may take a while.
Go about your business.
I miss you already!
Huh?
Huh.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Yes, it's for his own good.
Okay, we need to choose a picture.
No.
Scary.
Weird.
What is that?
Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make.
Hey, what celebrity do you look like?
Uh, Bruce Willis.
Mmm, no.
Humpty Dumpty!
Ooh, Gollum!
Okay, what are you doing?
We're signing you up for online dating!
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.
Oh, come on. It's fun.
And it's time for you to get out there.
No! Stop! No one is ever getting out there! Ever!
Oh! Okay, now for the announcement.
I have accepted a new job.
Whoa! Really?
Yes, I have been recruited by a top-secret agency to go undercover and save the world!
You're gonna be a spy?
That's right, baby!
Gru's back in the game.
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars.
The whole deal.
Awesome!
Are you really gonna save the world?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Ah!
Hmm.
"Bake My Day."
Blech.
All right, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the Internet.
And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!
Whoo.
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?
Ooh. You got a little...
Here, I'll get it.
Oh.
It's just spreading.
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!
Oh.
I'll let you get it.
Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new
I've been working on.
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare and krumping.
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.
Yay!
What? No, no "yay".
Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.
Well, it seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you.
But not me. I stepped up.
And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.
Walla!
Ya!
Aah!
Do you know this guy?
Yes, he's one of my minions.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have known.
You are free to go.
Uh? Ah!
Kampai!
Oh!
Dave...
Earth to Dave!
Huh?
You can leave now.
Oh, uh...
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?
Fire them at me.
First suspect,
Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop.
No, not her.
Okay, moving on...
Chuck Kinney, owner of Stuff-A-Bear.
Ooh.
I don't think so.
Hello?
Buenos días, my friends!
I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa y Salsa restaurant, across the mall.
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.
This is just going to take un momento.
I am throwing a big
Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag.
It looks something like this.
What do you think?
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Look away!
You, whoo.
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!
Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay?
And welcome to the mall family.
El Macho.
What?
But it couldn't be.
What? What couldn't be?
That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho.
From about 20 years ago.
He was ruthless!
He was dangerous.
And as the name implies, very macho.
He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands!
But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.
He died in the most macho way possible.
Riding a shark
with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest
into the mouth of an active volcano!
It was glorious.
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead.
They never found the body.
Oh, no.
All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!
Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant? Tonight?
Yes, that's good, because I am telling you, if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum, it's him.
All right, all right, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.
What's the big hurry?
I just have a lot of work to do.
Work, what kind of work?
Very important business.
So, hugs, kisses.
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.
Whoa!
But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show.
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.
My mother is beyond compare.
We love you, mothers, everywhere.
Wow! That was something else.
I really liked the way you smiled at the end.
Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?
Okay.
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair...
Perfect! Time to go.
I don't think I should do this.
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?
I don't even have a mom.
Well, you don't need one to do the show.
I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat.
This is different.
Okay, well, then maybe you can just use your imagination.
You mean I pretend I have a mom?
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?
Yeah! I do that all the time.
Thanks, Gru!
Hey!
All right. Hey, hey, no, no! No.
Hey. Hey, please.
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!
Come on!
Mmm-mmm!
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Huh?
Oca!
Oca!
Looka too!
Huh?
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.
Right. Gotcha.
Ya!
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.
Wait! Wait.
What?
What are you doing?
I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
It's a restaurant!
You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set.
Huh? Come on.
There are no booby traps.
Ha! Booby!
Oh. There's a chicken.
Are you lost, little guy?
You must be lost.
Ha! Some guard dog.
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!
Aah!
I got you!
I got it!
Ha!
Oh!
What is wrong with that chicken?
Hey, that pollo es loco.
No?
Okay, let's go.
Are you getting anything?
No, not yet.
But, hey, maybe you can find something with these X-ray goggles.
Bah.
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!
Aah! Oof!
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
That's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blech!
I knew it!
The serum is in here!
Ooh, then let's get it.
This is going to be good!
Ah.
Ah-ha!
What?
Salsa?
Aw, man.
Oh.
Somebody's going to die tonight.
Pollito!
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?
Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken?
What? Who's there?
Mmm-mmm.
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?
Yah!
Huh?
Stop!
My eyes!
Gru, call one of your munchkins!
We've been spotted!
Come get us!
Huh? Hey!
Ah!
Hmm, subtle.
Over here! Over here!
Over here.
Hold tight!
Aah!
I have you now!
Yay! Ice cream!
Huh?
Huh?
All right, there he is.
Suspect number eight,
Floyd Eaglesan.
Oh, okay.
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.
All right.
What the...
Oh, no. That's not good.
Whoa!
Hey, uh, what?
Oh!
Hey, Gru!
Oh, girls! What are you doing here?
Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work.
So, you're saving the world in a garbage can?
Funny.
Hey! There you are.
Oh. Who's this?
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.
Hello.
Hi.
Are you single?
Oh! Goodness.
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall? Bye!
Here is some money, go buy some useless mall junk.
Some headbands and...
Are you gonna marry Lucy?
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.
Plus, you love her.
You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!
And you're gonna get married!
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.
And I will be the flower girl!
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!
Almost forgot. Hugs!
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.
Bye, Gru!
Kids, right? They're funny.
Those girls totally adore you.
I bet you're a fun dad.
Huh.
I am pretty fun.
Is that stealing?
Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.
Whoa!
Cool glasses.
Oh.
I'm Antonio.
I'm Margo.
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?
Uh, sure.
I'm Margo.
Um, I'll catch up with you guys later.
Bye!
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"
We gotta go tell Gru!
All right, I'm going in.
If it picks up any traces of the serum, the sensor in your belt buckle will make a sound like this...
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Okay!
I get it. I get it.
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.
It's about time you showed up,
Mr. Gru.
You know my name?
When someone moves into the mall who is folically-challenged,
I make it my business to know all about them.
You are bald, and that is bad.
There you go, my sweet.
I'm getting nothing so far.
I think you need to move around.
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?
I take it you're an art lover?
No serum.
Yeah, not so much.
Oh, how about this impressive trinket?
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru.
Nothing.
The International...
Yeah, I don't care.
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!
Ah, and what do we have here?
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.
No, thanks. So, what's on the other side of the wall?
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!
Gru?
I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible.
Margo has a boyfriend!
And they're going on a date!
Date? Boyfriend?
What?
There she goes!
Oh, you're so funny.
Gross!
Look, they're in love.
Oh, no, no, no.
Do not say that. No, no, no.
And my dream is to one day play video games for a living.
Wow.
You're so complicated.
Margo.
What is going on here?
Oh, Gru, se llama Antonio.
Me llamo Margo.
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.
Whoa!
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.
Yay, Pop!
That's awesome!
So good to see you again, mi compadre!
Ha! Yeah.
Oh, I see you have already met my father.
What? Father?
Si. Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?
Come, sit, let me get you something.
Oh, look at you.
Heh?
He likes me.
Oh, oh! I'm sorry. Pollito is usually very friendly.
He had a rough night.
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.
That is a pity.
Young love is beautiful, no?
No!
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.
You are right, Cabeza de huevo.
They must get to know each other better!
Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?
No, no.
Si!
I'm sorry, El Macho?
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect after the whole salsa incident?
Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy.
You need to arrest him immediately.
And his deviously charming son!
I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too.
The son, also!
You got to get the son!
I think that the son is the mastermind!
There's a look, there's a devilish look in his eyes, and I don't like it!
Yes, but I don't really see any evidence.
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho.
Lock him up, lock up the son.
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
But, on the less crazy side of things,
Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!
Hmm, interesting.
Yeah! And you know who made that happen? Huh?
This guy.
Nailed it. Amazing, right?
No, I mean, sure. But it's not him, it is El Macho!
Mr. Gru, please!
No! It is him, and I will prove it!
Gru, come on!
He really thinks it's El Macho.
Can you tell?
Oh. Whoo!
Give me that!
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!
Kevin?
Hey, Lance, where the heck is Kevin?
All right, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get.
I can't find anybody anymore.
Gru, it's Jillian!
I've got good news!
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.
I was thinking you two could get some grub.
You know, tear it up, see what happens!
Open up!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...
Agnes! Agnes, tell Jillian I'm not here.
Gru's not here.
Are you sure?
Yes, he just told me!
Mmm-mmm!
I mean, no, he didn't just tell me.
Agnes, where is Gru?
He's putting on lipstick!
He's swatting at flies!
No! No!
He's chopping his head off!
He's pooping?
I know you're in there, Gru!
There's no way you're getting out of this!
I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight.
I mean there's just so many phonies out there!
Yes, I hear you.
Oh, so, do you work out?
Well...
I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it?
Huh? Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.
As you can tell, right? Huh?
Ah.
I can tell.
Solid.
We are in the restaurant, you know.
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?
Sure, just a sec.
Your accent is so exotic.
Ah. Well, thank you very much.
I know someone who can fix that for you.
And you'll be talking normal in no time!
Whoo. Is it hot in here?
How's the food?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?
What?
Ah! I don't think so.
I knew it.
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!
Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine.
No, they're not!
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing off your head, and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
I don't think so, Miss Lady.
Hello?
Hello? Are you...
Hey, Gru.
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?
Wow, looks like your date's out for the count.
It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer.
Yeah, I'm winking because that's what actually happened.
Scusi, what's happening here?
She no like?
Oh, she's just, uh...
Oh, ho.
Sì, Sì. Sì.
Shall we take her home?
Oh!
Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever.
Huh, tell me about it.
Don't worry. It can only get better from here, right?
But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun.
I've had to use it on one or two dates myself.
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
I think I'm good with just the one.
Well, good night, partner.
This was fun.
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.
Oh, and, uh, just between you and me?
You look much better bald.
See you tomorrow.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Yay!
So, I take it the date went well?
No, it was horrible.
High-five!
Bump it.
Mr. Ramsbottom?
Oh, hello.
What are you doing here?
We got him.
Got who?
Floyd Eaglesan!
Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night and discovered this.
It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it.
He's our man.
So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.
I was framed!
You won't get away with this!
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.
Ah. All right. So what now?
Well, now you're free to go back to your business.
Mmm. Jams and jellies.
And it looks like
Agent Wilde will be transferring to our
Australian branch.
Australia?
Yes.
But thank you for everything.
And by everything, of course I mean nothing.
Toodle pip and cheerio,
Mr. Gru.
Hey, there.
Hey.
So, we got him.
Yay. That's great.
And now you're going to Australia?
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.
I've already been working on my accent.
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.
Hugh Jackman.
So, um... Pretty excited.
Great.
Well, good luck.
Thanks. You, too.
Oh! Here.
I wanted to give you this.
Your lipstick taser?
Yeah, it's just a memento.
Just, you know, from the first time we met.
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.
Agent Wilde.
Well, it looks like they need you, so...
Yeah, I better go.
Bye, Gru.
I brought you an umbrella.
Ah, thank you.
What are you doing out here?
Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?
Well, it turns out, you're right.
Really?
Yes, but...
Well, she's moving away.
I'm never going to see her again.
Is there anything
I could do to help?
Aw, I don't... I don't think so, sweetheart.
Well, is there anything you could do?
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.
I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for
Australia and all, but...
Okay, here is the question.
Would you like to...
To go out on a date?
Uh, no.
Okay, that's not helping.
All right, here we go.
For real this time.
I can do this.
Agh! I hate you!
Ah.
Eh.
Kevin?
Mmm?
Tom?
Hello!
Kampai!
Kampai!
Huh? Kampai!
Bah!
Oh.
Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Whoa!
This place is awesome!
Okay. Let's party, huh?
But first, let's go over the rules.
Because what is fun without the rules?
Agnes, easy on the churros.
Edith, try not to kill anyone.
Hai!
Margo!
Hello, Mr. Gru.
Okay.
Gru!
There must be the standard 6 feet of space between you and boys.
Especially this boy.
Ah, you are a funny man.
There are no rules, señor.
It's Cinco de Mayo.
Come on!
They're starting the dance!
Arriba!
So glad you could make it, mi compadre.
Hey, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing is wrong.
I'm just chilling with the guac, from my chip hat.
Gru, please. I know that look all too well.
It is the look of a broken heart.
How did you know?
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
You?
Yes.
But we are survivors.
There's much more to us than meets the eye.
Enjoy the party.
Huh.
Ah-ha!
Ouch!
Say what?
Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?
That's a good joke.
I just did a boom boom.
I really need you to make a choice, hon.
I choose Gru.
I choose Gru!
Thank you, Gru stewardess!
You're welcome!
Aah!
You have not lost your touch, my friend.
Ah-ha! I knew it!
You are El Macho!
That's right!
Nobody believed me!
Ho-ho! But I knew you weren't dead!
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.
But now, it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil.
Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here.
Dr. Nefario?
Nice to see you, Gru.
Wha...?
So, this is your new job opportunity?
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.
Sorry.
I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.
Oh! Kevin!
No, he's not Kevin anymore.
Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!
Bah!
Just watch this.
Bah!
And here's the best part!
I got an army of them!
Look, look, look!
Bah!
Soon I will unleash them on the world, and if anyone, anyone tries to stop them...
Yeow!
...their city gets eaten!
We can do it together.
Together?
Together!
I have admired your work for years, amigo.
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?
We would be unstoppable!
Men like you, men like me.
We should be ruling the world!
So, are you in?
Woo-hoo!
Uh, yeah, probably.
Probably?
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.
I just have a lot going on right now.
I just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all.
Excuse me?
No, forget it.
One hundred percent! I am in!
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.
That's Agnes calling me from on the surface.
Totally in!
You know what?
I am not so convinced that he is in.
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!
Oops, sorry.
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?
But I didn't get a turn!
Margo!
Come on. We're leaving...
Hey, what's wrong?
I hate boys.
Yes. They stink.
Uh, sorry. Honey, we got to go.
Oops! Sorry.
Ya!
Hey! Pollito, what's the matter?
Oh, hey, Eduardo!
Lucia, I apologize.
Pollito, he's usually not like this.
The same thing happened the other day with Gru, and...
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him?
I really need to talk to him.
Yes. I think he's somewhere around here.
You two are close, no?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?
It's more what he didn't say.
For instance, he never mentioned that you were both working for the Anti-Villain League!
You're coming with me.
Hey!
Crikey!
So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?
Cool!
No, it is not cool!
Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me!
Gru!
Well, Dr. Nefario.
El Macho's onto you. He knows you're working for the AVL.
And he's got your partner.
Lucy?
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!
Nefario?
Sorry, gotta go!
He's got Lucy?
Not for long.
Come on, we're getting her out of there.
What was that?
I don't see anything.
Run!
My unicorn!
Agnes, no!
Come on! Hurry!
What's the matter?
Bah!
Ooh là là.
Kevin!
Dr. Nefario! You're back!
In the flesh.
Behold, the antidote.
Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use.
Ah! Ah!
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.
Huh?
Huh?
Uh...
Uh...
Oh.
Uh!
Curses! Foiled again!
These guys captured me!
Uh...
No?
Bah!
Run!
Up that tree!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hello, Gru!
Hey hey!
Nice work, Dr. Nefario!
I put an antidote in the jelly.
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family.
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, let's go get the...
Hi!
You brought the girls?
Yes!
Oh.
Was that wrong?
What's happening to my minions?
Gru?
You guys, take care of the rest of the minions.
I'm going to find Lucy.
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
Whoa! Whoa!
It's over, El Macho.
Now, where is Lucy?
Let me show you.
Oh, hey, Gru!
Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh?
Yay!
One push of this button, and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.
Only this time, it's for real.
No!
Yam
Tallyho!
We could have ruled the world together, Gru!
But now, you're gonna die.
Oh!
Ah!
Mmm, lipstick taser!
Aw, he copied me.
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.
Ho-oh!
Don't worry about me,
Gru, I'll be fine.
I have survived lots worse than this.
Okay, that's not entirely true.
I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!
Don't worry,
I will get you out of this.
I really hate that chicken.
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!
Gru, anytime now!
Listen, Lucy, we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question.
Uh, better make it quick.
If I had asked you out on a date, what would you have said?
Are you kidding me?
Yes!
Jump!
Lucy!
Lucy, where are you?
Oh, Lucy!
Gru!
Sorry! I guess you need your arms to tread water, huh?
They'll be back.
Underwear...
Underwear...
Underwear...
Oh!
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"
Underwear...
Okay.
Excuse me.
Um, hi, excuse me.
Uh, hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.
Uh...
Okay.
She, um...
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.
We love you, mothers, everywhere.
And my new mom,
Lucy, is beyond compare.
Aww.
Aw.
To the bride and Gru!
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
I'm so happy!
Huh? Ha!
Bah!
Hey, Bob! Stuart!
Eh!
No?
Ah!
Bob!
Uh-oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Aah!
Mmm?
Shh!
Blah.
BEEFEATER:
Admiral Collingwood!
Well, Admiral?
Great news,
Your Majesty!
The French are defeated at last.
Also the Russians, the Portuguese, the Chinese and the Welsh.
Then our navy rules the ocean.
Almost entirely,
Your Majesty.
"Almost"?
Unfortunately, just here, we're still having a little trouble with...
...pirates.
What does it say on my royal crest, Admiral?
"I hate pirates," ma'am.
Exactly.
Hate them.
With their idiotic shanties!
And their ridiculous hats!
And their endless, blasted roaring!
I want them sunk,
Admiral!
Scuppered, smashed, fed to the sharks.
Do you hear me?
I hate pirates!
It's the looting.
It's the cutlasses.
It's the looting!
It's the cutlasses!
Looting!
Cutlasses!
Looting!
Oh!
Sorry, Captain.
We were just discussing what's the best bit about being a pirate.
Oh, YOU were, were you?
I suggested it might be the looting.
Whereas I contend it's the shiny cutlasses.
And I thought it was the chance to catch exotic diseases.
Hmm.
Well, you're, all of you, wrong.
The best bit about being a pirate isn't the looting or the cutlasses.
It's not the grog or the scurvy.
Or the scantily clad mermaids.
The best bit about being a pirate is Ham Night!
Ham Night!
PIRATE: Ham Night!
ALL: Ham!
(CHEERING,
EXCITED CHATTER CONTINUES)
PIRATE: On your nose.
Go, Captain. Go, Captain.
Hey! Hey!
Ooh!
It's like a meat ballet.
To Ham Night!
Ham!
And to the Pirate Captain!
Pirate Captain!
Pirate Captain!
How was that, Number Two?
You've still got it, Captain.
I'd take a jellyfish in the face for that man.
Okay, now, shush, shush, shush.
Settle down, lads. Shush.
Lads, lads.
Pirates!
It's not all about me.
Don't be modest.
No, no, no.
Behind every captain with glittering eyes and a luxuriant beard...
Luxuriant!
That's what it is.
...there's a crew of briny rogues.
Briny rogues!
Sure, some of you are as ugly as a sea cucumber.
Will you get away with ya?
Some of you are closer to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate.
And some of you are just fish
I've dressed up in a hat.
But you're still the best crew a captain could wish for.
Oh, oh!
Don't forget Polly.
And not forgetting, never forgetting...
...Polly. The finest parrot to sail the seven seas.
Come on, girl.
ALBINO PIRATE:
I love her beady eyes.
Who's the feathery heart and soul of our boat?
Is it you? Is it you?
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
It's definitely you, isn't it?
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Right. (STUTTERS)
Where was I?
Ah, yes! Ah, yes.
Important announcement.
(GASPS) PIRATE: Ooh!
Shh-shh, shh-shh!
By order of the Pirate King himself...
The Pirate of the Year Awards?
Are you going to...
(DEEP VOICE) Are you going to enter again?
That I am, Surprisingly
Curvaceous Pirate.
I know it hasn't worked out perfectly for the last...
20 year.
20 years, yeah.
Exactly, Pirate with Gout.
20 years.
It might be a bit more.
Yes, yes.
Thank you, thank you.
PIRATE 1: You were very good, though.
PIRATE 2: Shush!
The point is, every time I've entered I've failed to win.
So by the sheer law of maths...
Ooh! Maths.
...I must have a really good chance this time.
Are you with me, lads?
Yes! This can only end brilliantly.
Then let's go plundering!
J' Deep in the castle and back from the war
J' Back with milady and the fires burnt tall
J' ”Hoorah” went the men down below
J' All outside was the rain and snow
♪ Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah, yeah

PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Excuse me. Mind out.
Captain coming through.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
One Pirate of the Year entry form, if you please.
Thank you.
Now, let's see.
"Booty"?
Oh, yes.
"Roaring." Check.
Shanties.
I shall put "rousing."
"Beard"?
Luxuriant.
Obviously. Duh.
Do you think I should sign it in blood?
Make it more dramatic?
Might be a bit on the showy side.
Bit too much.
You might be right.
Pirate Captain.
You can't lose, Captain.
I'd bet my face.
Well, thank you,
Albino Pirate.
You're a shoo-in, sir.
Sure, there's not a pirate on the seven seas can match you.
Lock up your daughters!
It's me,
Peg-Leg Hastings!
Back from plunderin' the Spanish Main.
Oh, good grief.
And I reckon this will make me
Pirate of the Year.
Don't worry, sir.
He's all flash and no bang.
ALBINO PIRATE:
Ah, Cutlass Liz.
The Butcher of Barbados.
Hello, boys.
Whoa.
You're probably all wondering if I'm still as deadly as I am beautiful.
Well, I am.
Hello, Cutlass, you trollop.
Peg-Leg, you pile of squid bait.
Check it out, lubbers.
The world's biggest diamond.
That baby's got my name on it.
She doesn't even have a beard.
Oh, sweet Neptune's briny pants.
Black Bellamy.
Roar!
Read it and weep, ya coves!
That's right, Black Bellamy is gonna be Pirate of the Year.
Again.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Grog for everybody!
Grog for everybody!
Wow, we are rubbish compared to them, aren't we?
Perhaps we should be off, sir.
Yes.
Yes, yes, good point.
(STAMMERS) I just remembered, actually, I have some very important bits of rope
I need to untangle.
BELLAMY: Thank you.
Well, if it isn't the Pirate Captain.
Oh! (CHUCKLES)
Hello, Bellamy.
Cutlass. Peg-Leg.
Didn't notice you come in.
The beard's looking great, my man.
And I see that you're more wanted than ever.
(GUFFAWING,
MOCKING LAUGHTER)
Come on, everybody, be nice.
Give him a break.
Bring it down a little bit.
All right.
Seriously, Captain, how's the pirating business treating you?
Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly.
Thanks for asking. (CHUCKLES)
Treasure coming out of my eyeballs.
Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes.
CUTLASS LIZ:
Oh, really?
If you've got so much booty, then how come you're still sailing that old wreck?
Anyway, look, (CLEARS THROAT) I'd love to stay and chat, but, you know, places to pillage, people to...
People to skewer.
Huh?
Ugh!
Ooh.
Oh, come on!
That is disgusting.
Wait a minute.
Captain, what is this?
What?
Captain?
Oh, that's nothing. Could I possibly have that back?
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
Thank you.
"Pirate of the Year"?
You're entering
Pirate of the Year?
No, no, no, no, no.
Uh, yes.
Again?
Yes!
BOTH: Ooh!
Come on. Listen, did they change the rules?
I mean, I always thought they gave it to the pirate with the most booty.
Do they now just give it to the guy with the fattest parrot?
She is not fat.
She's just big-boned.
She's fat, dude.
Yeah, go on.
Go on, then, laugh.
Everyone laugh.
Ignore them, Captain.
It's not worth it.
The trophy would just clash with your wallpaper, anyway.
You'll see, you'll see.
I will be
Pirate of the Year.
Oh, yes.
And then you'll be laughing on the other side of your faces.
Yes.
And believe me, that is a very painful thing to do.
Come on, lads.
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
All right, now listen up, you coves.
'We'll show those swabs a thing or two about pirating.
There's still time to fill these chests with sparkling booty.
I can practically taste that trophy!
Trophy! Trophy! Trophy!
Captain!
Sail off the port bow!
Aha!
Let's get after her,
Number Two.
Aye, aye, sir.
Clap on all sail!
Royals and topgallants!
PIRATE:
Release those gallants!
Aha!
Fire those long things that go bang.
Fire cannons four and six!
Eat cannonball, lubbers.
Here we go, lads!
Look and learn.
Yee-haw!
Go get 'em, Pirate Captain!
Avast!
I'm the Pirate Captain.
And I'm here for your gold.
Gold? This is a plague boat, old man.
I'd give my right arm for some gold.
Or my left. (CHUCKLES)
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Right, lads.
Minor hiccup, that last one.
This time, it's payday!
Aha!
I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold.
Geography field trip.
Aha! I'm the
Pirate Captain, and...
Naturists.
Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.
Ghost ship.
Sorry.
Mmm.
Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir.
Mm-hmm. That's nice.
Do you want to give the order to attack?
No, not really, Number Two.
No, I think I've...
Think I had enough of piracy.
I'm hanging up my cutlass.
Captain, no!
Yeah, I was thinking I might go into baby clothes, actually.
What?
I hear there's a fortune to be made in baby clothes because babies grow so fast.
No, but you can't.
I mean, the crew...
They'd... They'd be lost without you.
Oh, what was I thinking,
Number Two?
Pirate of the Year?
Me?
Look at the trophy cabinet.
Best Anecdote About a Squid.
I mean, that is all I've got to show for my entire career.
Pirate of the Year?
It's just commercialized nonsense.
Real piracy isn't about trophies.
It's about fighting up staircases backwards.
It's about sliding down sails with a knife in your teeth.
Beard glossiness!
And think about all the adventures we've had.
Our adventure with Aztecs.
Our adventure with that pig.
Our adventure with...
Shh!
Okay, maybe not the librarians.
But the fun we've had.
And what about the shanties?
Well, I mean... People would miss my shanties.
And the running people through.
Well, I... I do enjoy running people through.
Enjoy it?
You're brilliant at it!
You're a brine-soaked terror of the high seas!
Do you think so, Number Two?
Everyone does!
You're more of a pirate than
Black Bellamy or any of them.
You're a real pirate.
That's why the crew, they think you're the best thing since boil-in-the-bag ham.
Why do you think they all got that tattoo? Come on.
What do you say?
Arrr!
By Neptune, where's that ship?
MAN: Ooh!
This is the one, lads!
Ninth time lucky!
I can feel it in my beard!
Well, don't just sit there like lemons!
Hoist the flag!
Standard, sir?
Or extra gruesome?
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Extra gruesome!
Let's make their gizzards shake.
DARWIN: Journal of
Charles Darwin.
Day 93 aboard the Beagle.
I have, today, discovered a new kind of barnacle, which I have categorized in the order of Pygophora.
I'll never get a girlfriend. lam so unhappy.
(CANNONBALL WHISTLING
THROUGH AIR)
And now I'm being attacked by pirates.
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold.
I haven't got any gold.
No gold, eh?
Then what, might I ask, is this?
It's a baboon's kidney.
Is it?
Oh.
And what about this?
Oh, it's another baboon's kidney.
We searched the hold, Captain.
And?
Just creatures.
Bits of creatures in jars.
And an unhappy-looking baboon.
What kind of ship is this?
(STAMMERING) We're a...
Well, we were a scientific expedition.
Charles Darwin, at your service, sir.
Oh, for pity's sake!
Is it so much to ask? Is it?
I just want one tiny bit of success!
One teensy weensy bit of respect from my peers just once in my life!
Is that such a crime?
Is it?
No?
No!
(GASPS) No.
Oh, but you try telling that to the universe.
Just once, just once for things to go right.
Just... Just once.
So, are we done here?
DARWIN: Dear Diary, about to meet a watery grave.
NUMBER TWO: It's nothing personal, you understand.
It's just...
It's been a tough week, and a good plank walk usually cheers him up.
Will die without reaching second base with a lady.
Oh, get on with it!
Today's weather: inclement.
Stop! PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Oh, now what?
Last request, is it?
Do we have to grant those?
Is there some sort of human rights convention we're signed up to?
But that bird!
My parrot?
She's just big-boned!
No, she's not. I mean... I mean, she's not a parrot.
Not a parrot?
What's he on about, old girl?
She's... She's...
She's the scientific discovery of our age!
She's a... (PLANK
THUMPS, DARWIN SCREAMS)
Huh?
Sorry. It's just, that's my favorite bit.
A dodo, you say?
They've been extinct for 150 years.
To find one alive today, it's quite incredible.
Whoa!
Well, clever old girl.
Not going extinct.
If I might be so bold,
I would be prepared to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly.
Polly's not for sale.
Ten pound.
She's one of the family.
She's like an auntie.
With a beak.
Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles.
Polly here is the feathery heart and soul of the boat.
Come on, little dodo.
Oh.
It's such a missed opportunity.
If I could've presented her in London to the Royal Society at their annual science show...
(CHUCKLES) No question of that, I'm afraid.
She'd have been an absolute sensation.
Yeah, well, can't be helped.
And of course a shoo-in for the top prize.
Prize?
For best scientific discovery. Yes.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
This prize, valuable, is it?
Valuable?
It's priceless.
Untold riches.
Captain...
No, no, no, no.
I was thinking, perhaps perhaps
I was being a touch hasty.
But, Captain, London?
The home of Queen Victoria, mortal enemy of pirates everywhere?
We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock.
(SCOFFS) Oh, pah!
We laugh in the face of danger, remember?
Um, I don't.
I don't really like danger at all.
Captain, do you remember the little talk we had?
The one about whether pigs are actually a type of fruit?
No.
No.
The one about us trying to avoid harebrained schemes that end in us facing certain death.
You heard the man,
Number Two.
"Untold riches."
Here's the plan.
We go to London, Polly wins this science show thingy we take the prize money, I enter
Pirate of the Year, I win!
Bingo!
But, Captain, I'm not sure...
It can't fail.
And besides, look at her little face.
(HIGH-PITCHED) I sure want to win that science prize.
Squawk!
Bravo, Captain!
I see you're a man of vision!
Right, then, Charles. When is this science show of yours?
A week tomorrow.
Ah, confound it!
You see, we could've made that with a good wind behind us, but unfortunately there's this dirty great sea monster in the way.
Um, mmm, I think they just add those onto maps for decoration, Captain.
Is that a fact?
Well, blow me down.
(LAUGHS) I dare, you could learn something from this fine fellow,
Number Two.
J' London calling to the faraway towns
J' London calling to the faraway towns
J' Now war is declared and battle come down
J' London calling to the underworld
J' Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
J' London calling, see, we ain't got no high
♪ 'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
J' Now get this
J' London calling, yes, I was there, too
J' And you know what they said?
Well, some of it was true
J' London calling at the top of the dial
J' And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Ah! London Town.
The most romantic city in the world.
J' I never felt so much alike alike, alike, alike... J'
"Queen Victoria
"welcomes you to London."
Ah, that's nice.
Perhaps she's not so bad after all.
Well, don't look so worried,
Number Two.
Pirates are always visiting London.
Turn back!
This is the fate of pirates here!
Is that Scarlett Morgan?
Pirate Captain.
Goodness me!
I haven't seen you since that business in Madagascar.
Ah, yes. I could've sworn they were girls.
You're looking well, Morgan.
Yeah, lost a bit of weight.
What are you up to these days?
Oh, you know, this and that.
Yeah, just gonna enter a science competition, actually.
Ah! Good luck with that.
Yeah, thanks, thanks.
Eh?
No, no, wait, wait!
Turn back!
Turn back.
Oops. Sorry.
Oh, no!
Look what you've done to me boat.
Look at the state of it.
I hope you've got some insurance, 'cause I...
Ow.
Right, then. We'll be off.
I'll bring her back tomorrow straight after the show.
Well, don't be daft, Charles.
I'll be presenting Polly.
You?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I always fancied trying my hand at a spot of science.
But you can't. I mean, the streets of London are no place for pirates.
Pirates? What pirates?
Nobody here but us Girl Guides.
Yes!
I've got a badge for looting.
We're not really Girl Guides.
It's us, the pirates.
We're masters of disguise.
How ingenious.
But all the same, Captain, best we lie low for the night.
Perhaps at my house.
Captain, I really think...
Good plan, Chuck.
Be fun to see how you boffin types live.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, come on. Taxi!
Evening, Officer.
Hidey-ho, ladies.
ALBINO PIRATE:
London smells like Grandma.
Whoa.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
You don't get many women back here, do you, Charles?
People who live alone are always serial killers.
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Sweet Neptune on a bike!
DARWIN:
Oh, don't mind Mr. Bobo.
Just an old project of mine.
Project?
Yeah, I had this theory.
I thought that if you took a monkey, gave him a monocle and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass, then he would cease to be a monkey and become more of a...
A man-panzee, if you will.
Bold theory.
I don't like the monkey.
But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny.
He's not a patch on Polly here.
Oh!
Anyhow, big day tomorrow.
We all need our rest.
Let me show you to your room, Captain.
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Right behind you, Chuck.
DARWIN: (WHISPERING)
Now, shh, here's the plan.
You know what to do. Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep, then sneak into his room and...
Shh!
Captain.
It's... It's Mr. Darwin, sir.
I'm sure he's up to no good.
Oh, honestly, Number Two, what's got into you?
Thanks to Charles, we're about to win lavish untold riches, and here you are trying to find fault with the poor fellow.
Yes, but... No, no, no.
Not another word.
A future Pirate of the Year needs his beauty sleep.
Do you think you could make nautical noises until we drop off?
Oh, that's lovely.
Now, that is lovely.
Can you do the shiver a timber?
Oh... Mmm.
And just chuck in a few gulls, would you?
Caw, caw, caw!
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, our winner.
Give it up for the Pirate Captain!
Congratulations,
Pirate Captain.
Nobody deserves this more than you.
Thanks, Cutlass.
And that beard of yours, (GASPS) it drives me crazy.
Give it here.
Give it back,
Bellamy, it's mine!
No, give it back.
Neptune's navel!
Come back here, you lubber.
Stop, thief!
I'll take that.
Not so fast, my friend.
Number Two!
Number Two, are you all right?
Unhand that dodo!
Whoa!
Evening, Captain.
(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING,
CRACKING)
Oh, Number Two!
We're under attack!
Abandon ship!
Hello, Pirate Captain,
Pirate with a Scarf!
Come back here,
Mysterious Shadowy Figure!
Faster! Faster!
Got you!
Are you all right, girl?
Captain!
I mean, what's going on?
Don't play the innocent.
You and your hench-monkey tried to steal Polly.
Steal Polly? Oh, dear me, no, you're mistaken.
Then how do you explain this?
Well, I think it's obvious what's happened, isn't it?
Is it?
Some jealous rival scientist must have tried to make off with the dodo.
Well, that explains everything.
Captain, please, let's go.
Polly's not safe in London.
I couldn't bear it if something happened to Polly.
Nothing is going to happen to Polly.
She'll be perfectly safe.
Leave everything to me.
Now, come on, we can't keep that prize waiting.
Um... Anyone got a towel?
DARWIN: Nice going, banana butt.
Now this briny buffoon is gonna grab all the glory.
It's a disaster.
It's...
Bad news,
I'm afraid, Captain.
You can't go in.
Eh?
Mmm.
It's strictly scientists only, you see.
I'll just have to present Polly myself.
We're not really scientists.
It's us, the pirates.
See? (CHUCKLES)
Masters of disguise.
But where's Polly?
That is on a need-to-know basis from here on in, Charles.
Pardon?
I am keeping her hidden.
That shadowy figure could be anywhere.
Luckily, I am not only a master of disguises,
I am also a master of hiding things.
Right, lads, let's show these boffins what's what.
But, Captain.
Really, I...
Hello!
(BELL DINGS) We're here for the science show.
We're scientists.
Hmm?
That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin, and I am the Scientist Captain.
If you're a scientist, name three elements.
Oh, well, let's see now.
There's...
There's gold, ham...
Mmm-hmm?
...and the tears of a mermaid.
Yeah, two out of three Close enough.
First on your left.
The balloon of my airship contains
20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Just here, you will notice the open log fire to ensure a comfortable temperature at higher altitudes.
Ooh!
Captain?
Captain, Captain, please.
You can't possibly appear on stage without Polly.
Patience, Charles.
All in good time.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Sorry.
SCIENTIST: Idiot!
Just a tick.
Oh, but, Captain...
How on earth did...
My airship will revolutionize the fields of meteorology and cartography.
But mostly, it's for looking down ladies' tops.
Ingenious.
Captain, I really, really think it would be best if I take over from here.
There's a certain manner in which these things are conduc...
Nonsense, Chuck.
What this science stuff needs is a bit of showmanship!
Look, it's the captain.
Captain! Captain!
Shh!
Fellow scientists, poindexters, geeks, prepare to be confounded.
Prepare to be amazed.
Prepare to...
Oh-ho, wait a second.
What's this?
What's this?
Stop!
I am the world's leading doctor, and I declare the science you are doing is too shocking by half.
Dr. Albino, are you saying that those of a nervous disposition should leave immediately, in case the sheer unexpected remarkableness of my discovery should cause their hearts to explode?
Uh... lam.
Well, science lovers, you have been warned.
This is our most educational adventure ever.
(PLAYING
ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA)
Back from the dead.
Back from beyond the grave.
Back to astound you all.
The ninth wonder of the world.
She's traveled halfway across the globe to be here tonight.
Here's Polly!
MAN: It's a dodo.
By Jove.
That is astounding!
An actual dodo!
Makes electricity look like a pile of crap.
(LIGHT BULB CRACKLING
WITH ELECTRICITY)
MAN:
The Royal Society's prize for best scientific discovery...
Oh, I hope it's not a check.
...Is awarded to...
Have you any idea what the sterling-doubloon exchange rate is these days?
...the Scientist Captain.
Thank you, thank you.
You're too kind.
Please stop.
Enough. Thank you.
Thank you.
(GASPS) Is that it?
Oh, no.
Ah, good.
You also get this leather-bound set of encyclopedias.
Excuse me just one moment.
Thank you.
Okay, Chuck.
Now, I like encyclopedias as much as the next man, but they're not exactly gonna help me win Pirate of the Year, are they?
Where's the booty?
Booty? What booty?
The prize! The "untold riches," remember?
Oh.
Perhaps I didn't explain.
It's not all about money.
No, the real prize is...
MAN: Her Royal Majesty, the Empress of India,
Ruler of the Kingdom of Java...
...a personal audience with...
...Defender of the Faith,
Queen Victoria!
Queen Victoria herself.
Scientist Captain, congratulations.
What a tremendous discovery.
(STAMMERING) Your, uh...
Your Majesty.
And who are these charming fellows?
Well, this is my crew.
By which he means lab assistant crew.
Yes, yes. I'm using "crew" in the street sense.
Yo.
And I'm Charles Darwin,
Your Majesty.
I helped find the dodo.
Yes, whatever.
But where has your delightful creature disappeared to?
Resting, ma'am.
Hidden away.
I only let her out for the big performance, I'm afraid.
In case sinister forces should try to make off with her, you see.
Sinister forces?
Ooh, dear.
Well, we have a wonderful petting zoo at the palace where Polly would be quite safe.
Perhaps we could take her off your hands.
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's out of the question.
But she'd have a lovely time.
There are guinea pigs and a donkey.
No, no, I couldn't, ma'am.
Not even for little old me?
No, no, no,
I'm afraid not, ma'am.
No, you see, there is nothing more important to a pirate than his trusted dodo.
She is the feathery heart and soul of the boat.
Did you say...
..."pirate"?
Pirate? No, no, no, no, no.
Scientist. (CHUCKLES)
Yes, good old, good old science.
Can't get enough of it.
Mixing stuff together.
You know, test tube tubing and Bunsen burning.
See? (GRUNTS)
He's no scientist!
He's a Girl Guide!
Ooh! (GRUNTS)
He's no Girl Guide!
He's a pirate!
BOTH: Pirate!
Hang on, hang on.
There's been some kind of mistake. Some...
Some silly mistake
Whoa, laddies!
Stop, stop. I can explain.
Your Majesty.
He's hidden the dodo.
If you chop his head off now, we might never find out where.
Wait a mo.
One doesn't know why.
Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard or his gleaming teeth or the way he smells faintly of coconuts.
But we have taken a shine to this pirate.
Do you have a name, pirate captain?
They call me the Pirate Captain.
Well, Pirate Captain, we hereby pardon you of your piratical crimes.
You will stay in London,
Pirate Captain, and entertain us with your stories and your wit.
And especially your dear little dodo.
Hell's barnacles.
Can we please get out of here now?
That was a bit close for comfort, Number Two.
I will get you the dodo,
Your Majesty.
See that you do,
Mr. Darwin.
Ooh! Uh...
Captain?
Captain! Captain!
Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.
Let's get back to sea where we belong.
PIRATES:
Aye, aye, Captain!
I told you coming to London was a bad idea.
The sooner I get the smell of brine in my...
DARWIN: Captain!
Captain!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You're not leaving, surely?
I most certainly am.
You've let me down badly, Charles.
Look! Look!
Also, to be frank...
Captain...
...your nose is too small for your face.
But you're the toast of London Town.
Oh, I say, look at that.
Ooh!
They've really captured my eyes.
We were hoping you might come out for a little celebration before you go.
We don't want to miss the tide, Captain.
No, no, no. Quite right, quite right.
Oh, Captain, do join us, please?
I'll just stop for a quick one.
Rude to refuse.
But it's Ham Night.
I'll be 20 minutes.
Half an hour tops.
Just get her... Get her warmed up without me.
Aren't we going yet?
Shh!
(WHISPERING) But what about winning the Pirate of the Year and showing all those other captains that he's not a loser?
WOMAN: Yoo-hoo!
Come along, Captain.
Captain...
Cheers!
Good evening.
Thank you.
Thank you so very much.
Captain... PIRATE CAPTAIN:
And your name is?
DARWIN: Miss Jane Austen.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: And that, and that is why, in a straight fight, a shark would probably beat a Dracula.
Jane Austen, feel free to use it in one of your books.
Oh, Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur.
So much better than the last chap we all went doolally over.
You've all been
(SLURPING) terribly kind.
Oh!
Oh, do run along.
Another drink, Captain?
Hmm? Cheers, Chuck.
Huh?
I say, you're not related in some way, are you?
Pardon?
It's just you, sort of...
Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Cheers.
Do you know what
I've discovered, Charles?
The friends you make after you've become famous are better, truer friends than the ones you've had for years beforehand.
So very wise.
But the lads will think I'm a fool.
No. A fool, you? Oh.
You're an intellectual giant.
Just look at how you managed to keep Polly safe from those sinister forces.
Yes, I did do that, didn't I?
You did.
And wherever she's hidden,
I bet it's somewhere really ingenious.
It is rather.
You'll never guess where.
Well, no, why, you're too smart for me, Captain.
Right under everyone's noses.
Or right under my noses, anyhow.
Ta-d a!
You've been keeping Polly in your beard?
Actually,
I keep all sorts in here.
I'm sorry about this, Captain.
About what?
Oh.
What the... What's the monkey-man playing at? (CHUCKLES)
This patently isn't even a real... (SCREAMS)
Come back here, you lubbers!
Sorry, Your Reverence.
Aha!
Got you, you rogue!
Yeah, that's rather nice.
Neptune's lips, what are you up to?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.
What do you mean
"not your fault"?
You steal Polly, you shoot my best hat full of holes.
Hmm?
Well, go on, then.
Explain yourself.
There's this girl.
I'm hopelessly smitten with her.
I'm listening.
I know how partial she is to exotic animals, and I thought if I could get her the dodo, then she might like me.
Oh, I'm so ashamed.
Why didn't you say so?
We've all done stupid things to impress girls.
Yeah, you should act aloof.
They love it when you act aloof.
Still, must be quite a girl for you to go to all that trouble.
QUEEN VICTORIA:
She is quite a girl.
Kraken's biscuits!
Mr. Darwin.
Honestly, Charles.
It's the bun. The bun really does it for me.
QUEEN VICTORIA: And I see you've brought a friend.
How delightful.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
Oh, get a grip, man. You couldn't manage one tiny task, could you?
It's pathetic.
Oh.
Listen, Captain, I can see I've gone about this all wrong.
You see, I might have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and soul of a person who really, really wants that dodo.
I seem to recall that you piratical types have a bit of a soft spot for shiny things.
Or am I getting you muddled up with magpies?
(STUTTERING) I couldn't.
I mean,
Polly, she's a family...
Come now, Captain, it's so simple.
Polly here could live like a queen at my petting zoo, and you...Well...
With treasure like this, you could be famed across the seven seas.
NUMBER TWO: Captain.
Polly's not for sale.
You? Win Pirate of the Year?
You're a shoo-in, sir.
There's not a pirate on the seven seas can match you.
But what about winning
Pirate of the Year and showing all those other captains that you're not a loser?
(ECHOING) Loser... Loser...
Whee!
I'm a floating head.
So, Captain.
Are you going to do the right thing?
J' I'm sailing out on the ocean
J' Out on the deep blue sea J'
20 minutes, he said.
Didn't he say 20 minutes?
Don't worry, lads.
He probably just got caught up,
(EXHALING) you know, battling a giant squid or something.
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
Well, come on, you lubbers!
(LAUGHS) It's him!
I told you!
I... I told you he wouldn't let us down.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Hello, boys.
Miss me?
I'm having a mirage.
But... How?
Good question, Number Two.
I stole it all in a daring raid on the Tower of London.
You stole all this from the Tower of London?
That's right.
Then I burnt it to the ground, wrestled a bear, oh, and I kissed a princess for good measure.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Don't just stand there like porpoises.
There's atrophy with our names on it!
Set a course for Blood Island!

And welcome to the 59th Annual
Pirate of the Year Awards!
This is the ticket, eh, Number Two?
Oh, please, please, please, can't Polly come out now?
(STUTTERS) Best not.
She's still very tired.
And here is your host for the evening... Shush.
The Pirate King!
Hello, Pirates!
ALL: Hello, Pirate King!
Any lubbers in tonight?
ALL: No!
ALL: Behind you!
MAN: (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, I'm Queen Victoria!
And I hate pirates!
Ooh!
Oh, come on, cheer up.
PIRATE KING:
And now, you swabs, this is the big one.
The nominees for Pirate of the Year are as follows:
Black Bellamy.
Cutlass Liz.
Peg-Leg Hastings.
And a surprise late entry, the Pirate Captain!
The panel of independent judges have counted each pirate's booty and declared that this year's winner is the Pirate Captain!
Oh. Oh.

BELLAMY: Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Listen, this is all very moving.
I'm welling up here, but...
Bellamy, this is most irregular!
So is this!
ALL: (GENTLY) Aw!
It seems Queen Victoria has pardoned the Pirate Captain.
No!
So what if she did?
BELLAMY:
If you've been pardoned then, technically, you're no longer a pirate.
And if you're no longer a pirate, you really can't be
Pirate of the Year, now, can you?
No, you can't!
That's right!
Is this true?
(STUTTERING) Well, that's one, frankly, rather negative way of looking at it.
Villainous treachery!
Treacherous villainy!
You have betrayed the pirating fraternity.
But, Pirate King...
Your pirate hat and coat!
Your pirate badge with googly eyes.
And your World of Hooks discount card.
Confiscate his treasure!
Every last bit of it.
Begone! May your lubber shame bear down upon you.
You are hereby banished from Blood Island!
You are a pirate no more!
And stay out!
Yes, well, not a...
Not a total success.
We don't need them and their stupid awards.
The best thing about being a pirate isn't the treasure.
It's the cutlasses.
It's Ham Night.
It's Polly.
Where is Polly, Captain?
(CHUCKLES) What do you mean?
You know where she is.
She's been upset enough.
(SIGHS) Captain...
Oh... (GRUNTS)
Okay, Okay.
I sold her to Queen Victoria for a boatload of treasure.
There, I've said it.
Oh, well, come on.
She was just a parrot.
I mean, she wasn't even a parrot.
Always weeing on the boat's carpets, biting everyone.
She gave half of us tetanus, for goodness sake.
But she was our Polly.
(STUTTERING) Well, you know, you should be happy for her.
She'll be, she'll be living the high life.
Eating gold bricks wrapped up in, you know, swans.
Well, where are you swabs going? Come on.
Well, we'll have an adventure somewhere tropical with those native ladies whose outfits don't leave much to the imagination.
Looks like it's just you and me now, eh, Number Two?
Good old inseparable you and me.
Us two against the world, eh?
Yeah?
Like serrano ham and, you know, that other kind of ham.
Arrr.
You can't always just say
"arrr" at the end of a sentence and think that makes everything all right.
Fine.
Fine, go on, then. Go.
Go!
It's not like I need any of you, anyway.
See if I care.
J' I'm not crying
J' It's just been raining...
See if I care.
J' On my face
J' And if you think you see some tear tracks down my cheeks
J' Please, please
J' Don't tell my mates
J' I'm not crying
J' No, I'm not crying
J' And if I am crying

I told them not to
J' These aren't tears of sadness, they're tears of joy
J' I'm just laughing
J' Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
J' I'm not crying
J' I'm not crying
: Crying T
Huh?
DARWIN: You're too late.
She's gone.
Charles?
Is that you?
What are you doing here?
We're tramps now. It's not unlike being a scientist, but...
...with less experiments and more drinking your own sweat.
But where's Polly?
Why isn't she in her cage?
Oh, it's too horrible.
"Banquet for world leaders"?
I've been a fool for love.
Victoria never wanted
Polly for her petting zoo.
"Terrine of Tiger,
Black Rhino Ragout,
"Panda Face Fritters"?
I've discovered the Queen is a member of a terrible secret dining society.
Kings, queens, emperors from around the world, they meet on her flagship, the QV1, to eat the rarest and most endangered creatures they can find.
This year, the highlight is...
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
"Dodo a l'Orange"?
She's going to eat Polly?
It's all my fault.
I'm an awful human being.
I'll never get a girlfriend.
Now pull yourself together, man.
Ow!
Now listen, Charles, we've all done something unforgivable.
I've betrayed my pirate honor, you've betrayed science, and Mr. Bobo's betrayed the animal kingdom.
We've got to rescue her.
Us?
Against the crowned heads of the world on an impregnable warship?
It's impossible odds!
It's only impossible if you stop to think about it.
Come on, we didn't evolve from slugs just to sit here drinking our own sweat, now, did we?
Are you with us, Mr. Bobo?
"Are you out of your..."
Oh, I say.
Well, pah!
We can do without the monkey-man.
Sorry, what was that about slugs?
No time for that now
Come on.
J' Ready, said are you ready to go?
J' Said are you ready?
Prepare to be boarded, nerds.
J' Full Stop, me, stop, Full Stop
J' Ranking Full Stop
J' That is my name and I would really, really say
J' Full Stop,
Ranking Full Stop
J' Ranking Full Stop...
It's true! You can see down ladies' tops.
Keep pedaling, Charles.
J' Said are you ready to stop?
I said stop
Help!
J' Ready, said are you ready to go?
J' Said are you ready?
J' Said are you ready to go?
J' Full Stop, me, stop, Full Stop
J' Ranking Full Stop
J' As I would tell you 'bout this song, now come on...
Oh!
J' Said are you ready?
J' Said are you ready to stop?
I said stop
J' I'm dead J'
Neptune's nostrils.
Not a thing.
Where the devil can she be?
Uh, Captain?
Pedal faster, Chuck!
DARWIN: But how on earth do we get on board?
This might sting a bit.
I really don't...
Catch hold of something!
Good man.
How do you like my pygmy elephant nuggets, Your Majesty?
Hmm. They're good, but not quite rare enough for my tastes.
Not rare enough?
Only three have been seen in the last 50 years.
As many as three?
(CHUCKLES) Well, well.
Just wait until you see what
I've got for the main course.
Gaston?
Gaston?
Are you there?
Oui, Your Majesty.
Gaston, I think we're ready.
Neptune's teeth.
There's not a moment to lose.
We've got to find that kitchen.
But it's hopeless. Where do we even start to... Shh, shh.
So that's why I reckon, in a straight fight, a shark would probably beat a Dracula.
No!
Course, a Frankenstein versus a jellyfish, well, that's a different matter.
All clear, Chuck.
Chuck?
It's all right,
Charles, I'm coming!
Don't worry, I'll just...
Charles?
Just... Just hang on!
Ow! (GROANS)
Charles?
Poseidon's lips!
Are you all right, Charles?
GUARD: Hey, you there!
What are you doing here?
Ah! Well, now.
Excellent question.
All exotic animals should have been delivered to the chef by now.
What?
What is it?
Some sort of duck?
Oh. Yes, yes.
That's it, yes.
(MUFFLED) Quack, quack.
Hurry up, then.
Kitchen's that way.
Yeah, come away! Go on.
DARWIN: (MUFFLED)
Quack, quack.
Here we go, my Pretty-
It's time to be...
...délicieux!
Mmm.
(GASPS) Mon dieu!
Polly, come to Daddy.
Oh, I'm sorry, old girl.
I will never, ever leave you again.
I promise.
I will never leave you.
Perhaps we'd best make a move.
Hmm?
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Back to the balloon.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Gaston?
Gaston?
Hello ?
Captain. No.
Hello, Your Majesty.
The dodo is coming tout de suite.
This really isn't wise. Oh.
Claudette est dans Ia bibliotheque.
DARWIN:
Please, I think we...
But you know, Your Majesty, you cannot hurry the cooking.
Is a very delicate recipe, uh?
And the dodo is a very fattening dish.
Perhaps is not so good for you.
(BELL DINGS) And, you know, the calories, they will go straight to your chubby thighs.
Captain.
A minute on the lips is a lifetime on the...
Zut alors!
Well, well.
Pirate Captain.
Here you are again. And...
Oh. my-
Is that Mr. Darwin behind those feathers?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Hello.
What a delightfully unexpected surprise.
You know,
I think, secretly...
...I've always loved you, Charles.
Gosh.
Really?
No!
Give me my dodo!
Now, come on, Vickie, be sensible.
It's just you, a tiny queen, against me, a dashing terror of the high seas.
En garde!
Oh, dear!
Poor defenseless me.
What is a girl to do?
Now, steady on.
Now careful.
Do you know why
I really hate pirates?
Childhood trauma, was it?
Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby?
Beard envy?
It's because you're out-of-date.
You're dinosaurs!
All that
"romance of the seas" guff!
Aha!
Oh.
Right, where were we?
Look at you.
You should be extinct.
Along with your little friend!
Pity you can't eat pirates, really.
But you'd probably taste of barnacles.
Whereas, dear little
Polly here is going to be absolutely delicious!
Mr. Bobo?
Give me back my dinner!
Captain, catch!
Number Two!
Sorry, Vickie.
Dodo is off the menu.
Eh? (GASPS)
Oh, no, no, stop!
Stop!
Stop!
I'm being squashed by giant barrels of vinegar!
Good work, Chuck.
Number Two, what are you doing here?
How did you find me?
Where are the lads?
Don't worry, they're on the case.
It's all thanks to Mr. Bobo here.
He rowed halfway across the ocean to tell us what you were up to.
And, you know,
I figured you tend to end up wrapped in sausages facing certain death at about this point in an adventure.
(CHUCKLES) Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Listen, uh, (STUTTERING)
Number Two, I...
I realize I let you down.
CURVACEOUS PIRATE: Sorry.
I let everybody down.
You know, I've...
Well, I've done some pretty appalling things in my piratical career. (CHUCKLES)
Like that time I used babies as squid bait.
Or that other time
I thought it would be okay to let a turtle drive the boat.
But the thing is...
I mean, what I'm trying to say is...
You decided to single-handedly take on Queen Victoria's flagship, in order to rescue Polly.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
That's terrifically idiotic.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Yes.
It's also the reason why me and the lads, well, we still think you're the best pirate on the seven sea...
Gadzooks!
No!
Polly!
Oh, no, you don't.
Captain?
Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye.
That's it, Polly.
Snip-snip.
Come on, little dodo.
Bitey-bite.
The dumpy lady's got Polly!
Snip-Snip
Bite it!
Bite it, you stupid bird!
Bite it!
QUEEN VICTORIA: No!
My dodo!
Polly!
QUEEN VICTORIA: My dinner!
Oh, barnacles.
Well done, sir.
Hey!
Wah-hey, Captain!
Whoo! Whoo!
Fair play to you, sir.
(CHUCKLES) Wah-hey!
This is our most unexpectedly heartwarming adventure ever.
QUEEN VICTORIA: You'll swing for this!
Curse you!
And after you've done swinging,
I'll chop your head off!
I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!
Does that mean he's not pardoned anymore?
"Pardoned"?
You'll be outlawed across the globe!
There'll be a higher price on your head than any pirate before you!
The whole world will know your name!
NUMBER TWO: Welcome back,
Captain.
Yay!
See ya!
Bye!
Bye-bye!
J' You can get it if you really want
J' But you must try
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles.
Good luck with the science.
Thank you, Captain.
Oh, and just a little tip, grow yourself a beard.
It'll make your face look less lumpy.
J' You've got your mind set on a dream
J' You can get it though hard it may seem now
100,000 doubloons.
Not bad, eh, Mr. Bobo?
J' You can get it if you really want
J' But you must try, try and try
That... I...
Is this a bit of squid tentacle?
ALBINO PIRATE: Yeah.
And that's my earwax.
I keep telling you, it's never been about the trophies or the treasure.
It's about who you are, inside.
I say, you're not...
Not a woman disguised as a man, are you, Number Two?
No.
Because that does happen surprisingly often at sea.
J' But the harder the battle, you see
J' Is the sweeter, the victory now
J' You can get it if you really want
J' If you really want
J' You can get it if you really want
J' But you must try J'
Well, come on, you coves.
Those treasure chests won't plunder themselves.
Hoist the flag!
ALL: Aye, aye, Captain!
Set a course for adventure!
PIRATE CAPTAIN:
You see? I told you.
Didn't I tell you?
Just added on for decoration, my foot.
J' We are young
We run green
J' Keep our teeth nice and clean
J' See our friends
See the sights
J' Feel all right
J' We wake up
We go out
J' Smoke a fag
Put it out
J' See our friends
See the sights
J' Feel all right
J' Are we like you?
I can't be sure
J' Of the scene
As she turns
J' We are strange in our worlds
J' But we are young
We get by
J' Can't go mad
Ain't got time
J' Sleep around
If we like
J' But we're all right

Bought some wheels
J' Took it out
Across the fields
J' Lost control
Hit a wall
J' But we're all right
J' Are we like you?
I can't be sure
J' Of the scene
As she turns
J' We are strange in our worlds
J' But we are young

MARS NEEDS MOMS (2011)
NASA scientists are excited over recent findings by the Mars Rover
of fossilised organic compounds on the surface that indicate
at some time in the past there may have been life on the red planet.
Thank you.
Was it really that hard?
Every day with the trash!
What is the big deal?
Well, can you imagine what the world would look like
- if nobody took out the trash?
- Yeah, it would be awesome.
And speaking of trash, have you cleaned your room yet?
And don't forget to shut the door.
Milo, sweetie, can you get that?
I have to do everything around here.
Stromboli's Slave Shack, captive 331 speaking.
- Hey, stinker.
- Dad! Hey, are you almost home?
Because the movie starts at five, and then it starts again at seven, and I...
Hold on. Slow down. Slowdown.
I don't think I'm gonna make it back in time.
Well, you can't miss the beginning.
That's when the vampires take over the submarine...
No, I know. I know. But... looks like my flight's cancelled.
And no one's flying till this weather lets up.
I'm really sorry, Milo.
I'll make it home as soon as I can.
- I love you.
- OK. Bye.
- Hi, honey. What's up?
- Stuck at the airport.
That's too bad. Milo was really looking forward to...
- I was looking forward to taking him.
- Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
Well, maybe if he finishes all his dinner
he could watch Zombie Dawn III on pay-per-view.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
You didn't eat your broccoli.
Broccoli makes me barf.
Besides, it looks like brains.
Well, you like zombies.
Zombies eat brains.
Mom, no one likes zombies.
They're an abomination.
I'm committed to their annihilation.
OK. Well, no broccoli, no TV.
Milo!
Come over here.
- Is that broccoli?
- No. That's vomit,
- but I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.
Well, you're not gonna make me eat it now, are you?
- Go to bed.
- But you said I could watch...
No. That was before you lied to me and poisoned the cat!
- That broccoli was poisonous?
- No!
Of course the broccoli wasn't poisonous.
- Well, you just said that...
- No!
I meant that it's poisonous to the cat.
Well, how can it be good for me if it's poisonous to the cat?
Because cats are not supposed to eat vegetables.
Maybe I'm not supposed to eat vegetables.
Milo! Just go to bed.
Now.
I thought I told you to go to bed!
You told me to go to bed.
You didn't say get into bed.
- It's not specific.
- Milo!
My life would be so much better if I didn't have to be a nagging mom.
Yeah, well, my life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all.
Cujo. Wake up.
I can't sleep.
I shouldn't have said what I said, should I?
It wasn't a good thing to say.
I feel really bad about it.
I should go tell her I'm sorry.
Right? I'm gonna go tell her I'm sorry. Right now.
Mom? Are you still up?
'Cause I wanted to tell you that...
Mom?
Mom?
Milo?
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
Mom!
Let her go! Let her go!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Mom!
Let me go!
Hey! I'm... I'm caught in here!
Let me...
Wow! I'm in a spaceship!
This is so cool!
Did I get super powers?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello?
What's going on?
Low gravity!
Keep it together!
Jump down chute number three.
What? Who's there?
Hey, keep it quiet, and jump down chute number three!
You want me to jump in there?
Why?
Jump down chute number three!
Just jump down the chute!
Relax, it's like... a water slide...
... without the water!
Or the slide.
A world of trash!
It is awesome.
Zombies!
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!
I know karate!
Well, at least on the Wii.
No! I don't... I don't...
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just trying to find my mom.
- I want to find my mom.
- Mom?
Don't you understand? My mom.
- Mom? Mom!
- Yeah, my mom.
No, my mom. She's the one that feeds me. She feeds me...
- Feem? Feem?
- Yeah, my mom. She feeds me.
No, no, she... she... she washes my clothes.
She washes my clothes.
You know, my...
No, my... No, she... she...
My mom. She vacuums the house.
You know, she vacuums the house.
Yeah, she's the one...
No.
No. No, that's not it.
Stop. No! My... my mom.
She's the one that...
She tucks me in at night.
She tucks me in? My mom?
Can you... can you?
No. No!
No, you can't...
What are you doing?!
Let go of me.
OK. All right. Chill out, Chachi.
You seriously don't want to get dropped right now.
You!
You sent me down a trash chute, you jerk!
Yeah. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
Prepare to disembark the aircraft.
Let him down easy, TwoCat.
- Hello?
- You like video games, man?
Check it out. Space flight simulator.
I programmed it from the manual so it's just like the real thing.
I'm just messing with you.
Hey, brother!
Yeah. You're not a Martian.
You're a kid.
Man, it's been so long since
I've seen another kid.
Hey!
I'm excited, too, buddy.
My name is Gribble.
Gribble the First.
What's your handle?
No, wait, let me guess. Maverick.
- No.
- Wolfman?
- No.
- Iceman.
- No.
- Did you see Top Gun?
- It's Milo.
- Milo. How low can you go, Milo?
How 'bout I call you "My Bro"?
Check it.
You're a person...
...from Earth!
- Shut up!
What, are you crazy?
I'm part of Ronald Reagan's secret astronaut programme.
The Secronauts.
You might have heard of us.
We're here to stop the threat of interplanetary Communism throughout the galaxy.
Why else do you think they call it "the Red Planet"?
I do crazy stuff like that all the time, man.
You're gonna have so much fun here.
It's wobbly and shaky here.
Come on! I wanna show you something.
You gotta move pretty fast to keep up with me, buddy.
- Wait.
- Come on down!
Hey, check my room out, bro!
Oh, man.
You're not used to the low gravity yet?
OK, OK, OK. Don't worry, man.
I can totally fix that.
I can fix anything.
There we go. I got an extra.
Listen, I just wanna try and find my mom.
This'll hold you down.
- What is it?
- Right here. OK? I'm gonna patent it, call it the Gribblemeister 3000.
It's working, right? That's awesome.
I wanna show you something cool.
- What?
- Hold on tight. Banzai!
The weight belt helping you?
Check this out, man.
They're trying to figure out how you escaped. Watch this.
Oh, my word! I cannot get out! Help me!
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Watch this, watch this, watch this.
You wanna hear what they're saying?
Sure you do.
Wait. Gribble, I wanna find my mom.
TwoCat! That is disgusting.
Here we go.
What is that?
- That's a translator.
- Wait.
- Supervisor not likee.
- Getting off me, you Martian!
Unauthorised dogpile!
- "Unauthorised dogpile"?
- I know. They say that all the time.
Come with me, man. This is so cool.
Hey! Come on in.
What do you think, bro?
- About what?
- About the room, bud.
It's for you, man.
What do you think?
- For me?
- Oh, don't mind this guy.
I just tried to train him to be like my wingman, you know, but he's useless.
It's more like a wing nut.
Oh, gosh.
I'm gonna get rid of him.
But forget it, man. That's all history.
- 'Cause I got you now!
- Me?
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and me, bro.
Best buds hanging out forever.
Playing video games all day, watching TV all night.
There's no such thing as too much TV, man.
Mom?
Oh, yeah.
Maybe there is such a thing as too much TV.
- No. Wait.
- I wanna show you something in here.
What are they saying?
Subject will be terminating.
- Oh-four, oh-three...
- "Terminating." Terminating?
Terminating. I love that movie.
Hey, you know what? Let's go. I wanna show you something cool, dude.
No, wait. Gribble, what's going on?
I don't wanna tell ya, and you can't make me. OK?
- Just forget about it.
- No, Gribble, tell me.
- Please!
- System overload! System overload!
- Tell me!
- Help! Hey!
- Tell me!
- Oh, my...
Get... Uncle! Get off!
Chafe-y.
All right.
All right, I'll tell you.
Fact is...
...Mars needs moms.
What the heck does that mean?
These are hatchlings.
They are baby Martians, and they pop out of the ground, like potatoes, every 25 years or so.
And the Martians, they're terrible at mothering, which is ironic, really, since the ones running the place upstairs, they're all female.
- Can you get to the point?
- I... All right.
What they are good at is building robots, right?
So they build these Nanny-bots to raise the girls.
And each Nanny-bot gets one kid to raise, and then it's toast.
It can't be reused after that.
Who knew mothering was so hard?
"Hard?"
- So why did they take my mom?
- OK.
They have to program the
Nanny-bots each time, right?
So... they find someone who is really good at controlling their own kid.
Hey, that's my house.
And that's me!
Are these my mom's memories?
Yeah.
See, all these Martians care about is order and discipline.
What was that one about?
Just tell me what they're gonna do to my mom.
All right.
Right up there.
You see, they have this memory extraction machine.
It takes the discipline out of the mom and it puts it into the Nanny-bots.
It works on some kind of solar-wind focusing system.
And when the sun rises...
...they extract what they need to program the Nanny-bots, and that's it.
OK? That's it.
Wait. So my mom is gonna lose all her memories?
Yeah, something like that.
No, that... that can't happen.
- We've gotta save her!
- Well, that's impossible,
- so, like, get over it and move on.
- But we've gotta try.
- We've gotta try!
- This, my friend, is a Martian wristwatch.
You see the bars here?
Counts down to sunrise.
So you must have about 6.93 Earth hours left.
Less than seven hours? That's all?
Let's say that, for the sake of argument, that we do, we disguise you.
And we use all this awesome spy gear to guide you up to the surface.
Those Martians, man, they...
They're gonna spot you.
They're gonna chase you and shoot at you and... and... and...
Wait a minute.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
But you just said they're gonna shoot at me.
What? Oh, hey. What you talking about,
"shoot"? "Shoot"? That's crazy talk.
- That's what you said.
- Who said that?
Someone say he's gonna shoot at him?
What are you talking about, brother?
No one's shooting at anybody.
Don't even sweat it.
You trust me.
This is gonna be great.
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact, this is gonna be...
...Gribbletastic. Yeah!
I don't know, Gribble.
Are you sure this is gonna work?
Yeah, dude. It's gonna be awesome.
That disguise totally rocks.
Trust me, you're gonna blend right in.
Even the SISS won't spot you.
The SISS? What's the SISS?
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention them.
They're the Supervisor's
Secret Security.
They're the ones in the black uniforms.
But I'll take care of them, man.
Don't worry about it.
Anything else you "forgot to mention"?
What? No. What're you... Me?
Dude, honest Injun, man.
We're in this together.
Once he gets up top, he's gonna give himself away.
They're gonna chase him halfway around Mars, and I'm gonna save his butt.
And he's gonna be so totally grateful.
It's gonna be so cool.
Give me a break.
OK, OK. So, it's a... it's a fib, but it's for his own good, man.
After this, he'll stay down here, where it's safe.
OK, go ahead.
Dude, you march like a girl!
Which is kind of perfect.
There's that bleached-prune lady again.
Who is that?
That's the Supervisor.
She's like the school lunch lady,
only with the power to execute you on sight.
Man, Mars needs Botox.
Don't mess with her.
She runs everything around here.
Gribble, are you seeing this?
Yeah, man. Those tags are so cool.
I don't know who does 'em, but the Supervisor hates 'em.
Oh, hey, look sharp, man.
You see that tall building up ahead?
That's the Citadel.
Your mom's up at the top.
You get up there and get your mom.
I am gonna program the ship
and make it repeat its last
Earth mission, and then, boom!
You're through the wormhole and home in time for Pop-Tarts. OK? Easy.
TwoCat, this is it, man.
They're gonna spot him here for sure.
Stop it. Don't look at me like that.
I'm gonna take care of him.
Check it out, all right?
When he gets to the checkpoint gate, he's gonna trigger the alarm, the guards'll close in,
I'm gonna press this button.
The cleaning hatch is gonna open, gonna drop down to the maintenance floor, where he can escape down the trash chute. See? It's very simple.
OK. It'll all be fine.
But if anything, you know, weird or unexpected happens,
just run like crazy, OK?
You see?
Totally in my control.
I pushed the wrong one.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Gribble, where are they taking me?
OK, just give me a minute.
Don't have an aneurysm.
Oh, man, OK, you're going up, and that's not good.
I thought I wanted to go up?
Well, yes and no.
This is a very, very bad up.
OK, OK, OK... don't panic.
- Get ready.
- For what?
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!
And he's off! Yes! Finally.
Gribble! Which way now?
- Dang, I'm good!
- Gribble!
I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side
Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot and tell me which way!
Did you just call me an idiot?
Which way? I'm lost here!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I think that you have to apologise now.
Gribble!
I'm waiting.
All right, all right, I'm sorry!
Apology accepted. Go left.
No, no, no, no, not that left!
Not that left, not that left!
Back up, man!
- Turn it down, Gribble!
- TwoCat, turn off your alarm!
What is going on here? TwoCat?
Oh, no. Mommy? Mommy!
Gribble! I need to know...
Gribble, come in. Are you there?
Gribble! Come on, Gribble, this is no time for the silent treatment!
Gribble? Help me.
I'm trapped, and there's nowhere to hide!
Gribble!
If not using ropes, my friend, you will needing wings.
We must cleaning paint off you before someone is seeing you.
It will getting you in trouble.
Giving me your helmet...
The Earth hatchling!
Gribble! Gribble, come in. They've spotted me! But I think I lost them!
Get off me! Let me go! Let me go!
Cool it! I gotta clean you up!
- Get off of me!
- Hey!
Mellow out, man!
I'm not the fuzz!
- I'm not bustin' you.
- You're not?
Check it out!
What is that?
- They were tracking me?
- Not you.
They were trackin' whoever you were chattin' with.
Who I was... who I was talk...
I was talking to Gribble! Oh, no!
No time! Sorry! No time!
You got time now?
This is so low temperature!
OK. You're from Earth, so you must know...
What do you "turn on"?
How do you "tune in"?
What do you "drop out" of?
What powers do flowers have?
That's English!
Where did you learn English?
Two quarters ago,
I was working in the administration block.
The Supervisor was talking with 113-Elder-331.
They were viewing some top-secret Earth documents.
When they left, I wanted to check out what was making the weird light.
What's going on here?
It's a chrysanthemum, baby.
A chrysanthemum?
That's not a chrysanthemum.
And it was...
... amazing!
So I copied all I could.
The way that light vibrated and sang!
Nothing in my world has ever made me feel like that!
It was like my eyes were open for the first time.
It was crazy beautiful, man.
This is a chrysanthemum.
Flower power, it's gonna change the world, man!
Yeah, that's just groovy, man.
They called it...
Colour.
Your hippie alien life story is totally interesting, but I'm kinda busy saving my mom!
You mean your Nanny-bot.
No! I mean my mom!
She's a human being!
Wait. No, but...
I saw inside her headspace.
You said, "My life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all."
I know what I said, but I was wrong, and I do want her.
Heavy! Why?
Because she...
She looks after me and she tells me what to do!
Oh, like the Supervisor!
No, not like the Supervisor!
My mom is kind.
She takes me to Disneyland, and she reads to me, and she makes me hot chocolate, and she puts bandages on my cuts, and she hugs me and she...
She loves me.
"Love"?
Chute number three.
Crazy.
Gribble? Can you hear me now?
Gribble?
Oh, no.
Gribble?
Gribble?
Gribble?
Gribble!
Oh, no. That's only five and a half hours!
Stupid weights.
"Private. Keep out.
No Martians allowed."
"Gribble."
"George Ribble."
He must've been a kid, too, when he came here.
Why wouldn't he tell me?
TwoCat? TwoCat!
Hold on, buddy.
Are you OK?
Oh, here. Where's Gribble, TwoCat?
I gotta find him!
He's the only person on this entire planet who can help me save my mom.
That burnt area. That's where they shoot people, isn't it?
That's a firing squad, and they're gonna shoot Gribble?
TwoCat, we gotta save him!
Ladies, ladies, you don't wanna do this.
Listen, I'm a walking A-bomb!
You shoot me, and the whole planet's gonna go up!
You don't want that on your conscience...
OK, seriously.
OK, you could be precipitating a major interplanetary war here, people, aliens, Martians.
OK, listen! I've been living in your sewers for years.
I'm disgusting, they're contaminated, and they need a vaccine and I'm the only one that has it.
OK. Listen. You made your point.
I invented some great stuff!
I can let you in on the ground floor, OK?
How 'bout blue mascara?
I've got a Slinky!
A Rubik's Cube?
You like Dungeons and Dragons,
I love Dungeons and Dragons.
How 'bout skateboards?
I got millions... OK. Hey!
I can get you a Cabbage Patch Kid. Not one of those gnarly ones, a real one.
What about a pizza?
You like crop circles?
I have quite a crop.
Oh, and I'll teach you how to moonwalk.
Can't really do it in these chains.
Legwarmers!
Wait, wait.
We're really gonna do this?
Unauthorised dogpile!
Hey! Milo, what are you doing here?
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?
It's exactly according to my plan!
Ki!
Hot, hot, hot!
Wait! Stop it with the shooting!
My toe! What are you doing?
Oh, my gosh!
When you're going to shoot a laser at someone, you should bring them a change of underwear!
Hairy Tribe Guys.
Wingnut?
- OK. OK. Thank you.
- Oh, come on. Let go!
- Let go! What are you doing?
- They're hugging!
It's all these males ever do! That's why the females chuck 'em down here!
We don't have time!
The SISS are gonna find us!
- Run!
- Run!
Wingnut! It's Wingnut!
OK. Come on! Come on.
What?!
Wingnut! No!
Wait!
Gribble!
Relax, Grib. Fat floats.
Hey!
Oh, nuts.
There goes my sexy tan.
Less than three and a half hours.
Echo!
This place is amazing!
It's Gribbletastic.
You have got to stop saying that.
You sound Gribblediculous.
Hey, hey.
TwoCat's homing in on our headsets.
I built him with a location device.
I think of everything.
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.
Stretch... stretch that bar across this rock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good, good, good.
You know this place is perfect?
We can rebuild right over there.
- You see that?
- No.
- Keep still.
- Yeah, right, sorry.
Build a whole new lair.
Be years before we fill this place up with our junk.
What do you say, pal?
You and me? Best buds?
You can be emperor this time.
And I... I shall be El Presidente.
Hey!
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this!
- Gimme that!
- But...
Maniac!
These things are dangerous!
Tried to blow up some trash once with one of these, almost took my foot off!
Yes!
Oh, good, it's nearly empty.
Anyway, why don't we go rebuild right over here. What do you think?
That lava slope looks like our best way up.
My mom's running out of time, Gribble.
- Let's go!
- Hey, no, come on!
It can't be done!
Did you see what happened up there?
Man, I nearly got toasted!
To death!
Thanks for saving me, but... I'm never going up there again, man.
You... You can't!
You can't just bail on me now!
Bye.
George!
Your name's George!
- What did you just call me?
- George.
George Ribble.
- You were a kid, like me!
- Where did you get this?
This is mine.
They took your mom, too, didn't they?
It's OK, Grib, I know how you feel!
How I feel? How I feel...
You have no idea how I feel.
You see this?
This is when they chose my mom.
But way before they chose yours.
I know, Gribble.
It happened to me the same way.
No. No, you don't know.
How could you possibly know?
I was a good kid.
I did my chores.
Put my things away.
I did as I was told.
Turns out, that's exactly why they chose her.
'Cause of me.
Man. What kind of message is that to send to a little kid?
I know. It's not fair!
I'll tell you what's not fair, man.
Not fair is when a bunch of scary aliens take your mama,
your only parent, away from you in the middle of the night.
Not fair is when you follow them, and you sneak onto their ship,
and you search but you can't find her.
And then you see her...
They got your mama strapped into some kind of machine.
Mom!
So I grabbed a couple of breathing helmets,
and I went to get her.
But I didn't know what I know now.
I didn't know...
... that when the sun came up, it'd start the machine.
I didn't know... what that machine was gonna do to her.
Not until it was too late.
And then I realised...
... I was all alone.
I'd never see my mom again.
And I'd never be able to tell her I loved her.
"Never be able to tell her you love her..." What do you mean?
No, no, you don't have to worry about that.
It's not gonna happen.
Not this time.
Not to you.
We're gonna go up there and we're gonna...
We're gonna go get your mom.
Really? You mean it?
Yeah. You and me, buddy.
Best buds, right?
- Thank you, Gribble.
- Yeah, man.
Yeah, we'll get your mom back, man.
"Best buds."
That's like the "love" thing, right?
My, my, my, my...
...my, my Sharona!
- No! Gribble!
- Evasive action!
I'm sorry.
- No, Gribble! Gribble, stop! Relax!
- Don't shoot me, please!
Gribble, Gribble! Relax! Listen!
She's not gonna shoot you!
- She's not gonna shoot you!
- She's not?
No! She's the one that helped us escape!
She is?
- TwoCat brought her.
- He did?
I used to be administration unit 231-Ki-312.
But now,
I'm down with your scene, man.
What is she talking about?
I don't know.
She talks like that a lot.
But I think she wants to help us, right?
Right on! Come on!
We gotta beat feet!
"Beat feet"?
Oh, you mean run! Yeah, we do!
- Yeah!
- All right, Gribble, let's go!
- OK! Come on!
- It's just so weird!
Come on, guys!
This is the way out!
Is there gonna be a lot of running?
Psychedelic! What are they?
They're paintings.
You know, like your flower graffiti.
Wait! Wait, wait! Ki, Ki!
Hold on. You're the one...
...that paints those flower tags?
That is so bad!
Bad? But... but it is meant to be good.
No. No, no, I mean... no.
Bad means good. I just,
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...
I think that...
I think you're amazing.
Gribble!
- You can change colour!
- What?
That is also..."bad".
What is that?
That? It looks like a family.
Kids and parents.
That's the "love" thing.
What are "parents"?
You know, people like my mom, who look after kids like me?
I guess you guys had families once.
You know, if you Martians had parents, you wouldn't have to kidnap moms to program your Nanny-bots.
- Come on.
- But...
But the Supervisor said that Martians have always been raised by machines.
Wow, looks like she lied to you, big time.
We never knew.
That's the Citadel.
We've got to get to the top.
That's where mission control is, on the surface.
Your mom is in the Extraction Machine here.
And your ride back to Earth is in the silo here.
That's all well and good, guys, but I don't think we're gonna make it to the Citadel.
Why are they checking everyone?
Well, you're kind of a celebrity now, buddy.
And who is that handsome devil next to you?
You better keep your heads down.
If they bust you, they will slap you in the joint!
Wait a minute. That's exactly where we wanna go!
Yeah! He's right on!
What? What... Hey!
We're going to jail?
No, no. When they first found me, they brought me straight to jail.
The jail's next to the silo where they keep the spaceship!
- OK.
- Sub-level two. Go ahead.
If we can get through the jail, and up through the silo, we can get to the surface.
And that's where Mom is.
Yes, but isn't the jail thousands of feet above us?
One thousand and thirty-two!
Wait! Wait a minute.
How strong is this line?
I'm a little over my goal weight right now. Hey!
OK. We've got to take out the guards, shut down the surveillance cameras, then we can sneak through the jail and get to the silo.
We catching the two terrorists.
Supervisor ordering we must locking them in cells.
Is this gonna work?
- No, wait.
- No! No, please, please, no!
I don't wanna go back to jail! Please!
No, no, please! No!
I need a doctor and I've got measles!
And I've got gingivitis!
And I've got male pattern baldness.
I will getting prisoner tranquilizers.
Where are they?
- Bottom left control.
- Restless leg syndrome!
I got Saturday Night Fever!
- Bat wing disorder!
- And halitosis!
Yes! Horrible halitosis! I do?
Hey! Awesome!
And this officially ends today's prison broadcast!
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!
OK, here's the plan.
I'll go get my mom.
You guys fire up the spaceship, and we'll be outta here before they can say...
- Hey, Grib, what are you doing?
- It's Wingnut, man!
He's still alive! Hey, bud.
I can't just leave him in here.
OK, well, get him out, but do it fast! We gotta go!
OK. Come on! This will do it.
Yeah! Come on out, you freakazoid!
I know. I know. It's OK.
What's with all the grabbing and squeezing?
It's called "hugging".
It's another love thing.
OK, enough already.
Come on! We gotta go!
Man! I must have opened up all the cells.
- Who let the dogs out?
- No duh.
What?
What's going on?
It's the hatchlings.
They're sorting them.
Yeah. The girls are all assigned their Nanny-bots.
And the boys are sent down below where they'll be raised by the Hairy Tribe Guys.
These guys knew a bunch of boy hatchlings were coming!
That's why they were dancing down in the trash. They were celebrating!
Yeah, but all the Hairy Tribe Guys are up here now.
There's no one down there to take care of them.
The boys are gonna be all alone.
And to be alone is...
...to be without the crazy love thing.
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys. We gotta go!
Wait. Wait!
Go down the garbage chutes!
Listen, listen! Guys!
If you jump down chute number three, you can save the hatchlings.
OK? Do you understand?
Chute...
...number... three!
- Come on, Grib.
- One, two, three!
- We gotta go! They'll figure it out!
No, they won't!
They're dumb as a box of rocks.
- Ki. It's no use.
- We gotta go!
Go, Wingnut!
On the other side of the rocket, there's a ladder up to the surface.
But how do we get past all those Martians?
I can totally fix that.
Hey, everybody grab a helmet.
Put it on real tight.
Good game. Good game. Good game.
Here. Don't forget that.
Keep in touch, kiddo.
Get up that ladder over there.
Good luck!
Wait a minute! Won't they see me from Mission Control?
No way, buddy.
They'll be looking into the rising sun.
Won't be able to see a thing. By the time they figure out what's going on,
we'll be on the couch eating Smurf
Berry Crunch and watching He-Man.
- Gribble.
- Gribble.
Yes. And I am Ki. Remember?
No, I know.
I mean... No, I said that because, well, you know, the ship's got this... voice-activated launch system.
And I had to record a word, and Ki just didn't seem like a word that would start an engine... you know?
Except...
...now that I think about it...
..."Ki" is like a perfect word to start an engine because it's, you know, used to...
...unlock things like...
...my heart.
I dig it when you change colour.
Gribble! Ki! I'm halfway there!
Oh, no!
What dummy left that there?
Milo?
Gribble, I think I fell into something!
Gribble, come in!
- It's OK, Ki. I've got him.
- Great job!
- Gribble!
- Hey.
- That's the second-to-last lens!
- We're not gonna make it!
You wanna bet? Yeah!
This thing is going on my Christmas list!
Guys! The SISS are gonna crash Mission Control!
They'll be through the airlock and on the surface any minute!
Oh, no! What do we do?
All right, take her in.
OK. You go save your mom.
I'll take care of the SISS.
- But, Gribble, they're gonna...
- No, no, no.
My mama always said,
"Son, you gotta do the right thing."
And for the first time since
I came to Mars, I'm doing it.
Man, I hope Ki saw that.
Go get 'em. Fire butt blasters!
Mom! Mom!
Mom, wake up! Wake up!
Milo, can you turn the cartoons down?
I'm trying to sleep.
No. Mom, come on. You gotta wake up!
We gotta get out of here!
Milo, the alarm hasn't even gone off.
Can you just let me sleep until sunrise?
Believe me, that would be a bad idea.
- Gribble!
- Gribble, Gribble, Gribble.
Oh, no! I activated the launch system.
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Come on, Mom. Come on!
We gotta go. Hurry!
Hurry! Mom, come on! Mom, Mom!
Milo? The launch system lit up.
I can't cool it.
You got two minutes.
Two minutes! Mom, come on.
We gotta hurry. Mom.
Wait a second.
Did you just pull me out of bed?
No! Mom, Mom.
Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me.
Look at me. I'll explain everything, but later. OK?
- Right now we gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?
- The ship.
- What ship?!
- That ship!
- Milo! Sixty seconds.
- Get it on!
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- OK.
- Here. Just put this on.
And then you gotta twist this lever to seal the neck. See? Like this.
- What do you mean?
- We need air. We can't breathe outside.
- There's no air?
- Mom, it's Mars.
OK. One, two, three!
Help!
Now, start running! Run!
Are those Martians?
Yeah. The hairy guys are good, and the uniforms are bad.
Let's just hope we don't see...
...the Supervisor!
No! Mom!
You gave me your helmet?
No! No! Mom! No! No!
No! Mom! Mom!
No! No! No!
No, Mom! Mom, no! No.
Mommy, you have to come home with me.
You have to come home with me!
You're... you're my mom...
...and I love you!
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
No!
Gribble! My mom!
Bingo.
Milo! I'm coming, buddy!
I got it. I got it.
Lift her head.
Milo. You saved me.
No. It was Gribble.
No, bro. No, it was you, man.
It was you.
You saved your mom, man.
I'm sorry for what I said before.
My life wouldn't be better without you.
Oh, Milo. My love.
Milo! Gribble!
I've got the ship under control...
- Ki!
- I'm good.
- I can buff out the scratches.
- Come on, Mom. We gotta go.
- We gotta go.
- Oh, OK.
Stopping right there!
This is not over.
You will surrendering.
Hey! Surrender this!
Ki! What are you doing?
I will not letting you do this.
Insolence!
You cannot stopping this.
This is the way it has always being.
No. No. No!
This is not the way it is always being.
She lied to us! Look!
We were not meant to being raised by machines.
We were meant to be raised by families.
By parents.
We were meant to having that... that...
That crazy love thing?
That crazy love thing.
Never!
You fool. I saved you!
Before any of you were even born
I realised we do not have time to raise hatchlings.
And the males? They never helped.
Always dancing and playing.
That is why we must throw them away.
There must be order.
Arresting the evildoers!
Evildoer, you.
No! I did this for you!
I did this for all of you!
You will be sorry. Let me go!
So are you gonna stay?
Wow.
Wow...
Actually, I think I'm gonna...
You know, Mars is different now.
I'm gonna hang out with Ki and...
...help paint and stuff.
He's really good at red.
Stop it.
So will I ever see you again?
What? Are you kidding me? Of course.
We'll keep in touch.
- How?
- What do you mean "how?"
I could fix it.
It's gonna be Gribbletastic.
Best buds?
You better believe it.
Thank you, Gribble.
Your mother would be proud of you.
It's my pleasure.
Oh, man.
I'm not crying. It's allergies.
Silly.
- Bye! Goodbye!
- Bye.
Bye!
I love you, Milo.
I know that... now.
- Dad!
- Hi, stinker.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Did something happen to Milo this weekend?
Colour.
Flower power is gonna change the world, man!
- Mark.
- No, that's vomit.
- But I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.
Well, you're not gonna make me eat it now, are you?
Mom!
My mom. She... she vacuums the house.
You know, she vacuums the house. My...
Yeah, she's the one.
Yeah, that... No.
I'm just messing with you.
Oh, don't mind this guy. He's a...
I just tried to train him to be like my wingman, you know, but he's useless.
He's more like a wing nut. Yeah!
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact, this is gonna be... Gribbletastic.
Yeah!
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!
And he's off! Yes! Finally.
I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side
Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot and tell me which way!
Did you just call me an idiot?
Mark.
- Get... Wait a minute!
- Gribble!
Let's hit every single pipe on the way down!
- Gribble!
- I'm trying!
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this.
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...
I think that...
I think that you're amazing.
Gribble!
- You can change colour!
- What?
That is also..."bad".
- Mark.
- Chute...
...number... three!
- One, two, three!
- Come on, Grib. We gotta go!
- They'll figure it out!
- No, they won't.
They're dumb as a box of rocks.
What dummy left that there?
No! Mom. Mom!
Mom. Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me.
Mom, look at me. Look at me.
I'll explain everything, but later. OK?
Right now we've just gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?
- The ship.
- What ship?!
- That ship!
Robin.
Look at me.
You believe me when I say that I love you?
This is how long?
24 years? 25?
I've always been there for you.
Still, whatever happens.
For all your choices, all your fears, for all... these sacrifices, these anxieties, I was there.
When you plaquais all just as filming was about to start.
" Help me, Al Get me out of here. "
"Get me out of here elegantly without ruining my reputation. "
"Aaron needs me at home. "
But Aaron is an excuse.
Bad choices.
This is the story of your life.
Bad choice, bad movies, bad guys, unreliable friends.
Even what you have not been able to choose, your mother, you make a bad choice, too.
You did everything for you.
Queen of the cinema 24 years.
All studios crawling at your feet.
I may have been too lenient with you, everyone said.
I do not know.
That may be true.
But you were just a kid.
You were scared.
You made your choice alone.
You slammed the doors, broke all dreams.
And now...
Now...
Now what, Al?
What do they offer? no idea, I'd like to know.
They yelled at me this morning against they were tired of us.
They spoke of a " final offer " which will not be renewed.
I quote: "The offer will not be renewed. "
In your opinion, what is it?
How would I know?
I know one thing: they do not remember.
They never talked to me like that.
Ever.
Forgiveness. Mom, we need you to go to.
What does he?
The airport security was called. As usual.
Aaron!
If the kite goes to the other side, you know what happens.
I know it will not happen.
It was what flight?
United 435, Rochester?
Actually, no.
Which then?
United, but not Rochester.
Let's see...
Wednesday, 18 h.
Fort Lauderdale?
I know, Minneapolis.
- That's not the important. - What is it?
The wind blew from the west, my princess proudly flown tracks and it was a perfect combination.
I thought they would merge.
These colors!
This red, this white and black clouds.
It was powerful.
But you know what?
- It will not happen again. - Why?
He did not go there, so it will not happen.
If the kite goes to the other side of the fence, we will do our luggage for a rotten neighborhood in the city, no heaven or kites.
I prefer a rotten neighborhood in town that hole!
This is not new.
I saved you today.
What?
The Al proposal.
It was tempting?
Tell him, Mom.
- He offered you what? - I do not know.
SF? Graphic novel? Holocaust?
Why refuse movies about the Holocaust?
Each actress Series B in a film about the Holocaust has had a price and you could play both sides.
Both sides?
Look at you.
Nazi and victim.
You 're versatile for a film about the Holocaust.
You know what?
You could even play a collaborator.
How many actresses have this talent?
I remember your first visit to the studio.
I was a young accountant, down the hall.
Everyone said: " Here it is! "
"She is beautiful, sexy, smart, strong, talented, modest, wild, fantastic. "
And this is one of us.
She is from Texas!
This is not an actress born in Australia in an isolated farm
100 km to the cinema where the projector walked oil!
I remember I was in the hallway,
I watched you move.
You were so beautiful.
You were " Princess Bride " Buttercup.
I imagined your face instead of that of Grace Kelly on the poster of " Rear Window". A good idea.
You were the future, Robin.
You were promised the answer.
You were full.
And now...
I'm in this position.
What position, Jeff?
That offer you the final contract of your life.
The last?
Already? I do not even have 45 years.
Things are changing fast.
Soon, the whole structure we love so much will be gone.
You mean Miramount?
Good grief, no!
I mean that surrounds the actors: agents, managers, everything that follows... caravans, drugs, coke, depression, breaks, lovers, sex tips, contracts broken, legitimizing tasteless scenarios depression after the flops
PR is planted, pardon applications.
All this may disappear.
You follow me?
Not really.
Here at Miramount, we want... you scanner.
Entirely.
Your body, your face, your emotions, your laughter, your tears, your orgasms, your joy, your depression, your fears, your desires.
We want you sample, you keep and have this... this thing called...
"Robin Wright ".
What will you do with this thing called Robin Wright?
Whatever your Robin Wright refused to do.
For example?
All the films you have not made because of your bad choices.
You surrendered, abandoned, fled waived.
God knows what you did!
And all this at the last minute, it has blocked our production and cost millions!
How old are you?
Regardless, if your computer makes me at the right age!
It changes anything, I have 16 years or 60 years?
Nothing.
I need Buttercup from " The Princess Bride ".
Jenny from "Forrest Gump."
De.. What was his name?
Of "Angels of the night "?
I do not need you.
Or just your CV.
A resume filled with bad choices you said it yourself.
The last 15 years, yes.
All your films have flopped, not to buy another.
But I can save you.
- I can save you. - What?
For yourself! For yourself!
You knew?
What?
Its proposal rotten!
He knows nothing, for him cameras
Oil still work. at what?
Oil, crude oil.
Drops. It is a dinosaur.
Your career is nearing its end.
You tumbled long ago.
Scanned on the market actors, you 're not worth a nail.
We are at war.
An actor who has not signed within 6 months will be dead.
Erased from his screen characters ever.
You'll come back crawling, begging me te scanner.
What should I do to make that happen?
Nothing.
You sign, half-day scanning.
- That's it? - That's all.
And you commit to never play.
Nowhere, for eternity.
What do you mean "nowhere"?
Or movies, or TV, or school room, or avant-garde theater
Australia.
"Nowhere " is nowhere.
Robin Wright, actress, continue to live between the walls of studios Miramount.
This Robin Wright will be able to take money and fly on a Polynesian island to discover his true self.
What do you say?
You know, it's interesting.
Between actresses, it was said that never can not sleep with you for a role, but I'd do it being a flea dirt in your computer.
So thank you.
But, no thank you.
The offer is valid for 30 days.
After so much the worse for it.
Okay, my treasure?
What is it?
I was tired, I think.
Want to fly the glider Wright brothers?
It is not ready yet.
A kites Cody?
I do not know.
I missed landing 14 h.
What you got?
- You look sad. - Really?
And if you did steal one of Cody?
Me?
- I think not. - You'll get there.
Small. Trying
Go.
Trying at least once, all alone.
To see what it does.
I'll be watching, he does not go to the other side.
It should not be fired here.
Sarah, will open.
Me?
Nobody ever comes to see me.
So like that.
Okay?
You could have called.
Why? You do not unhooked from the interview studio.
Here Steve. It will establish your contract with the studio.
This is an ace contracts scanning.
Keanu Reeves, Michelle Williams, this is it.
They are scanned tightly.
Hi, delighted.
Hi, kids!
- You drink something? - Of course.
- And you? - No, thank you.
It's a real glider.
Thank you, it is beautiful.
And he, who is he?
Steve, a new lawyer with whom I work.
An ace contracts scanning.
It is a sacred warehouse you there.
This is not a warehouse.
This is an old shed for DC-9.
It was built in 1973.
You will not get a license conversion residence today.
An ace of scanning?
I saw on the "show" chain which scans players to make digital creatures.
It must shake up the contracts.
Absolutely. absolutely, it is a very different irrevocable contract.
Complex, full details must be the eye.
You can not return it.
Why " irrevocable "?
Once scanned and the computer is folded.
Everything depends on the agreement before.
You have to be really vigilant.
The character belongs to the studio.
- What character? - The actor of yesteryear.
" Old "?
Once paid and scanned, the actor is not an actor, there is only one person lambda.
The actor is no longer a character computer in the studio.
The studio does what he wants.
Unless the lawyer inserts a clause contrary.
So it is very complex.
Very complex.
This is a new field that explores.
- What happens to the actor? - Which actor?
The actor of yore, become a digital creature.
He will play golf somewhere.
And he does not like golf?
In this case, he plays what he wants.
You have a screen here?
Or is it too modern?
There is something else I have not told you.
What you do not tell me?
They will arrive in 15 minutes, then speaks.
My God...
You've also slept with Maria.
Admit, motherfucker.
Admit that you slept with it too.
I knew from the beginning.
This slut seduces you...
My God, Max, it makes me want to vomit.
I have not slept with Maria.
- With who? - With nobody.
More...
I voted for Bush.
You voted for Bush?
Yes.
I even voted for both Bush senior and junior, four times!
Who are you?
My God, did I marry?
It is not Michelle.
If this is Michelle!
Of course, this is Michelle, but... she was not there when they did that?
She was in Paris when they made this shit computer.
I can not believe.
Frankly, it's perfect.
Perfect? No.
But not bad for the beginning of the revolution.
You saw?
What morons!
3 years they are trying to fix this bug.
I do not find it funny.
You must see this nod in the sex scenes.
This is hilarious! mom,
I must admit that it's done!
Do not be so severe, technophobia nowhere.
So, you're on their side?
You changed sides?
Stop, enough hypocrisy.
Nothing has changed.
They took what they wanted and created a crappy series as they have since the 40s.
It would be better for her, or for you to be stuck on the shelf for six weeks?
As a dog?
To embrace an actor rotten breath?
It does not bother you that they did not consult?
And you, they consulted you?
You've always been their puppet.
Producers, directors, they told you what to do, how to act, how to play, how to smile, how to love.
And they gave you the subtext each crappy replica.
And when you've had 35 years they have told you how to stay young.
Because if you do not obey their being a few years of your beautiful face, you cease to exist!
So where is the difference?
It is the freedom to choose?
Yes, the freedom to choose! What are you talking about?
It is the privilege of choosing one you removed.
I do not want to decide that I should be and when!
I decide it's my choice!
I decide if I want to be a whore, a singer, if I want to play Keith Richards.
It's my choice, not theirs.
You dream!
You have a choice when they stressed you to death, saying that after a year without turning, you'd finished? It is a choice?
And women topspin to death who can not smile or show sorrow or emotion, it is a choice?
You're in their hands, you will not see?
It was saved miraculously by those pesky computers!
Saved!
You're crazy if you do not agree. Raving mad!
And what they say about you is true.
On your choice calamitous! Awake, Robin!
This opens the door to freedom.
Okay, my friend?
Hopefully, Dr. Barker.
New flying monsters?
I have a real one, the original Wright brothers.
Super is the glider?
December 17, 1903?
I built a similar model, but...
11.50 m wingspan. He will make his debut.
All right.
In fact, you need to one of the Wright brothers. The third.
Aaron Wright.
I am the original Wright brother.
I build better than because I live in a world jets and spaceships.
It's totally different.
And they had no competition.
Mermaid.
Silence.
Glamour.
Love.
Kite.
Kite.
Listening.
cover. </ i>
Hitch.
Travel.
Remember, you must repeat the word.
Table.
Capable.
Sky.
Sky.
Parade.
Distraught.
Bomb.
Grave.
His condition worsens?
It's too early to say.
But his hearing seems to deteriorate gradually.
Brakes.
Sentence.
Coronation.
Isolation.
Storm.
Rage.
Regarding the report of the ophthalmologist, it is not very optimistic either.
It has reached the stage of retinitis pigmentosa.
Is it a long way... and complicated to say a horrible thing?
No, this is a very long-term mean his visual field decreases. the final, night vision decline dramatically, until complete night blindness.
And then?
Dr. Barker?
Yes, my grandfather?
You can switch me the noise of the volcano?
The noise of the volcano?
Thank you.
I beg you.
And the other 50%?
Aaron is one?
That is the mystery with this syndrome.
You will not know until it has 30 or 35 years... it will be completely blind.
Aaron has a remarkable mind.
It stores information and translates it in his own way, it is a gift.
He hears " Coronation " says " Isolation " but he knows what he's doing.
Imagine what resemble movies in 50 years.
I think it is similar to what Aaron.
- That is to say? - That is to say...
The filmmakers provide electronic stimuli the brain result according to the subconscious of each.
We give people the data history and they will take their mother, or girlfriend, to embody or Marlene Dietrich.
Depending on what is in their brain.
This is exactly what Aaron.
This is a rare case he is ahead of his time decades.
And you, dear friend, how are you?
Okay.
New roles on the horizon?
I think so.
Whatever happens, let Steve talk.
Robin Wright for Jeff Green.
Miss Wright, I did not see you recognized.
This is not new.
Ça Va?
" Neither child abuse, or gender, except in a love story or a romantic comedy, or mentally retarded, or disabled, or porn, or holocaust, or Nazis. "
You have stated all this?
Absolutely.
You're a freaked swastika?
- Not him, my children. - These are his children.
They added Nazis and porn?
Porn at your age?
The Nazis and the Holocaust are prizes.
For whom? Your digital artists?
Well, they have become digital artists, not just technicians.
These are details, trifles, the nitpicking.
I agree with everything except science fiction.
No SF.
This is a stupid kind, in our opinion.
She never did SF and it does not do.
If she had made ​​a film SF this contract would be 6 times.
No SF, no contract.
So, no contract.
Why? SF is the dream.
How many people have read " The Lord of the Rings"?
0.001 % of people who have seen the movie read the book. You know why?
Because it is so difficult to read!
A nightmare! And it is razor!
You read it before making the film?
Are you kidding?
But I saw the film, and that's why we make films.
- But I wanted to say something else. - What?
I want to make you young forever.
Veiled what we will do.
How old are you? years.
Sign for SF and I guarantee you get 33 to 311 years.
Forever young, I promise.
Forever young.
33 to 311 years?
- Which is better? - 32.
You ask too much.
34 years old and sign.
A life.
In some countries, a life sentence is 20 years. where?
Middle East.
They are animals! 20 years for murder?
In 20 years, this technology is as old the invention of the boomerang.
- 20. - Okay.
We can do that now?
What you need me, you can do it right now?
I do not want to wait, it's now or never.
Robin Wright.
- Are not you...? - Yes, it's me.
Christopher Ryne.
What are you doing here?
I'll scanner.
Do not pity me.
The others are at home, unemployed.
You were a great chief operator so many great films.
Thank you. at least, I work with actors and with the light.
I get to see you as part of my work.
Like the good old days.
I also have the chance to ask take off your robe.
There is a locker room down the hall to the right.
Welcome back.
H 1 " to someone?
I'm here.
Relax, we start in a minute.
I want to not miss any your charming expressions, princess.
Smile.
Further.
You are happy.
Happy.
Now laugh.
A great laugh!
Burst out laughing!
Go a great laugh.
Bigger!
At present, the laugh... slowly... slowly... made up... vacuum...
in the absence of expression... < / i> sadness.
I can not, stop!
Turn off the lights.
Chris, I got it.
Let me do.
I already told you how I started in this job?
Why I am an agent?
The real story?
No, I've never told you,
I was too embarrassed.
You're not gonna believe this, but I started at the age of 10 years.
I was in 5th.
An agent in the 5th grade.
I explained.
There was a boy at home, in the Bronx.
Joey Tail Magic, it was called.
He had...
You know...
How to say...
He was born with a tail.
A real cock.
Inside at least 3 cm.
Maybe 5 cm.
As a boxer.
As soon as it became known, during gym, he became horribly persecuted.
I can not describe to you it has undergone, this kid 8 years.
They undressed in the street singing songs on his tail.
Kids screaming under his window:
"Joey, lend me your cock,
I want to toss my hot chocolate! "
Then one day,
I'll see before school, with an idea.
I said: " Look, Joey. "
" From now on, if someone wants to see your cock, it's $ 1. "
He looks at me and he did:
" Really, Al? "
" And I tell them what? "
"It is said that Al? "
I was a skinny kid, all vaulted, a wimp.
Not really the type wrestler.
So tonight, I went to see the Twin Towers.
I speak of the twin towers of the Bronx:
Podlowsky the brothers.
Do you remember? They already shaved 10 years.
At 13, they went with divorced 40 years.
I talk about Joey Tail Magic and I offer them
50 cents for each kid who wants to see his cock.
They take turns to manage the queue of curious,
I take bookings and money.
This month, I pocketed more money my father as a shoemaker in a year and I was 10!
From there, the business took off.
At 13, I was the agent of all losers.
The crippled, the dwarfs, hunchbacks fire eaters Bronx.
In 2 years, we were family richest area.
More... when I was 15 the child protection has nabbed me maltreatment of children with disabilities.
I did three months in prison.
And later years
I arrived in this city.
It was all glitter and tinsel and I was ashamed of my past.
But in my heart,
I knew I had an advantage on all others the power to recognize a fault, weakness, failure and exploit for my needs as an agent.
That's how I met you.
You were perfect for me.
Beautiful as an angel and the worst flaw an actress can have.
Fear.
And what scared!
Of pure terror.
A terror that goes through of all desires.
Panic attacks before every important meeting. paralysis face of prestigious roles.
And I was there to help you.
I was the devil inside who fed your fears and earned his living with your weakness.
Then, your children are born and suddenly you stopped being afraid.
You've never been so happy, you did not want to work, you wanted to stay with them.
I had never felt so abandoned me.
This is where I realized...
I'm not your agent, I love you.
I was afraid you leave me.
And suddenly, a few weeks
Aaron's condition began to deteriorate.
And I found my strength through your weakness.
Then Aaron strayed more and we are left alone.
And now, you can not really go over, trapped inside this monster.
This is your last performance.
And it will really save you all your fears, all your demons.
You did not deserve that.
You do not deserve it.
20 YEARS LATER
Welcome to Abrahama, Ms. Wright.
Is this your first visit?
Absolutely.
You are expected at the hotel Miramount, as special guest of Futuristic Congress.
This is a nice car for its age.
What year?
Just a little reminder.
Abrahama City is reserved for the animation area.
The only way to leave the animation area, that's when we'll meet again, on your return.
Your bulb.
In the age of spiritual machines where the streets have no name
Earth trembles with rage and shame.
Agent Robin is back!
" Triple A."
"Robin Robot Rebel Warrior Princess. "
Now in the air!
Hello, Miss Wright.
Welcome to Miramount Abrahama hotel.
The city of Abrahama
Miramount and Nagasaki welcome you to the Futurist Congress.
We remind you qu'Abrahama is entirely devoted to animation area.
Agent Robin is back!
" Triple A."
"Robin Robot Rebel Warrior Princess "!
Now in the air!
Hello, Aaron.
I see you left your room.
Do you feel better?
No, but it has stopped raining,
I can not risk slipping on wet leaves.
So this is how?
You should see my animated character, it is appalling.
As if a designer of genius had a bad trip.
How so?
I look like... a mix between Cinderella on heroin and an Egyptian queen who missed her chignon.
Mom?
They recognize you?
The new film is everywhere in the air.
No, nobody sees me.
I'm an old lady for them.
Probably because you're busy.
No, you never recognize me nowhere.
Welcome to the Wright.
It's been 30 years that does not recognize me.
Aaron, I can not hear you in that crowd.
I get into my room,
I'll call you later. I love you.
Robin Wright, invited to Miramount Classic.

The sixth Robin Wright.
Others do not seem also " robiniennes " you.
Ralph will lead you to your room, Miss Wright.
I wish you a good convention.
Area of animation...
Miss Wright, your new movie, " The Warrior "
Does it reflect our lives?
Absolutely.
I discover a new facet
Agent Robin each time.
For example, in "The Warrior " robots slums are part of our life, they are close to us.
People buy food processors and then...
They rush like lemons, exploit them to the bone and bone they expire.
These poor robots before they rehabilitation centers, now they are going to scrap, it's sad.
It is said that " Triple R" is science fiction but for me... this is a documentary.
Room Service?
Can I have room service?
Yes, Miss Wright. You want?
The light is off, there is more current.
There is an explanation or is it that it's just in my head? in the end, everything is explained and everything is in our heads.
What order do you want?
A full breakfast, 3 eggs...
Potato pancakes and toast.
As a drink?
No liquids. no liquid? none. It will be long?
2 seconds. How do you want your eggs?
On the flat.
Yellow will always flowing, arriving at the 100th floor?
Of course, Miss Wright.
That is why the Miramount Hotel Abrahama invented the elevator supersonic.
Ralph, it's dark in here or is it in my head?
It's all in our head.
If it is dark, it is because you chose black.
My God, this is water!
They put something in the tap water!
Jeff!
Jeff Green, you hear me?
You hear me?
Stop it!
I'll sign!
Stop playing with my brain!
I beg you, stop.

If you really want
I no longer talk
That my voice is silent as previously
I will speak
I expect, you see
Whether we are talking to me
If you really want
You are Robin Wright?
Yes, at least I was.
Police Miramount!
You went too far. It makes you a star.
Next time you are blind. Dirty whore!
Stop it.

You're here too?
You and I are the only survivors.
Who are the others?
Characters invented.

I distributed food to children in Africa.
And you?
I took care of my son.
You look great. Finally, animated.
Look who else.
Just you and... what's his name again?
He, I understand, it cost me a fortune, but you?
I paid peanuts for your contract and you're still here,
20 years later.
What hast thou done all these years?
I fed the little Africans.
They still hungry, there?
Least, thanks to you.
Tell me about this conference why everyone is on edge?
- You'll see soon. - I see what?
You understand, soon this structure no longer exist.
Structure? Miramount Classic the Miramount Hotel?
No, not the hotel. The whole structure.
The writer antidepressants,
Russian story- boarder with a drinking problem, facilitators always behind time, idiots who fall in love their digital characters special effects guys, they all go to hell!
The cinema is exceeded.
A relic of the past millennium.
As you uncover up there
Congress Futuristic,
Miramount Nagasaki enters a new era.
We are in the era of free choice!
Which means, to extend our contract?
Nothing important.
An extension of 20 and another small clause.
What he has in this small clause?
Now that... you can drink.
Or eat you like an omelette or crème brûIée.
From now on, you're a substance, that is all.
You're a chemical formula the pharmaceutical services
Miramount of Nagasaki decoded.
People can drink you in their milkshake and imagine you as they wish.
All?
"All", it means everything.
Comedy drama, Little Red Riding Hood, experimental porn, comedies, SF, trash, zombies.
What do you have to do?
Tell me, when you fantasies single bed in the dark, you pay him, to him or her, copyright?
You'll end up signing.
Why?
You might be selling your image actress, but you're still in lime actress.
You drove here to go on stage and enjoy a moment of glory.
To be seen, after all these years.
And you will sign for the same reason.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Look at us!
But look at us then!
Can you believe that a mini- bulb manufactured in laboratories
Miramount of Nagasaki could produce this neo- divine creation?
I say if you are here, you believe.

Let's go.
Breathe. inhale deeply and hold your breath.
Quickly.
Descend, I feel already.

We are already stuck in our animated characters.

- I think I saw Sarah. - Probably.
It looks like him to be with the rebels, you can be proud.
How do you know who is Sarah?
I know more than you can imagine.
Off! This woman is seriously injured!
She injured her head, push yourself! give him your seat.
Draw the short straw.
- Who are you? - One of the directors.

All part of the direction we do, it is important people.
Sit.

We need it, keep it alive.
- It is far from the hospital? - It is.
Aaron!
Who are you?
Dylan.
Dylan Truliner.
- You work for them? - I did.
Until this morning and this revolution Futuristic Congress.
I am the graphic that you computer gave life for 20 years.
The head of department Robin Wright Miramount.
Your body, your face, your smile, your sadness... have been all my life these past 20 years.
Tell me.
I was a graphic designer unemployed.
They put me in Robin department for the first film,
" Triple R, Attack."
I was clueless.
Why?
Because I knew who you were.
I had not seen any of your movies.
I did some research on you.
It was obsessive.
What was he looking for?
Where you come from, where] you went.
Texas, the typical American, skinny jeans and boots. after... one week
I sold them the idea of the lasso, with a small illustration in pencil.
The rebels seized the direction!
- Which way? - From Miramount Nagasaki.
They take control and stop the flow of hallucinogens.
It will become real!
How do I know if I'm dreaming?
Do you know what are my dreams?
You see my dream?
4 cockroaches playing poker on your lap, it's a dream?
Yes, but not mine.
Does one of you thought of me? From what I've been through
m after being sold '? </ i>
I've been obsessed with you for years.
- Through it, not me. - For me, it's the same.
At one time,
I had no ideas.
I was afraid they'll pull me and give you...
I've been looking for you everywhere in California.
I needed new... movements.
A different sensuality, things that a woman acquires with age.
Target approaching 500 m.
Bomb dropping off.
Bomb dropping off.
Let me go, I got it.
EXPLOSIVE where are they all gone?
They are deluded away from here, to freedom.
Where is Dylan?
He followed suit.
Why am I the only one left?
Because you still screwed up.
You thought what climbing on stage?
How so?
You invited me, as a symbol.
The symbol of what?
The chemical revolution, you said.
You are not a symbol, you're nothing.
The symbol is the image we have created you.
Look at you. You look a symbol?
What you did on stage was suicidal.
You do not let us have the choice.
What do you choose?
A bullet in the head.
One.
And fast. as quickly as possible,
I want out of this hallucination.
After all these years, it is time for you to know it is not a hallucination.
This is our life.
The following case is very interesting.
Patient, you may know, was an actress.
I forgot his name.
She suffered a serious hallucinogenic contamination during the uprising Abrahama.
A month since she is convinced that her life everything she has known, was a hallucination.
It was so severe that when relief
Abrahama reached, she begged Fire Chief to shoot a bullet in the head.
It is a hopeless case.
So we decided to freeze.
Given our progress, liquid nitrogen can keep frozen for 70 years.
Lower it.
Aaron?
You heard me!
You heard me call you!
Yes, Mom. Course.
What it's strange?
And now the weather.
The Company regrets Climate the asymmetry of arcs -en-ciel these last 2 days. That said, contradicts symmetry art.
Must free yourself from these thoughts.
I do not understand.
What?
I had to wake up in the distant future.
It's like treating a diver suffering from decompression.
It goes back as far as possible, up childhood memories.
Here we chose the decor for you.
The early 1980s. today, you have a visitor.
Are you ready to receive?
What are you doing here?
I was expecting you.
Me?
I waited for the moment when we could thaw you. where medicine would rather advanced to heal.
You waited for me all this time?
I was the last to have seen you,
I felt responsible.
I was told that Sarah is well.
She was rescued from the revolt Abrahama, what that means.
Now they look my Aaron.
Here is the DNA code of Aaron.
I search for ad
Your thawing.
And? no sign of him. no trace.
I think he is no longer with us.
"More with us?" In this world?
Or it is no longer alive?
You say he's dead?
It is much more complicated.
The world today is not like that where [1 you have.
To find Aaron, living or not, we must make a very long journey.
It has a direction? A clue?
I hope.
But we must start somewhere.
I came to take you into town.
Nobody told me
How long I remained frozen.
Maybe a year, maybe 20.
Now, time is subjective.
Everyone decides in his mind when the sun rises, or when the moon fades.
After some time, you probably forgot the calendar.
New York became a city hanging gardens to heaven.
Crazy colors you drunk, people are so beautiful, young and radiant.
Shining serenity beauty, sexuality.
There are more ego.
Chemistry has delivered us.
There is no ego, neither competition nor violence or war, either strong or weak, or secrets.
Everyone is... what it is.
Each is what he wants to be.
And while they eat their new personality, they emit into the air pheromones that mind translated into images.
I can not imagine Aaron in this world.
This street has the wisdom of a millennium.
There was one year when I was using
Greek mythology
I woke up half-man half - god.
I fertilized a daughter of Zeus, created an entire city then I fucked her,
I burned and punished.
It's all about feelings.
Just make a choice you feel and what you want.
What do you choose?
Usher syndrome.
What type of syndrome?
Type 2, I think.
Why? you research on someone?
I lost someone

Somewhere out there, there are currently </ i > Sarah.
It is naturalistic now.
No, it does you no good.
You do not recognize and do not know who you are.
Trust me, she is happy.
This is one of the few people still puts children into the world.

May you stay
Forever young
And if I do not want to participate this chemical feast?
You will understand very quickly it is impossible, otherwise you will be excluded from this world.
And I'll be where?
On the other side.
What he has on the other side, Dylan?
The truth.
Which is the other side?
Those who have not taken the plunge, who do not participate in the chemical feast.
And of course, anyone who manages this world.
You went?
- No. - Why?
Because I do not know if we can come back.
It's like coming back from the dead.
Some may have, we do not know.
So send me there, I'll tell you how it is.
You can send me there?
You have within you the substance?
It is not a chemical cocktail.
It is a kind... eraser which removes all influences a second chemical.
And the truth... immediately arises.
And where is it?
It's like cyanide capsules the Nazis, in case of surrender.
When I left the old world,
I took one.
It was my compensation from Miramount Nagasaki is what I asked them after 20 years of work.
This small capsule.
I want it.
If your son comes in your absence?
And if the other side? This is more likely.
That's all I have left.
If you take it, you go, you leave me.
You can not do that, not now.
Come with me.
I can not, the capsule serves only one person.
It's your choice
I'll give you everything you want.
I love you.
Robin, I've always loved you.
I loved you for 20 years, not even know you. You were my world.
And I loved you for another 20 years, until each hour every day you come back.
Promise me not to look at the real me.
Promise me you remember me like that.
I promise.
I love you.
There are still doctors in this world?
Yes, he left. where are they? up there.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me where I can find an ENT appointed Dr. Barker?
Course.
Its cabin is down the hall.
I knew you would spend not on the other side.
Do not be impressed by my presence here.
Being on this side of the truth is not so brave.
Nothing has really changed, actually.
Before we masquions truth with antidepressants, drugs that concealed, lying.
Now, we are reinventing the truth.
This is not so different.
The drugs were just a lot better.
And we have no choice?
The only choice is waiting to die here infected in this truth, halluciner or across.
It may be better out there, dreaming.
And Aaron?
Aaron waited for you here all these years.
For 19 years, he waited your return.
Her condition continued to worsen, it has become almost totally blind.
More... he did not want to go there.
However, I begged him to do so, knowing that I will not always be there to take care of him.
There six months, he went there.
It is someone else now in the world of chemical hallucinations.
6 months?
There are exactly 6 months.
He could not just more.
He had to say that I was going to die and... he no longer believed in your return.
There is no way to recover.
Here, it does not exist.
And on the other side, there are no means know who he is.
But you can go back there, it's better than nothing.
It's better than waiting for death.
And the other side...
Yes, what?
I can go back to where [1 I come from?
The place where [ one you just do not exist.
You invented it.
You go where your mind and your chemical molecules take you.
And after your visit here this will be a place in your consciousness completely different those where you've been to.
Your past is dead.
I will prepare a light bulb.
Then I call the kite.
You know where you're going?
Yes, I know.
This is Agent Leland Turbo.
I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile.
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.
You won't believe what I found out here.
This is bigger than anything we've ever seen, and no one even knows it exists.
Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry, it could blow the operation.
- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
- Let's go.
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.
All right, buddy, we're here.
Right where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?
I'm looking for a car.
A car? Ha!
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here.
Exactly where I want to be.
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.
What are you doing out here?
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.
Well, turn around and go back where you came from.
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?
- Incoming.
- All workers report to the loading dock.
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.
All right, fellas, you know the drill.
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.
Come on, guys. These crates aren't gonna unload themselves.
Too many cars here. Out of my way.
Professor Zundapp?
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to see this before we load it?
Ah, yes. Very carefully.
Oh, a TV camera.
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.
What are you up to now, Professor?
This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.
- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.
Yeah! This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong.
Agent Leland Turbo.
It's Finn McMissile!
He's seen the camera! Kill him!
- All hands on deck!
- All hands on deck!
Whoa!
Waargh!
What?
Get to the boats!
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!
He's dead, Professor.
Wunderbar!
With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now?
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who - is here to help you.
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.
I thought I could make it this time, but...
Smooth like pudding, huh?
- Who am I kidding?
- I'll always be a lemon.
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.
Hey, but look on the bright side.
This is your tenth tow this month, so it's on the house.
You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.
Don't sweat it. Shoot, these things happen to everybody.
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through.
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?
Not yet.
He must be crazy excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him, but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,
'cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for.
Just me and...
McQueen!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!
McQueen's back!
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.
Welcome home, soldier.
The place wasn't the same without you, son.
What? Did he go somewhere?
It's good to be home, everybody.
- Mater!
- McQueen!
Oooh!
Whoooa!
Hey, how far did you make it this time, Otis?
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!
I know! I can't believe it either!
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.
You too, buddy.
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe the things I got planned for us!
These best friend greetings get longer every year!
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.
Wow.
I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson.
I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!
I can handle anything.
Er... Mater?
Just remember, your brakes ain't going to work on these!
- Mater?
- Relax.
These train tracks ain't been used in years!
Aaaah!
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!
Faster!
Ooh. Wow.
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?
This is going to be good!
Did you see that?
Uh-oh.
- This ain't going to be good.
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir, this new dent.
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.
Wait till you see what I got planned for tonight!
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!
You, me and Miss Sally goin' out for supper.
Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally.
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
OK.
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.
See you soon, amigo.
Ah, this is so nice.
I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone, just the two of us, finally.
- You and me.
- Ahem! Good evening.
- Oh!
- My name is Mater, and I'll be your waiter.
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.
Mater? You work here?
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?
I snuck in here when nobody was lookin' and pretended to be your waiter so I could hang out with you?
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?
Can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple of drinks?
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.
Uh... Right. Your usual.
- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?
How should I know?
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...
His story gripped the world.
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS, ironically ran out of gas, and found himself trapped in the wild.
Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he distilled himself from the natural elements!
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel.
Now he claims to have done it with his allinol.
And to show the world what his new super fuel can do he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.
And we all know what happened to them.
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.
After seeing allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?
And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.
It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you.
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?
Of course we invited him, but apparently after his very long racing season he is taking time off to rest.
The Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco.
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.
In miles, that is like... way faster than McQueen.
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.
- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.
- Hello?
- Go ahead.
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.
That Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.
He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world.
- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,
"the bestest race car," then why must he rest? Huh?
'Cause he knows what's important.
Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!
This is not news to Francesco.
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.
After two laps, I am out cold.
That ain't what I meant.
What's going on over there?
He is afraid of Francesco.
That's that
Italian formula car.
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.
- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?
McQueen could drive circles around you.
Driving in circles is all he can-a do, no?
No.
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.
Any time, any track.
Mel, can we move on?
Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation, like a dump truck.
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.
Hey! Whoa!
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.
The Lightning McQueen, huh?
I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!
This is the difference between you and Francesco.
Francesco knows how good he is.
He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.
Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!
Not-a so fast, McQueen!
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?
Motto?
This sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course.
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.
I would love to, but my crew is off for the season, so...
Pit stop.
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby.
Ka-chow! Yeah.
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.
Mater's going to have a blast, though.
You're bringing Mater, right?
You never bring him to any of your races.
Ah.
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.
Come on, it will be the thrill of a lifetime for him.
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.
I didn't taste it!
How'd you like to come and see the world with me?
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.
- You're coming along.
- All right!
Ka-chow!
Ha-ha!
Hey!
Hey, excuse me!
Domo arigato!
Yeah!
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.
OK, now, Mater, remember, best behavior.
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!
Hey, McQueen! Over here.
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.
Can you believe this party?
Hey.
You done good. You got all the leaves.
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.
Ah... Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?
Ho-ho! Good job!
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
You're just realizing that?
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done a number on you.
Mater, things are different over here.
Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different, too.
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?
That's what a tow truck does.
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...
Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?
Anything for McQueen's friend.
Miss Sally is going to flip when she sees this.
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.
Hey, she has-a good taste.
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".
You're right. She's a huge fan!
She goes on and on about your open wheels.
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going on and on.
Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco.
Women respect a car that has-a nothing to hide.
Yeah, er...
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.
I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally.
Oh. Sorry.
I already dedicated my win tomorrow to her.
So, if we both do it, it's really not so special.
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks?
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?
I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race.
Yes, you will see Francesco, but not like this.
You will see him like-a this as he drives away from you.
Ha! That's cute.
You had one of those made up for all the racers?
No.
Okay.
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.
It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
From Brazil, Number 8...
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
That's because it's air-cooled.
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.
Try the canapes on the mezzanine.
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?
It appears to be a standard television camera.
They said if you could get closer photos next time that would be great.
This was London's message?
Oh, no. No, sir.
The oil platforms you were on, turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.
How did we miss that?
They've scrambled everyone's satellites.
The Americans discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that platform under deep cover.
He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.
Great.
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?
Nope, not yet.
The American is here tonight to pass it to you.
He'll signal you when he's ready.
Good, good.
Oh, no.
- What is it?
- Change of plan.
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?
Those thugs down there were on the oil platform.
If they see me, the mission is compromised.
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.
You are now.
I'll take one of them. Thank you.
Never know which one McQueen will have a hankering for.
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!
Er... little more, please.
It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more.
Come on, let's go. It's free.
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
My condolences.
And now our last competitor.
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
Ka-chow!
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.
You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition.
Somebody get me water! Aah!
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.
Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.
It has turned.
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.
This is the bloke that called in to the television show.
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.
This trip's been amazin'.
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.
I gotta go. Oh, er...
Er...
Sorry, ladies.
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!
I never leak, I never leak, never...
Wow-wee!
What in the...?
Hey, that tickles!
Waaargh!
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.
OK, so, the American has activated his tracking beacon.
Roger that. Move in.
Stop! Hey!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?
- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!
- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.
All right.
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!
No offense to your makes and models, but you break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the altar!
What the...? Whoa. Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!
We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Don't let me get in the way of your private business.
Oh, a little advice. When you hear a giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button.
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.
Get out of here!
All right, then. And when she starts gigglin', prepare to be squirted.
'Scuse me, ma'am.
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.
- This cannot be him.
- Is he American?
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.
- Extremely.
- Then it's him.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.
Perfect.
Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.
'Course, Karmann Ghias weren't the only ones.
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them there's the Type 2 buses.
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!
Erm... We should find somewhere more private.
Gee, don't you think that's a little...?
You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised.
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.
We'll rendezvous then.
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?
Mater, what's going on?
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.
Guido don't believe you.
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!
See you tomorrow!
Guido still don't believe you.
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.
What's so funny?
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.
So you think.
Allinol by itself is good for you.
But after microscopic examination
I have found that it has one small weakness.
When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous.
Smile for the camera.
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.
You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform.
Now, you will witness what it really does.
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.
Could I start it now, Professor Z?
Go 50% power.
This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter.
What about her? Did you give it to her?
The allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber.
How about him? Did you talk to him?
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.
You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse... unfortunately... there will be nothing to replace.
- How about him?
- Does he have it?
That's him. He's the one.
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!
Yes, sir.
We believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information.
I will take care of it before any damage can be done.
The project is still on schedule.
You will find the second agent and kill him.
Japan, land of the rising sun, where ancient tradition meets modern technology.
Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix.
I'm Brent Mustangburger with racing legends
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.
There's never been a competition like this before.
First, allinol, making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions.
Second, the course itself.
And it's like nothing we've ever seen before.
David, how exactly does this competition work?
All three of these street courses are classic round-the-house racetracks.
This means that the IMP and formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion.
Look for Francesco Bernoulli, in particular, to lead early.
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars, like Spain's Miguel Camino, should make up ground but I doubt it'll be enough to stop Francesco from absolutely running away with it.
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.
You forget the most important factor... that early dirt track section of the course.
The dirt is supposed to be the equalizer in this race.
French rally car
Raoul CaRoule is counting on a big boost through there.
And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time.
In my opinion, McQueen is the best all-around racer in this competition.
Really, Darrell, you need to clean your windshield.
You're clearly not seeing this
Francesco's race to lose.
- It's time to find out.
- The racers are locking into the grid.
Speed. I am speed.
Really? You are speed?
Then Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco is triple speed.
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.
It's-a really getting him into the zone.
He is so getting beat today.
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.
It must have cost him a fortune.
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.
As they head into the palace hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.
- Hang on, boys.
- Here comes the dirt.
Slipping and sliding, baby.
McQueen, it's time to make your move!
Get on the outside and show 'im what Doc taught you.
10-4, Mater.
Oh, boy! Francesco's brought to a screeching halt!
Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage.
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.
- Nice call, Mater.
- Keep it up.
Whoo-hoo!
McQueen looks happier than a roll bar at a demolition derby!
Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again.
Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt.
He's got serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race.
The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.
- It is time.
- Roger that.
- Oh!
- Miguel Camino has blown an engine!
- Very unusual, Darrell.
- He's been so consistent all year.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?
The one the American agent passed the device to.
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!
Not for long.
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?
The Pacer from the party last night.
I'm cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks.
Yep. His VIN numbers match.
- Anyone with him?
- He won't be alone.
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?
Get him out of the pits. Now!
Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud!
- Can you hear me? Over.
- What?
Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?
Hey. I know you! You're that girl from the party last night.
You wanna do our date now?
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.
Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!
Ha-ha-ha!
There's no time for messing about! Get out of the pits!
Is there going to be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?
- You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!
I'm trying. Get out now.
I usually like to have a proper detailin' done before I meet a lady friend.
Huh?
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.
Miss Shiftwell?
I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages.
Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
Hey, new lady friend, you like flowers?
What?
- No! Don't go in anywhere.
- Just keep moving.
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?
Whoa! McQueen suddenly moves to the outside.
I cannot believe what I saw.
That was a bonehead move to open up the inside like that!
That might have cost McQueen the victory!
This time, I'm going to make sure you stay dead!
- You're doing brilliantly.
- Now just stay focused.
What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus?
No! Don't go down that street.
Ohh!
Hi-yah!
Wow! A live karate demonstration!
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
Aaargh!
And here they come, the two leaders.
Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!
- It's close!
- Francesco's the winner!
McQueen's number two.
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?
Where'd he go?
Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe.
- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.
What was your strategy today?
Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.
It's-a very simple.
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.
You were in trouble for a while.
That dirt track section had you crawling.
To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high.
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?
Is the race over? You won, right?
Why were you yelling at me while I was racing?
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.
No, that's 'cause I seen these two fellers doing some karate street performance.
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.
Your date?
She started talkin' to me as a voice in my head, tellin' me where to go.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?
This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things.
Maybe if I, I don't know, talk to somebody and explained what happened, I could help.
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!
Hey, there he is!
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?
I made a mistake.
But I can assure you, it won't happen again.
Look, we know what the problem is and we've taken care of it.
Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix.
And three - count 'em - three cars flamed out leaving some to suggest that their fuel, allinol, might be to blame.
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.
There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out.
The jury may still be out on whether allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure,
Lightning McQueen blew this race.
Team McQueen can't be happy right now.
Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.
This is about my hook, ain't it?
I know I should have checked it, but I can't, really.
Look. It's attached to me.
Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration.
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.
I know some karate.
I don't want to brag or nuttin', but I got me a black fan belt.
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls.
I call it, "What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once. "
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!
Hang on!
Whoa-hah-hah!
This is first-class service.
You don't even have to go through the terminal!
Your karate partners is back there.
They look like they tryin' to catch up!
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Whoa...
Is everything okay back there?
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
Roger that.
'Member that whole thing about me not stoppin' no matter what?
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!
Thanks, old boy.
- You got it, mate.
- Hey, doggonit!
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!
Come on! Get in here!
I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya?
That's a no-quit attitude right there.
What the...?
- Aargh!
- Hold on, Sid.
Aargh!
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!
Hold on!
By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane flying home.
I'm so sorry for what I did.
"I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. "
"I want you to go prove to the world what I already know. "
"That you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. "
"Your best friend, Mater. "
I didn't really want him to leave.
Wait, there's more here.
"PS. Please tell the hotel"
"I didn't mean to order that movie. "
"I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it. "
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."
There are a few more pages of PS's here.
Well, at least I know if he's at home, he'll be safe.
That's how I like to start the day.
You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.
Whoa!
That's the closest I ever been to missin' my flight.
That was... Oh!
- Still in one piece? Great.
- I've got to go to a doctor.
I get these sharp pains in my undercarriage.
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomethin' or other.
He's a first-class VIP airport whatchamacallit.
And, Finn, this here is my date.
I never did get your name.
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.
It's Shiftwell. Holley...
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.
What is this?
That's one of the worst engines ever made.
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts.
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what.
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?
- But you took it.
- Holley.
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.
A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.
Agent? You mean, like, insurance agent? Like...
Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!
In how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?
It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period.
At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.
This seems like a dead end.
If there was something in the photo that could narrow this down, I'd be happier.
You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is.
See how he's had most of his parts replaced?
And see all them boxes over there?
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.
Exactly.
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.
I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife, but he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is.
What would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?
Wait. What?
You obviously have experience in the field.
Yeah, I live right next to one.
I don't know.
I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.
Well... Okay.
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?
Right. And I'm just in the import-export business.
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?
Paris. Tout de suite.
Yeah, two of them sweets for me, too, Sid.
I always wanted to be a spy.
Really? Me, too.
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?
Ha ha ha!
Once we're inside, stay close.
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.
Got it.
Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone, and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?
Why would I...
Dad-gum.
- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.
They got everything here. No!
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!
Wow. Whoa. He-he!
Do what?
Excuse me. What are you selling?
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?
- What in the...?
- Two for one.
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!
- There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.
- Mater, get back!
- Imbecile!
Hey, wait for me!
Ahhhhhh!
Ag-g-g-h!
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.
Sure thing.
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?
This is her first field assignment. She didn't know you were my informant.
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?
I never liked new car smell.
Tomber was doing 20-to-life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage, aren't you?
All right, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old.
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?
They should. I sold them.
- To whom?
- No idea.
He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone.
I was always wondering why he needs so many parts.
Now I know.
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.
Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter.
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.
Pull up the pictures from the oil platform.
I want to know what other type of cars were out there.
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.
Are these cars considered lemons?
Is the Popemobile Catholic?
Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.
And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov never get together, but they are having a secret meeting in two days.
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.
That's where the next race is!
There's a good chance our mystery engine will be there, too.
Your chances are more than good.
I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday. To Porto Corsa.
Contact Stevenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.
Good work.
That three-wheeled feller had to be right about a big meetin'.
You never see this many lemons in one town.
'Less there's a swap meet.
How'd you get all them pictures?
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.
Thank you... I think.
- That's a familiar sight.
- A Hugo being towed.
But he looks absolutely perfect!
Of course! They must be the heads of the lemon families.
Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day,
I'd hire me to tow me around all the time, too!
We've got to infiltrate that meeting to find out who's behind all this.
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
Thank you, Finn.
Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.
Guido, your eyes do not deceive you.
We are in Italy. We are home.
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?
What? No friend of mine will stay in a hotel in-a my village.
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!
Luigi! Guido!
How do they do it?
These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good.
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.
Hey, race car.
You look so down, so low.
Is like you have flat tires.
She said you look like you are starving, that she's gonna make you a big meal and fatten you up.
Oh, no.
Mama Topolino, please, you don't need to make a fuss.
Capisco. I understand.
Is a problem, yes, between you and a friend?
How did you know that?
A wise car hears one word and understands two.
That, and Luigi told me.
While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me.
I brought my friend Mater along on the trip and I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs.
This Mater is a close friend?
He's my best friend.
Then why would you ask him to be someone else?
What did I do?
I said some things during our fight.
You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything.
They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari, which one of them looked more like a Ferrari.
There were even some non-Ferrari fights.
So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight. "
"Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. "
"But you got to make up fast. "
"No fight more important than friendship. "
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.
Now, mangia. Eat!
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
Thank you, Stevenson.
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.
But everything's voice-activated these days.
What? I thought you was supposed to be makin' me a disguise.
- Voice recognized.
- Disguise program initiated.
Cool!
Computer, make me a German truck.
- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.
Make me a monster truck!
- Request acknowledged.
- What the...?
I vant to siphon your gas!
- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.
- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.
I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.
That's no good. Hm.
Hey. What are you doin'?
The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.
For a second there, I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents.
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.
I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody.
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?
I come by each one of 'em with my best friend, Lightning McQueen.
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.
Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.
But my line of work is towin' and salvage.
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.
- Oh...
- In the meantime...
.. you look a little light on weapons.
You are looking live at beautiful
Porto Corsa, Italy, on the Italian Riviera.
What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix!
Brent, they call this place the "Gem of the Riviera," and it's easy to see why.
With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos,
Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy.
And everyone who's anyone is here today, from the ultra-rich and super-famous to world leaders and important dignitaries.
You aren't kidding, David.
You can't do a three-point turn without bumping into some celebrity.
Welcome, everyone, to the second race of the World Grand Prix, where the big news continues to be allinol.
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety.
An independent panel of scientists has determined that allinol is completely safe, okay?
Safe. There it is.
So the race will go on, folks.
But the question everyone is asking:
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?
- He'd better.
- Talk about a home track advantage.
Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course.
Signore e signori, in the pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!
Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!
And your big mistake, McQueen!
In secondo position, numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?
If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe.
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.
Francesco understands, McQueen.
Oh, great, here it comes.
What do you got, Francesco?
For famous race cars like Francesco and, well, you, to be far away from home is not easy.
I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult.
Is-a no insult.
When-a Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama, just like-a you miss your tow truck amico.
Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly...
Of course, I am at home, and my mama is right here.
Mama!
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!
And there's the insult we were missing.
Darrell, the racers are settling in as they head to the Italian countryside.
Whoo, boy!
This is gonna be a great race.
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.
Look like someone stole their trunks.
My grand-a father has-a broken down.
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.
Sounds like you need some roadside assistance.
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.
Don't-a fight over me.
SignoreTow Truck, per favore.
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?
Impossible.
Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.
It's just that them guys look purty tough and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?
- That's how everyone sees you.
Isn't that the idea?
I tell you, that's the genius of it.
No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.
Brilliant!
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.
- Computer, disguise!
- Request acknowledged.
It's the boss. He's coming.
Ivan.
Oh, er...
Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait here?
He's in.
The racers are now making their way around the hairpin and headed downhill toward the casino bridge.
No more bets, please.
Come on, fuzzy dice!
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!
Air freshener. Antenna balls.
Spark-a plugs.
This place looks like it's made outta gold!
- That's because it is.
- Now, be careful what you say.
Why is that?
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?
You want me to stop talkin' to ya right now?
You are acting strange today, Ivan.
I have no idea what you're talking about,
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex. "
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But that makes sense, seein's how you's wanted in France, Germany...
Mater, stop it!
OK, OK, keep your voice down!
You gonna make me arrested!
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.
He's so good!
Victor!
Hey, Victor!
- There you are!
- Come in!
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.
It's good to see you.
Is the big boss here yet?
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.
Here we go.
Guten Tag.
It's just the professor.
Zundapp! When is he coming?
He's already here.
Welcome, everyone.
I wish I could be with you on this very special day, but my clutch assembly broke.
- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.
We know how you feel.
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.
Oh, it's too sophisticated.
We are here to celebrate.
Today, all your hard work pays off.
The world turned their backs on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts.
The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us.
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap, clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap, lemon.
But their insults just give us strength.
Because today, my friends, that all ends!
There's smoke on the casino bridge!
Oh, no!
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.
They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.
- Another crash!
- It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.
Embrace your inner lemon.
Let it drive you.
I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse.
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?
On the tower!
This was meant to be alternative fuel's greatest moment.
But after today, everyone will race back to gasoline.
And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve will become the most powerful cars in the world!
Get out of the way!
They will come to us, and they will have no choice, because they will need us.
Huh? Whoa!
We figured you might stop by!
And they will finally respect us!
So hold your hoods high!
After today, you will never again be ashamed of who you are!
No!
Long live lemons!
- Number 7 is loose!
- Shu Todoroki!
Finn?
Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!
They have no idea what happened behind them.
This is impossible!
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!
What happened?
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?
Oh, no!
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London still going to take place?
I suppose that...
The show must go on, as they say.
I can't believe this is really happening!
Quiet!
Will you require all the racers to still run on allinol?
I cannot, in good conscience, continue to risk the lives of any more race cars.
The final race will not be run on allinol.
There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use allinol for the final race.
A toast!
To the death of allinol and alternative fuel forever!
Mater, abort the mission.
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.
How is your grandfather?
Long live lemons!
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.
You are not leaving, are you?
Uh... of course I ain't leaving.
- I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?
Crashes are a part of racing, I know, but something like that should never happen.
You can choose your fuel for the final race. What it'll be?
Allinol.
After today?
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.
I didn't stand by a friend of mine recently.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen.
He will use allinol in the final race, despite what occurred today.
- .. Till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed!
No!
It's the American spy!
Dad-gum!
- Gatlinggun.
- Request acknowledged.
Down! Everybody, down!
- Shoot! I didn't mean...
- Request acknowledged.
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
Correction acknowledged. Deploying chute.
Whoa!
McQueen!
Whoa! What's this?
Whoa!
McQueen! McQueen!
Waagh!
Let me through! Let me through!
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.
We have a lunatic at gate 9.
I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting and my weapons system's done misinterperated what I'm saying!
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!
- You are the champion!
Thisway, signore.
- McQueen!
- Mater?
- McQueen.
- Give us a pose!
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!
Where you going?
Stop!
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...
Mater!
- Mater?
- Signore?
- McQueen!
- They're gonna kill you!
Mater!
Excuse me.
No, where are you going?
Scusi. Mater!
- McQueen!
- Scusi.
Mater! Mater!
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...
That was me. I said, "You killed out there today. You're the best. "
- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.
I really thought I heard my friend.
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.
Come-a with me, please.
Let me go!
You actually care about that race car.
A pity you didn't warn him in time.
- "Idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?
- That's how everyone sees you.
- I tell you, that's the genius of it.
No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.
At the fool...
Excuse me!
Domo arigato!
Yeah!
You done good. You got all the leaves.
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.
Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
Aargh!
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.
Mater!
But I never leak oil. Never.
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help.
Your help...
Bang the gong. Get it on!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things!
Holley! Finn! Where are we?
We're in London, Mater, inside Big Bentley.
Whoa!
Oh, this... This is all my fault.
Don't be a fool, Mater.
But I am, remember? You said so.
When did I... Oh.
Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.
I'm not a spy!
I've been trying to tell you that the whole time.
I really am just a tow truck.
Finn, he's not joking.
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen is 'cause I'm such a big one.
This is all my fault.
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.
Professor Z wanted you to have a front-row seat, for the death of Lightning McQueen.
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.
Whoa!
Huh?
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.
It never occurred to me he wouldn't be there.
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.
And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military.
You just need to focus on the race.
I know but, Sally with everything going on, I'm not sure...
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.
Because after Italy, I was finished, and then you gave me one last shot.
Listen...
I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I hope you win today.
You show the world that they've been wrong about allinol.
Mater would want you to race.
All right. For Mater.
Here he comes.
- What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?
- You broke it!
- Quiet!
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.
The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "ka-chow"... he's going to go "ka-boom"!
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.
Oh, wait, you could have!
- Dad-gum lemons!
- Request acknowledged.
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?
That's right! You got nothing!
Who's the lemon now, huh?
Nice try, Mater.
- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...
Mater!
I got to get y'all out of there.
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.
So, we'll be OK? Really?
He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth.
Argh!
Being killed by a clock.
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come. "
Time? That's it!
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.
If I can just reverse the polarity.
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.
What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?
Oh, no!
Drive! Burn rubber!
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to...
Done.
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.
Oh, no, that's Mater's.
I knew his escape was too easy.
Come back here! Stop!
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?
- Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.
When we were knocked out, they planted it in your air filter.
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!
- Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you OK?
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!
No, wait! Wait!
A tow truck has just raced onto the track, driving backwards!
Mater, wait!
Normally an emergency vehicle on the track means there's been an accident.
- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!
Stay back! If you get close to me, you're going to get hurt real bad!
I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters!
We're best friends!
And McQueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck.
I don't know who that truck is, Brent, but tell you what, he's got to be the world's best backwards driver.
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!
You've always been the bomb and you'll always be the bomb.
- Stay away!
- No! Never!
Almost there.
I'm not letting you get away again!
- Got to keep away from McQueen!
- Request acknowledged.
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening? It's a bad dream!
And Lightning McQueen just blasted away, hooked to the now rocket-propelled tow truck.
Gargh!
Aagh!
The Professor's on the run!
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!
- Holley, I'll get Zundapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!
What is happening?
Hurry, Professor.
You really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor?
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!
Give it up, McMissile.
- Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.
Oh, no.
Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you.
Bomb?
Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?
Death ray?
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.
Everything is voice-activated these days.
Deactivate! Deactivate!
Voice denied.
- Huh!
- Oops.
Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it?
- Say it.
- Deactivate.
Voice denied.
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.
I'm going out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct?
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.
But becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better.
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.
Pit stop.
Not today, boys.
Retreat!
Thanks for the help, Corporal.
Anything for one of Pop's mates.
What's he saying? What's wrong?
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.
I get it. I get it!
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!
What? No. I can't do it.
Nobody takes me seriously.
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.
Yes, it is.
Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs.
Be yourself here.
And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change, not you.
I know that because I was wrong before.
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.
Thanks, buddy.
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!
Oh, right. Hang on!
Where's he going?
- Computer!
- Yes, Agent Mater?
I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged.
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!
The second kind, not the first!
Deploying chute.
Who's winning the race?
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.
Okay.
Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurtin' the cars, and I know who.
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.
Bomb! It's a bomb!
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!
Get off the stage! Move it!
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
Mater, I don't know what you're doing, but stand down now.
This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.
Mater, just cut to the chase.
Okay. It's him.
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.
I figured it out when I realized y'all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts... the same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph.
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.
I remembered what they say about old British engines:
If there ain't no oil under 'em, there ain't no oil in 'em.
What is he talking about?
It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan.
You just blamed it on me.
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.
If we pop that hood, we'll see that engine from that picture.
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!
Stay away!
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?
To make allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil.
He said it himself with that disguised voice.
Disguised voice? What are you talking about? You're nuts, you are!
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.
One moment, I'd like to see where this is going.
Mater, he created allinol.
But what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else?
What if he came up with allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!
- Mater!
- Someone do something!
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!
- Bomb deactivated.
- Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.
How did the tow truck figure it out?
It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.
Now you're talkin'!
Hyeeugh!
Mater, let's go. You're on.
Your Majesty, may I present for the investiture of honorary knighthood of the British Realm...
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.
Go get 'em, buddy.
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir" business.
By the way, have y'all met each other?
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.
So there we was, my rocket jets going full blast,
McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowheres, guns drawed.
We was goners.
But then, out of nowhere this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!
That's a very entertaining story, young man.
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.
Holley! What are you doin' here?
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.
Finn!
Our satellites picked up an urgent communique.
So you got-a my email.
Y'all is going to have a great time!
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.
Don't tell nobody.
And this is Holley Shiftwell.
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.
It's so nice to meet you all.
Guido believe you now.
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in and you saved them in London?
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time.
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.
Those two are perfect for each other.
There's one thing I still don't get.
The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right?
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.
Our investigation proved that allinol was actually gasoline and Axlerod engineered it so when it got hit by the beam, it would explode.
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!
If you're implying that I switched that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel with my all-natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man!
It was him!
Once big oil, always big oil, man.
Tree-hugger.
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin.
All spectators, clear the starting line.
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!
We should do this every year.
Yeah, I just figured we never found out who the world's fastest car is.
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.
- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- SignorinaSally.
It is official.
Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world.
Why, thank you.
Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today!
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?
Just something I had made up for the occasion.
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.
Was-a funnier when I did it, but it's-a very funny.
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?
Try it. You'll like it.
So, he's not so good-looking.
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!
That's why I love you, Sally.
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!
And those open wheels.
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself some coolant.
Go, Lightning!
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!
Finn? Time to go.
Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly.
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.
Just stopped by here to pick something up.
Somethin' tells me you're not talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.
Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met.
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.
But as much fun as it was hangin' with y'all, this...
This is home.
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.
You still owe me that first date.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.
Actually, there is one thing.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! I'll be doggone!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thanks, Mater!
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!
Impossible!
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!
Not if I see you first!
Yippee!
