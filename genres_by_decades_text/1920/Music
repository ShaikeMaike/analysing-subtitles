There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.
Hot, eh?
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.
I've got the hottest song you ever heard in your life.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.
Got it? Have you got it?
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.
The second chorus, a little jazz, a little pep.
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.
Go on, Herb.
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.
Hot dog!
Listen, kid, if we can get that number, we're a cinch for the Palace.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song and smack it over for you.
Sure!
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming from the West to put it over for me.
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste a swell number like that...
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?
Nix cracking, Rosie.
Half of that sister team is going to be the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
If you wanna be made overnight, just give us a crack at that number.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. Positively not.
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.
Oh, but listen, if you want a song...
...see Georgie Cohan.
He writes good music too.
How about it, Jimmy?
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.
Quiet. I told you to pack that cooking outfit in the trunk.
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel holds the trunks, we still eat.
And, baby, when you don't eat, you lose a lot of calories.
Calories? What are they?
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?
You never got that complexion from the Greeks.
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.
And I counted them.
How high can you count?
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, food.
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the window and give me the high sign.
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
Screw.
Say, did they run out of everything but dollar signs on this thing?
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.
- Hank.
- Yes?
Come look at the elegant view.
Oh, that will be all, thank you.
Cup of coffee, order of rolls, a couple of eggs.
It worked.
Oh, Queenie, New York.
The place we've dreamed and talked about.
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.
But there's something about it that scares me, Hank.
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, it seems like we're taking an awful chance.
We were getting along so well out west.
Plenty of work, small jumps, a chance to save money.
And the act always went over big.
But here, nobody knows us.
Oh, I'm afraid.
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.
But we haven't got much money.
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back, just for one more year?
Back to those opera houses and town halls?
Those cheap hotels and their lobby comics?
Cooking our own food...
...washing our own clothes and ironing them on mirrors.
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.
Going ragged all summer and then darn near freezing in the winter. And why?
Just to save money enough to get to New York and show our act.
Oh, honey.
With your looks and my ability...
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Now don't worry.
You see that electric sign of the fellow in BVDs?
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...
...they're gonna have the Mahoney Sisters.
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...
Baby, they were plenty smart when they made you beautiful.
Come on, let's get cleaned up before Eddie gets here.
I'll run a tub for you.
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.
Hey, what are you singing?
The bubble song from Lux.
Will you join me?
No use of us both getting wet.
Will you wash mine?
I might as well. You never wash anything but your neck.
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.
Oh, you never do.
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.
Oh, I'll go.
Can you imagine my embarrassment?
Uncle Jed!
Hello, honey. How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Great.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!
Uncle Jed?
I'll be right out.
What a break for you.
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.
What do you know, Uncle Jed?
I've got you booked for 30 weeks over at the Manley Time.
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.
Say, listen, girls...
...you know, I know this town better than you do. And there are more sisters...
...doing their acts over the lunch counters in New York than over the...
Than in the theaters.
You're just a crapehanger.
Maybe, but let me tell you...
...tell you, tell you, tell you...
What's the name of that record you're playing?
Say, listen, girls...
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
I love both you girls, and I want to see you get along.
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.
But we aren't leaving this town till we get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...
Your coffee's here.
Bring the toothbrush glass when you come.
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!
Queenie!
Gosh, what a big girl you are.
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?
Well, I suppose you've decided to stay in New York.
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?
You bet.
I think we're making an awful mistake not to take that work.
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.
What did the Duncans have when they hit Times Square?
"My Patio."
Say, we've got more than the Duncans ever had.
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.
Say, what'd we do to them on the Gus Sun Time?
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.
- Eddie!
- Hank!
Oh, baby.
Let me have a good look at you.
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!
That's my Queenie!
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.
Queenie, all grown up and everything.
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss won't be so hard to take now.
I'll say it won't.
- Take it big.
- I did.
You were a funny-looking thing the first time I saw you...
...with those gangly legs and freckles.
But you certainly turned out to be a beautiful girl.
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.
Of course she is.
Well, Hank, now that you're here, when are we going to get married?
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.
Always doing something for somebody else.
No wonder I love you.
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Swell, Eddie.
Yeah, and you can feature that anytime in the electric lights.
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.
Hank, did you pack my new dress in the trunk?
I'll get it for you in a minute.
Come here, Queenie.
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.
Three carats.
Platinum.
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.
Gold garters!
Oh, Eddie, I always knew you'd make good.
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the little girl that made me come to New York.
Remember when I wanted to quit and give the whole thing up...
...and you made me stick it out?
Well, now I'm gonna do something for you.
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."
And he's naming his revue after it.
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.
True? You don't know how I stand with Zanfield.
- If we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?
And how much do we get?
You're gonna sing my "Broadway Melody" with me.
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.
Yeah, Eddie Kearns and the Mahoney Sisters.
Well, how does it go?
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse, and you come in on the chorus.
Then we do another chorus, and then go into a little dance.
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.
All ready, girls?
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?
Look at her.
Attagirl!
You like that?
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.
Go on, sit down, take a load off your mind.
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?
Come here.
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.
All right, now watch.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?
In a few minutes.
I haven't had a chance to talk to Zanfield yet.
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?
Sure, it's in the bank.
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!
Yes, sir?
We don't wanna take all afternoon to set one dance.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.
All right, Sam, let it go.
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.
The sets are all ready for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.
That's just an idea of what it's gonna be.
I can see that. It's just an idea.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
But don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.
Remind me to see that rehearsal in the morning. Make a note of that.
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't get it in the gold design, only in the silver.
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.
All right, wheel them in.
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?
Well, go over there and tell him what you want.
The Baloney Sisters.
Give us the introduction pickup and some choruses. And swell to the finish.
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.
Sam, looks like some carnival lost a good act.
I'm gonna lay that dame like a roll of linoleum.
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.
Well, all right, shoot.
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.
What's the matter with them?
There's something wrong with the piano.
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.
All right. All right, girls.
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.
I saw enough.
I can use the blond, but that little cluck is out.
But don't you know it's tough to put comedy over on a bare stage?
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.
I know, Eddie.
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.
We stopped the show every performance we did for Jake Wells.
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.
Say, you've been asking for trouble, and now you're gonna get it.
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond, you! What do you think of this act?
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!
Come here!
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!
Next time I'll give you a facial instead of a scalp treatment.
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick on me? I didn't start any fight with her.
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?
Don't let them throw you up in the air.
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.
Flo, what was the trouble about?
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.
Never mind who started it. Now run along and be a good little girl.
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?
I heard what you said about me.
Please, couldn't you use the both of us at the same salary?
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.
My sister is the business manager of the act.
You won't let on that it ain't the both of us you want, will you?
Of course not.
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!
All right.
Oh, Hank!
He can take his old show and put it where it'll do him the most good!
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?
Well, so am I busy, with 30 weeks waiting for me.
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!
Let me handle this. I can always take care of these things better with nobody around.
I'll talk to him.
All right, girls, we'll take this right from the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.
I heard what you said to Zanny.
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.
I could kiss you for that.
You mustn't do that, Eddie.
I guess I shouldn't.
I never realized you were...
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.
You mean next to Hank.
Yeah, sure.
You know, Hank's been everything in the world to me.
She's looked after me and worked for me, and fought for me, protected me.
I could never repay her for all her love and care.
Of course you love her, Queenie.
And you're gonna be everything that she wants you to be.
And I don't blame her for loving you.
Gee, but you're a cute kid.
And she loves you, Eddie.
I guess you and me are about all she ever thinks of.
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes so I couldn't sing...
...and go lame so I couldn't dance than to hurt Hank.
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!
I ain't booked acts for 10 years and not know how to handle them!
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!
- And plenty smart!
- And how!
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.
And we splits up for nobody!"
And with that, he smiled as nice as you please...
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.
"Maloney"!
Hey, come on and get those clothes on, will you?
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?
Yes, sir, everything ready to go when you say the word.
All right.
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.
Yes, that's perfectly safe.
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup for just one show a day?
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.
It ain't a bit different than it was in Reading, PA.
And we're going over just as big.
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.
"Big mammoth appearance of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.
Zanfield saw them once, and they were in.
With appreciation and regards to our agent, Uncle Jed."
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?
I'm nervous!
What's eating her?
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.
I get you.
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told you they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman, I design the costumes for the show...
...not the doors for the theater.
I know that. If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's killing my "Broadway Melody" number.
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, you!
When you get through with that noise, try and play my number.
Cut out the brass, and keep it very piano.
Are you back again?
Yes, and I'm telling you how I want my music played.
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.
You don't have to listen.
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was for buying it.
Maybe he'll get you to write the music for the show.
If I couldn't do better than this...
If you could, you wouldn't be waving a stick!
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.
What are you trying to do, ruin my profile?
Your profile was ruined the day you were born.
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.
Hey, put that spotlight over here on this girl!
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.
Say, you couldn't sing if you had a searchlight.
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.
Would you okay this bill for Miss William's second act?
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!
But you said ermine.
You'll giggle yourself right out of here one day.
Yes, sir.
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal, and he says there's a fortune in the show.
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.
From all the gold-diggers you got in the troupe.
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget off of his ledge, they're going some!
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.
Get out of here and hurry up.
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!
- Over there!
- Over where?
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.
More. With those beads.
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.
Elgin, call a doctor.
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.
Why, has he cut us out altogether?
Ain't it awful, the way they cut out these big stars?
I'll get to you in a minute.
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield, you can't cut us out like that.
We've got equity contract.
Kearns, go into the dance on the first chorus and end it there.
One more cut for you, dearie, and you'll be holding a spear.
And one more crack from you, bimbo, and you'll be holding a lily.
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out and give me a chance to do my number?
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage a moment? It's very important.
- All right.
- Yes, sir.
What's the trouble now?
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?
No, sir.
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.
Mahoney's the name, and let me tell you something...
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.
You may not know it, but we've played some of the very best...
Listen, we want you on the prow of that boat.
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.
But I don't want to take my clothes off.
No, that'll be all right.
But listen to me. I've never taken my clothes off in my life.
I know all about that. Come on.
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.
Over here.
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?
That's tough. I missed him.
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.
- That's fine.
- Great.
Sit down with us.
Oh, Jules. Jules.
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?
I guess it's just a gift.
By the way, what's the name of that little beauty on the boat?
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.
Yes, sir.
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.
What a flock of Johns will be waiting at that stage door!
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.
I may be there myself.
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.
Hank, did you see Queenie?
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had to get by on our legs before.
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face.
This is Broadway.
Yeah. Broad's way.
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.
Attagirl.
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek at you up there on that boat...
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?
I bet them that the most beautiful girl in New York will have supper with us.
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.
- No. Not tonight.
- No?
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.
We got a couple of others.
"Zanny saw them once, and they were in."
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.
Not altogether. And what of it?
Yeah, I know.
Do you think that's all I'll get to do, go on without any clothes on?
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.
You got a lot more on when you ain't got anything...
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.
Well, I guess I'll go get undressed again.
Come in.
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.
Well, listen. Zanny is giving a big party at his apartment tonight.
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?
That guy threw me out of your song tonight.
I ain't gonna give him a chance to throw me out of a window.
Let's get a bowl of chop suey, and we'll rewrite the show.
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.
Well, you can get most anything out of a bowl of chop suey.
Oh, cutie!
Come on, Queenie.
You two run along.
I've got some things to do, and I'll join you later.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.
Get your hat. You'll feel better when you get out of here.
Oh, sure, honey, come on.
I can't go.
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?
You've got a date with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.
I'll have to show you whether I can or not.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.
Maybe you had better wait for me just a few minutes down on the stage.
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.
- Hurry.
- I will.
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.
He ain't the right kind of a guy for you to go out with.
What difference does it make what kind of a guy he is?
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.
I can take care of myself. And you can both mind your own business.
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.
You keep out of this.
I've got my own life to live, and I'm gonna live it.
I'm not gonna be the third wheel to anybody's bicycle!
Oh, Queenie!
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?
Why, she's never gone against my advice before.
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.
I guess the bright lights got under her skin.
Come on, let's go and get a bowl of chili.
Queenie!
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.
Oh, they're elegant.
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.
Good morning, beautiful lady.
Oh, you frightened me.
Good morning.
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?
You have some place to go, haven't you?
Are you putting me out?
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.
Any girl that can look beautiful so early in the morning...
That sounds like you know a lot about girls.
I do. I'm an expert.
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.
Well, so long.
- Must I go?
- Please do.
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.
I'm arranging a little party tonight for your birthday.
- A party for me?
- Yes.
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.
Then I'm gonna wait right here till she gets back.
Well, it looks as if I'd better take the air.
I'll give you a ring a little later, shall I?
Fine.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And thank you again for the flowers.
Well, I've got my suspicions about any guy that kisses a girl's hand.
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.
What are you burned up about?
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.
Hank'll be here in a minute, and you can start raving to her.
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.
Why do you let a guy like that hang around you?
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick of hearing you crab all the time.
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.
What do you think of that?
I know. But you haven't anything to do in the show.
I can team you up with this blond and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.
Nope. I've gotta stick around and keep an eye on Queenie.
Queenie? What has she been doing?
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.
Night after night, she's out with Jock Warriner.
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.
With Eddie?
Now, now listen, Hank.
Why don't you give Eddie a break and marry him?
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.
That's it.
Now, watch this one.
Boy, if you could do that with my wife.
Say, give us something good, something new.
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?
Hello, everybody.
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."
Take this cake in the other room, and when you hear us yell "surprise"...
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.
Someone's coming. Are you all set?
Quiet, quiet.
Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?
Why, there was another party, and I forgot to tell her about this one.
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.
Jock Warriner, huh.
Say, listen, I've got an idea.
Let's give the party...
Let's give the party...
- For Hank.
- Great!
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.
Hank doesn't feel very well.
Well, all right, we'll go down to your room.
Good night. I hope you feel better.
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
You see what you're missing?
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.
Good night, dear.
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.
But don't make it too long. You know that bottle won't last very long.
Queenie and me have always been on the level.
And now I'm fronting for her.
Won't you please give her all the best of the breaks?
What's the matter, Hank?
I lost something.
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.
That's one break.
Goodbye, baby.
Happy birthday.
Queenie, aren't you having a good time?
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.
Call me Jock, won't you?
All right.
Mr. Warriner.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.
I want you to stand up here where everyone can see you.
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!
A happy birthday to Queenie, the queen of New York's beautiful girls.
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!
I can't say anything but thanks, everybody. A lot.
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?
That cake is just elegant...
...but I can't eat it all.
Well, you eat as much as you can, and we'll save the rest.
Please, Mr. Warriner, ask them to play something else.
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.
"Broadway Melody."
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.
Tell me...
...why don't you like that song?
I don't know.
Well, what do you like?
I like cake.
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?
Maybe.
You mean it?
Maybe.
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?
Maybe.
Please, I wanna dance.
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.
But look, everybody's dancing, and the music is playing and everything.
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?
Why, of course.
Diamonds should only be worn by beautiful girls.
Oh, it's just adorable.
I'd like to do a lot of things for you, Queenie.
How would you like an apartment all your own?
Say, on Park Avenue.
And a car all your own.
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.
Well, I'd have to think about that.
Say, where have you been?
I've been looking all over the place for you.
You would come in at a time like this.
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.
Let's have this dance.
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.
Well, that's swell, because I wanna to tell you...
...about the grandest party that ever happened to me.
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see anything more beautiful in all your life?
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.
And Eddie said he wouldn't even give me a ring.
What would I want with his ring?
There's more diamonds in a bracelet, ain't they? Ain't they?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying this for...
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.
And an apartment on Park Avenue.
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.
Now, honey, listen to me.
I know we ain't had the greatest break in the world since we hit New York.
But that's gonna change.
That's got to.
And you're gonna meet somebody that's right.
Somebody you can be proud of, who'll just be crazy about you.
Somebody who's really worthy of you.
Somebody like Eddie.
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...
...with some song-and-dance guy...
...who expects me to cook his meals over a gas-jet...
...listen to a lot of smart wisecracks and bum songs.
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.
Move over.
No more of these kind of dumps for mine.
I'm gonna have everything in the world I want.
That's me.
And you're gonna have Eddie.
Queenie, I don't want you to answer me like that again.
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.
How are you gonna stop me?
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?
And don't you see what I'm doing is for your...
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.
You're not gonna go out with that guy, hear me?
I'll stop you if I have to tie you up to do it. You hear me?
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.
Well, you hear me. I'm going out with whoever I want...
...and I won't hear orders from anyone about it.
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!
You ain't my boss. So mind your own business and shut up.
Oh, Queenie.
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet, and you don't know things.
What Hank has been saying to you is for your own good.
Yeah, and I suppose what you're saying is for my own good too.
As far as that goes, yes, it is.
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because I...
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.
And whether you like me or hate me, you're gonna pay attention to me...
...because I'm...
Well...
Me and Hank won't let you go out with that guy. He's no good.
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.
You and Hank...
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.
Here's your pants, sir.
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.
Oh, can't I say nothing that will make you see what I mean?
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Warriner. Do you know what they say about that guy?
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?
What are you so interested for?
What business is it of yours where I go and who I go with?
It's my business because...
Well, because it is.
Oh, you ought to know why I'm doing this.
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.
And you gotta hear it.
I love you, Queenie.
I love you, and you know it.
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.
But it's easy to say now.
I love you, dear.
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?
Yes, Eddie.
And that's why we can't...
Oh, don't you see now why...
Why what?
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.
Here's your coat, sir.
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.
Get on there, Kearns.
Queenie, you better be here when I get off.
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got no idea what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun without you trying to stop me?
Oh, I ain't trying to stop you having fun...
...but this thing will turn out bad.
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.
He ain't the type to take a girl out and buy her drinks...
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.
I'm old enough to know what I'm gonna do.
And I don't want no more cracks from you and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
What I'm saying's for your own good.
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.
You will give it to me.
Queenie.
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.
You're not gonna leave except with me and Hank.
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.
I'll make him suffer the way he's making me suffer.
Shut up!
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.
Gonna stay right here. No.
Let go of me.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from either of you. You've said enough.
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Queenie, Queenie!
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?
You gonna let a john like that steal her from you because he's got a little more jack?
Well, if you do, all I can say is you're a rotten quitter.
You love her, don't you?
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.
Say, if I loved a girl like you do Queenie...
...l'd fight for her. What's the matter with you? Where's your nerve?
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.
What do you think I've been meaning all along? I was on the level with this thing?
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.
Say, I wouldn't marry you if you was the last man on earth.
And at that, I ain't so sure you're the right guy for her.
You're a coward.
You're afraid of Jock Warriner, or you'd go out and fight for her.
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!
You're yellow. Do you hear me?
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.
You're white.
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Jed?
It's Hank.
Say, I've decided to take those 30 weeks.
You can team me up with that blond.
I'm breathless.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.
It's not half good enough for you.
I want you to have everything in the world.
Thank you.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?
I want you to meet my girlfriend.
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.
Why, I haven't had you to myself for a moment tonight.
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.
Wait, Queenie.
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.
Wait a minute, Queenie.
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.
You're going to stay right here with me.
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.
You won't keep me here, do you hear me? You won't.
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.
I won't stay with you another minute.
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.
What do you mean coming in here? Get out.
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.
Oh, Eddie.
What's the matter?
Oh, darling, let me see you.
Oh, Eddie. Have they hurt you, sweetheart?
Have they?
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.
You don't realize what you're doing.
You let me go. And you can take your jewelry and your presents...
...and everything. I don't want anything to do with you.
Let me get a sock at that guy.
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.
And stay out.
What do you know about that guy?
Got rid of that guy anyhow.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.
You dirty bums, you.
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.
I am.
I don't know why you feel sorry for anybody like me.
I'm no good.
I can't even scrap a little.
I let a heel like that take a sock at me and get away with it.
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.
I suppose you found that out from his hugs.
Well, if you couldn't stop them from throwing you out...
...how could I stop him from hugging me?
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.
Oh, Eddie, aren't you gonna take me home?
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?
Like you? Why, Queenie, I...
Oh, what is it? They've hurt you, I know they have.
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.
Now understand, it took six of them to throw me out.
Yes, Eddie.
Oh, what is it?
Oh, they'll be here any minute.
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?
Well, what's the matter with this thing?
See who that is.
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!
Oh, gee.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.
Oh, come here.
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be in the electric lights this time?
Queenie Kearns and Company?
No, sirree.
I'm only gonna be connected with the stage by marriage.
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest little home down on Long Island.
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.
And say, when you're finished with this tour, you're coming to live with us.
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine, where I can get service.
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
No home, no nothing.
Hank, you're just a born trouper.
Doggone this weather. It certainly is tough on colds, isn't it?
Well, say, I want Queenie and Eddie to see the act.
Say, where is that blond, anyway?
I don't know. She's always late.
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have a good time on your honeymoon?
Yeah, great.
Oh, Eddie, when you open your new show...
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.
Oh, you're grand.
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.
Okay.
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.
We're gonna break in the act and bring it to New York.
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.
I want two choruses...
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part in your show for that dame, get me?
Of course not, honey.
It's kind of rough yet, but don't you say it's pretty good for an opening?
You know, if you don't hurry, you're gonna miss that train.
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.
Oh, Hank.
That's all right, Queenie.
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.
Here. Here. Here's your valise.
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.
The season will be over before you know it, and she'll be back here with us.
It ain't that, honey.
But it seems like Hank ain't never had a real break.
And I guess I haven't done much to make her any happier.
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.
And now that she knows you're taken care of...
Don't cry, honey.
People can't help falling in love.
It comes to you no matter what you do.
And I love you, dear.
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.
You were just meant for me.
Opening in Peoria.
Four shows a day.
Zanny said he'd make me a star in six months.
Say, listen, it's better to star in...
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.
That's a bunk.
Say, now you listen to me, stupid. I'll handle things.
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway and in the Palace in less than six months.
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
Sure, it's...
It's... It's in the can.
[ENGLISH]
[SINGING]
They called her frivolous Sal
A peculiar sort of a gal
With a heart that was mellow
An all 'round good fellow
Was my gal Sal
Your troubles, sorrows and care
She was always willing to share
A wild sort of devil
But dead on the level
Was my gal Sal
[SINGING]
Watch them shuffle along
See them shuffle along
Go take your best gal, your real pal
Go down to the levee
I said to the levee
And join that shuffling throng
Hear that...
[SINGING "KOL NIDRE"]
[UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]
[SINGING]
Wonderful pals are always hard to find
Some folks have one
Some folks have none
And I was alone for years
But fate was kind
And in the end
Sent me a friend
Although he's not much higher
Than my knee
Still, he's the greatest thing on earth
To me
Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbors a chase
But his smile is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
Always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're a vision
To see
And when my work is done
Coming home with the setting sun
From the gate he'll start to run
And then I'll kiss my boy
Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me
He's an angel ofjoy
Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbors a chase
But his smile, his little smile
Is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
[LAUGHS]
Always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're his mother's
And they're a vision to see
And when my work is done
Coming home with the setting sun
From the gate he'll start to run
And then, oh
I'll... I'll kiss my boy
Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me
He's an angel ofjoy
[APPLAUSE]
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You ain't heard nothing yet.
Wait a minute, I tell you.
You ain't heard nothing.
You wanna hear, "Toot, Toot, Tootsie!"?
All right. Hold on, hold on.
Lou, play "Toot, Toot, Tootsie!"
Three choruses, you understand?
In the third chorus, I whistle.
Give it to them hard and heavy.
Go right ahead.
[BAND PLAYING "TOOT, TOOT, TOOSIE!"]
[SINGING]
Toot, toot, Tootsie, goodbye
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry
The little choo-choo train
That takes me away from you
You don't know
Just how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
Do it all over again
Watch for the mail
I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter
Then you'll know I'm in jail, hey, hey
Don't cry, Tootsie, don't cry
Kiss me, Tootsie, goodbye
[WHISTLING]
Get hot.
Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye
Ah!
Goodbye, Tootsie, don't cry
The little choo-choo train
That takes me away from you
You don't know
Just how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then, hey, hey
Come do it all over again
Watch for the mail
I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter
Then you'll know I'm in jail
Don't cry, Tootsie, don't cry
Ah!
Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye

Blue skies smilin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies do I see
[SCATTING]
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but little bluebirds all day long
I never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love
Oh, don't they fly?
Blue days, days, days
All of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
- Did you like that, Mama?
- Yes.
I'm glad of it.
I'd rather please you...
...than anybody I know of.
Oh, darling, will you give me something?
- What?
- You'll never guess.
Shut your eyes, Mama.
Shut them for little Jakie.
I'm gonna steal something.
[JAKIE LAUGHS]
Oh, Jakie.
I'll give it back to you someday too.
You see if I don't.
Mama, darling...
...if I'm a success in this show...
...well, we're gonna move from here.
- Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
We're gonna move up in the Bronx.
A lot of green grass up there and people you know.
The Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, the Goldbergs.
A whole lot of "bergs,"
I don't know them all.
And I'm gonna buy you a nice, black silk dress, Mama.
Mrs. Freedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
- Oh, no. No.
- Yes, she will. You'll see if she isn't.
I'm gonna get you a pink dress that will go with your brown eyes.
What do you mean, no?
Who is telling you?
What do you mean, no?
Yes, you'll wear pink or else.
Or else you'll wear pink.
And darling, oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
- Yeah?
- Yes. We're gonna ride the Shoot-the-Chutes.
- Do you know the dark mill?
- Yes?
- You ever been to dark mill?
- I wouldn't.
With me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You'll see if I don't.
Now, Mama. Mama, stop now.
You're getting kittenish.
Mama, listen. I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage with this show.
I'm gonna sing it jazzy.
Now, get this.
[SINGING]
Blue skies smilin' at me, me, me, me
Nothin' but little blue skies do I see
[SCATTING]
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but little bluebirds all day long
You like that slapping business?
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, oh, don't they fly?
Blue days, all of them gone
- Stop!
- Nothin' but...
Mother, I'm sorry I wandered away
Breaking your heart as I did
Now that I'm grown up
I've come back to say
Things that I felt as a kid
Dear
Mother of mine
When friends all doubt me
I still have you
Somehow you're just the same
Mother divine
With your arms around me
I know I'm not to blame
When skies are sunny
[JAKIE SINGING]
Ain't it funny?
That's when my pals
All haunt me
When things go wrong
And they don't want me
Mother, I still
Have you
Mother of mine
When friends all doubt me
I still have you
Somehow you're just the same
Mother divine
With your arms about me
I know
I'm not to blame
Gee, ain't it funny
When skies are sunny
That's when my pals
They haunt me
And when things go wrong
And they don't want me
Mother
I still have
You

-
- 
She's terribly jealous.
Oh!
Voilà!
- Mon mari!
- Her husband!
Oh.
Paulette!
Paulette! Ma Paulette!
Paulette!

S'il vous plaît.
Voilà.

Count Renard, this scandal will be your last.
At any rate, your last in Paris.
As the ambassador of Sylvania...
I cannot any longer permit our military attaché... to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless escapades.
Your Excellency, please -
But that is an end.
You will leave at once for Sylvania and report to Her Majesty the queen in person.
But, Your Excellency, I'm sure the stories you've heard about me are horribly- are horribly exaggerated.
Count Renard... for one week, I made it my business to follow you about personally.
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know it,
Your Excellency.
I would have taken you to some real places.
How dare you.
I know more about you than you think.
My wife has told me everything.
You are to take the first train.
I think I had better take the first airplane.
You are going by plane, monsieur?
Yes, Jacques.
And I've got to leave you.
You're not going to take me with you?
- I'm sorry.
- But what will you do without me?
Think how good I am at making up excuses for you.
Why, I can even imitate your voice on the telephone... and pretend you're at home to one lady... when you're really having supper with another.
Yes, Jacques.
You're a very good servant.
And you can tell lies better than anybody I know.
But I won't need you anymore.
In fact, I will probably be sent to a military prison.
But even so, you'll need me, monsieur.
Supposing someone you don't want to see calls at the prison.
Who's going to tell them you're not at home?
I can't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful Paris.
But, monsieur, I am a Frenchman.
And to be a Frenchman in Paris is nothing... because everyone in Paris is a Frenchman.
- That's true.
- But to be a Frenchman in -
- What is the name of your country?
- Sylvania.
That is different.
Why, even my stories will be new there.
I can actually tell them the one about the Frenchman and the farmer's daughter.
Oh, please, monsieur, take me to Pennsylvania.
- Sylvania.
- Take me to Sylvania.
All right, Jacques. I'll take you there.
Go and pack the bags.
Oh, thank you. Thank you, monsieur.
I am so happy.

I am not.
# You'll never miss me when I'm gone
Paris #
# But I know that I'll miss you #
# You took a lot of pains in teaching me #
# Why must we say adieu #
# I've seen your mild days #
# And some of your wild days #
# Down where the Seine flows #
# And where the champagne flows
# You taught me all that a kiss could be #
# Paris, your judgment was good enough for me #
# With you each night meant the thrill of excitement #
Montmartre and ladies
# That love to raise Hades #
# If I've been happy then you're to blame #
# Oh, Paris please stay the same #
# I've seen your blonde girls #
# With beautiful blonde curis #
# Sweet Paris daughters #
# In all of your quarters #
# They taught me all that a kiss could be #
# Paris, your ladies were good enough for me #
I've met brunettes here
# And little grisettes here #
# I've lost my station and my reputation #
# If I've been happy then you're to blame #
# Oh, ladies, please stay the same #
# I'm like my master
Now I'm leaving you #
# He's sad
So am I, Paris #
I try to follow in his footsteps too
# A few may remember me #
# I've seen your mild maids #
# I've see your wild maids #
# Both shy and sporty #
# Tried all under 40 #
# They taught me all that a kiss could be #
# Paris, your servants were good enough for me #
# If I've been happy then you're to blame #
# Oh, Paris please, stay the same ##
Ladies and gentlemen, on your right you see the Royal Opera House.
And on my left, the residence of
Her Majesty, Queen Louise I of Sylvania.
The construction of the castle was begun under Maximilian I in 1537...
and finished in 1687 under Maximilian VIII.
The castle contains one of the most beautiful picture galleries in the world... and its collection of art treasures is unsurpassed.
The castle represents a value of $110 million.
$110 million?
-
- 
Company...
- halt!
- 
You call that a goose step?
Why, that isn't a chicken step!
- You blackguards!
- Lieutenant!
Don't you realize Her Majesty is still asleep?
Quiet here! Take them away.
- Yes, sir.
- Shh!
Yes, sir.
Company... left... face!
Forward- on tiptoes- march!


Good morning, Your Majesty.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I'm so hopeful Your Majesty rested well.
Why am I always awakened from my dreams?
I'm sure it was a nice dream,
Your Majesty.
Oh, it was wonderful.
It was gorgeous.
Mmm. Oh.
Mmm.
I hope Your Majesty's dream comes true.
No.
I'm afraid it will always have to remain... a dream.
# There's a land of charm that I know #
# Land of sweet romance where I love to go #
# And its bounds touch my room #
# In the gloom where the shadows creep #
# Someone I meet there waits for me #
# Someone tender as a lover should be #
# And I whisper each night #
# As I close my eyes #
# In sleep #
# Dream lover #
# Fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# I'm held #
# In your spell #
# Knowing so well #
# Dreams never tell #
# We two can leave the world behind us #
# Nobody indiscreet can find us #
# Oh, dream lover mine #
# Secrets divine #
# I will share them #
# With you #
# Dream lover fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# Oh, my darling
I am just longing for a love of my own #
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us #
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us, I know #
# Dream lover #
# Secrets divine #
# I will share them #
# With you ##
Please, Your Majesty.
Won't you tell us more about your dream?
I'm afraid I can't.
It wasn't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen.
Was it the sort of dream for a lady-in-waiting?
I hope not.
I had a lovely dream myself- about Your Majesty.
I dreamed that Your Majesty got married.
And you call that a lovely dream?
Why not, Your Majesty?
We all wish, we all hope, we all pray...
- that very soon Your Majesty will be -
- Married.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Marriage. Marriage.
In all my country, nothing else is ever spoken of.
What do the children learn at school?
"The queen is unmarried still."
What do the papers write about?
"Is the queen to marry?"
What does my Parliament debate?
"When shall the queen marry?"
And from my ministers:
"Whom shall the queen marry?"
Marriage. Marriage.
That's all I hear, morning or night.
Didn't I tell that conductor never to play the "Wedding March" again?
But, Your Majesty, it is not the same conductor.
- This is a new one.
- Where's the old one?
He is being married today.
Oh.
Oh.
Phew!

-
- 
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
Well?
Whom can you suggest today?
For what, Your Majesty?
For my husband.
Now don't tell me you weren't talking about it.
You're always talking about it.
We have no one to suggest,
Your Majesty.
We have given the matter up.
- Really?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Oh, what a relief.
Oh, how glad I am.
And, uh... why have you given the matter up, may I ask?
Well, uh -
- You see, it's rather difficult.
- Very difficult.
Difficult?
You tell me it's difficult to find a husband for me?

Yes, Your Majesty.
Excuse me, Baron.
How does Her Majesty feel today?
And that's final, Admiral.
I certainly don't need any help from the navy.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But surely Your Majesty must realize that the field for selection is limited.
If marrying you were to make a man a king... that would be different.
But Your Majesty's husband would be simply prince consort.
After all, what is a prince consort?
He is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights.
- He has nothing to say, nothing to do.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
Of course, he has something to do, naturally.
And yet, uh, he has nothing to do, if you see what I mean.
I see.
He is Your Majesty's husband and nothing else.
Nothing else?
- But isn't it enough to be my husband?
- But, Your Majesty-
It never seems to occur to you gentlemen that there might possibly be some men... who would enjoy being my husband even if I were not a queen.
My face isn't actually painful to look at.
My complexion's quite good.
And in case you're too serious-minded to notice such things... let me inform you... my legs are perfect.
There's only one other leg like that in the whole of Sylvania.
And that's it.
Do you see?
Thank you.
I didn't see, Your Majesty.
How do you think I should behave?
Should I be humble, proud, apologetic?
Say as little as possible.
I don't think your French accent will please Her Majesty.
Is it still very notice-able?
No. It's very noticeable.

Oh. But that's terrible.
No. It's terrible.
How did you acquire this accent?
I'll tell you.
Once, in Paris,
I had an awful cold.
I went to see a great French doctor to cure it.
I rang the bell.
The door was opened by a lady.
- Mm-hmm.
- A beautiful lady.
Mm-hmm.
The doctor's wife.
And in less than a month...
I had lost my cold... but I had a terrific French accent.
 And if I'm talked to like this again,
I'll dissolve the cabinet.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I'll dismiss the whole general staff.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- And if that band...
plays the "Wedding March"once more...
- I'll give orders to shoot!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm sorry, Count.
You're next.
- What do you want?
- Count Alfred Renard...
Your Majesty's military attaché at Your Majesty's embassy in Paris.
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty.
- You'll have to wait.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What do you want?
- Count Alfred Renard...
Your Majesty's military attaché at Your Majesty's embassy in Paris.
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty.
- Didn't I tell you to wait?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Then wait.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Count.
Count Alfred, I understand you've been seriously involved... in a disgraceful affair with a woman.
No, Your Majesty.
With several.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I don't think it's funny.
I think it's serious.
Very serious.
- And I shall have to punish you.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I shall have to punish you very severely.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Otherwise you'd start all over again.
Yes!
I shall think of a punishment that will cure you forever.
An awful punishment.
Let me see.
An awful punishment.
You shall be ordered... to grow a beard.
- A beard, Your Majesty?
- Yes.
That will stop all your philandering.
You'll have to be serious in a beard.
And am I to be permitted to attend
Your Majesty after the beard is grown?
Certainly. I shall want to see that my instructions have been obeyed.
Then I fear Your Majesty will regret the order.
I look terrible in a beard.
- Really?
- Oh, dreadful.
Of course, there are men who look fine in beards, like sheiks.
- Well, yes. That's what I thought.
- But I don't.
- No?
- Oh!
Oh, I grew one once to see.
Ah, it came out all red and scraggly.
Oh, no. No, I assure Your Majesty... it would be the most awful-looking beard in Sylvania.
And -
That's saying a great deal.
- Well, then don't grow it.
- No, Your Majesty.
- Don't do it.
- No, no, Your Majesty.
- No beard.
- No, no, Your Majesty.
- You promise me.
- My word of honor.
But what can I do with you?
I've got to punish you.
May I make a suggestion?
You want to suggest a punishment for yourself?
Yes.
Of course.
Please.
Well, tell me.
If I were in Your Majesty's place...
I would say this:
"Count Alfred...
"the sort of life you've been leading must stop.
You shall not return to Paris."
Very good.
Then I would say:
- "Alfred" -
- Hmm?
"Count Alfred, you shall stay here...
"in the palace...
"attached to me.
And from morning till night, never dare to leave my side."
And you call that a punishment?
You're the most impudent man I've ever met.
You seem to forget you're talking to your queen.
Count Alfred will dine with me tonight.
At 8:00?
Yes, Your Majesty.
White uniform.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You understand?
Oh, yes, I understand.
# With such a bad report of you
I wonder what I ought to do with you #
# You really can't be too severe when my regret is so sincere #
# And true #
# If you were on probation #
# Could I depend on you #
# To make you think more kindly #
# Let me obey you blindly #
# You mean you'd really do #
# Anything to please the queen #
# Everything to please the queen #
# Morning, noon and night #
# I'm yours to command me #
# You want me good
Then I'll be good #
# You want me bad
Then I'll be bad #
# I mean, I could be both #
# If you demand me #
# Understand me #
# What if I demand your head #
# Perhaps you'd like my arms instead #
# I've lost my head the moment I saw you smile #
# Remember you're on trial #
# Will you do as I advise #
- # Madame, you will be surprised #
- # You mean #
# Anything to please the queen #
# Anything to please the queen #
# Everything to please the queen #
# Morning, noon and night #
# I'm yours to command me #
# You want me cold
Then I'll be cold #
# You want me bold
Then I'll be bold #
# I'll be bold or cold or hot #
# As you demand me #
# Understand me #
# You'll keep watch all day for me #
# A good night watchman I will be #
# I've learned that duty in Paris
You leave it to me #
# You'd better wait and see
We shall find how good you are #
# I've had no complaints so far #
- # You mean #
- # Anything to please the queen #
# Anything to please the queen ##
Perhaps you didn't quite follow me, Count.
You're invited for dinner, not for tea.
I followed Your Majesty perfectly.
Hmm. Too perfectly, I'm afraid.
Remember. 8:00.
Oh, Count.
Don't forget. No beard.
Oh, no, Your Majesty.
# Anything to please the queen
Everything to please the queen #
# Morning, noon and night
I'm yours to command ##



Just a minute, monsieur.
In case some lady should telephone, am I to say you have a date with the queen?
- No lady will telephone.
- But if?
Impossible. There is no telephone.
Do you know the story of the Frenchman and the farmer's daughter?
I know it.
I am the Frenchman.
You are not.
How do you know?
I am the farmer's daughter.
Go home.
Are you talking to me or to the dog?
- Is this your animal?
- Yes.
Then take it away. Don't you see it is eating out of the same dish as the queen's dog?
Listen here. If my master's good enough to have dinner with the queen... then his dog can eat dinner with the queen's dog.
- So, that's your master.
- Yes.
- That naughty boy from Paris?
- Yes.
Do you know why the queen has invited him for dinner?
Because the king's away.
There is no king.
- She hasn't got a husband?
- No.
Oh. Now I know why she invited him.
But, gentlemen, even if she liked him, would he be eligible to become the prince consort?
Why, absolutely. His great grandfather was the illegitimate son of one king... and his grandmother the sweetheart of another.
Oh.
I had no idea that he came from such a distinguished family.
And do you think Her Majesty is serious?
Why, how can you doubt it?
The first time she sees him, she invites him to dine with her alone.
- And if it goes on at this rate -
- Then we're entitled to the highest hopes.
Shh! They're coming.
They sit down.
They are seated.
She smiles at him.
He smiles at her.
They both smile... at each other!
At each other?
- She is laughing.
- That's the way they always start.
And how she laughs.
He must have told her the story of the Frenchman and the farmer-
The lackey is bringing in champagne.
Now they are clinking glasses.
She drinks his health.
He drinks hers.
He tells her, " This is the most beautiful moment of my life."
How do you know that he does?
You can't hear anything.
What else could he say?
They've opened the window.
What does it mean?
- The queen is warm.
- The champagne.
No. It's him.
She's going to her boudoir.
She opens the door.
- She enters the boudoir.
- Heavens!
She beckons to him.
He enters.
She closes the door behind them!
Heaven save the queen!
You know, Count... this is the first time
I've ever dined with a man alone.
And this is the first time
I have ever-
Don't lie.
The first time I ever dined with a queen.
But with women?
Of course.
Of course I have dined with women.
These dinners in Paris... were charming?
Yes.
The food in Paris is very, very good.
And the ladies?
Oh -
Well, I feel, by comparison... it must be very dull... dining with a queen.
It would be the most delightful experience of my life...
dining with a queen, if-
- lf?
- If one... could forget -
That I am a queen.
Yes.
Very well. Forget it.
I am no longer
Queen Louise I of Sylvania... but a woman.
A mere woman.
And you're meeting me for the first time.
What would you do?
Oh.
What would you do?
Hello, Louise.
All this the first time you meet?
Yes.
Oh.
Oh, but if it's like this at first... what can be left for later?
Plenty.
If she appeals to you... and if you find out that you love her... oh, there's plenty left...
- if she were like -
- Like?
If she were like -
# Loves I have known are buried in the past #

Stop. Stop that whistling.
- It's unlucky.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
And don't call me Your Majesty.
I'm not a king.
Oh, but you'll be a sensation.
Everyone will applaud when you enter the throne room.
Nonsense.
I feel sure you'll run away with the wedding.
Now, how do I look?
I don't like that medal.
What's the matter with it?
The man looks cross-eyed.
Cross-eyed?
King Stanislaus XXll cross-eyed?
Oh, no. No. That can't be.
That was never taught at school.
Still looks cross-eyed.
Maybe - Maybe it's a silly superstition... but each time I have seen a cross-eyed man...
I've had bad luck.
To me, it's even worse than whistling.

Come in.
Her Majesty is ready.
Just a minute, sir.
It's all right.
-
- 

Long live
Her Royal
Majesty
The queen
Long
May she reign
Serene
Proudly
We serve her
Here at her command
Queen
Of our hearts
And Sylvania
Our land



By personal order extraordinary...
Your Majesty has bestowed upon Count Alfred the title of prince... and by this merciful act has uplifted him to a station... where marriage between you is possible.
Is it still Your Majesty's wish... to select Prince Alfred as Your Majesty's husband?
It is.
Is Your Majesty willing to be a loving wife to the prince consort?
I am.
And will Your Majesty protect him from all danger?
I will.
And you, Prince Alfred... you abide by Her Majesty's selection... and are happy to accept the station of prince consort?
Yes.
You promise always to love Her Majesty?
Yes, I do.
You promise further to fulfill Her Majesty's every wish...
to execute Her Majesty's every command...
and to be an obedient and docile husband?
- He hesitates.
- Incredible.
- He hesitates at promising to obey.
- And to be docile.
He should've thought of that before.
Yes, I do.

I pronounce you wife... and man.
What does he say?
He says,
"Man is man, and woman is woman.
And that to change that causes trouble."
He does not see how any man could stand being a wife.
And therefore he hopes this will be a most unhappy marriage.
For heaven's sake.
If he reports this to Afghanistan -
Tell him this is a love match... and will be the happiest marriage in the world.
No tschungu.
No tschungu.
No tschungu.
Halt. Left face.

Have that firing stopped.
- Your Highness, that is impossible.
- Stopped at once.
I can't. It's etiquette.
Etiquette or no etiquette -
Can't you understand?
- Perfectly, sir.
- Ah.
But I can't help it.
- I command it.
- Very sorry.
I can take orders only from Her Majesty the queen herself.
So. We shall see.

Alfred?


Do you hear those cannons?
Yes. Isn't it glorious?
Our bridal music.


How many-
How many more shots will there be?
What?
And each time they fire, you shall kiss me.

I wish now I'd ordered 500.



That was the last.
- Too bad.
- Thank heaven.
I wish we could have a cannon when we get married.
Let's get married too.
Make it a double wedding.

Jacques.
Jacquesy!
- Lulu. You're cross -
- I'm not cross.
I'm thrilled!
Eh, don't get thrilled.
Perhaps we'd better wait with our marriage and see how they get on first.
But there's no chance of their marriage going wrong.
Why, it even started wrong.
What does that lady think she's marrying - a trained poodle?
She is not a lady.
She is a queen.
Well, he's not a king.
He's a gentleman.
But when royalty marry, they don't quarrel like common people do.
They can't afford to.
That's just the trouble.
They can't let off steam with a good old row like you or I.
That's true.
But we common people can take life easy.
We can act natural, and nobody will care.
We can eat chicken with our fingers.
Look at the names I can call you.
Look at the things I can throw at you.
Oh, it's wonderful being common.
# Snuggle near, baby dear #
# Why so haughty and severe #
# Let's get together and cuddle up right here #
# Bear in mind I'm refined #
# And I'm not that way inclined #
# Where's your proper pride #
# Why be so dignified #
# Squeeze me once
Squeeze me twice #
# S'most improper but, oh, it's nice #
# Let's be common #
# And do it again #
# Hug me do close to you #
# S'a beautiful feeling and thrills me through #
# Let's be common and do it again #
# I'll surely smother #
# Oh, let me go, sir
This isn't right #
# Oh, darling Mother #
# If you could see your daughter tonight #
# Grip my neck, grab my hand #
# S'most improper but, oh, it's grand #
# Let's be common #
# And do it again #
S'a lovely moon
S'a lovely night
# What's the matter with you
You're so polite #
# So let's be common #
# And do it again #
# You crush me
I'll crush you #
# S'possible we'll be black-and-blue #
# Let's be common #
# And do it again #
# Can't you be gentle #
# You'll bruise me till I'm ultramarine #
# Be sentimental #
# But don't act like a threshing machine #
# So let's be rough
You know how #
# S'no use struggling
Too late now #
# So let's be common #
# And do it again ##


Don't do it again!
Ladies and gentlemen... four weeks ago today, our illustrious queen was married.
The desire of her subjects to celebrate this date... is readily understood.
But in consideration of the royal honeymoon...
I must ask the public to refrain just a little longer... from any serenades, torchlight processions... or public demonstrations of any kind and, in particular... to patriotically observe quiet within the limits of the castle... especially in the early morning hours.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
And don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, this program comes to you... by courtesy of the Sylvania Hardware Corporation... the company that gives you two pots for the price of one.


Louise.
Louise.

Why, you're up, dear?
Yes. I'm surprised myself.
I might as well lie in bed all day.
I have nothing to get up for.
Well, what a charming reception.
I spend all morning reviewing the household guards, distributing medals... and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister...
I steal away to have a look at my husband, and-and -
He doesn't even say good morning to me.
Good morning.
Well, that finishes my morning's work.
What can I do now?
I have already shaved.
I had my hair cut yesterday.
There's nothing left.
So, you're bored.
All I'm waiting for now is to have you tell me I'm neglecting you.
Do you realize that not once since we've been married... have I left you alone at night?
And I never will.
Thank you.
It's very kind of you.
And after this foreign loan is arranged...
I'm going to take you to Vienna... and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms.
That's it. You think all you have to do is to buy me a few new uniforms... and I'll be satisfied.
That's the opinion you have of me, is it?
Oh, don't be silly, Alfred.
Oh, I'm sick of being treated as if I were a sort of plaything.
- You're in a horrible mood today.
- Am I?
- You have a cold?
- No.
Why do you cough?
Listen, Louise. You have the power to exclude me from all military affairs... from all cabinet meetings.
But, please, do not interfere with my coughing.
I cough when I want to.
At last, I've found something to do.
I will repair this today.
Yes. Immediately after-
I almost forgot something very important.
Alfred, where are you going?
Something very important.
I am going to have breakfast.
Where is my breakfast?
May I remind Your Highness... that Her Majesty the queen has not as yet appeared.
- Well. And?
- Well, I'm sure Your Highness knows... that breakfast cannot be served before the appearance of Her Majesty.
I want my breakfast.
Your Highness, I am very sorry.
- We must wait.
- I can't wait.
I want my breakfast.
I'm hungry.
Your Highness, I regret it, but it's impossible to -
Her Majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning.
Breakfast for His Highness.
Please, Your Highness.
- Do you speak French?
- No, Your Highness.
You're the only one in the palace who looks up to me.
#Just look at me #
# I think my heart will break #
# Nobody seems to take me seriously #
# Honestly #
# I'm just as lonely as a man can be #
# The days mean nothing at all #
# And when the shadows fall #
# The moon is only wasting time on me #
# Candidly #
# There must be something awful wrong #
# With me #
# I have a pair of hands #
# To hug and hold #
# But nobody's using them now #
# I've loads of love #
# That could be told #
# But nobody's using them now #
# I've a world of time #
# That's all my own #
# They say that you go silly if you spend it alone #
# I'm telling the truth
I'm just wasting my youth #
# 'Cause nobody's using it now
No, no, no, no #
# Nobody's using it now #
# There's a bridal suite #
# In gold and blue #
# But nobody's using it now #
# I've learned to wear pajamas too #
# What's the use of wearing them now #
# I've sown wild oats #
# I have indeed #
# But now that I've stopped sowing them
I'm going to seed #
# For years and for years
I've had great ideas #
# But nobody's using them now
No, no, no, no #
# Nobody's using them now #
# I have a big settee with patent springs #
# I've some pleasing ways and - other things #
# I'm a family man who's out of sorts #
# I'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts #
# I blush to admit
I've still plenty of"it" #
# But nobody's using it now
No, no, no, no #
# Nobody's using it now
Zum, zum ##


...try to see the prince.
Isn't there standing room?
Oh, but I must see the prince.

Oh? Oh.
Oh, is that so?
Mm-hmm. All right.
The moment it was announced that Your Majesty... would attend the opening of the opera in person... the place was completely sold out.
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country.
- Yes, indeed, Your Majesty.
Have the spotlights been focused on the entrance to the opera house?
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
Twelve motion picture cameras will photograph the arrival... of Your Majesty and the prince consort.
The crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm... that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police.
And has all this been well rehearsed?
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
The crowd is the same one that we used at Your Majesty's wedding.
They all know their parts perfectly.
Good. Go on.
When Your Majesty and the prince consort appear in the royal box... the whole audience will rise.
For two minutes, we will have silent homage.
Your Majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles.
You are both in the best of humor.
- In the best of humor?
- Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
And does the prince consort know he's to be in the best of humor?
Well -
Your Majesty, I-I -
- Well, you'd better tell him, to be safe.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty frightens us.
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing your matrimonial happiness to the public.
- And if the prince consort does not smile in joy- - It will mean disaster.
The diplomatic representatives of the whole world will be guests in the royal box.
And unfortunately, the Afghan ambassador too.
And if he sees any coolness between you, he'll report it to Afghanistan.
Well, let him.
But surely Your Majesty knows that if Afghanistan hears anything...
Baluchistan hears it too.
And if Baluchistan hears it, then all Persia will know it.
And what is talked of in Persia spreads all over Turkey.
And when anything is known in Turkey, the Armenians get onto it immediately.
And you know how many Armenians go to America.
So if Wall Street hears of a rift in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty... it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan.
- And without that loan, we are broke.
- Broke!

So, unless I have a smile on my face tonight, we are broke.
- Yes, Your Highness.
- And you call yourselves statesmen.
Borrowing money is all that you're able to do.
Prince Alfred, what are you permitting yourself?
I permit myself to make the following suggestion.
We do not need a loan.
We have enough natural resources.
There is my plan for the national budget.
I have worked out everything - in my sleepless days.
The country can be saved without a loan.
Go on.
Read it.
It includes everything.
Even your dressmakers' bills.
I am not permitted to receive suggestions in the affairs of state... from the prince consort.
Not even when they are good?
Not even then.
- Do you speak French?
- Yes, Your Highness.
Too bad.
Prince Alfred, I must ask you once and for all... not to interfere in affairs of state.
I know.
I'm Your Majesty's husband and nothing else.
Prince Alfred, you may leave the room.
Stay, gentlemen.
Prince Alfred, you will meet me here at 7:00... in full gala uniform - all medals and decorations - and in the very best of humor.
And in case I don't feel like complying with Your Majesty's wish?
This is not my wish.
It is my command.
If Your Majesty had not already commanded me to smile...
I would laugh.


# When they went riding yesterday they never spoke a word #
- # You don't say #
- # Is it true #
- # Think of that #
- # Who's to blame #
# And he asked for garlic in his soup at dinner, so I heard #
- Something's wrong
- Did you hear
- Are you sure
- What a shame

- # Good for you #

You can tell him my patience is exhausted.
If he won't come here voluntarily,
I'll have him brought here... even if I have to send soldiers.
Yes, Your Majesty.

His Highness, the prince consort.

Why are you dressed like this?
What does it mean?
It means I'm dressed for traveling.
I'm going to Paris.
You go change at once.
You're going to the opera with me.
Only with soldiers and handcuffed.
Alfred, you know very well how much depends on this - my name, my position, my reputation as queen.
If you fail me tonight, all will be over between us.
It is already over- and forever.
- Alfred.
- You have gone too far, madame.
You thought you could order the former military attaché around and command the husband.
But you forgot one thing, madame - that first, I am a man.
- I know that, Alfred.
- No, you do not.
But I'm going to prove it to you.
Good-bye, madame.
- You mean you're really going?
- Yes.
Oh, but, Alfred, won't you love me anymore?
Only with soldiers and handcuffed.

Alfred!
Alfred!

As for myself, you needn't have come at all.
All right, good-bye.
Stay here.
Beg me to stay.
I ask you to stay.
Don't ask me. Beg me.
I beg you to stay.
Not commanding.
Begging.
Begging.
I beg you to stay.
Since you beg me so lovingly...
I'll be generous.
I'll stay.
You want to humiliate me.
That's why you came here.
No. I came because -
Why?
Because, after all...
I didn't want to ruin the woman
I once loved.
But tomorrow, I'm leaving for Paris.
And as soon as this loan of yours is signed...
I will file papers for divorce.
If you don't treat me nicely,
I'll go right home.
All right. Go on.
Still here?

If you don't take those glasses from your eyes,
I'll tear them away.
Go on.
You can't do it, eh?
You're a queen.
You must behave.
If you were just a mere woman, you could make a scandal.
But you can't.
That's what you get for being a queen.
Huh?
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh!
He'll never get these glasses back.

- 
Applaud.
Smile.
Oh! We are in the very best of humor, eh?


I blush to admit
I've still plenty of"it"
But somebody will use it now
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Somebody will use it now
She is in her room, and he is in his.
Yes. Sad, isn't it?
When we get married, let's be common... and only have one room between us.
Why even one room between us?


Who is it?
Louise.
What do you want?
A mouse is in my room.
Call your soldiers.

What are you doing?
Packing.
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.
-
- 





Please.

The key, please.
So, you're trying to use force again, madame?

Where shall we live in Paris?
- We?
- Yes.
I'm going with you.
Wherever you go,
I'll follow you.
You can't get rid of me.
Well, there is no use for me to leave then.
No. No use at all.
I suppose I might as well stay here.
I suppose so too.
But how am I going to punish you?
- And you must be punished.
- Yes.
- And severely.
- Yes.
But how?
Let me see.
An awful punishment.
Let me see.
It's really not so easy.

May I- May I make a suggestion?
Yes.
Sit down.
If I were in your place, I'd say:
"Louise, I don't want a divorce.
- I love you too much for that."
- No, no, no, no, no.
But I'd say: " Louise...
"you can't order me around any longer.
" From now on,
I shall take command -
"not only of the affairs of state...
"not only in the Department of the Navy... but also here at home."
And my first command would be...
"Louise, don't dare to leave this room.
"You shall stay here...
"at my side... attached to me from morning till, uh" -
"from night till morning."
And you call that a punishment?
Yes... my king.

There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.
Hot, eh?
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.
I've got the hottest song you ever heard in your life.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.
Got it? Have you got it?
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.
The second chorus, a little jazz, a little pep.
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.
Go on, Herb.
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.
Hot dog!
Listen, kid, if we can get that number, we're a cinch for the Palace.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song and smack it over for you.
Sure!
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming from the West to put it over for me.
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste a swell number like that...
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?
Nix cracking, Rosie.
Half of that sister team is going to be the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
If you wanna be made overnight, just give us a crack at that number.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. Positively not.
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.
Oh, but listen, if you want a song...
...see Georgie Cohan.
He writes good music too.
How about it, Jimmy?
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.
Quiet. I told you to pack that cooking outfit in the trunk.
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel holds the trunks, we still eat.
And, baby, when you don't eat, you lose a lot of calories.
Calories? What are they?
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?
You never got that complexion from the Greeks.
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.
And I counted them.
How high can you count?
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, food.
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the window and give me the high sign.
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
Screw.
Say, did they run out of everything but dollar signs on this thing?
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.
- Hank.
- Yes?
Come look at the elegant view.
Oh, that will be all, thank you.
Cup of coffee, order of rolls, a couple of eggs.
It worked.
Oh, Queenie, New York.
The place we've dreamed and talked about.
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.
But there's something about it that scares me, Hank.
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, it seems like we're taking an awful chance.
We were getting along so well out west.
Plenty of work, small jumps, a chance to save money.
And the act always went over big.
But here, nobody knows us.
Oh, I'm afraid.
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.
But we haven't got much money.
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back, just for one more year?
Back to those opera houses and town halls?
Those cheap hotels and their lobby comics?
Cooking our own food...
...washing our own clothes and ironing them on mirrors.
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.
Going ragged all summer and then darn near freezing in the winter. And why?
Just to save money enough to get to New York and show our act.
Oh, honey.
With your looks and my ability...
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Now don't worry.
You see that electric sign of the fellow in BVDs?
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...
...they're gonna have the Mahoney Sisters.
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...
Baby, they were plenty smart when they made you beautiful.
Come on, let's get cleaned up before Eddie gets here.
I'll run a tub for you.
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.
Hey, what are you singing?
The bubble song from Lux.
Will you join me?
No use of us both getting wet.
Will you wash mine?
I might as well. You never wash anything but your neck.
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.
Oh, you never do.
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.
Oh, I'll go.
Can you imagine my embarrassment?
Uncle Jed!
Hello, honey. How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Great.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!
Uncle Jed?
I'll be right out.
What a break for you.
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.
What do you know, Uncle Jed?
I've got you booked for 30 weeks over at the Manley Time.
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.
Say, listen, girls...
...you know, I know this town better than you do. And there are more sisters...
...doing their acts over the lunch counters in New York than over the...
Than in the theaters.
You're just a crapehanger.
Maybe, but let me tell you...
...tell you, tell you, tell you...
What's the name of that record you're playing?
Say, listen, girls...
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
I love both you girls, and I want to see you get along.
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.
But we aren't leaving this town till we get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...
Your coffee's here.
Bring the toothbrush glass when you come.
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!
Queenie!
Gosh, what a big girl you are.
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?
Well, I suppose you've decided to stay in New York.
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?
You bet.
I think we're making an awful mistake not to take that work.
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.
What did the Duncans have when they hit Times Square?
"My Patio."
Say, we've got more than the Duncans ever had.
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.
Say, what'd we do to them on the Gus Sun Time?
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.
- Eddie!
- Hank!
Oh, baby.
Let me have a good look at you.
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!
That's my Queenie!
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.
Queenie, all grown up and everything.
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss won't be so hard to take now.
I'll say it won't.
- Take it big.
- I did.
You were a funny-looking thing the first time I saw you...
...with those gangly legs and freckles.
But you certainly turned out to be a beautiful girl.
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.
Of course she is.
Well, Hank, now that you're here, when are we going to get married?
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.
Always doing something for somebody else.
No wonder I love you.
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Swell, Eddie.
Yeah, and you can feature that anytime in the electric lights.
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.
Hank, did you pack my new dress in the trunk?
I'll get it for you in a minute.
Come here, Queenie.
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.
Three carats.
Platinum.
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.
Gold garters!
Oh, Eddie, I always knew you'd make good.
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the little girl that made me come to New York.
Remember when I wanted to quit and give the whole thing up...
...and you made me stick it out?
Well, now I'm gonna do something for you.
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."
And he's naming his revue after it.
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.
True? You don't know how I stand with Zanfield.
- If we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?
And how much do we get?
You're gonna sing my "Broadway Melody" with me.
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.
Yeah, Eddie Kearns and the Mahoney Sisters.
Well, how does it go?
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse, and you come in on the chorus.
Then we do another chorus, and then go into a little dance.
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.
All ready, girls?
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?
Look at her.
Attagirl!
You like that?
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.
Go on, sit down, take a load off your mind.
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?
Come here.
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.
All right, now watch.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?
In a few minutes.
I haven't had a chance to talk to Zanfield yet.
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?
Sure, it's in the bank.
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!
Yes, sir?
We don't wanna take all afternoon to set one dance.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.
All right, Sam, let it go.
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.
The sets are all ready for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.
That's just an idea of what it's gonna be.
I can see that. It's just an idea.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
But don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.
Remind me to see that rehearsal in the morning. Make a note of that.
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't get it in the gold design, only in the silver.
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.
All right, wheel them in.
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?
Well, go over there and tell him what you want.
The Baloney Sisters.
Give us the introduction pickup and some choruses. And swell to the finish.
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.
Sam, looks like some carnival lost a good act.
I'm gonna lay that dame like a roll of linoleum.
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.
Well, all right, shoot.
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.
What's the matter with them?
There's something wrong with the piano.
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.
All right. All right, girls.
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.
I saw enough.
I can use the blond, but that little cluck is out.
But don't you know it's tough to put comedy over on a bare stage?
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.
I know, Eddie.
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.
We stopped the show every performance we did for Jake Wells.
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.
Say, you've been asking for trouble, and now you're gonna get it.
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond, you! What do you think of this act?
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!
Come here!
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!
Next time I'll give you a facial instead of a scalp treatment.
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick on me? I didn't start any fight with her.
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?
Don't let them throw you up in the air.
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.
Flo, what was the trouble about?
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.
Never mind who started it. Now run along and be a good little girl.
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?
I heard what you said about me.
Please, couldn't you use the both of us at the same salary?
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.
My sister is the business manager of the act.
You won't let on that it ain't the both of us you want, will you?
Of course not.
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!
All right.
Oh, Hank!
He can take his old show and put it where it'll do him the most good!
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?
Well, so am I busy, with 30 weeks waiting for me.
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!
Let me handle this. I can always take care of these things better with nobody around.
I'll talk to him.
All right, girls, we'll take this right from the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.
I heard what you said to Zanny.
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.
I could kiss you for that.
You mustn't do that, Eddie.
I guess I shouldn't.
I never realized you were...
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.
You mean next to Hank.
Yeah, sure.
You know, Hank's been everything in the world to me.
She's looked after me and worked for me, and fought for me, protected me.
I could never repay her for all her love and care.
Of course you love her, Queenie.
And you're gonna be everything that she wants you to be.
And I don't blame her for loving you.
Gee, but you're a cute kid.
And she loves you, Eddie.
I guess you and me are about all she ever thinks of.
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes so I couldn't sing...
...and go lame so I couldn't dance than to hurt Hank.
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!
I ain't booked acts for 10 years and not know how to handle them!
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!
- And plenty smart!
- And how!
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.
And we splits up for nobody!"
And with that, he smiled as nice as you please...
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.
"Maloney"!
Hey, come on and get those clothes on, will you?
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?
Yes, sir, everything ready to go when you say the word.
All right.
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.
Yes, that's perfectly safe.
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup for just one show a day?
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.
It ain't a bit different than it was in Reading, PA.
And we're going over just as big.
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.
"Big mammoth appearance of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.
Zanfield saw them once, and they were in.
With appreciation and regards to our agent, Uncle Jed."
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?
I'm nervous!
What's eating her?
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.
I get you.
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told you they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman, I design the costumes for the show...
...not the doors for the theater.
I know that. If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's killing my "Broadway Melody" number.
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, you!
When you get through with that noise, try and play my number.
Cut out the brass, and keep it very piano.
Are you back again?
Yes, and I'm telling you how I want my music played.
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.
You don't have to listen.
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was for buying it.
Maybe he'll get you to write the music for the show.
If I couldn't do better than this...
If you could, you wouldn't be waving a stick!
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.
What are you trying to do, ruin my profile?
Your profile was ruined the day you were born.
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.
Hey, put that spotlight over here on this girl!
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.
Say, you couldn't sing if you had a searchlight.
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.
Would you okay this bill for Miss William's second act?
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!
But you said ermine.
You'll giggle yourself right out of here one day.
Yes, sir.
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal, and he says there's a fortune in the show.
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.
From all the gold-diggers you got in the troupe.
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget off of his ledge, they're going some!
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.
Get out of here and hurry up.
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!
- Over there!
- Over where?
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.
More. With those beads.
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.
Elgin, call a doctor.
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.
Why, has he cut us out altogether?
Ain't it awful, the way they cut out these big stars?
I'll get to you in a minute.
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield, you can't cut us out like that.
We've got equity contract.
Kearns, go into the dance on the first chorus and end it there.
One more cut for you, dearie, and you'll be holding a spear.
And one more crack from you, bimbo, and you'll be holding a lily.
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out and give me a chance to do my number?
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage a moment? It's very important.
- All right.
- Yes, sir.
What's the trouble now?
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?
No, sir.
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.
Mahoney's the name, and let me tell you something...
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.
You may not know it, but we've played some of the very best...
Listen, we want you on the prow of that boat.
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.
But I don't want to take my clothes off.
No, that'll be all right.
But listen to me. I've never taken my clothes off in my life.
I know all about that. Come on.
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.
Over here.
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?
That's tough. I missed him.
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.
- That's fine.
- Great.
Sit down with us.
Oh, Jules. Jules.
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?
I guess it's just a gift.
By the way, what's the name of that little beauty on the boat?
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.
Yes, sir.
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.
What a flock of Johns will be waiting at that stage door!
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.
I may be there myself.
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.
Hank, did you see Queenie?
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had to get by on our legs before.
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face.
This is Broadway.
Yeah. Broad's way.
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.
Attagirl.
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek at you up there on that boat...
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?
I bet them that the most beautiful girl in New York will have supper with us.
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.
- No. Not tonight.
- No?
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.
We got a couple of others.
"Zanny saw them once, and they were in."
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.
Not altogether. And what of it?
Yeah, I know.
Do you think that's all I'll get to do, go on without any clothes on?
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.
You got a lot more on when you ain't got anything...
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.
Well, I guess I'll go get undressed again.
Come in.
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.
Well, listen. Zanny is giving a big party at his apartment tonight.
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?
That guy threw me out of your song tonight.
I ain't gonna give him a chance to throw me out of a window.
Let's get a bowl of chop suey, and we'll rewrite the show.
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.
Well, you can get most anything out of a bowl of chop suey.
Oh, cutie!
Come on, Queenie.
You two run along.
I've got some things to do, and I'll join you later.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.
Get your hat. You'll feel better when you get out of here.
Oh, sure, honey, come on.
I can't go.
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?
You've got a date with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.
I'll have to show you whether I can or not.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.
Maybe you had better wait for me just a few minutes down on the stage.
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.
- Hurry.
- I will.
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.
He ain't the right kind of a guy for you to go out with.
What difference does it make what kind of a guy he is?
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.
I can take care of myself. And you can both mind your own business.
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.
You keep out of this.
I've got my own life to live, and I'm gonna live it.
I'm not gonna be the third wheel to anybody's bicycle!
Oh, Queenie!
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?
Why, she's never gone against my advice before.
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.
I guess the bright lights got under her skin.
Come on, let's go and get a bowl of chili.
Queenie!
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.
Oh, they're elegant.
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.
Good morning, beautiful lady.
Oh, you frightened me.
Good morning.
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?
You have some place to go, haven't you?
Are you putting me out?
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.
Any girl that can look beautiful so early in the morning...
That sounds like you know a lot about girls.
I do. I'm an expert.
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.
Well, so long.
- Must I go?
- Please do.
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.
I'm arranging a little party tonight for your birthday.
- A party for me?
- Yes.
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.
Then I'm gonna wait right here till she gets back.
Well, it looks as if I'd better take the air.
I'll give you a ring a little later, shall I?
Fine.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And thank you again for the flowers.
Well, I've got my suspicions about any guy that kisses a girl's hand.
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.
What are you burned up about?
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.
Hank'll be here in a minute, and you can start raving to her.
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.
Why do you let a guy like that hang around you?
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick of hearing you crab all the time.
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.
What do you think of that?
I know. But you haven't anything to do in the show.
I can team you up with this blond and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.
Nope. I've gotta stick around and keep an eye on Queenie.
Queenie? What has she been doing?
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.
Night after night, she's out with Jock Warriner.
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.
With Eddie?
Now, now listen, Hank.
Why don't you give Eddie a break and marry him?
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.
That's it.
Now, watch this one.
Boy, if you could do that with my wife.
Say, give us something good, something new.
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?
Hello, everybody.
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."
Take this cake in the other room, and when you hear us yell "surprise"...
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.
Someone's coming. Are you all set?
Quiet, quiet.
Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?
Why, there was another party, and I forgot to tell her about this one.
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.
Jock Warriner, huh.
Say, listen, I've got an idea.
Let's give the party...
Let's give the party...
- For Hank.
- Great!
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.
Hank doesn't feel very well.
Well, all right, we'll go down to your room.
Good night. I hope you feel better.
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
You see what you're missing?
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.
Good night, dear.
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.
But don't make it too long. You know that bottle won't last very long.
Queenie and me have always been on the level.
And now I'm fronting for her.
Won't you please give her all the best of the breaks?
What's the matter, Hank?
I lost something.
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.
That's one break.
Goodbye, baby.
Happy birthday.
Queenie, aren't you having a good time?
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.
Call me Jock, won't you?
All right.
Mr. Warriner.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.
I want you to stand up here where everyone can see you.
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!
A happy birthday to Queenie, the queen of New York's beautiful girls.
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!
I can't say anything but thanks, everybody. A lot.
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?
That cake is just elegant...
...but I can't eat it all.
Well, you eat as much as you can, and we'll save the rest.
Please, Mr. Warriner, ask them to play something else.
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.
"Broadway Melody."
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.
Tell me...
...why don't you like that song?
I don't know.
Well, what do you like?
I like cake.
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?
Maybe.
You mean it?
Maybe.
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?
Maybe.
Please, I wanna dance.
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.
But look, everybody's dancing, and the music is playing and everything.
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?
Why, of course.
Diamonds should only be worn by beautiful girls.
Oh, it's just adorable.
I'd like to do a lot of things for you, Queenie.
How would you like an apartment all your own?
Say, on Park Avenue.
And a car all your own.
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.
Well, I'd have to think about that.
Say, where have you been?
I've been looking all over the place for you.
You would come in at a time like this.
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.
Let's have this dance.
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.
Well, that's swell, because I wanna to tell you...
...about the grandest party that ever happened to me.
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see anything more beautiful in all your life?
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.
And Eddie said he wouldn't even give me a ring.
What would I want with his ring?
There's more diamonds in a bracelet, ain't they? Ain't they?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying this for...
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.
And an apartment on Park Avenue.
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.
Now, honey, listen to me.
I know we ain't had the greatest break in the world since we hit New York.
But that's gonna change.
That's got to.
And you're gonna meet somebody that's right.
Somebody you can be proud of, who'll just be crazy about you.
Somebody who's really worthy of you.
Somebody like Eddie.
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...
...with some song-and-dance guy...
...who expects me to cook his meals over a gas-jet...
...listen to a lot of smart wisecracks and bum songs.
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.
Move over.
No more of these kind of dumps for mine.
I'm gonna have everything in the world I want.
That's me.
And you're gonna have Eddie.
Queenie, I don't want you to answer me like that again.
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.
How are you gonna stop me?
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?
And don't you see what I'm doing is for your...
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.
You're not gonna go out with that guy, hear me?
I'll stop you if I have to tie you up to do it. You hear me?
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.
Well, you hear me. I'm going out with whoever I want...
...and I won't hear orders from anyone about it.
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!
You ain't my boss. So mind your own business and shut up.
Oh, Queenie.
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet, and you don't know things.
What Hank has been saying to you is for your own good.
Yeah, and I suppose what you're saying is for my own good too.
As far as that goes, yes, it is.
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because I...
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.
And whether you like me or hate me, you're gonna pay attention to me...
...because I'm...
Well...
Me and Hank won't let you go out with that guy. He's no good.
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.
You and Hank...
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.
Here's your pants, sir.
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.
Oh, can't I say nothing that will make you see what I mean?
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Warriner. Do you know what they say about that guy?
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?
What are you so interested for?
What business is it of yours where I go and who I go with?
It's my business because...
Well, because it is.
Oh, you ought to know why I'm doing this.
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.
And you gotta hear it.
I love you, Queenie.
I love you, and you know it.
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.
But it's easy to say now.
I love you, dear.
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?
Yes, Eddie.
And that's why we can't...
Oh, don't you see now why...
Why what?
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.
Here's your coat, sir.
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.
Get on there, Kearns.
Queenie, you better be here when I get off.
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got no idea what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun without you trying to stop me?
Oh, I ain't trying to stop you having fun...
...but this thing will turn out bad.
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.
He ain't the type to take a girl out and buy her drinks...
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.
I'm old enough to know what I'm gonna do.
And I don't want no more cracks from you and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
What I'm saying's for your own good.
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.
You will give it to me.
Queenie.
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.
You're not gonna leave except with me and Hank.
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.
I'll make him suffer the way he's making me suffer.
Shut up!
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.
Gonna stay right here. No.
Let go of me.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from either of you. You've said enough.
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Queenie, Queenie!
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?
You gonna let a john like that steal her from you because he's got a little more jack?
Well, if you do, all I can say is you're a rotten quitter.
You love her, don't you?
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.
Say, if I loved a girl like you do Queenie...
...l'd fight for her. What's the matter with you? Where's your nerve?
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.
What do you think I've been meaning all along? I was on the level with this thing?
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.
Say, I wouldn't marry you if you was the last man on earth.
And at that, I ain't so sure you're the right guy for her.
You're a coward.
You're afraid of Jock Warriner, or you'd go out and fight for her.
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!
You're yellow. Do you hear me?
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.
You're white.
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Jed?
It's Hank.
Say, I've decided to take those 30 weeks.
You can team me up with that blond.
I'm breathless.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.
It's not half good enough for you.
I want you to have everything in the world.
Thank you.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?
I want you to meet my girlfriend.
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.
Why, I haven't had you to myself for a moment tonight.
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.
Wait, Queenie.
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.
Wait a minute, Queenie.
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.
You're going to stay right here with me.
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.
You won't keep me here, do you hear me? You won't.
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.
I won't stay with you another minute.
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.
What do you mean coming in here? Get out.
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.
Oh, Eddie.
What's the matter?
Oh, darling, let me see you.
Oh, Eddie. Have they hurt you, sweetheart?
Have they?
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.
You don't realize what you're doing.
You let me go. And you can take your jewelry and your presents...
...and everything. I don't want anything to do with you.
Let me get a sock at that guy.
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.
And stay out.
What do you know about that guy?
Got rid of that guy anyhow.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.
You dirty bums, you.
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.
I am.
I don't know why you feel sorry for anybody like me.
I'm no good.
I can't even scrap a little.
I let a heel like that take a sock at me and get away with it.
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.
I suppose you found that out from his hugs.
Well, if you couldn't stop them from throwing you out...
...how could I stop him from hugging me?
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.
Oh, Eddie, aren't you gonna take me home?
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?
Like you? Why, Queenie, I...
Oh, what is it? They've hurt you, I know they have.
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.
Now understand, it took six of them to throw me out.
Yes, Eddie.
Oh, what is it?
Oh, they'll be here any minute.
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?
Well, what's the matter with this thing?
See who that is.
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!
Oh, gee.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.
Oh, come here.
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be in the electric lights this time?
Queenie Kearns and Company?
No, sirree.
I'm only gonna be connected with the stage by marriage.
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest little home down on Long Island.
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.
And say, when you're finished with this tour, you're coming to live with us.
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine, where I can get service.
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
No home, no nothing.
Hank, you're just a born trouper.
Doggone this weather. It certainly is tough on colds, isn't it?
Well, say, I want Queenie and Eddie to see the act.
Say, where is that blond, anyway?
I don't know. She's always late.
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have a good time on your honeymoon?
Yeah, great.
Oh, Eddie, when you open your new show...
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.
Oh, you're grand.
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.
Okay.
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.
We're gonna break in the act and bring it to New York.
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.
I want two choruses...
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part in your show for that dame, get me?
Of course not, honey.
It's kind of rough yet, but don't you say it's pretty good for an opening?
You know, if you don't hurry, you're gonna miss that train.
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.
Oh, Hank.
That's all right, Queenie.
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.
Here. Here. Here's your valise.
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.
The season will be over before you know it, and she'll be back here with us.
It ain't that, honey.
But it seems like Hank ain't never had a real break.
And I guess I haven't done much to make her any happier.
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.
And now that she knows you're taken care of...
Don't cry, honey.
People can't help falling in love.
It comes to you no matter what you do.
And I love you, dear.
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.
You were just meant for me.
Opening in Peoria.
Four shows a day.
Zanny said he'd make me a star in six months.
Say, listen, it's better to star in...
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.
That's a bunk.
Say, now you listen to me, stupid. I'll handle things.
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway and in the Palace in less than six months.
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
Sure, it's...
It's... It's in the can.
