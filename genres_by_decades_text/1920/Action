THE TREE MUSKETEERS
Life knows no age nor time. Youth will ever set out to seek fortune.
Man will ever fight for the love of a woman. Kings will threaten-Queens weep-Ministers conspire. And so-though our story is of three hundred years ago, It is as young as Yesterday or
To-morrow.
Then follow us to France of old.
To frery days when hearts beat high,
When blood was young, and hate was bold. When sword crossed word to dare and die. For love and honor gloried then. When live was live, and men were men!
In 1625 the Court of
France teemed with plot and counterplot, faction and cabal, enmity and jealousy-its men and women merely pawns in a game.
Louis XIII, the King, jealous, suspicious, easily moulded---
Cardinal Richelieu, the Prime Minister, iron willed, bent on being the sole power to dominate the King...
In another room in the palace...
Anne of Austria, Queen of France, whose influence over the King is the one obstacle in Richelieu’s path to power...
Constance Bonacieux...
Seamstress to the Queen...
Milady de Winter...
Father Joseph, the familiar of the Cardinal, fearsomely know as
His Grey Eminence...
Madam my Queen
I hear again how cruelly the Cardinal persecutes you. I pray you let me come to you that
I may throw around you the protection of the love you have ever scorned
Your mort humble slave
Bnechingham
In England, the Duke of Buckingham, whose mad infatuation for the Queen of France offers Richelieu the means for accomplishing his purpose…
Madame my Queen
I heard again how cruelly the Cardinal perseruter you. I pray you let me come to you that
I may throw around you the protection of the love you have ever scorned
Your mort humble slave
Bnechingham
Monsieur le Cardinal, your medicine.
The Queen has but now received a letter from Buckingham
I thank thee, Joseph.
That is very stimulating.
Your Queen is in danger.
Your queen is in danger- menaced by a knight.
Why do you harp on my Queen?
What do you mean?
I but spoke of your CHESS queen, sire.
Always double meanings.
Speak out, I command you.
What shall I say of the Queen save that she is profoundly devoted?
Devoted! To whom?
Not to me. She is in love with Buckingham!
I cannot but thing you are wrong, sire. If it were true, letters would have passed between them.
Letters! We shall soon see.
Madame, it is imperative that I see all your papers at once!
Your Eminence was right. There was a letter. Nothing about Buckingham.
Plenty about you.
To monsieur my Brother
The King of Spain
The humiliations put upon me by this odious Cardinal are becoming the gossip of every court. I beg you send an emissary to urge his dismissal
Your good sister
Anne R
Your Majesty knows that I have always warmly defended the Queen.
If she distrusts me I must bear it with humility.
In Tarbes, a town in the southern province of Gascony---
An impoverished nobleman sends forth his son to seek his fortune.
D'Artagnan
Remember, my son, that your ancient nobility gives you the right to the best in France.
You have thews of iron and wrists of steel. Fight on all occasions!
Fight the more since duels are forbidden, for that means double courage.
Never forget these things- loyalty to the King- reverence for the Cardinal- devotion to the Queen-
...and my pride in you... my love for you.
In Paris... fresh intrigue...
Milord
Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intrust to a letter
Repenting the impulse that led to the humiliation of the Queen, the
King strives to make amends...
It took ten years to collect and match those twelve stones. They cannot be duplicated.
And the world says kings and queens are not happy!
I have come at a propitious moment to secure your signatures to a decree.
And D'Artagnan little realized, as he leisurely made his way toward
Paris, that he was soon to be enmeshed in a scandal involving the foremost courts of Europe.
What we do now promise is by our concurrence and consent.
Luis
Milord
Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intriest to a letter.
Anne
Meet Milady de Winter at Meung. She is to deliver this letter to
Buckingham and remain in England until I send for her.
D'Artagnan takes every smile for an insult... every look as a provocation...
The Inn at Meung...
The exact shade of a buttercup!
The color is common enough in botany but... until now... very rare among horses.
Who laugh at my horse... laughs at me.
Pardon me, Madame.
I must kill your friend.
To Buckingham without delay... by order of Cardinal.
Coward!
Thus chance left these two men with a score unsettled... but they were to meet again.
Paris...
A horse for a hat.
Bonacieux, uncle to Constance...
Can you tell me where I might and lodgings?
Thus fate plays her part again...
Pardon me, mademoiselle.
Do you live in this house or that house?
Marvelous!
I desire to secure lodgings here.
In England... Buckingham receives the forget letter...
Milord
Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intrust to a letter
Anne R
The letter has been delivered, madam.
In Paris, the next morning,
D'Artagnan calls on his father's old friend, the Captain of the King's Musketeers...
Monsieur de Treville, Captain of the King's Musketeers...
The ambition of his life... to be one of this...
Athos!
Porthos!
Aramis!
You Know that fighting is prohibited yet you fight... fight... fight!
And always with the Cardinal's Guards.
But if you MUST fight... fight as you did yesterday.
The three best swordsmen in Paris.
So you are from Gascony... and the son of my friend.
What hat brought you to Paris?
I came to join the Musketeers.
My boy, these Musketeers are all picket men.
All my life I've dreamed, I've hoped, I've prayed to be in your regiment.
Impossible! Serve your apprenticeship with the cadets for two years... and... we shall see.
My man of Meung!
Excuse me. I am running after someone.
You can find ME without running.
Do you understand?
Where?
Behind the Luxembourg.
When?
One o'clock.
Behind the Luxembourg.
Permit me to observe, monsieur, that in one respect you are absolutely perfect. You are the most perfect idiot I have ever met!
Behind the Luxemburg at one o'clock.
Possessed of Gascon courage,
D'Artagnan wasted not a moment in regret that his first day in
Paris had involved him with the three best blades of the time.
Behind the Luxembourg at one o'clock...
Gentlemen, I desire to explain...
If you kill me, I shall have been honored...
If I kill you, I shall regret it all my life... for I love you every one.
Monsieur Athos, on guard!
The Cardinal's Guards!
Hola! We are in luck!
You are under arrest
Come and take us!
We are four against three!
Pardon, Messieurs.
Four against Foul!
A young Gascon played me foul.
I'll find him and carve him to ribbons.
My young harpooner, perhaps you'll arrange time for me to show you how to use a sword correctly.
That is Bernajoux... the Cardinal best swordsman.
One for all and all for one.
Thus D'Artagnan, in two days, became the talk of Paris and won for himself the loyal comradeship that was to last throughout his life.
Richelieu lodges complaint that the
King's musketeers have assaulted his guards...
Remember! I cannot have the Cardinal annoyed. Those who disobey the edicts must be... punished.
Rest assured, Monsieur le Cardinal, these men shall be dealt with... properly.
I commanded you to fetch me these four devils who have so maltreated seven of the Cardinal’s best men.
Where are they?
But where is that young cadet?
You rascal... you have kept the King waiting!
So you are that wild Gascon who fights a regiment single-handed?
For the future I shall expect you to be discreet.
But TOO discreet.
I have a servant for you... a fellow who reflects before he acts.
I found him on a bridge, spitting in the water to see which way the river was glowing.
Your province?
Picardy.
As Richelieu's plans begin to mature, Constance makes ready to keep a mysterious appointment...
Certain messages have been confided to you. Tell me what they are and to whom they are to be delivered.
I dare not delay. Midnight is striking.
It is the hour I am expected.
Do not question me.
My mission is secret.
Who is he?
Stop, in the name of heaven!
His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham.
Lead on. I'll follow. If anyone looks at you I shall kill him.
The river entrance to the palace...
Milord, you have been told that it was not I who wrote to you... yet you rashly insist on this interview!
What does it matter?
Nothing matters but that
I see you again.
You see me at the risk of my honor... rat the risk of your life.
So sweet a voice can never pronounce the words that separate us.
...the depth of seas,
...the enmity of kingdoms...
...the sanctity of vows!
I beseech you... relent.
Then something for remembrance... something that you have worn... a ring... a chain... a brooch... that I may wear it always.
And now, Madame, your Majesty and I share a secret.
The last of the King's gold...
Richelieu prepares to make use of the Queen's secret...
How many days away is the court ball?
Twelve.
Go to England. Deliver this to
Milady de Winter.
While poverty still stalks the four friends, Aramis has secured for himself an invitation to dine...
Father, I have a friend I know you'll like. He's outside now.
May I Bring him in?
I trust I am not intruding.
Father, I have a friend outside... a fine fellow.
Monsieur de Cardinal,
YOU always win!
When I have bent my energies to a purpose, I have never failed.
D'Artagnan invites his friends to dine...
I wagered D'Artagnan that he could not provide a dinner without money.
Does he think Paris is paved with food?
Patience, my friends. This Gascon has a fashion of winning his wagers.
Certain fortune favored members of the Cardinal’s Guards are gathered for a feast...
Marvelous!
Intruder! How dare you meddle with our dinner!
Pardon, monsieur.
MY dinner.
I would allow you to get your swords, but... really, Messieurs... the dinner is not worth it.
Porthos must pay.
While in the palace, the Queen, who has been to a fancied security, receives a rude awakening.
Madame, I wish to remind you that the court ball is only six days away. I request you to honor me by wearing to it the diamond buckle
I recently gave you.
This is the end! I am lost!
Ten minutes later Constance arrives at home...
Can I trust you?
I love you.
As rivers love the sunlight.
Are you sure?
I would give my life for you.
This may mean your life.
Go to England. Get the jewels from the Duke of Buckingham and return in all haste. The Queen's happiness, her life, her honor are in your hands.
When you come back.
Find Porthos and Aramis and me at De Trevilles.
Bonacieux sells his information...
Search Paris. If D'Artagnan is within the gates, fetch him to me.
On perilous expeditions of this kind you must pay toll.
Four must start if one is to arrive.
All for one and one for all!
Be at the Barriere du
Nord in half an hour.
See that the way to Calais... and beyond... is made unsafe.
His Eminence presents his compliments and desires to see you at your earliest convenience.
At your EARLIEST convenience.
D'Artagnan is below.
When I drop this handkerchief... fire.
You were about to leave Paris,
Monsieur D'Artagnan?
We can make it VERY COMFORTABLE for you in Paris.
It is imperative that I go.
Monsieur D'Artagnan, if you were about to die, what would you do?
Your Eminence, I should write the history of France.
And what would you say?
I should speak of her great men,
Monseigneur.
Whom do you call great?
Monsieur le Cardinal,
Duc de Richelieu.
And what would you write of him?
That he is a great statesman...
...a great poet...
...a great swordsman.
You, yourself, are somewhat of swordsman.
By the way... what trick you employed to best my man, Bernajoux?
Thus four men rode forth in the service of their Queen...
That is D'Artagnan.
Porthos pay toll...
An inn near Calais...
Athos pay toll...
The port of Calais from which
D'Artagnan plans to sail...
NOTICE
THE PORT IS CLOSED
AVIS
LE PORT EST FERME
The port will remain closed until you receive further orders from the
Cardinal.
It shall be as you say,
Count de Rochefort.
My man of Meuhg!
You are on the Queen's business, master.
In England...
Buckingham wears a buckle set with twelve diamonds. Let possession of this and fetch it to me at once.
Richelieu
Good! Say to His Eminence that I am attending the Duke's fete to-morrow night.
Under the cover of midnight...
Watch every boat for my return and have the horses ready.
Set sail for England this instant or I'll blow out your brains!
My heart fails me. Ever foot of this road is sown with danger.
I'll stake my life he is near the shores of England at this moment.
You love him?
The fete at the palace of the
Duke of Buckingham...
To the harbour.
That is Milady de Winter.
Milady de Winter has just left your house... bound for the harbour.
She is a friend of Rochefort, a tool of Richelieu. She has the jewels!
The boat leaves in half an hour.
Perfect!
After you leave Calais, go by way of
Boulogne. This ring will get you fresh horses along that route.
Next morning... just before the ship drops anchor at Calais...
We go by the long route. No food, no sleep, no rest until we reach Paris.
The inn near Calais...
Has Monsieur D'Artagnan passed this way?
Then he has gone by the longer road.
We can reach Paris ahead him.
Drive on.
The evening of the court ball...
You bungler! I place the resources of a Kingdom at your command and you fail. Imbecile!
Guard every entrance to Paris.
Line the streets. D'Artagnan must not pass.
Go to the ball. Join the Queen... never leave her for an instant.
Block every way that leads to the palace.
Arrest that seamstress, Constance.
D'Artagnan... dead or alive!
The grand ball room of palace...
Her Majesty is late. I trust she will not forget that you desired her to wear your gift of jewels.
At the gates of Paris D'Artagnan scents danger...
Our luck runs too high.
I smell the Cardinal.
Madame, why do you appear here without your diamond buckle?
Sire, I feared some accident might befall it.
You do wrong to slight my wishes!
This is Fate!
This is for Meung... and this for Constance!
Your Queen.
My brave D'Artagnan, let this token ever remind you that you have won the eternal gratitude of a Queen.
Constance has disappeared.
Joseph, I never acknowledge defeat,
I make use of it.
If you were about to die, what would you do?
Your Eminence, I should still write the history of France.
Then set down in your book, Monsieur
D'Artagnan, that Richelieu was a generous foe.
Marvellous!
And now, Monsieur D'Artagnan, what say you to a lieutenancy in my Guards?
Your Eminence, my dreams, my hopes, my ambitions are all with the
Musketeers.
I am offering him a commission in my Guards.
A commission in the
King’s Musketeers.
And so, later in the evening,
De Treville presents to the King a new Musketeer...
'D'Artagnan!
So thus they lived in
France of old,
When blood was young and hearts were bold,
And sword crossed sword for honor then,
When life was life and men were men.

WAY DOWN EAST
A Simple Story of Plain People.
Since the beginning of time man has been polygamous
- even the saints of Biblical history - but the son of
Man gave a new thought. and the world is growing nearer the true ideal. He gave of One Man for One
Woman.
Not by laws - our Statures are now overburdened by ignored laws - but within the heart of man, the truth must bloom that his greatest happiness lies in his purity and constancy.
Today Woman brought up grom childhood to expect
ONE CONSTANT MATE possibly suffers more than at any point in the history of mankind, because not yet has the man-animal reached this high standard
- except perhaps in theory.
If there is anything in this story that brings home to men the suffering caused by our selfishness, perhaps it will not be in vain.
Time and place - in the story world of make-believe,
Characters; Incidents - never occurred-yet always happening.
Let us suppose a remote village in New England.
Ana Moore and her mother.
We call her "Anna" - we might have called her
"Woman" - for is not herw the story -
Sore need of money drives the mother to appeal to the
Tremonts, their rich relatives in Boston.
Oh Mother, I hate to ask them for money.
So, through the troubled twilight...
All right Mother, I'll go.
THE DEPARTURE
Tell Cousin Emma I made this hug-me-tight my own hands.
The fashion paper says these gloves are style in the city.
An errand undertaken with the tremulous footsteps that ever mark the trail of the
"poor relation"
Her cousins, the Tremonts, were giving a bridge whist party the afternoon of
Anna's arrival.
Cousin Emma Tremon
Herself.
Diana Tremont, her daughter.
An occasional interloper in
Society - The dashing
Lennox Sanderson, who depends go his living upon a rich father.
He has three specialties:
Women! Women! And
WOMEN.
There is a young person - says she's your Cousin
Anna Moore - from
Greenville.
My dear child! Whatever brought you here?
Well, you see, things haven’t been going very well - and we wanted to ask you - if -
Courage failing, she changes the subject to the hug-me-tight.
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Tremont imparts the embarrassing news of the country cousin's arrival to her daughters.
Well, get rid of her.
But to impress their eccentric, but enormously rich aunt, the sisters pretend to be nice to Anna.
I knew you both from your pictures.
Yes, I expect to stay quite a time - that is, if we suit each other.
CHAPTER II
Near the country estate of then Santerson family is
Bartlett Village.
Also the home of Squire
Bartlett, the richest farmer in the neighborhood.
The clock hand points to blossoms - and awakening.
David Bartlett though of plain stock, haw been tutored by poets and visions as the world.
Squire Bartlett, a stern old puritan, who lives according to his awn con- seption of the Scriptures, particularly the "Thou
Shalt Nots".
Mrs. Barlett, whose gentle soul is as sweet as her beloved Scriptures.
Day dreams of twenty-one.
The great Tremont ball - the climax of the social season.
Anna's dress that she and her mother had made in case she should go out in
Society.
It's quite all right - and from the balcony you can see uis dancing.
Solely to pique the sisters of whom she is not over-fond, the aunt makes different arrangements for Anna.
Oh, Aunty! - This dress
- where’s the top?
Beneath the alcove lights' golden glow.
Anna's delicate beauty a whip to Sanderson's laded appetite.
In your beauty lives again
Elaine, the lily maid, love dreaming at Astolat.
Tell me more.
Cousin Emma hurries Anna off to bed - perhaps in fear of her own daughters being outshone.
The susceptible Sanderson, obsesed by a new desire.
Sanderson, after managing several meetings, finally lures Anna to the apartment to meet a mythical aunt.
Wait - I'll call Aunty.
Strange, she isn't here.
Just five minutes! She'll be back any time.
If she doesn't come in five minutes - I must go.
You don't understand...
I mean... I want you to... to marry me.
Anna's inexperienced heart caught in a tide of infatuation.
Oh, I' m just going to tell everybody.
But Sanderson, dreading to cross the wishes of his rich father, upon whom he is de- pendent, persuades Anna to promise secrecy.
Sanderson belongs to a class which, if it cannot get what is wants in one way, it will go to any length to get it in another.
Evil plans.
Passion's urge knows no conscience and various its ways to betrayal.
Sanderson induces Anna to marry secretly before going home.
Far away it happens that
David Bartlett is dreaming a troubled dream.
Don't worry... everything's all right. Don't you trust me?
So... it is done.
The bridal suite at
Rose Tree Inn.
To her it is the fulfillment of the dreams of girlhood
- to him but another adventure.
Here conscience knocks at the door... perhaps the slightest interruptions might still avert this tragedy, but...
My... my husband!
The afternoon the Bartlett post office was robbed.
The dread minion of the
Law - Rube Whipple,
Constable.
Seth Holcomb waiting for
Martha Perkins, whom he has been following around for twenty years.
Seth takes his liquor under tha name of
"Long Life Bitters".
Martha Perkins, a relic, nobody needs newspaper when she is around.
The Constable on the man hunt.
Napoleon, his fiery steed.
Napoleon refuses to climb the hill.
The temptation of
Napoleon.
These men! I just can't keep tem from following me.
Great news! Post office bin robbed! Dollar eighty-two cents in postage stamps, eighteen postal cards!
Heavy loss to the government.
I'll 'low bno man to laugh at the law, Seth Holcomb.
The both win.
Charter IV.
One day of the honeymoon before Anna starts home with her great secret.
Promise now.
Only two days!
Anna's return home.
Anna relieves her mother's anxiety with happy mysterious hints of wealth to come.
The old way too pleasant to give up.
Less and less frequent their secret meetings until at last...
In answer to her urgent letter...
All right. I'll wait.
You haven't told anyone aboyt our marriage?
She tells him of a tender new reason why the secret cannot be kept any longer.
You mustn’t tell ANYONE.
Well...
Well... if you MUST know
The truth...
Because we aren't married at all!
You’re just joking... tell me, aren't you joking?
WE MUST be married... see... see... our ring...
Marriage would have meant my losing everything...
I intended to make it right... but...
For Heaven's sake, don't make a scene! I'll let you have lots of money and you can go away.
Mother! Mother!
When the mother returns...
Some time afterwards - left alone by her mother's death
- Anna hides away with her shame in the village of Belden.
Maternity:
Woman's Gethsemane.
Shadows across the time dial.
The baby without a name.
My child, your baby is very sick.
Ten drops of this in a little water every hour until
I return.
Where's your husband?
Oh... he's away.
The landlady solemnly reminds Anna that if the baby dies without being baptized, it will never see Got.
Helpless and alone in the dreadful hours of the night, and stricken with a terrible fear for her baby's soul... she herself performs the sacred rite.
In the name of the Father, and of the son... and of the Holy Ghost...
I baptize thee...
TRUST LENNOX.
The vigil.
The little hands grow cold upon her breast.
My child, your baby is dead.
Sanderson on his country estate at Bartlett.
Everybody is talking about you having no husband.
I guess you'll have to leave.
Upon her back the age-old Cross.
The Pilgrimage.
Hi Holler, the Barlett's chore boy, sprucing op in the barn to meet Kate, the Squire's niece.
A reckless spectator.
Oh! Hi! Hi Holler! Hurry up! It's time to fetch Kate!
Anna, in search of work, reaches Barlett Village.
Kate, the Squire's niece, returns from a short trip to Boston.
The Professor, summer boarder at Squire Barlett's. pursues his studies.
Is this the young niece you were expecting from
Boston?
I am looking for work.
Work? You don't 'pear to have no strength to work.
Where ye from?
Whose your folks?
I haven't any folks.
For all we know she might be some loose woman wanderin' 'round. I won't take her inter my hum!
Sorry, young lady, but I ain't got nothing for yet.
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these... ye have done it unto me!
That's Scripture, Father.
All right, Mother, we'll try her. Nobody can't ever say
I went aging the Scriptures!
Whatever your troubles, child, remember, the Lord is your Shepherd, you shall not want.
Kate's Homecoming.
It has been settled by the
Squire and David’s childhood that they are to marry,
Open admiration.
The Professor, meeting
Kate, is converted to the scientific theory of Love at first sight.
Oh, Professor, my shoe is untied.
Well, well, neighbor
Sanderson, haven’t seen you since Kate went away.
Kate - Sanderson's newest infatuation.
David, you'll have time before supper to show
Neighbor Sanderson that heifer he wants to buy.
What are you doing here?
I am working.
You can't stay here.
I live right across the way.
Come right in, Mr. Sanderson!
Supper's ready.
You father was right.
I'm afraid I'm not strong enough for this work.
Release don't do away,
Miss Moore! I... we all... like you very much.
You'll get stronger after awhile, and...
Anna! David!
Come right in.
END OF PART I
WAY DOWN EAST
Part II
Meanwhile, Anna, her past still a closed book, has become a beloved member of the household.
Knowing only Anna's blameless life among them,
David thrilled with the thought that she is the virginal white flower of his dreams.
By the river and the distant music of the falls - Around them the sweet scent of summer fields.
The David points out the two forks of the river, that go into one...
And all a thrill with a great sincere love,
Visions to her how they two might go,
On through life together...
One heart for one heart,
One soul for one soul,
One love for one love,
Even through Eternity.
At last the freat over- whelming love - only to be halted by the stark ghosts of her past.
I am only trying to say I love you, Anna - it seems
I've always loved you!
So she tells him he must never speak like this again.
The summer goes, the winter comes,
We cannot rile the year,
Nor can we rule the barque of Fate,
Nor all its strange ways steer.
The Professor's love... burdened heart brings him down to the country to see
Kate.
I'm going ter read yer some funny jokes.
Why does a chicken cross the road?
None of the rooster’s
Business.
Ain't that funny?
Three eggs, two bad.
Miss Kate, I want to ask... if you will... be... my...
The ice is going out soon.
When the river starts you'd better look out down below there!
Anna goes ton the store after forgotten goodies for the big party planned for the evening.
The villain still pursues her.
The sewing circle next to the grocery store.
Maria Poole, the landlady from Belden, visits Barlett.
That's Anna Moor lives down to Squire
Barlett's.
Moore? Her name ain't
Moore...
She lived at my house.
Mrs. Lennox, she called herself... but she never had no husband at all!
And then... there was a baby!
The Squire thinks it time that David and Kate come to an understanding.
It's my bounden duty to go and expose this woman to the Squire.
Father's set on getting married but I don't think we can without proper love... do you?
Suppose, Squire, I had been like you suspected when you first saw me?
Would there be any hope of forgiveness?
When the law's broke. it's broke, ain't it? A wrong’s a wrong and nothing can make it right.
Of course...
I was just supposing.
On their way to the big barn dance.
Maria Poole, from Belden, was at the sewing circle and she says...
No. I shouldn't tell you!
It's that...
Oh, it's awful...
But before Martha tells her thrilling news...
On their way to the big party, they stop to warm up at the Squire's with an old- fashioned dance.
No, I am not invited to the party,
The Professor, dazed but happy.
All bound 'round a woolen string!
A great big hat with a great big brim.
All bound 'round, all bound 'round.
All bound 'round with a woolen string!
David, for some reason, suddenly discovers he is not interested in the party.
The neighbors' barn dance.
Moro and worried by Anna's presence... also afraid she will interfere in his pursuit of
Kate - Saderson -
I can't have you around here where I live!
Suppose they find out about your past life?
You'd have to fet out them!
Suppose they find out about YOUR past life!
Oh, it's different with a
MAN! He's supposed to sow his wild oats.
At last Martha gets her opportunity with the
Squire.
Does Lennox Sanderson mean anything to you?
Why do you ask such question?
Because I can't keep silent any longer.
I love you! I want you to be my wife.
It's about Anna Moore.
She lived in Belden under the name of Lennox.
Mrs. Lennox.
A baby was born, but there ware not no wedding ring to the finger.
No, father... you must have proof.
I'll go to Belden in the morning... and if it is true...
Please! Please don't!
I can never be ANY
MAN'S WIFE!
The next morning. The
Squire on his way to
Belden to investigate
Martha's story.
The Squire's on important business, isn't he?
So happens that
Sanderson...
At noon Squire arrives in Belden.
It's all true. Why, her baby was born in this very room.
Late afternoon.
Roses in wintertime!
Lan' sakes!
Don't want no supper of your getting!
The time's come for you to get your things and get out of this house!
Don't want no words!
Just get out!
It means she is going to get out of my house!
I found out all about her... she ain't fit to be here!
She's the mother of a baby, but she ain't got
NO HUSBAND!
Tell them it's a lie,
Anna!
I... I can't!
You found out so much!
Why didn't you find out the whole truth?
That I was an ignorant girl betrayed through a mock marriage.
This man... an honored guest at your table... why don't find out what
HIS life haw been?
For HE is the man who betrayed me!
And then the storm.
The sugar camp.
Anna's lost in the storm... get out men... quick!
Frenzied... tortured...
The calling river.
The storm lulls.
The great ice-break.
The ice jam gives way... rushing to the falls.
Quick! Quick!
The Doctor!
Toward morning.
The Squire asks forgiveness.
Come, Anna, I know I didn't the right thing. I'm willing to marry you now if you want me.
I... I will.
I will.
Interested witnesses.
Seth, wilt thou have this woman to be the wedded wife...?
I... I will.
The one man for the one woman,
Between them the
Sacramental bond...
Life's cleanest and sweetest.

Our story deals with one of those queer tricks that Fate sometimes plays.
Nobody would believe, for instance, that the entire lives of a peaceful American boy and girl -
- could be changed by a funny little war between two small countries far across the sea.
And yet it came to pass. The spies of the two little nations were at a Pacific seaport, -
- each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies.
"Gentlemen, the enemy have just purchased the steamship Navigator."
"There she lies now, and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship."
"We will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard. -
- The wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest."
The wealthy ship owner who has just sold the Navigator.
And his daughter.
Rollo Treadway - Heir to the
Treadway fortune - a living proof that -
- every family tree must have its sap.
"I think I'll get married."
"Today."
"We'll sail for Honolulu tomorrow on our honey-moon - get two tickets."
"He had completed all arrangements
- - except to notify the girl."
"Will you marry me?"
"Certainly not!"
"I think a long walk would do me good."
"Your tickets, sir - - and congratulations."
"The boat sails at ten in the morning, sir."
"I don't get up that early - so I'll go aboard tonight."
Going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of -
- "Kiss Me Again" to the music of "Alice, Where Art Thou."
"What pier, sir?"
"Pier two."
"I must get some papers off the
Navigator, so stop at Pier 12."
Pier 12 >>> Pier 2
"Is there any one on board?"
"Nobody."
Under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans.
"Help!"
The next morning found the Navigator drifting helplessly at sea.
"Will you marry me?"
"This is a fine time to ask me that.
I'm cold and hungry and - -"
"Put up that bright one."
"She's quarantined."
"Try and catch them!"
"Hey! Wait a minute!"
By the time they were ready to say "good-night" -
- they had found a couple of sea-going tuxedos.
Giant Fire Crackers
Candles...
Roman Candles
Asleep in the Deep - Wilfred Glenn
Danger is near thee -
Many brave hearts are asleep in the Deep -
BEWARE
Weeks later - still drifting.
We now find the crew -
- with a safe and quiet place to sleep.
"Land!"
"Cannibals!"
"We're safer on the boat."
"We're drifting toward them."
"We're safe! I've anchored the ship."
"We are sinking! It's just a matter of time until we're captured."
"Can't you fix it?"
"That would have to be fixed from the outside."

The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marrietta, Ga., in the Spring 1861.
There were two loves in his live.
His engine,
And--
"Fort Sumter has been fired upon."
"Then the war is here."
"Yes, dad, and I'm going to be one of the first to enlist."
"Aren't you going to enlist?"
"Your name?"
"Johnnie Gray."
"Occupation?"
"Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad."
"Don't enlist him. He is more valuable to the South as an engineer."
"We can't use you."
"William Brown."
"Occupation?"
"Bartender."
"If you lose this war don't blame me."
"Did Johnnie enlist?"
"He didn't even get in line."
"He's a disgrace to the South.
"Why didn't you enlist?"
"They wouldn't take me."
"Please don't lie. I don't want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform.
A year later. In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
"I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga, and with ten picked men I cannot fail."
"We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause."
"At Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner, and proceeding North we will burn every bridge, cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you."
"Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you."
"As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded."
"Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for dinner."
"Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters."
"Why not stop and fight them?"
"I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered."
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat."
General Parker's victorious
Northern army advancing.
"There is only one man on that engine."
In the enemy's country, hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
"At Nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge."
"Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank."
"Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on the earth can stop us."
"This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her."
"We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are."
"It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me."
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
"We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack."
"I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines. You follow with the supply trains as planned."
"We must pick up more firewood."
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."
Heroes of the day.
"Is that your uniform?"
"I had to wear it to get through the lines."
"Take it off!"
"Enlist the lieutenant."
"Occupation?"
"Soldier."
So fleet the works of men
Back to their earth again
Ancient and holy things
Fade like a dream -
Stately castles whose turrets pierced the sky have left imperishable record -
Though the storms of centuries have laid waste the works of their spirit soars on and poets make live again the days of chivalry.
Mediaeval England - England in the Age of Faith.
Her chronicles tell of warriors and statesmen, of royal Crusaders, of jousting knights. Her ballads sing of jolly friars, of troubadours, of gallant outlaws who roamed her mighty forests.
History - in its ideal state - is a compound of legend and chronicle and from out both we ogger you an impression of the Middle Ages -
Excitement rises high for the final event in a tournament.
From far and near have come all England's knighthood for, on the morrow, they depart on the Holy Crusade.
And so the lofty battlements of the castle look down upon the chivalry of
England in all its glory -
Richard of the lion Heart,
England's immortal King impulsive, generous and brave -
Prince John, the Kings brother- sinister, dour, his heart inflamed with an unholy desire to succeed to Richard's throne -
High above the clash of lance and shield in joust and tourney, the fairest maiden was chosen to reign for a day as the
Queen of Love and Beauty -
Lady Marian Fitzwalter, from whose slim white hands would fall... the chaplet of valor on the
Victorious knight -
Sir Guy of Gusbourne, intimate of Prince John and one of the two contenders for the championship -
Your veil for a favor, fair lady, that you may see it worn in victory.
The other contender for the championship-favorite of King Richard -
The Earl of Huntingdon's trusted squire...
To gain unfair advantage
Gusbourne straps himself to his saddle...
Brother, Ill gage you this against your prize falcon that Huntingdon wins the day.
On the knight with the white plume!
The marshals inspect the equipment of the contestants...
They splinter their lances - ever a good omen for Huntingdon!
I double mine on
Huntingdon!
Huntingdon hath proved his knightly mettle.
We hereby decree that on this Holy Crusade he shall be our second in command.
Go to the fair maid,
Marian, and receive the victor's crown.
Exempt me, sire.
I am a feared of women.
Another woman!
In the great hall of the castle the feasting that followed close upon the tournament has lasted far into the dawn...
Brave hearts that smile through parting tears...
Knightly lovers tell again their love to maidens fair...
Ladies' eyes speak courage to their knights...
Apart from the others, Prince
John and Guy of Gisbourne, dizzy with wine and drunk with thoughts of power...
The King's goblet...
Dog of a servant! This on the morrow shall be mine - and everything that is the King's shall them be mine.
A servant hath a friend and his friend hath a friend.
Be discreet my Prince.
Where is Huntingdon?
With dagger at head he doth try his strength for the goblet.
At such a time as this it were more befitting that he try his love for a maid.
Why hast thou not a maid?
When I return, good my liege.
Nay, before you go, good my knight.
A castle and lands to the maid who wins him.
You too shall have your pick of maidens, my Gisbourne.
So? Sits the wind in that direction? The Lady Marian, eh? A goodly choice.
You forget, Sir Knight.
I am a Prince.
It is only the Prince who has forgotten.
I regret, Lady Marian, that a brother of our noble King should so degrade his knighthood.
I fear you have incurred his enmity... in my behalf.
I was but my knightly privilege...
Interference is a dangerous pastime, my squire.
I... I never knew... a maid... could be... like you...
Now... all too swiftly... comes the hour of parting...
...and o'er the kneeling hosts the Bishop lifts his hand in benediction...
...and for the cross that gleams upon his shoulder each knight breathes a silent vow...
While on the battlements...
HUNTINGDON!
My lord King, I go to the
Holy Land with half a heayt.
The other half I leave in the keeping of a maid.
Good! Now your blade will be keener.
I leave in your keeping my dearest treasure.
Guard her with your life.
See that Richard never returns from the Holy Land.
Nor Huntingdon.
Even Kings must wait on love...
Huntingdon's head for Lady Marian's hand.
Do not forget.
And so the very flower England's knighthood marched on to its high purpose.
Scarce had the dust of the Crusaders settled to the Crusaders settled to the ground when the dire mischief of Prince John was set afoot...
When the throne is mine, I will reward those who serve me. To your task and spare no one.
All of England fell under the pall of
Prince John's perfidy.
By Prince John's order the good officials of the town of Nottingham are ousted...
I am the High
Sheriff of Nottingham.
The poor who cannot pay the tax levy are forced to give up their belongings...
For slaying a wild boar in
Prince John's forest...
For spurning Prince
John's addresses...
In Richard's castle
Prince John's henchmen apprise him of their evil successes...
Your bidding has been done. Huntingdon's castle is razed and burnt.
One woman braver than the rest...
Have mercy on the people of England.
Fred not your pretty head for such as they.
Prince, your oppressions will not please our King.
A Prince at home outranks a King abroad.
Think you not so, beautiful lady?
If Richard knew these things, there would be no Prince at home.
That maid bears watching.
In silence and at night...
Take this message and sleep nor night nor day until you reach your master.
Day after day... across the fields of
France... the Crusaders had plodded on...
Mark how Huntingdon spurs them on. He is the very backbone of the adventure.
A good way to crack a head, my master. Would were thy brother's.
To your tent. These fevers are but passing ills. Ere the night falls thou wilt be able to march again.
He plays his tricks of discipline to cozen favor of the King... the sycophant!
But for discipline
I'd twist you round a tent-pole and crack your spine!
Why come you here?
The people suffer and perish. The women of the castle hang their heads in shame.
Intrigue and death lurk in every corner. Desperately my heart cries out to you.
If the King should know of this, himself would return and this
Holy Crusade would fail.
If Richard had but one friend in England...
Fetch falcon.
My Beloved.
By some pretext I shall persuade the King to allow me to return.
On the heels of this missive
I shall be in England.
Huntingdon
Speed this letter and prepare our departure.
I pray you, my Lord and King, to speak again your trust in me which you have so oft prosed.
As I trust my right hand do I trust you.
You are my friend.
Then, my liege, your leave and favor to return  to
England without unfoldment of my purpose.
I humbly beseech you, not as my King but as my friend, to place unquestioned this trust in me.
Tis not the maid?
You! Turned chickenhearted for a wench!
You do but jest. go join the lances of your King.
Sire, what needs doing... must be done. But my heart aches that your friendship fails me.
My Beloved.
By some pretext I shall persuade the King to allow me to return.
On the heels of this missive
I shall be in England.
Huntingdon
Sire, you must trust me!
We wait not on permission.
We go to England though hell itself should gape and bid us stay.
A deserter.
Is this true?
The truth is... that back in England...
My Beloved.
By some pretext I shall persuade the King to allow me to return.
On the heels of this missive
I shall be in England.
Huntingdon
Sire, the penalty is death.
Have his wound attended.
Place him in that tower.
He will remain a prisoner, until our return. See to it that he is well cared for.
But, my liege, the penalty is death!
My command! Obey!
Give them food and drink until our last column is well on its way. Then let them rot.
In England Lady
Marian's serving woman comes under the dread inquisition of John...
Tell me what has become of
Huntingdon's squire.
I'll tell... I'll tell. Tis true.
He did carry information from mistress the King.
Lady Marian shall pay for this with her life.
So much for melding!
Quick! Fly for your life.
He means to kill.
I seek Lady Marian
Filzwalter.
After her, Bring her back. I'll put an end to tattling!
Scarce was the last column of England's knighthood well on its way when...
Unlock the door.
To England... with all haste.
There is work to do.
While in England, sturdy men, rebellions to Prince John's tyranny, sought refuge in
Sherwood Forest...
Prince John's deed!
These lusty rebels only waited a leader to weld them into a band... an outlaw band destined to live immortal in legend and story.
A friend of Richard returns to his native soil...
Good my lord... poor Lady Marian... it was on this very spot... here... a riderless horse... an overturned saddle...
To God... to Richard... and to her.
Thus it was that Huntingdon buried his Yesterday. Here began a new life... a life to be dedicated to revenge... bitter... but joyous.
In far-off Palestine
Richard meets with victory and concludes a truce with the infidel...
A year passed and then... from the mysterious depths of Sherwood Forest... came whispers of the rise of a robbers chief...
Robin Hood!
The High Sheriff of Nottingham...
Tis the naked arrow of Robin Hood and sings death to the emeries of King Richard.
A butcher's stall in Locksley Town...
The three lions of
Richard. It is Robin
Hoods manner of saying:
If ye be brave, come to
Sherwood Forest.
Richard is your King.
The rich man of Wakefield...
He seems to be everywhere. I confess
I am helpless.
Our very soldiers desert to join this outlaw's band.
Fetch me a bag of gold.
There are lots of visions and the way to a good result, to captures this Robin Hood:
John
This will put a stop to it.
Robin Hood!
Will Scarlett...
Friar Tuck...
Little John...
Robin Hood's lair...
Mark you his hat.
Allan - a - Dale...
Three blasts!
We rob the rich, relieve distressed
On damned John to score.
We'll take a life if sorely presses
Jill Richard reign once more.
While Prince John's dark schemes are sped in distant lands...
Richard's sleeping tent...
Now for England... and my reward!
Alas, poor fool.
Thou hast played king once too often.
Gisbourne!
On the morrow a messenger from England relates full measure of
Prince John's treachery...
Let John get his bellyful!
In Sherwood Forest a gallant outlaw... a some... time Knight now know as Robin Hood... hath a band of followers and doth thwart the Prince at every turn.
A robber knight, eh?
Methinks I know who tis.
Quick... to horse!
We go to England... mayhap to join this outlaw's band.
Prince John's hired soldiers levy tribute on the Priory of St. Catherine's...
Has this Prince no regard for Holy Chutch?
While... nearby... Robin Hood and his Merry Men distribute dole to needy villagers...
Three blasts...
They are of the Priory of St. Catherine's.
The Priory garden...
It is Robin Hood and his men!
Is not that the Earl of Huntingdon?
Tis Robin Hood.
Robin Hood to the poor, mayhap, but he was born
Robert, Earl of Huntingdon.
Prepare thyself. Within these holy walls there is some dear to you.
Lady Marian...
Scarce a day's journey away... a menace to their new-found happiness...
Sir Guy of Gisbourne...
Tis the Earl of Huntingdon with Lady Marian.
Each day do loyal men rally to our cause.
Twill not be long ere we storm the very castle itself.
An hundred troopers approach!
To horse! I'll follow.
When the lark sings in the morn,
I'll send you a message to re-speak my love.
...Robin Hood is the
Earl of Huntingdon!
Lady Marian Fitzwalter lives...
Surround this band of outlaws with all your men.
By hook or crook take
Huntingdon alive.
Seize that wench, Drag her here. She shall die the death promised.
When the lark sings in the morn...
To Lady Marian.
Tell her that when the sun drops... o'er Nottingham hill,
I'll come to her.
His lady and his King...
All the troops from
Nottingham Town surround the forest.
Tis a good time to take the town.
To the trees with all our men. Entrap these troops.
I go to Nottingham with Scarlett and Allan-a-Dale. We three shall take the town.
While in the forest Robin
Hood's men entrap the troops...
Near the gates of
Nottingham Town...
Rouse the townspeople!
Man the walls! Every mother's son of you!
To the postern door!
To the postern door!
The Prince's soldiers...
Lady Marian... brutally abducted... the saints protect her... fly to your master.
Richard is dead!
Long live King John!
Heralds to the north!
To the south! England is mine!
A mysterious stranger invades Sherwood Forest...
He seeks Robin Hood.
Why seek you
Robin Hood?
He says' Mayhap to join him... mayhap to slay him.
So ho, my pretty knight!
To do either you needs must prove your mettle first!
I will beat them.
With such strength... thou almost makst me think thou art Richard himself.
Each member of this band hath an arrow in yon tree. Speed yours!
Exulting in their freedom, then people of Nottingham
Town hang Prince John in effigy...
Well take life if sorely pressed
Jill Richard reign once more.
Soldiers have carried her away to the castle.
Damn their black hides! I'll lash them till they bleat!
Keep the town!
I go to the castle. You to the Forest. Fetch every man.
We'll make John sing a pretty song to-night!
Close the drawbridge!
Gisbourne...
My men are on their way.
Watch for them.
If they fail...
Three blasts...
I surrender.
Robin Hood is taken.
Forty archers make ready.
We shall teach you which way to face!
Bind him to yon post.
When I dip my dagger, he dies.
We have captured the outlaws.
Lower the bridge.
The High sheriff of Nottingham...
Prince John's chief henchmen...
And Richard reigns ance more.
Huntingdon!
Huntingdon!
HUNTINGDON!
Hear ye all!
Until now Richard has never bowed his head to man.
But I did mistrust my friend and with all humility do ask forgiveness.
To-night!
That night...
In the courtyard...
The bride and the groom escape the wedding revels...
Huntingdon!

Let's go to work, huh?
Hyah!
Halt!
Put up your hands!
Keep 'em up.
For the love of St. Patrick, what's this?
Everybody come out of the coach.
Oh, there you are.
If this is a holdup, we're lucky if we get away with our lives.
Oh, I shouldn't have come on this trip. I told-
Keep the mouths closed.
[ Chattering ]
Throw down the guns.
Now, throw down the gold box.
Phil, get your feet out of the way here before we get shot.
All right, here it is and here it comes.
Gracias.
- Keep 'em up. Keep the hands up.

[ Bells Jingling ]
[Jingling Continues ]
Whoa!
Well, Bill, I guess we're out of shootin' distance from that fella now.
Say, did that there bandit rob any of you folks?
No, he didn't rob any of us.
Well, if I hadn't been so busy with that there gold a-gettin' it out for him...
I'd have killed that fella and I'm not a-lyin'.
I'm mighty glad to see you throw down that gold box.
You know, there's nothing like being liberal with other people's money.
Come on!
Let's get a-goin'!
Get up!
By golly, my friend.
[ Chuckles ]
You and me are going to have lots of fun.
I buy for you new blanket... new shoes and a good dinner.
Then we go to see my girl.
Yes, sir, we are going to have one fine time.
I'll send my gal to the city
And I send my gal to the town
Daisy, Daisy

I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
We can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built

It says in hereJohn L. Sullivan is going to quit drinkin'. Did you read that, Henny?
I don't believe in them newspaper stories.
Probably ain't true anyhow.
Look! Here comes that old stagecoach, sure enough.
My golly!
Hey, those boys are hoofin' up fast.
That's for sure.
- Whoa!
- Hello, there, old boy!
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello.
Boys, I was held up down there at the Devil's Pincushion by that Cisco Kid.
And I sure would have killed that fella, too...
- if my gun hadn't have hung, wouldn't I, Bill?
- You sure would have.
- Where's the colonel at?
- He's inside. Go and see him, Charlie.
Hmm.
[ Muttering ]
Say, there's got to be something done here about this Cisco Kid.
He held up my stagecoach down here and took my Wells Fargo box.
He didn't harm nor rob any of my passengers... but he like to scared all of them to death.
Hmm.
Where'd you see him?
I met him down here on the desert, what they call the Devil's Pincushion.
- [ Typing ]
- Oh, orderly.
- Yes, sir?
- Tell Sergeant Dunn to report to me at once.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll tell you the facts, what I'd have done.
If my gun hadn't have hung on me,
I'd, uh, I'd have shot him myself.
Yes, I know, Charlie. I know just how you feel about things like that.
- Am I faded?
- Sure.
Come on, sweetheart.
One pass for papa.
One, that's all.
I'll shoot the works.
Read 'em and grieve. Ha!
That's my baby.
Rich and ricey, nice and spicy. All right, come on, pay me some of that coin, you guys.
Oh, I see where
President McKinley... is gonna send a bunch of you boys down to Cuba.
Yeah, so I understand.
Come on, sweetheart.
My Brooklyn baby needs new shoes. Ha!
- [ Groans ]
- Dynamite. Another natural for Big Casino.
Hey, what's the idea? Did you walk through a pasture or somethin'?
Come on, long-haired Liz.
- That's the one-
- Sergeant!
Oh, get out of my life, hard luck.
Come on. Ada from Decatur crossed the equator. Ha!
- [ All Laughing ]
- It's a four.
Hey, listen, bad news, if I never see you again, it'll be soon enough for me.
- But the colonel wants you.
- Well, why didn't you say so? That's different.
- Come to papa, sweet mazuma Come to papa, come to papa - Hey, what's the- Hey!
So long, boys.
I hear my master's voice.
Yeah, but your point is four.
Well, what do you want me to do, cry? Geez.
Hey, can you imagine? Just because he's got stripes, he thinks he's a zebra.
- I never saw a guy like that-
- [ All Chattering ]
Sarge.
- Sarge?
- What?
I've got a great idea.
You do the playing,
I'll do the interrupting and we'll split.
Are you trying to make a dishonest soldier out of me?
Dishonest?
- Well, holy-
- [ Chattering ]
[ Both Laughing ]
Sergeant Dunn reporting for duty, sir.
Sergeant, the Cisco Kid is back in our territory.
He just held up the stage coming in from the south.
And it's up to our outfit to get him.
I want you to take a squad of men and go into wolf country.
Camp at the Frio and work west.
Yes, sir.
And don't get the idea this is any picnic.
This is not the usual type of cattle rustler.
He's smart and he's brave and he's a killer.
And you don't need to worry about any court-martial... if you shoot first and argue afterwards.
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Then get going.
Yes, sir.
Charlie, thanks very much for the information.
He'll bring him back dead or alive.
Well, I'm darn glad of that. And I'll bring over a pistol the next time I come too.
[ Bugle Blowing ]
[ Clanking ]
- [ Man ] Hello, Edward.!
- Howdy!
- Morning, Mrs. Doolittle. How's Henry?
- Fine, thanks.
That's good.
Well, good morning.
Well, boys, he's done it again.
This time it was the stagecoach.
- Who did what?
- It's your lone bandit.
Why, he come tearin' down the gulch and held up the stage all by himself.
What'd he get away with this time?
He took the Wells Fargo box and all the gold that was in it.
[ Italian Accent ] What? I just a-send my wife $87 to Sicily by the Wells Fargo.
Well, you can kiss that good-bye.
When this here Cisco Kid does a job, he does it right.
I wish I had my hands on him.
I do good job-a myself.
We've got to form a vigilante committee and hang him to the highest tree... and I'm going to start it.
They say he'll shoot you quick as he'll look at you.
But if I ever meet him face-to-face,
I'll kill him like I would a dog.
What?
You would kill somebody?
- You heard me.
- I kill him too.
First I try to get my $87 back.
- Huh?
- You lose $87, my friend?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
That is too bad.
I hate to see working man lose so much money.
Uh, this Cisco Kid, he's very bad egg, I guess, huh?
- He's bad, all right.
- And plenty dangerous too.
They say the gals are all crazy about him. Ha! That's funny.
Funny? Ha, ha. I don't know.
He may be very handsome.
Probably just a dirty greaser.
Oh. You have never seen him, no?
No, but we're going to. Come on,Joe.
Let's get this vigilante committee started.
We'll make this town safe anyway.
Yes. We'll get Cameron, Randolph and Turner and the rest of the gang.
We'll round him up before the night is over.
It took me six a-months to save that $87... and now it's all gone.
My friend, up in the hills,
I have find much gold.
Ha! I tell you what I do.
You fix for me a nice bath... with nice, sweet soap... nice, new towel... and then when I go away, I make up to you all the money you lose.
[ Chuckles ]
Grazie, Signore.
You are very kind.
Uh, thank you.
That's enough.
No more customers today.
Only you.
Now I fix a fine-a tub.
[ Chuckles ]
That's right, my friend.
I'll send my girl to the city
And I send my girl to the town
- [ Knocking ]
- And my gal still young and- just a minute.
[ Mouthing Words ]
Come in, my friend.
Are you the barber?
[ Chuckling ]
No. No.
- I'm the victim.
- Oh.
Well, what's the idea of locking the door?
Shh.
This barber fella, I don't know, but he's much scared. Bandits.
Oh, yeah?
[ Chuckling ]
Well, you tell him he don't have to worry from now on.
- Oh, that is good news.
- Yeah.
From now on, everybody should not be afraid.
- I'm glad you come.
- Yeah.
You got nice big gun too, huh?
Yeah, well, that ain't no cap pistol you're carrying.
No, here- Oh, no.
This is- Hey, Giuseppe.
[ Giuseppe ]
No, no. No more "costumer. "
"Costumer"?
What do I look like, a dressmaker?
Yeah- Oh, dress-
[ Laughs ] That's funny.
Hey, Giuseppe, business is business.
Now, you take care of this gentleman.

- [ Giuseppe ] Almost ready.
- Hey, you got any more perfume?
- [ Giuseppe ] No, no more.
- Ta-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay
- Oh, excuse me. Maybe you use perfume, huh?
For my women, nothing butJockey Club.
For me, nix.
[ Chuckling ]
Well, for me, you see...
I go around so many different kinds of people, I-
- I got to protect myself.
- [ Both Chuckling ]
And now for nice, good, hot bath.
Yeah, well, don't burn yourself, Fauntleroy.
- [ Pump Squeaking ]
- Ah, Giuseppe, you got my bath all ready.
Everything, sir, very nice.
- Soap, towel, brush, everything nice.
- Uh, that's fine.
I stay, a-scrub your back?
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, no. I'm too ticklish.
- Thank you very much.
- [ Dunn ] Hey, Garibaldi, hurry up.
Go. Take care of my soldier friend.
Give him anything he wants.
Sí, Signore.
Anything you like. Anything.
Ahh. By golly. This is luxury.
Ra-ra-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay
Ra-ra-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay
Ra-ra-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay

You?
Me and the belle of Greenpoint.
Say, she's got more in a minute... than Lillian Russell has in an hour.
But she's-a too skin.
Too skin?
Listen, she has more curves than a scenic railway. Geez.
I like 'em a-fat.
Oh, fat dames are old-fashioned.
Old-fashioned. just the same.
I like 'em a-fat.
All right, all right, Garibaldi, you can have 'em fat. [ Laughing ]
Who is that gent in there?
He's a-nice fellow.
He's a-big gold and silver man from the hills.
Oh.
Say, listen. Do you happen to know anything about a fellow they call the Cisco Kid?
[ Dunn ] I understand he drops into this town occasionally.
I'm very anxious to see him.
Do you know him?
[ Cisco Kid ]
I'll send my gal
- Do I know about him?
- [ Continues ]
Say, I'd like to meet him just a-once and that would be enough.
- Just a-once.
- [ Continues ]
Well, meet him with that, not me. Geez.
[ Cisco Singing, Indistinct ]
Say, he's a-got a nice voice, that fellow.
And she's ready
To settle down
Nice? He must have promised you a big tip. Geez.
So I send my gal
- Want a shampoo?
- No.
- What a singe?
- Singe?
Say, what do you think grows on my dome, pinfeathers?
- Want a tonic-a?
- No tonic-a. Shave-a.
And my gal
She's young
And she's pretty
And she's ready to settle down
Hey, Pop, where's the sergeant?
He just went on up to the barbershop.
The barbershop?
What for?
Wait till he sees the gals in this town.
Why, the old connoisseur is liable to burst right out crying.
Talcum powder and witch hazel.
Well, he has to smell sweet, doesn't he?
What's the matter with the gals in this town?
- Talcum?
- No. No sissy stuff.
[ Chuckles ]
Gettin' dolled up, eh?
[ Toots ]
Well, we've been all over town, Sergeant.
- You won't like it here.
- No? Why not?
Well, all the dames we've seen is fat.
Yeah, there ain't a skinny ankle in town. just a lot of old, broken-down warhorses.
The sun's bleached 'em.
Yeah, the sun and peroxide.
Say, don't they make any pretty girls anymore?
Say, listen, you roughnecks, get down to business and cut out the dames, see?
Oh, there ain't no better business than dames.
Get back to camp now, pronto, understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Say, what did I say?
I don't see why-
- You're the big a-boss, huh?
- That's right, kiddo.
This little frontier town of ours... will soon be a thriving, prosperous city of the great Southwest.
The railroad is coming in down here... and it's up to us to suppress the bandit... the outlaw and the desperado.
[ All Chattering ]
If the sheriff can't do it and the army won't do it... then it's up to us to drive him out of here.
[ Speaking Chinese ]
There, boys.
There's the proper spirit right there.
[ Speaking Chinese ]
Ah. Well, now
I feel very good.
- How you feel, Sergeant?
- All right.
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Conrado Sebastián
Rodrigo Don Juan Chicuello.
[ Chuckles ] Ah, but the girls, they call me Conejito.
That mean little rabbit.
Oh. Little Rabbit, huh?
Are you that fast?
- [ Chuckles ]
- No, no.
Well, my name is Mickey Dunn... and the girls call me Big Casino.
- Mitt me.
- Oh, thank you.
- What do I owe you, Garibaldi?
- Oh, no, never mind.
- No, this my treat.
- Oh, fine.
Sure. I bet.
Now, my friend,
I give you all the dollar.
- That make up all the money you lose.
- Grazie, Signor. Grazie.
Poor fellow.
Somebody steal his money.
Hmm. I got no use for that kind of thief.
You're right.
I'd like to get my hands on him.
- Adiós, my friend.
- Good-a-bye.
- Is that your horse?
- Uh, that is my horse.
Uh, he's a fine-looking animal.
Ah, this fellow Yaqui, he's the best friend I ever got.
Yeah?
What you say, my friend?
I meet you down to the saloon at, uh, oh, at 3:00, huh?
- 3:00? Right.
- Yeah.
What are you going to do in the meanwhile, call on the señoritas?
[ Chuckles ]
No, no. Only one for me.
Oh, I like lots of señoritas... but... I love only one.
Same with me.
One at a time.
That's only fair to the sex.
Know what I mean?
Adiós, my friend.
So long... Little Rabbit.
[ Both Chuckling ]
Well, I'll be blowed.
[ Chuckling ]
Little Rabbit.
Come on, my friend.
[ Dunn ] Well, if it ain't the old village blacksmith himself.
- Hello, Sergeant.

Hello, there, Little Rab-
Well, Pop, did you give the old boy a new pair of patent leather shoes?
Yeah, all around. She's ready and waiting for you. Cost you 80 cents.
- Good.

Good morning, Matilda.
Good morning, Matilda.
Say, you know any people around these parts?
I reckon I know almost everyone.
You know a fella they call the Cisco Kid?
[ Laughing ]
Say, that was him you just shook hands with over there.
What?
I just- I just shook hands with him?
Sure. That was the Cisco Kid himself.

[ Tonia Maria ]
You got something for me?
"You got something for me?"
"You got something for me?"
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Come down here. I show you.
Did I ever come back unless I bring you something?

I could squeeze you to pieces.
I'm crazy for you.
Why not?
I am lovely.
Lovely. All the day and the night when I ride over the desert sand... you are always in my mind.
In the winds, your rippling laughter.
And in the night... your sad, sweet smile among the stars.
I count the hours till I can come back and hold you in my arms again.
These words too damn beautiful for that old woman to hear.
[ Chuckles ]

Say, uh, you know any gentlemen around here?
Gentlemen?
Where do you think you are?
Now, don't get sore.
Anybody can make a mistake.
That's why they have rubbers on lead pencils.
What's the idea of the uniform?
Is there a war?
Say, are you trying to show me a good time? [ Chuckles ]
- I don't like soldiers.
- No? That's tough.
And I don't like sailors either.
Ha! There goes the navy.
[ Chuckles ]
What do you prefer, traveling men?
Oh, all men are bums.
Say,you, get up and shake a hoof with those customers.
Oh. Didn't I tell you all men are bums?
Ha, ha. It's a cruel world, girlie, a cruel world.

Oh, no. Sergeant.

And she's ready to settle down
Her flirtin' days are over
And she's going to settle down
Ah, music, wine and love.

I don't know which one
I could give up if I have to.
Maybe I could do without music and wine... but love-
[ Chuckles ]
I got to have all of it.
[ Ticking ]
By golly, I just remember. I got date with soldier fella down at the saloon.
[ Chuckles ] Ah, he's very nice fellow.
I like him very much.
But I'm afraid if I keep this date,

How do you know it's for me?
This message is for the handsomest man in town.
Well, you're on the right street, sister. Speak up.
Señor Chicuello, the man you meet this morning is called out of town.
Oh. Is that so?
It's a swell world.
This place is terrible rough place for nice girl to come.
Oh, it is?
These women are very bad.
No?
These women are very common.
[ Chuckles ]
You wouldn't fool me?
No, I wouldn't fool you.
I hate to see a nice soldier like you get mixed up with bad women.
Well, girlie,
I'm glad you warned me.
Come on, sit down, have a drink.
- You speak to me?
- Yeah.
What you trying to do, make fun of me, eh?
Let me tell you this.
I am the prettiest girl in town.
Well, what am I supposed to do now, drop dead? Geez.
You are a conceited fool.
Yeah? Well, you're no shrinking violet, baby.
You can't understand any man not falling in love with you, huh?
Well, what is the matter with me?
Turn around, let's see.
[ Chuckling ]
You think my favors are cheap, eh?
You think I'm like these other women, eh?
- How do you know what I think?
- I don't care what you think.
Well, that makes everything square, baby.
Maybe I'm not like these other men, either.
Maybe you are a saint, a soldier saint, eh? That is funny.
The last soldier who come to this town was carried out on a stretcher.
Well, you still got that stretcher.
- [ Chuckles ]
- A soldier saint.
- That is funny.

[ Dunn ]
Now that's as funny as a cry for help.

Looking for someone?
Sit down.
Can I help you?
Say, who is that girl?
You'd be surprised.
Yeah?
Huh. By golly, you get lots of love letters all the time, huh?

Where you come from,
Conejito?
Well, I tell you.
My mother, he is born in the Portugal.
And my father- my father, she is come from San Luis Obispo.
Uh, my father- Ha- he terrible smart man.
Yeah. Uh, but my mother... beautiful like a rose.
I run away from Portugal when I was this big.
I never see them no more.
And now, well, I am sorry.
You are very mysterious.
Mysterious.
Life is full of mysterious.
Yesterday and tomorrow.
The rainbow's end and the moonbeam's kisses.
Who knows?
All the time, your life is in danger.
My life? Ha, ha.
What is my life, after all?
The warm breath of a few summers... and the cold chill of a few winters and then-
By golly, I think
I need a drink, huh?
- [ Giggling ]

Elenita. Elenita.
Excuse me.

[ Both Speaking Spanish ]
- How much you take for him in gold?
- [ Speaking Spanish ]
What you say?
Ha, ha. She say she only got seven others.
She cannot part with this fellow.
Ah, look at him.
Oh, he is so sweet.
The most precious things in the world cannot be bought with gold.
The tender touch of a little baby's fingers... the light in the woman's eyes and the love in a woman's heart.
That-
Maybe you better take him, huh?
- Where the devil's this Tonia Maria?
- [ Tonia Maria Shouts ]
Uh, get my horse, pronto.
[ Speaking Spanish ]

I hate that kind of man.

Oh, you hurt my feelings.
Oh, well, I am sorry.
Oh, you go away so soon?
I must go to work.
- Come on, hold out the hand.
- Sí.
Plenty of gold for mi enamorada.
Gracias.
All right.
That is why I like to work so hard.
So I can buy pretty things for my gal.
Where you go this time?
I know where there is lots of cattle on the Guadalupe.
Soon I get rich.
Then we go far across the sea to Portugal. Hmm.
Yeah, that is beautiful place- Portugal.
Nowhere is the sea so blue like the sky.
Nowhere is the rose so red, and nowhere is the south wind so soft.
Of course, you got to remember
I see this place when I was a kid.
Every place look good to kid.
Maybe I don't like Portugal.
Maybe I not be happy there.
Ah. Then we go wherever you want.
But first, you got to be happy always.
That is what I say to myself.
- When you come back? Soon?
- Uh, I don't know. Maybe I come back very quick.
Sometimes in my business,
I have to go places very quick.
Well, good-bye, my sweetheart.
I always like to see you wave to me... when I ride away.
[ Chuckles ]
Good-bye, my sweetheart. Good-bye.
- You bring me something?
- I always bring you something when I come back.
Here. Good-bye.
Ah, Conejito.
Adiós.
Adiós, my Conejito.!
My Conejito. Portugal.
Well, finally you got a kiss, eh?
That should last you the rest of your life.
Say, it's funny.
What you think men like, huh?

You? You so small, take three or four of you to give man appetite.

A officer.
A general, he was.
He look at me and he say-
[ Kissing Sound ]
"Dios.
"What a beautiful figura that girl, he has got.
"I would walk over broken glass in my bare feet... for just one of her kisses. "
That's what he say.
He must have been drunk.
[ Chuckles ]
Drunk? Yes, he was drunk.
- With love. [ Giggling ]
- [ Gasping ]
He say to me, "If you do not let me love you...
I will kill myself. "
[ Dunn ] Well,you're not gonna let me kill myself,are you, baby?
[ Laughs ]
I am so sorry.
We were just playing a little game.
- Won't you come in?
- Will I?
Can a duck swim, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
Who's the old girl?
[ Chuckles ]
That is my cook.
Cook?
Is she up on Irish stew?
We will excuse you.
Cook! Dios mío, what next?
[ Both Chuckling ]
She is very bashful.
You don't mind?
Not at all, not at all.
Well, finally you change your mind,
Mr. Soldier, eh?
When I'm wrong, baby,
I admit it.
Yeah, you should. You were very bad to me in saloon.
I'm sorry. No gent can say more.
[ Chuckling ]
Well, of course I was a little fresh myself.

Aw, you and me in New York together.
Say, you'll love it.
Aw, New York! Gee.
Why in New York, you can get a glass of beer that high for a nickel.
On ice, too.

Oh, uh... don't you want to leave a note for, uh, somebody?
Why do you say this?
Well, I thought the old woman might worry.
Oh, let her worry.
I hope she worries the rest of her life.

Come on, baby.
Are there nice soldiers in the camp, eh?
Huh? Yeah.
Perfectly nice.
[ Chuckles ]
There'll be a hot time in the old town-
[ Mooing ]
[ Cowbells Clanging ]
That's the Cisco Kid, all right.
What do you reckon... he's gonna get for them steers?
About 4,000.
Olé.!
[ Whistles ]
5,000 on his head and 4,000 in his pocket.
That's 9,000 for us.
Say, all we gotta do is to trail him in the hills... and give him both barrels in the back.
Why, it's the easiest money we ever got.
Now, he's heading through to Coyote Wells.
Now, come on.
Let's take to the pass.
- Olé, camino.! Andele, ándele.!
- [ Mooing ]
Whoa.
Well, this is the place.
Now, let's wait for him up on the bluff. Come on.
Thank you for the money, my friend.
Good-bye. Good luck.
Ben, have you ever seen that fellow before?
No, I don't believe that I ever have.
Well, take a good look at him, because you'll never see him again.
Those three cattle rustlers have been waiting for him. Two-to-one, they'll get him.
Beat him to it. Bring him down the first chance you've got.
There he is!
Give it to him, Art.
[ Gunshot ]
Hey! You coyote, you!
Tell him you meet the Cisco Kid.
These other two fellows don't talk no more.
The Bowery
They say such things

The Bowery
I'll never go there anymore
Go on, sister. Try it.

And they do such things-
On the "bawry", the "bawry"
I don't think
I go there some more
[ Laughing ]
That's fine, baby. Swell.
Sweetheart, you got a voice like a Brooklyn sparrow.
I don't understand it.
You tell me what a nice place this Bowery is... and that you're gonna take me there to show it to me.
Then, in the songs, you say: "You don't think you go there some more. "
- How you make that out, eh?
- [ Guffaws ]
- Say, I never thought of that. Whoo!
- Hey!
Hey, wait a minute.
Where ya goin', huh?
- I go fix your place, eh?
- Yeah?

- [ Harmonica ]
- Don't be long, baby.
- Sweet as a peach.
- I guess. Some worker.
I gotta give you credit, Sarge.
You sure can pick 'em.
Ha, ha. Love and duty.
For once, they go together.
How do you mean, "together"?
- You fellas know why we come up here.
- Why, sure.
Hey. Listen.
Now, this gal used to belong to the Cisco Kid, see?
But when I came into her life, things changed.
[ Sucking Sound ]
Cut that out.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
- Mickey. Mickey!
- Yeah?
- What do you want, sweetheart?
- Come here.
Oh, I'm practically there.
- What's on your mind, sister?
- Now I know why you come to my house.
You come there looking for someone.
That's right, baby.
I was lookin' for you.
Not the first time. The first time, you come looking for a man.
A bandit!
- How do you know?
- I am not blind.
- Here is a paper, offering-
- Wha- reward for him.
A big reward. Is that the reason you make love to me?
- To get the man and the money?
- [ Laughing ]
- No, no, no, no. N-
- That is a lie.
You are a cheat.
I hope he kills you.
- Hey, baby-
- No me toques. No me quieres.
- No me quieres.
- Hey, wait a minute, sister. Gee!
Doesn't come to the level with this gal.
Oh, he ain't.
He plays them all.
He's serious this time.
This morning he asked me if I knew anything about... buying furniture on the installment plan.
- No!
- Wanted to know how much it would cost... to furnish a flat in Flatbush.
[ Chuckles ]
Say, don't let that fool ya.
Six weeks lets him out with any gal.
Say, listen. He buys weddin' rings like you and me buy bananas.
That is, if we bought bananas.
How much is this reward?
Say, you didn't think I was figurin' on any part of that, did ya?
What do you mean?
Why, I was gonna turn the whole amount over to you.
Ahh! [ Laughs ]
I did not know this.
- Yeah?
- $5,000, all for me?
Why, certainly.
I'll get a promotion out of this.
[ Chuckling ]
And a gal, huh?
That's enough for me, baby.
You get the money, all of it.
Oh, the things
I could buy with this.
- Dios.!
- Yeah? [ Chuckles ]
Hey. The sarge is framin' a nice surprise on this bandit.
Only gonna take his life and his gal. That's all.
He ain't out of it yet.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
- He's the best shot in the army.
- Well, he'll have to be.
If what I hear of this Cisco Kid is true.
Yeah? Aww-
When do you expect the Cisco Kid to come back?
Soon. Guadalupe is not very far.
Yes. He will be back soon.
Maybe you better take me home, eh?
I tell you this.
You will never capture him alive.
Yeah?
Well, I ain't figurin' on capturin' him alive.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I'll be rich. Rich! Come on. We go now, eh?
- All right, baby.
Maybe you got better mantilla than this, eh?
This is the best one I got.
It is very rare.
It come from Seville.
Yeah? Huh.
How much you take for him?
One hundred dollar in gold.
- [ Snaps Fingers ]
- That is fine. I buy him.
[ Chuckles ] By gollies, you know I ride many miles just to find you.
Yeah.
I say to myself...
I cannot go home unless I bring something nice for mi enamorada.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I can see her in this now.
Beautiful like angel.
[ Chuckles ]
- Adiós.
- Adiós.
- Adiós.
- Adiós, amigo.
- ¡Adiós.!
- Adiós.
[ Gramophone: "My Tonia"]
Soldier... in the house.
[ Continues ]
¡Dios.!
Well, baby, that's what
I call a perfect evening.
Pardon me.
[ Clears Throat ]
[ Tonia ]
I love no one but you.
My soldier.
And the Cisco Kid-
[ Scoffing ]
I never, never loved him.
I swear to you.
Mickey, my love, he will come back soon.
He will kill you on sight.
You must not let him find you here.
He is a beast.
I wish he were dead.
You must kill him. He tell me he would never be captured alive.
He is desperate.
Oh, I wish he were dead.
Will I get this reward money soon?
[ Dunn ]
Ha-ha. Sure you will. just as soon as they identify him.
I will send you a note by the old woman.
When he returns.
Maybe- Maybe tonight.
About 10:00.
My lover!
So long, my muchacha.
Yaqui, my friend.
You remember I told you...
I was great lady's man.
[ Scoffs ]
That does not go now.
I am not as good as I think I am.
[ Chuckles ]
And maybe I never was.
Coney Island! Brooklyn!
- The Bowery! $5,000!
- [ Cisco ] I send my girl to the city
- And I send my girl to the town
- ¡Dios mío.!
And my girl, she's young
And she's pretty
And she's ready to settle down
- Well, mi vida.
- Ahh! My lover!
I was afraid something might have happened to you.
I was afraid you might not come back.
I would not disappoint you.
[ Chuckles ]
I know how anxious you have been for me to come back.
Tonia.
Tell me. Have there been anybody here looking for me... today?
Why, no, no.
- No?
- No!
Tonia Maria, this law is closing in around me.
Tonight, I am sure that this-this life
I live- it does not pay, but- but like the man who is caught in the- in the whirl- whirlpool, I cannot get out.
That is what a thief comes to know.
He cannot rub out his past.
Ah, he may be able to get away from these people... who hunt for him... but he can never get away from himself.
I go on, Tonia, till the chapter here is finished, but...
[ Scoffs ]
I know in the end I will pay.
Tonia... we will go far away tonight together, huh?
To Portugal!
Ah, Tonia, I try.
I try to start all over again, just for you.
Ah, that will be grand!
But... I cannot get ready tonight.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, mañana.
Mm.
Well, you get ready for long, long journey.
Get me wine.
Get me vino.
- I get you wine and fruit, eh?
- Yes.
I put my horse in corral.
Elenita? Elenita!
- Where you been?
- At the market.
- In the wagon?
- Sure, in the wagon.
Listen.
Take this note to soldier.
Ride in the wagon to his camp.
Do you know where it is?
Hurry, quickly.
It's very important.
Don't make talk. I explain to you when you get back.
Here. Quick.
Hurry! Hurry!
The old cat.
Say, listen.
Why don't you fellas change the bill of fare once in a while?
Beans, beans, beans.
Geez. General Grant said,
"Let us have peas. "
What a memory that boy has got.
Eggs! Why don't you get some eggs?
Say, do you know that eggs cost 15 cents a dozen?
- Do you have to buy 'em?
- Well, what do you want me to do? Lay 'em?
[ Laughs ]
You can't do that.
For soldier.
Sí, Conejito.
Men all love Tonia Maria.
You can get any man you want.
[ Orchestra: Dance ]
- [ Stops ]
- I did not tell you, I was to Yuma.
You got something for me?
[ Chuckles ]
The surprise of your life.
Look.
A mantilla!
- From Seville.
- Oh, it is lovely.
Nah.
It is you who... are lovely.
To you, my faithful... loyal, constant sweetheart.
To your eyes, with their warm devotion.
And to your lips, with their warm kisses.
And to the heart of you and all the other girls in the world who-
[ Chuckling ] who are true...
I drink.
To you, my brave caballero.
The bravest of the brave.
- My lover.
- [ Spits, Coughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
I'm sorry, Tonia.
The wine was so strong, it-it make me cough.
[ Laughs ]
It don't make me cough.
Ándele, ándele.!
- The old woman.
- Listen, you better be careful, Sarge.
- You know, you're liable to get in some trouble.
- Listen, you fellas, keep quiet.
No funny business, now.
You understand?
I didn't say anything.
What's the matter with the guy?
- Who is the old woman?
- Aw, she lives with the gal.
Well, he better look out for them foreigners.
- They do things different.
- [ Laughs ]
Señor.
Gracias, señora.
I guess I know who it's from.
Anda, caballo.
"He is here, but he is going away tonight.
"He is frightened. He thinks the posse knows his hiding place.
"When he goes, he will be disguised as a girl.
"He will wear my clothes, and on his head...
"a large, white mantilla.
I will wear his clothes, and ride away. "
"Come at 10:00 tonight.
"Do not fail.
Shoot quick and straight.
A hundred kisses, Tonia Maria. "
Hey, here's something else.
"Remember, he will wear a large, white mantilla.
You will be able to see it from a distance. "
You get the idea, boys?
The bandit's gonna try to escape tonight in a girl's clothes.
Well, this is empty.
- You have more, eh?
- No, no. No.
I have had... enough.
The job's finished, boys.
I get my man tonight.
Get him alone.
You better let us go with ya, Sarge.
No, sir.
I've got a particular reason for wanting to turn this trick all by myself.
So long, boys.
The old sarge has got a new gal... and she's a pippin.
- [ Clicks Tongue ]
- Hey, we ought to go along with him anyway.
Nah, nah. Didn't I tell ya he was the best shot in the army?
Oh, well-
I think it is getting dangerous for me to stay here.
- I better go. I send for you. Adiós.
- No, no!
You must not go.
You must not.
I will not let you.
I will not let you.
You must stay here tonight.
I am afraid to be here alone.
Tomorrow, you can go.
But I will not let you go tonight.
Hmm.
Such anxiety is touching.
[ Chuckles ]
You are so beautiful...
I could not refuse you... anything. [ Chuckles ]
Ay!
We should have gone... to Portugal tonight.
I better look around outside to make sure there is no danger.
I-
[ Hoofbeats ]
Somebody is out there.
[ Gasps ]
Adiós, my beautiful angel.
That is what you are.
And what you will be... an angel.
When I ride away... you stand outside where I can see you... and wave good-bye to me.
Then I know you love me.
If it is to be the end,
I want to know that... you are thinking only of me.
My beautiful angel.
Adiós.
- Adiós.
- Don't forget... to wave to me when I ride away.
Adi-

Are you going to attend Diana Mayo's farewell dance this evening?
I am not! I thoroughly disapprove of this young madcap's wild scheme!
The idea of Diana Mayo planing a tour alone into the desert, with only native camel-drivers and Arabs!
The subject of all the gossip, the orphan daughter of an English peer,
Lady Diana Mayo. Agnes Ayres
Her brother, Sir Aubrey, who for years has vainty striven to curb Diana's reckless spirit of daring Frank Butler
Diana's guide into the desert,
Mustapha Ali
Charles Brindley
I have a good mind to make you give up this insane trip.
I've made up my mind, dear brother.
Evening in the Monte Carlo of the Sahara
Diana, I love you. Postpone this trip and give me the right to go with you.
Marriage is captivity - the end of independence.
I am content with my life as it is.
It is the great Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan.
He is entertaining at the Casino tonight.
Mademioselle will be disappointed- the Casino is closed to all except Arabs.
And why should a savage desert bandit keep us out of any public place?
Sheik Ahmed is not a savage.
He is a rish tribal prince, who was educated in Paris.
In Biskra his slightest wish is law.
Go to the dancer and ask if I may borrow one of her costumes for the evening.
Like a page from the Arabian Nights.
The marriage gamble Where bridge are won On the turn of a wheel.
Oh, sons of Allah! Gaze upon the charms of Halima, loveliest flower of the desert.
To the cultured English girl this marriage fair suggests the slave of the barbarous past.
The pale hands and golden hair of a white woman.
By whose invitation do you come here?
I wanted to see the savage who could bar me from this Casino.
With your permission, the savage will escort you to the door.
It is the English woman whom
I am to guide into the desert tomorrow.
Dawn- with the Arab under the lure of the defiant English girl.
Pale hands I love, Beside the Shalimar,
Where are you now?
Who lies beneath your spell?
Into the sand garden of the sun. with her brother accompanying her on the first day's journey
Don't worry, Aubrey, I shall join you in London in a month - goodbye.
Lie still, you little fool!

Lucien Littlefield.
Why have you brought me here?
Are you not woman enough to know?
Do you know how beautiful you are?
I am not accustomed to having my orders disobeyed.
And I am not accustomed to obeying orders.
You will learn!
You make a very charming boy, but it was not a boy
I saw two nights ago in Biskra.
Your luggage has arrived.
You will dress for dinner.
See that Mademoiselle is given every comfort and attend to her luggage at once.
I speak French, Madame, and come to serve my master's bride.
An hour of anguished revolt, while a savage sand-storm sweeps in from the fevered wastes.
Do you think can keep me here when I am missed by my friends in Biskra?
You will not be missed until it is too late... too late for anyone to learn your whereabouts- the desert is a great hidingplace
Better remain here, for in that sand fury you would not live an hour.
You are so pretty and if I choose,
I can make you love me.
I would rather you killed me.
Master, the horses!
They have broken loose!
Through the dull slumber of despair.
Until morning tempts back.
A desire to live.
For Madame to wear the master's orders.
After a week of sullen obedience.
To my friend, Ahmed Ben Hassan from Raoul de st. Hubert
That I can at last make another visit to you in the desert.
I count the days until you meet me in Biskra. Affection stely Raoul
Pale hands I love, Beside the Shalimar,
Where are you now?
Who lies beneath your spell?
Pale hands, pink tipped!
Then it was you who sang beneath my window in Biskra?
I always sing when I am happy when events and things please me.
My friend from Paris is coming for a visit Raoul de St. Hubert,
That is why I am happy that is why I sing.
Are you going to bring him here and let him see me- like this?
You are here and so it is my wish that you should cordially receive my guest.
You will return Mademoiselle's possession to her at once.
I am leaving for Biskra to be gone three days.
During my absence, amuse yourself.
You will have the saddle horses and Gaston to keep you company.
Gaston will return your clothes.
You hate them so mush my kisses?

"Where is Gaston?
What are you doing here?"
I did not have the courage to face the stranger.
Oh, be kind to me Ahmed, please!
If I had arrived a moment later, you would have been picked up by that caravan and carried away from me.
At dinner St. Hubert reveals himself as a chivalrous gentleman of tact.
If you will permit me,
I should like to retire, sir!
You might have spared her.
My presence here!
The humiliation of meeting a man from her own world!
She is content.
Desert days bring to the captive and the novelist a closer understanding.
Your story is wonderful, but is it real?
Does there really exit such a man as you have drawn.
As tender and faithful as your hero?
I do know such a man.
One who could develop into such a character.
The men in my life have not known the meaning of tenderness.
Have thought only of themselves.
Unfortunately, beautiful women provoke in some men all that is base in their characters.
And the women pays for the beauty God has given her.
Excuse me. My ideals cannot possibly interest you.
On the contrary, they interest me profoundly.
As what. A subject for vivisection?
The victim is ready.
It will make interesting material for your next book.
If you will honor me with your friendship, my life is at your service.
Come quickly, doctor!
There been an accident!
Ahmed!
One of the men.
A gun exploded in his hand.
You see, Mademoiselle, it is all right!
In the harem of
Omair, the bandit.
The white woman of Ahmed Ben Hassan.
Bring me word of her.
Learn if she is guarded well.
I cannot ride today.
Gaston will accompany you.
You won't run away again?
I want you to carry this always.
The spies of Omair are still in the neighborhood.
I trust you.
You have not changed your mind about Mademoiselle?
Eventide, when the vast undulating sand dunes throw their shadows.
A spy of Omair, the bandit.
One more reason for restoring
Mademoiselle to her people.
Let take her with me when
I return to Biskra.
Has she bewitched you, too?
You want her for yourself!
How I have made her suffer!
Merciful Allah, why does it give me so little pleasure?
Because you love her.
Ahmed I love you
You are right. I cannot see her again.
Take her safely to Biskra.
Bid her goodbye for me. Then, my friend, return to me in my loneliness.
Do not let me fall into their hands.
The stronghold of the barbarous Omair.
Ahmed I love you
Monsieur!
Madame - Omair!
Nightfall on the oasis.
Where the tribal clans gather.
At the call of their chiftain.
I have sent for reinforcements.
When they arrive let them follow.
Bring forth the white gazelle and guard closely the jealous one.
Ahmed! Ahmed!
Call, beautiful one! Your lover will not come! He has forgotten you.
Is he dying?
It rest with Allah.
We must get him away from here.
White tribal hearts appeal to Allah.
He is sleeping.
There is still hope.
His hands is so large an Arab.
He is not an Arab. His father was an Englishman, his mother a Spaniard.
Twenty-five years ago the old
Sheik Ben Hassan found Ahmed's mother and father deserted by their escort.
Left to die on the desert.
Growing to manhood as an Arab, he was sent to Paris to be educated and upon the Sheik's death, returned to the desert to assume leadership of the tribe.
Pray God, dear friend, to save his life.
Oh, if He would only accept my life in exchange for his!
Diana, my beloved!
The darkness has passed and now the sunshine.
All things are with Allah!

{98341}{98567}I can bear a thousand tortures,|endure a thousand deaths...|but not thy tears.
{98709}{98872}This Arab Prince is but a thief.|Seek him out!
{99253}{99470}Quick! Hide thyself. If thou art|found with me, they will be merciless.
{100020}{100089}I love you.
{101564}{101712}Thou dog! What torments|can we devise for thee!
{101955}{102033}Flog him!
{103311}{103475}Fling him to the ape!|Let him be torn to pieces.
{104899}{105024}A pearl to every guard.
{105028}{105184}Have him placed in safety through|the secret panel into the streets.
{105640}{105718}She shall choose again.
{106012}{106104}The secret panel into the streets...
{107108}{107182}Choose! I command you.
{107512}{107615}I myself will make the choice.
{107947}{108022}Betray not the sands of Mecca.
{108026}{108140}Gain time. Defer the outcome.
{108837}{108962}Send them to distant lands to seek some rare treasure.
{108966}{109091}At the seventh moon let them return.
{109095}{109248}Who brings the rarest treasure I will wed.
{109593}{109777}When marriage plans have gone amiss,|The seventh moon betokens bliss.
{110265}{110333}Morning...
{112192}{112317}Come, if you still wouldst steal her.
{112321}{112449}I have found a way through|the tunnels of the tigers.
{113252}{113401}The Princes will return at the|seventh moon bearing treasure.
{113405}{113530}The one who brings the rarest wins the Princess.
{114047}{114212}Lose not thy hope, the rose persists,|and something good will come of this.
{115186}{115352}Turned lily-white he now goes|mewling to the mosque. Bah!
{116351}{116397}Thou art wounded.
{116631}{116705}In heart and soul.
{117068}{117138}I love a Princess.
{117283}{117364}Make thyself a Prince.
{117658}{117773}Allah hath made thy soul|to yearn for happiness...
{117777}{117881}...but thou must earn it.
{118479}{118554}Stay you in Bagdad.
{118558}{118658}I will send soldiers under guise|of porters bearing gifts.
{118662}{118742}Build me an army within the walls.
{119639}{119811}And so.. on the bedrock of humility|thou canst build any structure.
{119904}{119989}Come with me and I will set thy feet...
{119993}{120099}...on the path that leads to treasure|beyond thy dreams.
{120515}{120590}Three suitors leave thy city gate...
{120594}{120682}...But four are numbered in her fate.
{121162}{121243}At the end of the way is a silver chest...
{121247}{121328}...that doth contain the greatest magic.
{121332}{121429}Thou must be brave. Go now.|Control thy destiny.
{121917}{122045}Give this to her who hath|already my heart.
{122694}{122824}A day's journey from Bagdad...|a caravansary in the desert...
{123135}{123256}Thus far the three Princes|have traveled in company.
{123410}{123485}Great Lords of Asia,|good fortune to you...
{123489}{123565}...second only to mine own!
{123569}{123644}Let us meet here at the end|of the sixth moon.
{124823}{124900}Set spies to follow each.
{125355}{125459}A Defile in the Mountains|of Dread Adventure...
{125751}{125832}The Hermit of the Defile.
{125972}{126130}I seek a magic chest that|lies beyond this defile.
{126263}{126353}Knowest thou, rash youth...|devouring flames,
{126357}{126456}...foul monsters, shapes of death|beset the path?
{126532}{126607}A hundred years have I been here.
{126611}{126731}Many have gone this way|and none returned.
{126773}{126927}But, if thy resolve be firm,|I will help thee.
{126964}{127089}If thou dost reach the Cavern|of Enchanted Trees...
{127093}{127231}...touch with this talisman the midmost tree.
{128159}{128274}In Bagdad, the pavilion|of the Princess...
{128682}{128804}He too may return by the seventh moon.
{129111}{129259}... but his road is hard.|You must pray for him.
{129624}{129760}The first moon.
{129823}{129897}The Valley of Fire...
{131879}{131936}The second moon.
{131990}{132198}In search of rare treasure, The Persian Prince|came to the bazaars of Shiraz.
{132855}{132978}A crippled beggar knew a priceless secret.
{133121}{133250}The magic carpet.|They know not its value.
{133987}{134072}My Prince, here is|the greatest rarity in the world,
{134076}{134164}...the flying carpet.
{134788}{134895}The third moon.
{134956}{135086}The Valley of the Monsters.
{136705}{136854}The Cavern of the Enchanted Trees.
{137703}{137783}Thou hast shown great courage...
{137787}{137866}...but thy way is yet hard.
{138196}{138391}This is the chart to guide thee to|the Old Man of the Midnight Sea.
{139582}{139695}The fourth moon.
{139749}{139874}In search of rare treasure,|the Prince of the Indies...
{139878}{140028}...came to a forgotten idol|near Kandahar.
{143056}{143226}This is the greatest rarity in|the world, the magic crystal.
{143728}{143835}The fifth moon.
{143862}{144023}The Old Man of the|Midnight Sea.
{144771}{144921}At the bottom of the sea|is an iron-bound box.
{144925}{145071}There thou wilt find a star-shaped key.
{150886}{151035}Now you must climb to the|Abode of the Winged Horse.
{151039}{151217}That star-shaped key will|give you entrance here.
{151312}{151429}The Abode of the|Winged Horse...
{152458}{152566}The sixth moon.
{152632}{152782}In search of rare treasure,|the Prince of the Mongols...
{152786}{152915}...came to the Island of Wak.
{153144}{153260}A court magician knew|a secret shrine.
{155691}{155761}The magic apple...
{156534}{156591}That fisherman.
{159913}{160039}Far rarer than India's crystal|or Persia's carpet.
{160291}{160361}Thou wilt haste to Bagdad and,|at the end of
{160365}{160442}this sixth moon, give order|that the Prince be poisoned.
{160488}{160616}The Citadel of the Moon...
{161003}{161159}The magic chest is wrapped|in a cloak of invisibility.
{161537}{161724}The Cloak of Invisibility|and the Magic Chest...
{162607}{162714}At the end of the|sixth moon...
{164765}{164975}A day's journey from Bagdad..|again the caravansary in the desert.
{166231}{166313}Let us haste to Bagdad.
{166643}{166768}O Prince of the Indies,|discover this with the crystal.
{166772}{166921}...Does the Princess wait as she pledged?
{167966}{168032}Spread the flying carpet.
{168203}{168349}With the magic apple we|shall save her life.
{169337}{169457}The learned doctor,|Zakariya of Kufa.
{171783}{171845}Out of the clouds...
{174871}{174996}I was at the portals of death|and now I glow with health.
{175000}{175089}...What miracle is this?
{175439}{175489}I was I who brought you back.
{175493}{175611}No other gift can match|my golden apple.
{176006}{176105}He makes rash claim.|'Twas this rare crystal...
{176109}{176175}...disclosed your desperate plight.
{176590}{176679}My magic carpet brought us here.
{176683}{176799}By the beard of the Prophet,|it is rarest.
{177089}{177169}Her life belongs to me.
{177206}{177242}¡To me!
{177311}{177351}To me!
{177599}{177740}It is for me to decide|which gift is rarest.
{178607}{178770}A moment, O Princes!|Who can say which gift is rarest?
{178986}{179086}Without the crystal you|could not have known.
{179090}{179190}Without the carpet you could not have come.
{179194}{179297}...Without the apple you|could not have cured me.
{179357}{179457}Apple.. crystal.. carpet.|No one of them is rarest.
{179461}{179554}Each had been useless without|the other two.
{179948}{180071}Cease! There's wisdom here.|'Tis best that we deliberate.
{180365}{180440}Bide your time.
{180444}{180547}You have twenty thousand troops|within the walls.
{180769}{180917}Yourself hath said it.|'Tis best that we deliberate.
{181505}{181607}Through the night...
{183484}{183597}The Mongols are|taking the city!
{186339}{186404}Bagdad is yours!
{186717}{186842}The courier of the dawn...
{188495}{188585}We shall be wed at once.|Prepare thyself.
{188649}{188720}It is my command.
{189187}{189321}Bagdad is in the hands|of the Mongols.
{189990}{190168}You shall add joy to the wedding|festival by being boiled in oil.
{191499}{191591}Open wide the gates|of Bagdad!
{191663}{191736}Open wide the gates|of Bagdad!
{193640}{193740}Fly for your lives!|A great magician comes.
{193744}{193852}He summons armies from the earth itself!
{194598}{194683}A magic army, a hundred thousand|strong, surrounds the walls.
{194687}{194793}...Thy troops have fled.
{194856}{194971}Set my guard at|the Palace gates!
{195103}{195220}Open wide the gates|to our deliverer!
{196179}{196311}Great Khan, every way|of escape is blocked.
{197598}{197699}The flying carpet...|and the Princess.
{199136}{199202}Quick... the magic carpet.
