Get along there, dogie!
~ She wears a big white hat, ~
~ and I bet your life when I'm in town,
the dudes all hit the flat! ~
Come along!
Here we are in Nebraska, and I'm telling you I'm packing a powerful thirst!
Me for a can of them plums!
I'm going over to Jim's Place and get a quart of his best juice!
And get off in a corner and slowly strangle it to death!
Well, I'll be gol-darned!
Steve, you ornery old, low-down son of a bull-beaver!
You gol-danged buzzard!
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, nothing special!
Well, come inside! I can listen your lies much better with a drink under my belt!
It's been a long time, boy!
I bet you still drink that rot-gut bourbon!
I wouldn't insult my stomach with that red-grain water you drink!
One rye and one bourbon, padre!
Say, I heard about you being a foreman.
Kept me laughing for most of a week!
- What have you been doing?
- Oh, you know...
You no-count weasel!
Just the same as always!
- You're no-count to nobody nowhere!
- That so? Well, I can have my fun!
I ain't been wasting my time working like you.
Here's mud!
Well, I'll be a ...
Let's see, it's been about 4 years since we burned up the border down in Texas.
- That's right!
- Ain't you ever going to settle down?
Me? Why should I?
I kinda expected you at the last roundup.
How about working for me at the Box H?
Maybe I will... for awhile.
- I bet you five.
- Well, Steve...
I reckon I've got to learn you all over again!
That's a bet!
Pardon, ma'am. Could I welcome a stranger with a shot of liquor?
Look out for this hombre! He don't mean nothing he says and he's flat broke!
Senior, that's too bad!
- And you? - I can toast you with rye and bourbon until the sun goes down!
- Should we start now?
- Why not?
- You buzzard!
- Stand back, this lady drinks with me!
Two rye and one bourbon, Joe!
- Hello, Trampas!
- Hello, boys!
Rotten whiskey!
Put you boys in line to make some real money and you throw it away like...
...ordinary cowhands!
Go ahead! Squeeze each other out then
I'll sit down and take it away from you!
Them that don't, Lord soften their hard hearts!
I don't know what the argument is between these 2 cowhands ma'am, but whatever it is, I can settle it fair and square ...in my favor!
- Howdy, Trampas! When did you blow in?
- Hello, Steve!
Just blowed in to beat your time with this lady!
Ain't that so, ma'am?
But I promised to drink with these guys!
Yeah?
Well, you and me are leaving, see?
Just one minute please.
Don't look like you're beating anybody's time, Trampas. Not even your own.
I ain't arguing with you, sweetheart.
I'm telling you!
Please, no argument Trampas.
We're getting along just fine.
Not that it's any of your business!
Who's talking to you?
I'm talking to you, Trampas.
When I want to know anything from you
I'll tell you.
Long-legged son-of-a...
If you want to call me that...
...smile!
With a gun against my belly, I ...
...I always smile.
Mucho lucky, Trampas!
That fellow is a good shot!
He keeps the Mexicans jumping down the road!
Is that so, Pedro?
I know a fellow what can hit...
...3 whiskey glasses in the air at the same time!
Boys, sit down and I'll skin the hide off you in a game of stud!
Boss!
Number 3 can't get to the station because of the cattle blocking the right-of-way.
Alright, I'll tend to that!
Reckon I better get on down there.
Want to come along?
Sure, I'll help you clean them up.
Hey, listen you! You blow that whistle again, and I'll blow you out of that cab!
You old sheepherder, how'd you like that?
Don't call me a sheepherder, you grizzled old walrus!
Slow down, these cows are just hanging around your engine to keep warm.
Get them off! I've done my stretch and
I want to go home!
Better get your head back in that cab before some cow bites it off!
Steve, go down there and bring the rest of that bunch back.
Peanuts, popcorn, chewing wax!
All kinds of cigars, cigarettes!
We'll be in the station in a minute.
My goodness!
This is terrible!
I never saw so many wild cows in my life!
- Not much like Vermont, is it?
- I should say not!
Howdy, ma'am!
- Getting off at Medicine Bow?
- Yes... if we ever get there!
Say, you aren't the new waitress for the Lone Star Hotel, are you?
No, I'm a schoolteacher.
Oh! The new school-marm!
I wasn't expecting anybody to meet me!
Well, we weren't expecting to meet you, but here we are ma'am!
Yes ma'am, here we are! And we'll roundup every maverick kid in Wyoming!
That's fine!
How many children are there?
About 19 counting the Indians and half-breeds.
He's a lying pole-cat, Miss! There ain't but 13 all told.
Ma'am, what you gonna learn them kids?
Reading, writing and figuring up figures?
Yes, and history and geography.
I wish those durn critters knew something about geography!
They ain't got a lick of sense about knowing where they're at!
Thank you so much.
Now, where do we find the stage?
Follow me, ma'am.
You'll never go astray.
Right this way!
Hey ma'am!
That critter won't hurt you!
I think it's safe now, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Might lucky thing I happened along.
A wild steer is an awful ornery critter.
It did frighten me. Just for a moment.
If that steer had seen you face-to-face like I'm doing, he wouldn't be so mean.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm glad my man got your bags alright.
Take the lady's things right over to the stagecoach, will you Steven?
Oh, boy!
Come on.
Here, Ellie. You better take your moo-cow home or your mother will spank you.
Come on, you bad old thing!
Perhaps you'd like to rescue that little girl from that wild steer!
I'm sure she'd be impressed, but if you try to make a fool of her...
...she'd probably slap you face!
I'm really obliged to you, sir, for helping me.
It was a great pleasure, ma'am.
That'll be all, my man!
Here you are!
Take good care of this lady, Ben.
She's a special friend of mine!
I'll take good care of her, Steve.
Who was that man who was so rude to me?
Just a mangy foreman, ma'am. You don't have to pay no attention to him!
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
Smart, ain't you Steve?
My pal.
In case you got any ideas about my new lady friend...
...I just want to warn you that school-marms ain't in your class!
Oh... you're warning me!
Well, Steve...
...usually I just punch a guy in the nose.
But this time I'm going to throw you and hog-tie you!
You don't tell me!
Stop this thing now!
You stop this wagon now!
Put them boots on, Pa Hughey!
Oh, Ma!
They are too tight across the bunions!
- Mrs. Taylor won't mind...
- You will put them on!
Land sakes!
Look at all them folks there!
You'd think they were welcoming the
President instead of a school-marm!
- If I get them on, I'll have to cut them off! - You put them on!
Take your fingers out of them sausages or you'll get a bellyache...
- ...and your mother will blame me!
- Ma don't care!
Put them both on now!
- I'm coming right over!
- Alright!
Well, Uncle Hughey!
- How are you? Nice to see you!
- We brung the twins!
Rode 40 miles and still as dry as a bone!
You're very lucky, Mrs. Hughey.
Very lucky!
Put your children in the bedroom. They can get a nap before the christening.
The parson won't get here until a little later.
- Mrs. Taylor! - What's the matter?
- You come see!
Excuse me, folks. I've got to see what this is all about.
You run along!
- What's the trouble, Hong?
- Look at that chicken!
Trying to hatch then apples! Always wanting to be a mother, ain't ya?
If you only knew, Emily!
Now, get!
Well now, Hong, what's the problem?
They no work! It's so much work,
I can't do everything!
Alright! I'll fix those lazy buggers!
Bug Ear!
Hurry up with them chickens and ducks!
Keep that slant-eyed muskrat away, and we'll get through!
Mrs. Taylor, we got no milk!
- Why not?
- Cowboy no milk them!
Why you yellow-bellied...
Sam, it's awful cold in here!
Why Sam, your whole body is changing color!
Hurry up, you ornery pole-cats!
Bow-leg, hurry up and get out of that shower!
You're clean enough!
I need you out here!
Just keep your shirt on, Mrs. Taylor!
How'd she know I was in here?
That woman knows everything!
Now, folks. My it's just grand having you here!
Folks, this is Miss Molly Wood, the new school-marm.
All the way from Vermont!
What are them cow-herders up to now?
Look here, quit making that noise!
You'll wake up them babies!
Stop trying to shoot them cans open!
Here, use this cleaver!
Alright, Mrs. Taylor, but it will take a heap longer!
Howdy, boys! Getting ready for the celebration? - Yeah!
- Howdy, Trampas!
- Hi, boys!
You got here just too late to work, didn't you?
In the cool of the evening when the food, liquor and women are ready...
...that's when I appear!
Hello, Honey!
Where's the liquor bell?
That ain't gonna be hard for you to locate!
- What do you say boys?
- Hey, Steve...
...what are you trailing around with Trampas for?
Why you fellows all sore at Trampas?
He's alright.
Yes, he is... in a pig's valise!
Looking for someone, Miss Wood?
No, I'm interested in seeing everybody.
It's all so new to me.
- Are all the cowboys here now?
- Sure hope so!
A whole lot of them here haven't even been invited! A whole lot of them!
- What is it, Hong?
- Dinner is ready!
Should I ring the bell?
Dinner everybody!
Come and get it!
Come on, Miss Wood. I want you to sit at the head of the table.
Now you fellows!
Get out of that chair!
The ranchers had a meeting today, and their patience is plumb give out!
The country's gone to the devil that pays a man better to steal than to work.
Then I reckon it's getting pretty close to a showdown, Judge.
- That's her standing in the window now!
- Cattle rustling's got to stop!
She's pretty.
I wonder if she can dance good!
- Are you listening to me?
- Sure, Judge! I agree with you!
My throat's dusty.
Let's go in the house.
I think we can find something in the house to cure that.
That's no way for a fellow like you to make a living, Steve.
Don't I know it! A cowhand's dumber than a loco steer!
Freeze all winter and bake all summer!
For what?
Just to get enough money to get drunk
12 times a year!
But money's easy when you're smart, Steve!
But you'll never get it herding cows for 30 dollars a month!
Why didn't you wait for me this evening, Steve?
You were late and Trampas came by, so I came along with him.
You ain't very choosy about your company.
Explain what you mean by that.
Nothing, Trampas, nothing.
Maybe I could tell you a belly full, and maybe I couldn't.
- What are you driving at?
- Maybe I want to compliment you.
You've got so many cows this year, your cows must have litters!
Like a sow! Reckon it keeps you all wore out branding them.
You're talking yourself into a heap of trouble, my friend!
Since when was I your friend?
Alright...
...that suits me!
How about circulating around the dance, Steve?
That is if you're through being sociable here.
Why'd you let him say that tot you?
Because I'm smart.
One job at a time!
Never lose your temper.
There she is! Looks pretty in her Vermont sash and dress, don't she?
She'd look good in an
Indian squaw blanket!
Say, you buzzard! You know I've got the inside track with her!
I want to give you an even break!
- Flip you to see who asks for the first dance! - Heads!
You son-of-a gun!
How'd you know?
Is it true, Miss? France is going to give us that Statue of Liberty?
Yes, it was in the paper just before I left!
Excuse me please.
Miss Woods...
Good evening, ma'am.
Would you care to dance?
You're from Virginia?
Yes, that is I was born there.
I always that Southerns had such good manners.
That's correct, ma'am.
At least, they should have!
In New England, where I'm from... a man always asked to e introduced to a lady before he asks her to dance!
I ask your pardon ma'am!
Pardon, ma'am...
I see you didn't dance with that big galoot! Would you like to dance with me?
Why, yes!
I'd love too!
- I guess Eastern dancing's different.
- Sorry I'm so awkward!
That's alright, ma'am.
You'll pick it up in no time!
Say, Judge. I wonder if you'd oblige me in a little social matter?
What is it?
I'd like you to introduce me to the new school-marm. Formal-like.
All that talk you did about her, I thought you were good friends!
- Didn't I see you talking to her?
- Who, me?
I don't know what you're up to, but I'll do it!
Thank you, ma'am!
Excuse me, Miss Wood but this young man says he never met you.
It ought to! He's been talking about you for a month!
- Allow me to introduce Miss Wood.
- Pleased to meet you.
Oh, you're the gallant young man who rescued me from a tame cow!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm sorry, but you must admit this is a genuine rescue!
You must excuse my friend Steve for being so clumsy and bow-legged!
Care to sit down?
Thank you. I am a little tired.
I'd rather talk than dance.
We can't talk and dance at the same time any how.
Let's sit down by the window.
We sure are glad to have you out here,
Miss Wood.
Thank you!
Now that we've been formally introduced...
I'd like very much to go riding with you someday.
Oh, yes?
- You aren't afraid of me, are you?
- Why should I be?
No reason at all.
I'm as gentle as a plow horse.
And I'm powerful interested in education!
Then I hope you come to some of my classes!
I have several little boys just your age!
Book learning do a cowhand any good?
Oh, it won't be all reading, writing and arithmetic...
I hope to teach my children good manners too.
I'm sorry, ma'am... if you though I aim to treat you that way!
See out here...
..us folks... we don't exactly... you see you're from the East...
...and we been out here so long.
Out where it's kind of wild, and...
I tell you, when I first...
Miss Molly, the parson's here.
Won't you come and meet him?
Dr. McBride, this is Miss Molly Wood, our new school teacher.
Well, well, I...
Really, I'm glad to meet you Miss Wood.
Hey, Steve, where'd you rustle the cake?
Me for them there sweets!
In case it's any interest to you...
..the most elegant lady of this outfit promised me the pleasure of seeing her home to her cabin.
You don't tell me!
Now ain't that just fine!
You know, Steve. There ain't nobody
I'd rather see beat my time than you.
You know more than a half-breed bandit!
Or a speckled-trout!
You better leave that door open, it's kind of stuffy in there!
Now boys be careful. Don't make no noise or you'll wake them up!
What do they got corralled in there anyhow?
Babies, aren't they?
Never saw so many mavericks in my life!
Them's the kids.
Some of them are waiting to be christened.
One, two, three...
...four, five...
...six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
...eleven beautiful sleeping angels!
It'd be funny if they got mixed up, and some of them were christened wrong!
You ornery, low-down horse thief!
I only said it would be funny!
Let's get busy before the parson goes to work!
This must be that Jasper brat.
Looks like he has the itch!
Wonder what these little varmints think about all day long?
Not a gol-darned thing!
Getting mighty swampy around this bed!
Come on, young fellow!
This is apt to change your whole life!
Now sleep peaceful, you little maverick!
Stop playing now boys!
Listen, folks!
It's getting late. Some of you women have to drive all night to get home.
So let's christen the babies now!
This country sure is getting fancy!
Christening babies!
Importing school-marms!
Pretty soon they'll be putting soda pop in the liquor!
- That's when I'll be getting out!
- Me too!
Step in here folks if you want to see the ceremony!
Here's the christening water, Parson.
It's perfectly clean!
- Been boiled a strained through a new sock! - Fine!
Towel, please.
- Name the child.
- Charles Augustus Jafrey.
- Charles Augustus, I christen thee...
- Wait a minute!
That ain't Charles Augustus!
That's one of Uncle Hughey's brats!
What? Here!
Come to your Pa, Leonidas!
- He's Charles Augustus!
- Charles Augustus nothing!
- But I've just christened him!
- Then un-christen him!
Un-christen this child or you'll not get another nickel out of me!
Folks! Someone has mixed these kids and we can't tell which is what!
That's my son in a blanket
I've never seen before!
That's my baby!
Parson, something's got to be done about this.
A most distressing and reprehensible occurrence!
Reprehensible? I call it plain mangy!
It'll be bad if they find out it was us!
- Some ornery pole-cat done this!
- Well, who was it?
- I'll brand the critter that did this!
- He ought to be strung up!
Don't worry, Steve.
They ain't gonna find out we done it.
No, sir. We ain't left no clue.
The fun's all over. I'm gonna be leaving before something does happen!
What's that on Steve's pants?
Land Sakes! That's my baby's cap!
He's the pole-cat that did it!
Go get him!
I'm sorry ma'am about what happened to Steve.
Now that Steve's gone, can I see you home?
I saw you plant that cap on Steve!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Treating those poor babies that way!
- Well, you see I heard...
...some of them were female, so I had them introduced all around!
I think your conduct is disgraceful!
I suppose you're proud of yourself, playing a trick on those poor mothers!
I suppose you call yourself a grown-up, responsible man!
You act like a child!
Is that all you have to say for yourself?
I don't think you're a bit funny!
Now that's the right pitch.
You were way off-key last time.
Now, all together...
You're the one that's wrong.
Now, let's hear you by yourself.
Alright, and you...
That's better. All together now, and don't forget where you come in.
I told you I'd go riding with you after school!
I was just helping so you'd get finished quicker!
I'm afraid that herd of yours is about to stampede!
Sounds like it!
I'll go see what I can do!
That's enough!
That's enough!
Because you learned that song splendidly,
I'm letting go 10 minutes early!
School's dismissed!
- I've got a surprise for you today.
- What is it?
A new horse!
- Is he gentle?
- Yes, I broke him myself.
And he gave me more trouble than you did!
- I'll change into my riding clothes.
- Don't go...
...do me a favor, and go just as you are.
I'm sure the host won't mind, and I sure like that dress!
Alright.
What is her name?
What are you laughing about now?
Her name is Sir Henry, but I call him "Hank" for short.
You haven't told me about the book I lent you, did you finish it?
That "Romeo and Juliette"?
Yes, ma'am, I finished it!
Don't tell me you didn't like it!
Well...
I ain't read any poetry before.
Soon it'll be as easy as reading the patent medicine catalog.
Didn't you like the story?
They raised a strange breed of men in those days.
Romeo was a pretty good hombre.
Indeed! Just a pretty good hombre.
He had his enemies and he killed them.
He wasn't a coward, and he was quick on the draw.
- You approve of killing your enemies?
- An eye for an eye?
- Not if there's another way out.
But them enemies were ornery.
They had it coming to them!
What else?
What didn't you like about Romeo?
- I didn't like him in that balcony scene!
- The balcony scene?
That's the most famous scene in the play!
Maybe so, but not for me. What's the idea traipsing up that rope and ladder?
He wanted to talk to her!
Why didn't he go in through the front door?
Don't you understand?
Their families were enemies!
Exactly so!
Traipsing up a ladder, that ain't my idea of a real man!
What would you do? Go in and kill her father? That would be nice.
No, I wouldn't have killed him.
But I would have a showdown with him!
If he was too stubborn to call off that feud,
I would have grabbed Juliet off that balcony and married her!
That's just what he was planning to do!
Well, what was he fooling around about?
He loved Juliet.
She fell in love right back at him.
Why didn't he get to going?
Men in those days realized how much women loved the gallantry of courtship.
Yes, I know. He couldn't resist playing actor on that balcony.
Wasted so much valuable time, it got them both killed. If I loved a gal...
...and wanted her, and knew I could take care of her...
Not in the words of Romeo, but in the feeling inside...
Do you think I'd let that gulf stand between us?
Messing around with rope ladders, making up poetry?
No, you're hardly a Romeo.
What would you do?
Molly...
I'll show you what I'd do.
You're just as sure of yourself as ever, aren't you?
Molly, don't play act with me.
We don't fool each other.
We ain't on no balcony!
Don't you think the Spring is the prettiest time to get married?
But I don't want to get married yet!
I've got my school, and I'm just getting started!
That ain't no real woman's job in life.
Listen, Molly...
I don't aim to stay here!
Not if you'd be my wife and partner.
What I aim to do, I'm pushing farther
West to Utah or Nevada.
To do out there just what Judge Henry done here in Wyoming.
Make more United States out of raw prairie land!
I like you, and I admire you more than any man I've ever known.
But I'm not sure of myself yet.
This country's so new and strange.
I feel like an alien.
An outsider.
I don't know how to explain it, but I feel that I'm different!
Women are funny, Molly.
I don't understand them.
Oh, yes you do!
But I'm glad you think you don't!
What is it?
Sounds like calf bawling.
I'll find out what the trouble is!
Come on, horse!
I'll be right back, Molly!
Hello, Steve!
I didn't know you were coming up this end of the range.
Oh, just kinda drifting around.
I've just been putting a monogram on a couple of strays.
Yes, so I noticed.
Steve, there's no use talking around things.
You've been putting Trampas' brand on somebody else's calves.
Aw, what's a few calves to a man who's got thousands?
I'm sick of nurse-maiding someone else's cows around for... no more than enough to keep you in smoking tobacco.
Don't talk that way, Steve.
You and I done a lot of loco things together.
But some things are not only loco, they are plumb wrong!
You take life too seriously!
This whole country's taking things more seriously!
I ain't trying to lecture you or play
Sunday on what's right or wrong...
The ranchers are sick of having their herds trimmed out!
There will soon be posses out with ropes on theirs addles.
Times are changing. They can't get away with this sort of thing much longer.
Well, I'm carrying a nice limber rope to make it easy for them.
If they catch me!
You hard-headed fool!
What are you going to do?
Turn me in?
Nobody's talking about that.
I couldn't be sore at you no matter what you did.
But listen, you and I have been friends too long to find ourselves on opposite sides.
Don't put me in any hole like that.
Aw, shucks!
How do I know what I'm going to do?
This country's getting too civilized, too solemn.
I've got a notion, I'll be moseying out.
Gold fields or somewhere.
There's no need for you to leave.
You can stay on here as long as you want.
I know.
You mangy old buzzard!
There they go, Steve!
Right on time!
The only thing I don't like about this stealing business is the hard work!
Hard work, but easy pickings!
You lazy son-of-a-gun!
You got it all straight, haven't you?
Leave at least 100 head of the sorry critters on the bank.
In case anybody's trailing us, they'll think we got scared and left them.
We'll swim the rest down the river.
Don't let a hoof touch the shore until they hit the rocks at Boulder Creek.
- They won't leave any tracks. Savvy?
- Alright!
I think you're crazy for leaving any of them!
You got to pay a little for safety!
Throw away one, grab two!
Always play percentages.
Never try to be a hog!
Percentages, Steve.
I learned that dealing faro.
Remember that!
Alright, Trampas.
Come on. boy!
That a huckleberry!
We got a pretty good bunch!
I don't think we'll find hide or hair of them!
Well, you find any more, Nebrasky?
About 100 head so far.
This country's just full of stolen cattle, and ain't a cow thief in sight!
Looks like they got leery and dumped the whole herd.
Yeah, and they'll get them out of the country! We never will know who they are!
No one can find then in them blind canyons!
Reckon we're licked boys!
Lucky to get any cattle back.
Yeah, you found all of your cattle except 200 head of your best beef!
We will never find the rest of them?
You know you ain't found nothing but scrubs!
They must have gone someplace!
Them cows can't fly!
And a durn good thing they can't!
Boys, we're plain out-smarted!
They swum them cows downstream.
And I bet you...
...that we will pick up those tracks on the other side of Lava Gap.
- Boulder Creek?
- Through the rocks, sure.
They picked a tough route to Jackson
Hole. We may find then before nightfall.
I'll pick up the rest of the bunch, and we'll get started.
By gosh, I believe he's right!
You can bet he's right!
And what's more...
The guy that's bossing this spread ain't no common cow thief.
He's cuter than a mountain goat in Springtime!
He ain't no smarter than that
Virginia boy!
That boy's so smart, he'd dry snow and sell it for sugar!
Come on, boys!
I'll leave a couple boys down here with the cattle.
Okay, Fred. Let's go!
Not bad for 3 days' work!
200 head worth more than $75 apiece.
Better than herding cows for a living!
Where do you think we are now?
In some swell New York hotel?
We soon will be about 2 months from now!
Let that fire be! Do you want to let someone know we're here?
When I want a fire, I'm going to have it!
If anyone's following us, they are 40 miles back!
Yeah, hunting cow tracks under the water!
Well, I'm going to go see how Greasy's doing night-herding them critters.
What's the matter, Jim?
It's alright for Trampas to talk, I'll be glad when we get rid of them cows!
What if they do catch you?
You can only die one time!
What do you want?
Live to be 100?
What's life anyway?
A few Winters waiting for Spring.
A few Summers wishing they'd last.
Two bottles of whiskey and a half-dozen girls you can remember.
Then you're 6 by 3 feet under the ground and that's all!
Might as well be now as later!
Greasy, they will settle down. I'll send one of the other boys to help you!
Look!
Looks like a posse!
- We better warn them!
- No, you go your way and I'll go mine!
Now that he's found them, what's biting him anyway?
I don't know, but he's sure bothered about something!
Boys, we're going to split into
3 parties and close in on them.
Foster, take your boys down by the creek.
You boys come with me.
The moon's too bright.
I don't like that either.
If they couldn't set us by sunlight, they ain't gonna get us by moonlight!
I wish I was in Jackson Hole right now!
For God's sake!
Can't you get that frown off your face?
Think of something cheerful!
Your girl or a cold bottle of beer!
Play on that harmonica I loaned you!
Get them up, boys!
Get their guns, Honey!
- Boys, where's your calling card?
- We left them in the deck!
Thanks for the ditty, Pedro!
It was real entertaining!
I knew something like this was going to happen.
Where's Trampas and the rest?
You got us all wrong.
Only us 3 on a little hunting trip.
Well, then you must have been drinking your coffee with a cup in each hand!
Tie them up, boys.
I'm going to take a look around.
Found another one, boys!
Howdy, boys!
Never expected to find you here!
Found the cattle down in the ravine.
Whoever was night-herding them ducked.
Tie him up?
Real nice of you boys to build this fire for us!
Smelled it right across Wyoming!
- I told you!
- Told who?
You also was a rotten liar, Steve!
You got 4 of us.
Ain't that enough for one gathering?
Not by a long sight!
What do we do with them?
Hang them now?
No, we'll take them down to the cabin by the oak.
- Maybe we'll catch the rest of them.
- Come on, boys.
I'm plumb out of tobacco. Any of you fellows got the makings?
Well, she's breaking.
Be daylight before you know it.
Boys ought to be showing up anytime now.
Wouldn't look for them until morning.
When are you going to do this thing?
Sunup, I reckon.
Keep quiet!
We fooled you fellows good a couple of times! Thought you'd lost our trail.
You can't beat that doubling back in the water!
I learned that trick off an Indian.
Funny how you pick up a thing, ain't it?
You never know when it's going to come in handy!
Dollar and a half you owe me, Pedro!
Alright. I'll pay you tomorrow!
I'll be glad when this is all over with.
It ain't over for me!
I'm heading for the Tetons.
- Hunting?
- Yeah, hunting.
There's only one hombre responsible for this and that's Trampas.
And I'm hunting Trampas until I find him!
Here's some of the boys now!
We ain't caught hide nor hair of any of them, boss!
I told you there wasn't any more of us!
Come on, let's get this thing over with!
It's a pity to waste that loyalty on a skunk like Trampas!
Come on, boys!
Let's get going!
Come on! Let's go!
Little low, Joe.
Take it up a bit.
Please, I don't want to die!
Aw, shut up Jim!
Take your medicine with grace!
Ask him for a drink.
Maybe that will help you.
Nebrasky...
You can have this.
Don't worry, I didn't steal it.
Don't forget to wind it, keep the stem side up and it'll always run.
It's good for $4 in any regular saloon.
Thank you, Steve.
You can have my saddle, Honey.
Thanks, Steve.
Honey! That's a heck of a name!
Got a pencil?
I guess we can get the horses now, boys.
You got my gun, ain't you Honey?
I want you to keep it with this.
And give it to... him.
After it's all over.
I wish it was Trampas instead of you, Steve.
I don't want to die!
Alright, bring them on, boys.
You boys got anything to say?
You don't want to say anything?
Steve wanted to you to have this.
There's a note inside the holster.
Sure is a lot of quail this season.
Be quiet, you son-of-a-gun!
You'll get me shot someday!
How is he?
He's still unconscious, but the doctor says he's out of danger.
He belongs in a hospital! School-marm's house ain't no place for him!
- What'd they bring him here for anyway?
- His horse brung him here!
- Funny, ain't it?
- No, it ain't funny!
He's been hanging around here so much, the horse thought he was home!
Here you are at last!
Where'd you have to get that medicine?
A saloon?
No, had to wait while Doc mixed it up.
About time you showed up, Honey!
If we had to depend on you, he'd be dead already!
Don't scold him, Mrs. Taylor.
It's a long way to town.
You boys have been just wonderful!
If it hadn't been for you Miss Molly,
I reckon we'd have lost him.
You wait outside with the other boys!
I'll be wanting to use you later!
You quit your worrying, dearie.
He's coming along fine!
Why don't you close your school this afternoon so you can get some rest?
You've been here every minute that you ain't teaching!
And you ain't had the right kind of sleep since he's been sick.
- I'm alright! I'm not a bit tired!
- I know better!
No one can do 2 jobs at once without getting tired out!
Except me!
Nonsense!
Recess is over now.
I have to be going back.
- Thank you, boys.
- Alright, Miss Molly.
- Honey, have you seen Steve around?
- Steve?
Oh, Steve ain't with the Box H no more!
I thought it was funny he hadn't been around!
If you see him, tell him his gun is here.
He must have borrowed it from Steve before he got shot.
I'll sure tell him if I run across him!
Gosh, Honey!
I meant to warn you about that!
I wish I had a woman that thought as much of me as she does of him!
Come on!
Let's see if some of that liquor's left!
- What are you children doing?
- We're playing rustler!
That guy's a cattle thief, and we're lynching him!
You can't play like this!
You might hurt each other!
- He said he would!
- He said he'd be Steve!
Steve?
Sure! Steve wasn't afraid when they strung him up!
He didn't whimper at all!
Steve strung up?
What are you talking about?
Judge Henry's foreman had to string him up because he was stealing cattle!
- You mean hanged him?
- Sure!
Is it true?
Is what true?
That Steve... has been hanged?
- Who told you that?
- The children.
How do them kids know?
Then it is true!
You might as well know. Don't know why you weren't told in the first place.
Steve was strung up with the rest of them cattle thieves.
Did he do it?
Somebody had to do it! He was in charge and it had to be done!
That's our kind of law!
Don't you realize that's murder!
No use talking about it. Crimes are ranked different in different countries.
Out here, stealing's the meanest, lowest thing a man can do!
That doesn't justify killing!
And Steve was his friend...
It ain't a question of friends or enemies, it's a question of right and wrong!
If we didn't hold a rope and a gun over them outlaws, you couldn't teach at all!
Our lives wouldn't be worth nothing!
Do you think I'll teach my children that?
Teach a new generation to approve of murder?
Where you come from they have policemen and courts and jails to enforce the law.
Here, we got nothing. So when we have to we do things our own way!
Do you think it was easy for him to have to hang a friend?
It was harder for him to do it than for us to bear it!
And there he is! Because of lawlessness, someone took a shot at him!
And you can't tell me it was Indians!
I suppose this country's destroyed every human feeling in you...
...and in him.
I suppose in time, I'd feel that way too.
But I won't!
Then why don't you go back where you come from?
I will, as soon as he's well!
I won't stay here any longer!
Alright, go on back home!
You don't belong here!
We don't want your kind! Go back East where the living is soft and easy!
Sit on silk cushions and get hired girls to wait on you and drink your pink tea!
When I married Taylor I drove an ox team
1000 miles to this very spot!
I fought Indians with my father's rifle and him lying dead across my knee!
I killed a Sioux squaw with her own axe!
And you were talking...
This is a new country we're building, and there ain't no room for weaklings!
Men or women!
Go on back East!
And I will say, "Good Riddance!"
Now you listen to me!
My people built a country in
New England too.
And they fought and died just as bravely as you Westerners!
Do you think you're the only people who ever fought Indians?
Did you ever hear of the
Cherry Valley Massacre?
My Grandfather Stark was killed at Cherry Valley!
And my Grandmother walked 90 miles on foot to get help to save the survivors!
Don't tell me I can't do anything when it's got to be done!
I can stand anything you can and more!
I'm not going away!
I'm going to stay here and look after him!
And now you get out of here!
Get out!
Get out!
You get out of here!
I warned you, Steve.
I warned you!
How could you do this to me?
It's alright, darling.
It's alright.
I'm trying to understand.
Let's never talk about it.
Never let it come between us.
Forget it ever happened.
I can't help it, ma'am.
I think Romeo was a mangy hombre!
Shut up that rotten noise!
Set up another round, Joe!
You know what I want!
Town's full of mangy cowboys!
What's up?
A wedding. Judge Henry's foreman's getting married to the school-marm.
Him, huh?
I think he would marry her; she saved his life!
I remember something about him being shot a while ago.
Indians, wasn't it?
No, somebody plugged him in the back!
Hello, sweetheart!
Come here!
Boys, the only woman in Wyoming that's always on time!
You said 5 o'clock, and here I am!
Senorita and I are going to go get some flapjacks.
After that, we'll be back at the bar for some more punishment!
- Did you see who I saw?
- Yeah, the mangy cow thief!
Looks like bad news to me!
- When's it going to be?
- Tomorrow!
The bishop's making a special trip just to marry them!
Ain't never seen a bishop!
What's a bishop look like?
Like an ordinary shoe-drummer. Except he wears half his clothes backwards!
- Howdy, Miss Wood!
- How do you do?
Won't be Miss Wood this time tomorrow!
You look pretty as a picture!
Much prettier than that girl on the
"Pride of Iowa" can of corn!
Where's Ma & Dad Taylor?
They will be along soon.
I'll get everything ready.
- Howdy, Miss Molly!
- Hello boys!
- Welcome to the bride!
- We've been waiting all morning!
I didn't expect you so soon!
They got something planned!
I can see it in their faces.
- Howdy, boys!
- Howdy, boss!
He's plumb right, Miss Molly!
Could we borrow him for a spell?
- Can I trust you?
- We'll be good... pretty good!
Not too good!
- Which is the honest man?
- Not one of them!
I'll trust all of you. I'm going upstairs now and you can drink all you please!
Sure thing!
See you later!
We'll be waiting!
- You don't mind me going with them?
- Of course not!
The boys have their right to you just as much as I have.
It won't be long.
Anyhow, the Taylors will be along soon.
We will have plenty of time alone where we're going.
Traveling West.
Find just the place we want to make our home.
I hope you'll never be sorry!
Hope I'll always be able to make you happy.
And keep you happy.
That's going to be my main aim in life.
Now run along.
The boys are waiting for you.
The boys brought you things and they're all upstairs.
Hello, boys!
Set up about 4 of them and let's get to it!
Much obliged to you boys!
I didn't know Trampas was in town.
He's heading for more trouble.
Talking plenty and drinking more!
Well boys, my last drink with you...
...single!
Well, fire and fall back boys!
Someday maybe I'll step off too!
Here's luck!
I'm glad you know there's a friend of yours in town.
Did he mention he was a friend of mine?
He said plenty about you!
What I hear goes in one ear and out the other.
Hot weather, ain't it?
That friend of yours said he'd drop in again, in case you're interested.
Well, it ain't!
Let's have another drink!
Hey, did you get what you were hunting in the Tetons last Fall?
Yeah, sheep was thick in the Tetons all year.
Trampas claims different.
We'll take this thing off your hands.
Save you the trouble!
Just say the word!
No!
Thanks, boys.
This is a matter between us two.
I'm hoping he don't drift around.
But a fellow don't get married every day!
You've got to think of her!
Who else am I thinking of?
I'm acting mayor of this town and I'll put him in jail!
Until you get married anyway.
Joe's Place is getting pretty crummy all of a sudden!
Set up a round!
Cow hands drinking their mangy wages.
Somebody left the door open, and the wind blew in!
Aw, come here Trampas!
Let's drink to the bride and groom!
Get good and liquored for the wedding!
I heard the only way a man can get shot in the back is by running away!
Say you, I'm a friend of Trampas.
You know what Trampas claims about your affair down in the Tetons...
...that you run from a rustler with your tail between your legs!
Feller, if you wasn't drinking you might wake up and find yourself seriously dead!
Come on, Joe. Drink hardy, boys!
~ Turn your tail, you ornery hound! ~
~ And shove your nose into the ground! ~
~ For I'm an hombre Texas bound,
early in the morning! ~
Hey you! You've been spreading talk about my cattle deals!
I'm having a showdown with you here and now!
- I don't want ruckus here!
- Shut up and keep out of this!
It's you I'm talking to!
Trampas, I'm trying not to have any trouble with you just now!
You've been dodging it for 5 years!
You tried to stay out of my way!
I've got you corralled now, and I'm calling your hand!
You lying, white-livered skunk! This country ain't big enough for both of us!
I'm giving you until sundown to get out of town!
Too bad you had to say that, Trampas!
Get out! Get out by sundown or I'll shoot you on sight!
Boys...
...if you'll oblige me in this.
Sure, we understand. It's something nobody else can do for you.
- I knew you'd see it that way.
- We'll see that nobody interferes.
Never thought Trampas had the guts!
I don't want her to know until it's all over.
We ain't saying nothing.
She wouldn't understand.
She was raised different.
- So long, Joe.
- Goodbye, Honey.
Won't be long to wait.
Sun will be down in half an hour.
Well, he forced it on you so hurry and get it over with.
Yeah, we want to get some fun out of this wedding too!
- You ain't worried, are you?
- Of course not!
It's been so frightful waiting for you!
Who had to tell you about it?
The woman downstairs. I wanted to run out and find you.
But I didn't.
I waited quietly in my room.
- I'm sorry you had to be worried.
- It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters now that you're back again and it's all over.
Let's don't think about it.
What will we do now?
What now?
Now?
Nothing now.
I know it's a heap worse for you...
I wish you didn't have to wait alone...
...but it won't be for long.
What do you mean?
I did my best...
I let him say things to me no man ever said before.
If I hadn't been thinking hard of you...
I reckon I'd have killed him then!
I gave him a chance to quit.
But he had gone too far before the others.
It'll have to go on now.
What are you going to do?
I'm not going to let him shoot me.
We can go away! It's not too late!
You can go away and leave him here!
I've got to stay!
There's something else!
There must be!
Think what it means, killing in cold blood!
Do you think I want to do this?
I've tried to forgive the other killings.
Those cattle thieves and Steve...
I forced myself to think of it as you did.
A public duty, law and order!
But this... this isn't the same!
Just to satisfy a personal grudge!
If folks came to think of me as a coward...
I could never look them in the eye again.
Or you either.
But that's just pride!
I don't know what you call it...
...but it's something in the feelings of a man.
Down deep inside.
Something a man can't go back on.
If somebody said I was a thief,
I couldn't let them go on saying it!
It wouldn't matter what other people thought...
...but I'd have to know inside of me...
...that I thought enough of my own honesty to fight for it!
Then it will be like this always!
When will it ever end?
There will always be killing to do until this country ain't a meeting place...
...for men like Trampas.
Then think of us!
You and me... our life together!
That's what I am thinking of!
Your life has always been your own...
...but now it isn't!
You've given it to me!
Don't take it away!
When I think of tomorrow...
...of you and me...
...and of...
If you do this...
...there will be no tomorrow for you and me.
Don't go!
Don't go!
For my sake, please!
It's you, your life!
I can't let you!
Give me room!
Whiskey.
Sundown.
Here he comes now!
Let's go!
Hello, boss.
Hello, boys.
Well, guess I'll go to the Post Office.
You ain't finished your last drink yet,
Greasy!
He's got him!
He's dead as a cold mackerel!
- The key, Nebrasky.
- Here it is.
It's all over!
You can come out now, gents!
Thank heavens, it wasn't you!
I love you so!
[ Orchestra ]
[ Ringing ]
[ Chattering ]
There's the bus.
- Whoa!
- Hello, Harry.
- Hello. How the hell is everything going?
- Fine.
Uh, hold a seat there for me!
I'll be right-
Well, good-bye, old boy.
Good-bye to you.
I enjoyed your company very much... and I'd come back here to stay among people of such good breeding as you are.
Hurry up, folks, 'cause I'm in a hurry.
Listen. Some of these foreigners have to be put in their place, you know that?
And I'm the bucko that can do it.
- Does this coach go to Gallup?
- Yes'm. Get right in. I'm late now.
Well, good-bye, Nelly.
Put that coat in mothballs... and send on the blue dress that's hanging in the closet.
Well, good-bye. Take-Take care of your rheumatism and don't each too much meat.
- Oh, get in.
- And don't let the cat out at night... and be sure and cover our bird Wilson.
Well, good-bye. Good-bye.
Say, I wonder if I have everything.
- I hope you have.
- Um, well- Hey, where am I gonna sit?
- Where's a man usually sit?
- [ Laughing ]
I don't think I'm gonna like these other passengers.
[ Donkey Braying ]
- That gold box in all right?
- [ Man Indistinct ]
Now, Nelly, don't forget to put the cat in the mothballs.
- [ Laughing ]
- You!
- [ Woman ] Good-bye, Nelly.
- Good-bye, Amy.
Bye! Good-bye!
[ Spanish ]
[ Continues ]
[ Ends ]
[ Chuckles ] Five thousand dollars for my head, huh?
Never.
My friend, we are in very dangerous business. We must work quick.
This gun, he liable to bark many, many times... but he is the best friend I got- uh, next to you, my friend, yes.
Let's go to work, huh?
Hyah!
Halt!
Put up your hands!
Keep 'em up.
For the love of St. Patrick, what's this?
Everybody come out of the coach.
Oh, there you are.
If this is a holdup, we're lucky if we get away with our lives.
Oh, I shouldn't have come on this trip. I told-
Keep the mouths closed.
[ Chattering ]
Throw down the guns.
Now, throw down the gold box.
Phil, get your feet out of the way here before we get shot.
All right, here it is and here it comes.
Gracias.
- Keep 'em up. Keep the hands up.
- [ Screams ]
- I think I'm going to faint.
- You do, you'll fall on your ear.
The pretty lady, come here.
Who? Me?
Uh, no.
The other pretty lady.
Oh, for pity's sake.
[ Giggles ]
Come here.
Everybody get back in the coach.
- Oh! He might get me!
- You have nothing to fear.
- [ Mumbling ]
- Everybody, in the coach. Come on, get in the coach.
Keep 'em up.
I don't know how you live so long and act so foolish, my friend.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Ah. Is very pretty pin you got.
It look very beautiful on my girl.
I take him.
Ah, but, first
I give you gold for him.
- Oh, muchos gracias. Gracias.
- Come.
Keep 'em up!
[ Amy ]
He didn't rob any of us.
Ah, lady.
I never rob the individual.
I am so sorry. I cannot travel with you in this very dangerous country.
Uh, but, I wish you... a very safe and pleasant journey.
- Adiós.
- [ Amy ] Good-bye, bandit. [ Giggling ]
Be on your way. Quick.
[ Bells Jingling ]
[Jingling Continues ]
Whoa!
Well, Bill, I guess we're out of shootin' distance from that fella now.
Say, did that there bandit rob any of you folks?
No, he didn't rob any of us.
Well, if I hadn't been so busy with that there gold a-gettin' it out for him...
I'd have killed that fella and I'm not a-lyin'.
I'm mighty glad to see you throw down that gold box.
You know, there's nothing like being liberal with other people's money.
Come on!
Let's get a-goin'!
Get up!
By golly, my friend.
[ Chuckles ]
You and me are going to have lots of fun.
I buy for you new blanket... new shoes and a good dinner.
Then we go to see my girl.
Yes, sir, we are going to have one fine time.
I'll send my gal to the city
And I send my gal to the town
Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
We can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built
For
- Two
- [ Chuckles ]
It says in hereJohn L. Sullivan is going to quit drinkin'. Did you read that, Henny?
I don't believe in them newspaper stories.
Probably ain't true anyhow.
Look! Here comes that old stagecoach, sure enough.
My golly!
Hey, those boys are hoofin' up fast.
That's for sure.
- Whoa!
- Hello, there, old boy!
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello.
Boys, I was held up down there at the Devil's Pincushion by that Cisco Kid.
And I sure would have killed that fella, too...
- if my gun hadn't have hung, wouldn't I, Bill?
- You sure would have.
- Where's the colonel at?
- He's inside. Go and see him, Charlie.
Hmm.
[ Muttering ]
Say, there's got to be something done here about this Cisco Kid.
He held up my stagecoach down here and took my Wells Fargo box.
He didn't harm nor rob any of my passengers... but he like to scared all of them to death.
Hmm.
Where'd you see him?
I met him down here on the desert, what they call the Devil's Pincushion.
- [ Typing ]
- Oh, orderly.
- Yes, sir?
- Tell Sergeant Dunn to report to me at once.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll tell you the facts, what I'd have done.
If my gun hadn't have hung on me,
I'd, uh, I'd have shot him myself.
Yes, I know, Charlie. I know just how you feel about things like that.
- Am I faded?
- Sure.
Come on, sweetheart.
One pass for papa.
One, that's all.
I'll shoot the works.
Read 'em and grieve. Ha!
That's my baby.
Rich and ricey, nice and spicy. All right, come on, pay me some of that coin, you guys.
Oh, I see where
President McKinley... is gonna send a bunch of you boys down to Cuba.
Yeah, so I understand.
Come on, sweetheart.
My Brooklyn baby needs new shoes. Ha!
- [ Groans ]
- Dynamite. Another natural for Big Casino.
Hey, what's the idea? Did you walk through a pasture or somethin'?
Come on, long-haired Liz.
- That's the one-
- Sergeant!
Oh, get out of my life, hard luck.
Come on. Ada from Decatur crossed the equator. Ha!
- [ All Laughing ]
- It's a four.
Hey, listen, bad news, if I never see you again, it'll be soon enough for me.
- But the colonel wants you.
- Well, why didn't you say so? That's different.
- Come to papa, sweet mazuma Come to papa, come to papa - Hey, what's the- Hey!
So long, boys.
I hear my master's voice.
Yeah, but your point is four.
Well, what do you want me to do, cry? Geez.
Hey, can you imagine? Just because he's got stripes, he thinks he's a zebra.
- I never saw a guy like that-
- [ All Chattering ]
Sarge.
- Sarge?
- What?
I've got a great idea.
You do the playing,
I'll do the interrupting and we'll split.
Are you trying to make a dishonest soldier out of me?
Dishonest?
- Well, holy-
- [ Chattering ]
[ Both Laughing ]
Sergeant Dunn reporting for duty, sir.
Sergeant, the Cisco Kid is back in our territory.
He just held up the stage coming in from the south.
And it's up to our outfit to get him.
I want you to take a squad of men and go into wolf country.
Camp at the Frio and work west.
Yes, sir.
And don't get the idea this is any picnic.
This is not the usual type of cattle rustler.
He's smart and he's brave and he's a killer.
And you don't need to worry about any court-martial... if you shoot first and argue afterwards.
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

Well, good morning.
Well, boys, he's done it again.
This time it was the stagecoach.
- Who did what?
- It's your lone bandit.
Why, he come tearin' down the gulch and held up the stage all by himself.
What'd he get away with this time?
He took the Wells Fargo box and all the gold that was in it.
[ Italian Accent ] What? I just a-send my wife $87 to Sicily by the Wells Fargo.
Well, you can kiss that good-bye.
When this here Cisco Kid does a job, he does it right.
I wish I had my hands on him.
I do good job-a myself.
We've got to form a vigilante committee and hang him to the highest tree... and I'm going to start it.
They say he'll shoot you quick as he'll look at you.
But if I ever meet him face-to-face,
I'll kill him like I would a dog.
What?
You would kill somebody?
- You heard me.
- I kill him too.
First I try to get my $87 back.

They say the gals are all crazy about him. Ha! That's funny.
Funny? Ha, ha. I don't know.
He may be very handsome.
Probably just a dirty greaser.
Oh. You have never seen him, no?
No, but we're going to. Come on,Joe.
Let's get this vigilante committee started.
We'll make this town safe anyway.
Yes. We'll get Cameron, Randolph and Turner and the rest of the gang.
We'll round him up before the night is over.

This little frontier town of ours... will soon be a thriving, prosperous city of the great Southwest.
The railroad is coming in down here... and it's up to us to suppress the bandit... the outlaw and the desperado.
[ All Chattering ]
If the sheriff can't do it and the army won't do it... then it's up to us to drive him out of here.
[ Speaking Chinese ]
There, boys.
There's the proper spirit right there.
[ Speaking Chinese ]
Ah. Well, now
I feel very good.

I get to talking to myself.
[ Tonia Maria ]
You got something for me?
"You got something for me?"
"You got something for me?"
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Come down here. I show you.
Did I ever come back unless I bring you something?

I could squeeze you to pieces.
I'm crazy for you.
Why not?

Lovely. All the day and the night when I ride over the desert sand... you are always in my mind.
In the winds, your rippling laughter.
And in the night... your sad, sweet smile among the stars.
I count the hours till I can come back and hold you in my arms again.
These words too damn beautiful for that old woman to hear.

You think my favors are cheap, eh?
You think I'm like these other women, eh?

Well, that makes everything square, baby.
Maybe I'm not like these other men, either.
Maybe you are a saint, a soldier saint, eh? That is funny.

Soon I get rich.
Then we go far across the sea to Portugal. Hmm.
Yeah, that is beautiful place- Portugal.
Nowhere is the sea so blue like the sky.
Nowhere is the rose so red, and nowhere is the south wind so soft.
Of course, you got to remember
I see this place when I was a kid.
Every place look good to kid.
Maybe I don't like Portugal.
Maybe I not be happy there.
Ah. Then we go wherever you want.
But first, you got to be happy always.
That is what I say to myself.
- When you come back? Soon?
- Uh, I don't know. Maybe I come back very quick.
Sometimes in my business,
I have to go places very quick.
Well, good-bye, my sweetheart.
I always like to see you wave to me... when I ride away.
[ Chuckles ]
Good-bye, my sweetheart. Good-bye.

Who's the old girl?
[ Chuckles ]
That is my cook.
Cook?
Is she up on Irish stew?
We will excuse you.
Cook! Dios mío, what next?
[ Both Chuckling ]
She is very bashful.
You don't mind?
Not at all, not at all.
Well, finally you change your mind,
Mr. Soldier, eh?
When I'm wrong, baby,
I admit it.
Yeah, you should. You were very bad to me in saloon.
I'm sorry. No gent can say more.
[ Chuckling ]
Well, of course I was a little fresh myself.
- I know that. [ Chuckles ]
- Yeah, I should say you were.
But big-hearted Mike forgives ya.
Maybe- Maybe you like to come in house.
- Eh?
- Eh, huh?
Well, I'm practically in.
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight
Pobre Tonia.
Qué mal camino.
[ Spanish ]
I get you some nice, cool vino, eh?
- Red ink? Yes, ma'am.
- Sí. [ Giggles ]
Put a little red ink in front of the old Sarge... and he'll begin to chat like Laura Jean Libbey.
- You. You come this way...
- [ Chuckling ]
- often?
- Often?
Say, I'm already runnin' for office in this town.
I would like to know if you got a girl.
Sister, I been a hermit all my life.
It's made me just a little bitter.
Aww.
[ Chuckles ]
You should not feel this way.
You should... be cheerful.
Yes, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
Baby, I see where I'm gonna be putty in your hands in no time.
- [ Both Laughing ]
- You ready?
- You like some vino, eh? Huh?
- Mm-hmm. You bet I would.
[ Chuckles ]
To you!
My soldier.
To you, muchacha.
Ahh! Nice, eh?
Yeah. That and the caress of a mule.
Would you like me to... tell your fortune, eh?
Yeah. Sister, if that's in the system, gimme the works.
- Hey. My soldier, huh?
- Oh!
Swell.
[ Chuckling ]
Ah! What is this? Huh?
Hey! That's my traveling bag.
Oh! [ Chuckles ]
Now I tells your fortune, eh?
- Are ya good at it, baby, huh?
- Good?
- Anything I tell you, you can believe.
- Yeah.
Ah, look! The first one.
You are lucky.
Yeah. The Big Casino shoots another natural. [ Clears Throat ]
There is... a very beautiful girl... coming into your life.
Beautiful face.
The most beautiful eyes.
Hair and teeth.
She is a dream.
And what a figura.
- Figura?
- Yeah!
He got a shape just like "Venice. "
Venice? That's in Italy, ain't it?
You are going to fall madly in love with her.
"Going to"?
Come here.
[ Laughs ]
Tell me.
Do you make much money, eh?
Enough for two, and maybe three, huh?
You like to look ahead, don't you?
You are very... romantic?
Yeah? Well, you ain't doin' so bad yourself.
[ Both Chuckling ]
Listen, baby.
I'm gonna be transferred next month to Governor's Island.
- Yeah? Where is that?
- Mm-hmm.
Back to civilization.
New York, right at your front door. Gee.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Oh, I'd like to see it.
You take me there, huh?
Sister, that's the idea that's been gallivanting through my mind this very minute.
Aw, you and me in New York together.
Say, you'll love it.
Aw, New York! Gee.
Why in New York, you can get a glass of beer that high for a nickel.
On ice, too.
[ Chuckles ]
And the Bowery!
Baby, you ain't seen nothin' till you see the Bowery.
Finest street in the world.
Saloons and dance halls everywhere. Hmm.
Free lunch.
All you can eat for nothin'.
And the finest whiskey?
Ten cents a throw.
You can pour it yourself.
They got pretty clothes for girls there, eh?
Clothes?
[ Laughs ]
Baby, you can get the swellest pair of shoes in the world there... for two dollars.
And hats?
Well, you can get a hat for a dollar and a quarter with a feather that long.
And petticoats? Oh, baby.
Wait'll you see the petticoats.
Every color under the sun.
Girls show 'em on rainy days.
Oh, rainy days!
That's when you see the sights.
[ Chuckles ] Hot tomato.
[ Continues ]
- Oh, I would love to see it.
- Yeah?
You and me together.
Is it a go, hmm?
Yes. It is a go!
Let's seal it with a kiss.
One for Big Casino. Hmm?
[ Speaking Spanish ]
- You mind your own business.
- [ Rapid Spanish ]
You get out.
Get out, quick!
- She-devil!
- Get out, you-
Oh, I hate that old woman.
- She's always so nosy.
- [ Dunn Chuckling ]
She's always spying on me.
- Yes?
- Where's your camp?
- Far from here?
- No, not very far.
I would love to see it.
- You take me there?
- Sure.
- You got a horse?
- No.
- But I ride with you, eh?
- Aw, that suits me, baby.
Please. I get my shawl, eh?
All right.
[ Chuckles ]
I be with you in just a minute.
- I am ready.
- Yes.
Oh, uh... don't you want to leave a note for, uh, somebody?
Why do you say this?
Well, I thought the old woman might worry.
Oh, let her worry.
I hope she worries the rest of her life.
- The old cat.
- [ Chuckles ]
Come on, baby.
Are there nice soldiers in the camp, eh?
Huh? Yeah.
Perfectly nice.
[ Chuckles ]
There'll be a hot time in the old town-
[ Mooing ]
[ Cowbells Clanging ]
That's the Cisco Kid, all right.
What do you reckon... he's gonna get for them steers?
About 4,000.
Olé.!
[ Whistles ]
5,000 on his head and 4,000 in his pocket.
That's 9,000 for us.
Say, all we gotta do is to trail him in the hills... and give him both barrels in the back.
Why, it's the easiest money we ever got.
Now, he's heading through to Coyote Wells.
Now, come on.
Let's take to the pass.
- Olé, camino.! Andele, ándele.!
- [ Mooing ]
Whoa.
Well, this is the place.
Now, let's wait for him up on the bluff. Come on.
Thank you for the money, my friend.
Good-bye. Good luck.
Ben, have you ever seen that fellow before?
No, I don't believe that I ever have.
Well, take a good look at him, because you'll never see him again.
Those three cattle rustlers have been waiting for him. Two-to-one, they'll get him.
Beat him to it. Bring him down the first chance you've got.
There he is!
Give it to him, Art.
[ Gunshot ]
Hey! You coyote, you!
Tell him you meet the Cisco Kid.
These other two fellows don't talk no more.
The Bowery
They say such things
- And they do such things on the Bowery
- [ Harmonica ]
The Bowery
I'll never go there anymore
Go on, sister. Try it.
You got a swell voice.
- I should sing it?
- Sure, go ahead. Gurgle it.
Give her a chord,Joe.
[ Laughs ]
- [ Chord ]
- Now. Ta da
[ Together]
The Bowery
- The brewery
- No, no. Not the brewery.
The Bowery!
[ Laughs ]
Go on, baby. Now.
Ta da
- [ Both ] The Bowery, the Bowery
- [ Harmonica ]
They say such things
And they do such things-
On the "bawry", the "bawry"
I don't think
I go there some more
[ Laughing ]
That's fine, baby. Swell.
Sweetheart, you got a voice like a Brooklyn sparrow.
I don't understand it.
You tell me what a nice place this Bowery is... and that you're gonna take me there to show it to me.
Then, in the songs, you say: "You don't think you go there some more. "
- How you make that out, eh?
- [ Guffaws ]
- Say, I never thought of that. Whoo!
- Hey!
Hey, wait a minute.
Where ya goin', huh?
- I go fix your place, eh?
- Yeah?
- I come right back.
- All right, baby.
- [ Harmonica ]
- Don't be long, baby.
- Sweet as a peach.
- I guess. Some worker.
I gotta give you credit, Sarge.
You sure can pick 'em.
Ha, ha. Love and duty.
For once, they go together.
How do you mean, "together"?
- You fellas know why we come up here.
- Why, sure.
Hey. Listen.
Now, this gal used to belong to the Cisco Kid, see?
But when I came into her life, things changed.
[ Sucking Sound ]
Cut that out.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
- Mickey. Mickey!
- Yeah?
- What do you want, sweetheart?
- Come here.
Oh, I'm practically there.
- What's on your mind, sister?
- Now I know why you come to my house.
You come there looking for someone.
That's right, baby.
I was lookin' for you.
Not the first time. The first time, you come looking for a man.
A bandit!
- How do you know?
- I am not blind.
- Here is a paper, offering-
- Wha- reward for him.
A big reward. Is that the reason you make love to me?
- To get the man and the money?
- [ Laughing ]
- No, no, no, no. N-
- That is a lie.
You are a cheat.
I hope he kills you.
- Hey, baby-
- No me toques. No me quieres.
- No me quieres.
- Hey, wait a minute, sister. Gee!
Doesn't come to the level with this gal.
Oh, he ain't.
He plays them all.
He's serious this time.
This morning he asked me if I knew anything about... buying furniture on the installment plan.
- No!
- Wanted to know how much it would cost... to furnish a flat in Flatbush.
[ Chuckles ]
Say, don't let that fool ya.
Six weeks lets him out with any gal.
Say, listen. He buys weddin' rings like you and me buy bananas.
That is, if we bought bananas.
How much is this reward?
Say, you didn't think I was figurin' on any part of that, did ya?
What do you mean?
Why, I was gonna turn the whole amount over to you.
Ahh! [ Laughs ]
I did not know this.
- Yeah?
- $5,000, all for me?
Why, certainly.
I'll get a promotion out of this.
[ Chuckling ]
And a gal, huh?
That's enough for me, baby.
You get the money, all of it.
Oh, the things
I could buy with this.
- Dios.!
- Yeah? [ Chuckles ]
Hey. The sarge is framin' a nice surprise on this bandit.
Only gonna take his life and his gal. That's all.
He ain't out of it yet.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
- He's the best shot in the army.
- Well, he'll have to be.
If what I hear of this Cisco Kid is true.
Yeah? Aww-
When do you expect the Cisco Kid to come back?
Soon. Guadalupe is not very far.
Yes. He will be back soon.
Maybe you better take me home, eh?
I tell you this.
You will never capture him alive.
Yeah?
Well, I ain't figurin' on capturin' him alive.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I'll be rich. Rich! Come on. We go now, eh?
- All right, baby.
Maybe you got better mantilla than this, eh?
This is the best one I got.
It is very rare.
It come from Seville.
Yeah? Huh.
How much you take for him?
One hundred dollar in gold.
- [ Snaps Fingers ]
- That is fine. I buy him.
[ Chuckles ] By gollies, you know I ride many miles just to find you.
Yeah.
I say to myself...
I cannot go home unless I bring something nice for mi enamorada.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I can see her in this now.
Beautiful like angel.
[ Chuckles ]
- Adiós.
- Adiós.
- Adiós.
- Adiós, amigo.
- ¡Adiós.!
- Adiós.
[ Gramophone: "My Tonia"]
Soldier... in the house.
[ Continues ]
¡Dios.!
Well, baby, that's what
I call a perfect evening.
Pardon me.
[ Clears Throat ]
[ Tonia ]
I love no one but you.
My soldier.
And the Cisco Kid-
[ Scoffing ]
I never, never loved him.
I swear to you.
Mickey, my love, he will come back soon.
He will kill you on sight.
You must not let him find you here.
He is a beast.
I wish he were dead.
You must kill him. He tell me he would never be captured alive.
He is desperate.
Oh, I wish he were dead.
Will I get this reward money soon?
[ Dunn ]
Ha-ha. Sure you will. just as soon as they identify him.
I will send you a note by the old woman.
When he returns.
Maybe- Maybe tonight.
About 10:00.
My lover!
So long, my muchacha.
Yaqui, my friend.
You remember I told you...
I was great lady's man.
[ Scoffs ]
That does not go now.
I am not as good as I think I am.
[ Chuckles ]
And maybe I never was.
Coney Island! Brooklyn!
- The Bowery! $5,000!
- [ Cisco ] I send my girl to the city
- And I send my girl to the town
- ¡Dios mío.!
And my girl, she's young
And she's pretty
And she's ready to settle down
- Well, mi vida.
- Ahh! My lover!
I was afraid something might have happened to you.
I was afraid you might not come back.
I would not disappoint you.
[ Chuckles ]
I know how anxious you have been for me to come back.
Tonia.
Tell me. Have there been anybody here looking for me... today?
Why, no, no.
- No?
- No!
Tonia Maria, this law is closing in around me.
Tonight, I am sure that this-this life
I live- it does not pay, but- but like the man who is caught in the- in the whirl- whirlpool, I cannot get out.
That is what a thief comes to know.
He cannot rub out his past.
Ah, he may be able to get away from these people... who hunt for him... but he can never get away from himself.
I go on, Tonia, till the chapter here is finished, but...
[ Scoffs ]
I know in the end I will pay.
Tonia... we will go far away tonight together, huh?
To Portugal!
Ah, Tonia, I try.
I try to start all over again, just for you.
Ah, that will be grand!
But... I cannot get ready tonight.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, mañana.
Mm.
Well, you get ready for long, long journey.
Get me wine.
Get me vino.
- I get you wine and fruit, eh?
- Yes.
I put my horse in corral.
Elenita? Elenita!
- Where you been?
- At the market.
- In the wagon?
- Sure, in the wagon.
Listen.
Take this note to soldier.
Ride in the wagon to his camp.
Do you know where it is?
Hurry, quickly.
It's very important.
Don't make talk. I explain to you when you get back.
Here. Quick.
Hurry! Hurry!
The old cat.
Say, listen.
Why don't you fellas change the bill of fare once in a while?
Beans, beans, beans.
Geez. General Grant said,
"Let us have peas. "
What a memory that boy has got.
Eggs! Why don't you get some eggs?
Say, do you know that eggs cost 15 cents a dozen?
- Do you have to buy 'em?
- Well, what do you want me to do? Lay 'em?
[ Laughs ]
You can't do that.
For soldier.
Sí, Conejito.
Men all love Tonia Maria.
You can get any man you want.
[ Orchestra: Dance ]
- [ Stops ]
- I did not tell you, I was to Yuma.
You got something for me?
[ Chuckles ]
The surprise of your life.
Look.
A mantilla!
- From Seville.
- Oh, it is lovely.
Nah.
It is you who... are lovely.
To you, my faithful... loyal, constant sweetheart.
To your eyes, with their warm devotion.
And to your lips, with their warm kisses.
And to the heart of you and all the other girls in the world who-
[ Chuckling ] who are true...
I drink.
To you, my brave caballero.
The bravest of the brave.
- My lover.
- [ Spits, Coughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
I'm sorry, Tonia.
The wine was so strong, it-it make me cough.
[ Laughs ]
It don't make me cough.
Ándele, ándele.!
- The old woman.
- Listen, you better be careful, Sarge.
- You know, you're liable to get in some trouble.
- Listen, you fellas, keep quiet.
No funny business, now.
You understand?
I didn't say anything.
What's the matter with the guy?
- Who is the old woman?
- Aw, she lives with the gal.
Well, he better look out for them foreigners.
- They do things different.
- [ Laughs ]
Señor.
Gracias, señora.
I guess I know who it's from.
Anda, caballo.
"He is here, but he is going away tonight.
"He is frightened. He thinks the posse knows his hiding place.
"When he goes, he will be disguised as a girl.
"He will wear my clothes, and on his head...
"a large, white mantilla.
I will wear his clothes, and ride away. "
"Come at 10:00 tonight.
"Do not fail.
Shoot quick and straight.
A hundred kisses, Tonia Maria. "
Hey, here's something else.
"Remember, he will wear a large, white mantilla.
You will be able to see it from a distance. "
You get the idea, boys?
The bandit's gonna try to escape tonight in a girl's clothes.
Well, this is empty.
- You have more, eh?
- No, no. No.
I have had... enough.
The job's finished, boys.
I get my man tonight.
Get him alone.
You better let us go with ya, Sarge.
No, sir.
I've got a particular reason for wanting to turn this trick all by myself.
So long, boys.
The old sarge has got a new gal... and she's a pippin.
- [ Clicks Tongue ]
- Hey, we ought to go along with him anyway.
Nah, nah. Didn't I tell ya he was the best shot in the army?
Oh, well-
I think it is getting dangerous for me to stay here.
- I better go. I send for you. Adiós.
- No, no!
You must not go.
You must not.
I will not let you.
I will not let you.
You must stay here tonight.
I am afraid to be here alone.
Tomorrow, you can go.
But I will not let you go tonight.
Hmm.
Such anxiety is touching.
[ Chuckles ]
You are so beautiful...
I could not refuse you... anything. [ Chuckles ]
Ay!
We should have gone... to Portugal tonight.
I better look around outside to make sure there is no danger.
I-
[ Hoofbeats ]
Somebody is out there.
[ Gasps ]
Adiós, my beautiful angel.
That is what you are.
And what you will be... an angel.
When I ride away... you stand outside where I can see you... and wave good-bye to me.
Then I know you love me.
If it is to be the end,
I want to know that... you are thinking only of me.
My beautiful angel.
Adiós.
- Adiós.
- Don't forget... to wave to me when I ride away.
Adi-

FULTAH FISHER'S
BOARDING HOUSE
That night, when through the mooring chains
The wide eyed corpse rolled free.
To blunder down by Garden Reach
And not at Kedgaree.
The tale the Huglali told the shoal
The lean shoal told to me.
It was Faltah Fisher's boarding house
Where sailor-men reside,
And there were men of all the ports
From Mississip to Clyde,
And regally they spat and smoked,
And fearsomely they lied...
And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
Tho carried on his hairy chest
The maid Ultruda's charm...
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.
And there was Jake
Without-the-Ears
And Pamba the Malay,
And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,
And Luz from Vigo Bay.
And Honest Jack who sold them slops
And harvested their pay.
And there was Salem Hardieker
A lean Bostonian he...
Swiss, German, English,
Halfbreed, Finn,
Yank, Dane and Portuges,
At Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
They rested from the sea.
They told their tales of wreck and wrong.
Of shame and lust and fraud.
They backed their toughest statements with
The Brimstone of the Lord.
And crackling oaths went to and fro
Across the fist-banged board.
How Anne of Austria shared their drinks
Collinga knew her fame,
From Tarnau in Galicia
To Jaun Bazar she came.
To eat the bread of infamy
And take the wage of shame.
She held a dozen men to heel...
Rich spoil of war was hers,
In hose and gown and ring and chain,
From twenty mariners,
And, by Port Law, that week, men called
Her Salem Hardieker's.
But seaman learnt-what landsmen know...
That neither gifts nor gain
Can hold a winking Light O'Love.
Or Fancy's flight restrain,
When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.
But cold was
Hans the blue-eyed Dane.
Bull-throated bare of arm.
And laughter shook the chest beneath
The maid Ultruda's charm...
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.
"You speak to Salem Hardieker,
You was his girl, I know
I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,
Und round the Skaw we go,
South down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,
To Besser in Saro."
When love rejected turns to hate,
All ill betide the man.
"You speak to Salem Hardieker..."
She spoke as woman can.
A screa-a sob-
"He salled me-names!" and then the fray began.
An oath from Salem Hardieker.
A shriek upon the stairs,
Across the broken chairs.
A dance of shadows on the wall
A knife-thrust unawares...
And Hans came down, as cattle drop,
When Anne of Austria's trembling hands
The weary head fell low:...
I ship mineselfs to-morrow, straight
For Besser in Saro:
Und there Ultruda comes to me
At Faster, und I go.
"South down the Cattegat -
What's here?
There-are-no-lights-to-guide!"
The mutter ceased, the spirit passed,
And Anne of Austria cried
In Gultah Fisher's boarding-house
When Hans the mighty died.
Thus slew they
Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm.
But Anne of Austria looted first
The maid Ultruda's charm...
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.

Gold on Indian land! The Sioux tribes were given other reservation, and President Grant set a day when settlers might race for possession of the rich lands.
<b>By the President of the United States of America
Proclamation</b>
I Ulysses S. Grant,
President of the United States, do hereby make knowm
that the said lands acquired from the Sioux tribes,
will be available for settlement at and after the hour of o'clock ...
noon of the 25 day of June, 1887 and not before ...
In the middle of the seventies, ship of hope bore thousands of emigrants to seek the reality of their dreams in America.
Some sought happiness ... some only the horn of plently ... the chalice of ... the Unholy Grail ...
And from crowded eastern cities, civilization began pouring the overflow into the trackless immensity of the West.
Spring, 1876 ...
Old World blood began to fuse with Colonial strains ... and "westward the course of empire takes its way".
In the Black Hills of Dakota, the outriders of progress had set up a trading post at Custer.
" Gold! Gold ... I'm tellin' ye ... the mountains is just abustin' with it! "
" Sorry, Lucas, but we can't touch that land ... it's on the Sioux Reservation. "
" Where'd you strike it, Lucas? "
And then came the eager thud of hoofs and the creak of wagon wheels.
The start of an empire that was to be compounded from the peoples of the face of the earth!
Dan O'Malley had came from Ireland at a smile a minute pace.
♫ " All the way from Ireland ♫
♫ With a Swede named Squaarehead Joe ♫
♫ Bound to find Dakota ♫

" The wheel came off. "
" Oh, did it ? "
" Something ought to be done about it."
" You must have traveled a lot to know all those things."
" I can fix it. "
" Don't let me stop you."
" I'm Mayor Carleton of Virginia.
Suh ... this is my daughter Lee."
" My name and address is Dan O'Malley."
" We're on our way to the Dakota rush ...

REWARD
£ 500 REWARD
HORSE THIEVES
" Bull " Stanley ...
Who lived day by day on pluck, powder and providence.
Mike Costigan and " Spade " Allen weren't exactly thieves ... but they had a habit of finding horses that nobody had lost.
" Chaw ? "
" Naw ! "
" Am I seein' things ... or is them million wagons on the square? "
" Pardner ... where-you all bound for? "
" Sufferin' coyotes ... yer don't mean t' say you ain't heard tell about gold in the Dakotas! "
" We're goin' to the Dakotas ... he may be there ... "
" It ain't gold I'm looking for ... but it's a man jest as yeller ..."
Hundreds of gold-mad men swarmed Custer, awaiting word to rush for the ore-ladened lands.
Sheriff Layne Hunter, running the mushroom town with a high hand; keeping his own lawless gang in cheek by a generous division of the spoils.
" Layne, please don't make me stay in there with those ... women ..."
" Just for tonight, Millie ... tomorrow we'll find a better place."
" A string of race hosses ... about fifteen miles back ... an' only two men herdin' them! "
" Thoroughbreds! "
" Why the low-down hoss-thieves! "
" Nothin' to it ... our businness is gettin' overcrowded."
" I have to goin' blind ...  fired three shots and only dropped two of 'em."
" By golly ... he's a woman! "
" Put them hosses back ! "
Hour by hour, thousand by thousand, the stampeders crushed into Custer, as the big day neared.
Zach Little ... Editor of the Custer " Pathfinder ", was half Scotch and half seltzer.
" They had a lot of touble takin' out Spud Taylor's appendix ... they had to kill him first. "
THE EMPORIUM
JOE MINSK
And still they come ... lured by the magic word ... Gold.
" You are a minister of the Gospel, Sir? "
" There's a minister in town, Layne ... now we can be married! "
" Parson ... this ain't exactly a Sunday School camp ... but they's some of us that'll be d...n glad you come along."
" Oh, bless these plows ... that they may make this wilderness blossom with the glory of God! "
" I'm Sheriff Hunter ... allow me ..."
" This lady's in my outfit ... if they's anything she needs, I'll 'tend to it! "
" Since when did the notorious
' Bull ' Stanley become so gallant ..."
"... And Mike Costigan! Every sheriff west of the Mississippi has asked me to welcome you! "
"... And 'Spade' Allen! Been shot at lately for card cheating? "
" I congratulate you, Miss ... on your selection of friends! "
" Come along, my 3 Bad Men ... it's time we were making camp."
" What you lookin' at ... hoss face? "
" They're dangerous men ... but I'll take care of them ... in my own way! "
Just outside the town ... a camp for the night.
" I'm mighty grateful to you men for helping me through."
" We couldn't see anybody robbed."
" No, sir, not us! "
" I'd like to hire you three, but I suppose you have business to attend to ..."
" To tell the truth, miss ...  our business ain't what it used to be."
" Then you're free ... for the moment? "
" Y.. y .. yes ... for the moment. "
" I ... I'm afraid I can't pay you any wages ... just yet."
" For the time bein', miss ...
I'll work for nothin'..."
"... and I know my pardners will ! "
"Oh, gladly!"
" Then you'll be my men? "
♫ " Gettin' near Dakota. Just rarin' for to go ...♫
♫ Feelin' very mighty happy,
'Cause I've seen my calico! " ♫
Morning found a wagon city on the edge of the town.
" I'm sorry about ... er ... yesterday, Miss Carleton."
" Drunk again ! "
" So are we ! "
" It's plumb low-down to do a thing like this ... an' her trustin' us! "
" I'm thinkin' three terrapins like us ain't fit to take care of a gal like her ..."
" What our gal needs is a husband! "
" Leave it to us! We'll find a marryin' man ... if we have to shoot him."
" So you're back again, Lucas? "
Brother, I have gone awug with the man I love.
Everithing is all right, as he has promised to marry me.
Lovingly, Millie.
Husband hunting ...
" Not a Chink ... they get shot too easy."
" Thirty two."
" Twenty eight."
" I've just reached manhood."
" Then you'd better reach again! "
" Sound as a dollar ! "
" Come on ... you ain't safe alone."
" If a man's heart is in the right place, it don't matter what sex he belongs to."
Dan sold his outfit and joined the stampede.
" You're mine now .... Hunter wanted to get rid of you and gave you to me."
" Ragamuffins! "
" Married? "
" Want a job? "
" I found a man ! "
" It's plumb unsafe for you to go ridin' alone that a-way."
" He's the new hired hand."
" But 'bull' ... I don't think we need any more help."
" Not so bad ..."
" Not so good ..."
" All right ... he'll do."
" Now let nature take its course."
" I hope he don't drink ..."
"... we don't want no soaks around here."
" I haven't seen your dad around
... Where is he? "
" Sheriff some of the better element ... are complaining about the way you run this town. "
" Listen, Rabbi ... Business is terrible! ...
Nobody buys a new suit even to be buried in. "
Cleanliness is next to Goldliness ...
That's why Saturday night comes before Sunday.
" You don't reckon she'll be wantin' us to take a bath, do you? "
" I'm a little nervous about it."
" Guard the tent."
" How about three fingers of bug juice?"
♫ " I'm here in Dakota I want the world to know ...♫
♫ Goin' to get a homstead.
Cause I found my calico! " ♫
" Do you like that tune, Miss Lee? "
" Having a nice time ? "
" You're goin' to tell me how to get that gold ! "
" Hunter, you've been takin' in too much territory... Now you're all through! "
" You bungling fool !"
" Hunter sent him to be make me tell the way to the gold land ..."
" ... my map won't do me any good now ... but it'll take you to where there's gold ! "
The night before the rush ....
Custer, an armed camp ... with "Bull" Stanley leading the revolt against Hunter.
... while in the little church the women pray ... for safety, today ...
Divine guidance tomorrow...
"... and as He led the children of Israel into the promised land, so He will lead us ..."
Knowing his danger, Hunter fans the flames of lawless abandon among his followers.
" Burn that psalm-singing preacher's shack! "
" Brother! Brother! "
" Brother! Brother! "
" Brother! "
" It's gettin' stuffy in here with all this smoke and love ... I'm leavin' !"
" We'll sneak across the line tonight and wait. "
" Millie! Little Sister! "
" Millie, who is ... the man? "
The Grand Land Rush!
Morning broke with the clatter of wagons ... the roaring, sweating, cursing, fighting mob scrambling ... for position in the line.
" It's time for you to start, Missy ... you've got a long, hard ride ahead ..."
" I'm ready when you are, 'Bull'! "
" Mike and 'Spade' will take care of you ...
I've got to look for someone else."
" Please, 'Bull'... I need you. "
On the line! Ready for the dot of twelve ...
And the race for land and gold.

Carleton's thoroughbreds ... sensing the drama of the historic trial of speed.
" Keep your plow! You'll find the real wealth of this land in the soil ! "

The end of a day of furious riding ... the Carleton far ahead.
BUSTED BY GOD
" The parson was right, Ned; we'll stay right here.
This soil is as rich as gold."
Hunter sights his prey ...
... and the Carleton seek escape through a narrow pass to the gold country.
" You and Miss Lee go on ahead
... we'll follow along. "
" Well, partners ...

" Shucks! One good man could hold this pass against a whole army of men like Hunter. "
" I said a good man."
" Mike, your pants may be shabby, but they cover a warm heart ..."
" You an' Mike go on. I'll stay."
" We'll cut high card to see who stays! "
" All right ... but no tricks ... this is a gentleman's game."

I made it the other way 'round."
" Goodbye, 'Spade' ... It is a long, long trail ..."
" Goodbye, Mike ... you been a good pardner ..."
" Here ... that ought to last ya."
" I'll wait here for 'Spade'."
" Goodbye, you ole son-of-a-gun ..."

" Mike and 'Spade' ain't far apart by now."
" Take care of him ... we'll follow the others."
" I'll fool 'em ... I won't die with my boots on."
" Hold everythin', gentlemen ..
I want to ask you one last riddle
... positively the last ..."
" Where was Moses when the LIGHT WENT OUT ? "
" Do you think Mike and 'Sade' are all right? "
" And what am I supposed to do ... run like a whipped cur? "
" Guess maybe Mike and
'Spade' are callin' me ..."
" Don't ever be afraid o' notin', Missy ... because the three of us will be watchin' over you ... "
" I've been waitin' for you, Hunter ... an' now ..."
