My beloved Paris!

I am looking for love, mademoiselle.
A deputy
I was just saying to madame... that the government has agreed to your appointment.
Here's to a cheerful Paris!
To a sated Paris!
To a carefree Paris!
A reporter
People of Paris!
The French army... has been defeated!
Defeated!
To Paris!

How about my appointment?
Paris is under siege
Cheerful...
Carefree...
Sated Paris.
The National Guard of workers defends the city
If Paris falls, the workers' Guard will be destroyed!
We need guns to make sure Paris doesn't fall!
For the guns!
In the workers' quarter
When Paris falls it won't be the bourgeoisie who will pay for the war... but the working class.
The soldier
He has been begging.
Take those boots off!
As long as you don't surrender there won't be any peace!
I don't need your bread! I'm off.
Where will you go without your boots?
There are placards saying they have capitulated!
They have capitulated! The Prussians are taking away the workers' guns!
The Prussians and the bourgeoisie... are pointing the workers' guns on the workers!
Let's take the guns to our quarters!
Why aren't you coming?
What do I care about your guns?
I don't want to fight anymore!
I want to return to my village!
The morning of March 18th the workers' Guard defends their guns preparations for the operetta's premier preparations
We are all looking for love
All we need is the horses and we're done!
Faster!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing?
Leave me in peace.
It's tough enough when you're hungry all day.
Look at these men!
Look how beautiful they are!
If only I were younger...
Who are you serving?
Finally!
There's no more milk!
Please, take our guns away!
Saddle the horses!
Take your guns and shoot us!
Shoot us!
The people won't let itself be disarmed!
Shoot that rabble!
What a disgrace, the operetta is a failure!
To the town hall!
To Versailles! We'll start from there!
To the town hall!
Soldiers! After Versailles you will be allowed to go home!
Why don't you appeal to the soldiers?
To the town hall!
To Versailles.
Jean, please don't go!
Don't go, Jean!
Paris as it has been for hundreds of years this Paris is no more
Why we enjoy our work more?
We work for ourselves and not for the owners.
As decided by the Commune!
We don't work nights anymore.
As decided by the Commune!
Our children aren't cannon fodder for the rich anymore.
As decided by the Commune!
We aren't evicted from our homes anymore.
As decided by the Commune!
As decided by our Commune!
We have plenty of time.
We can solve everything.
Paris lacks money, weapons and ammunition.
Can't we just seize shops and banks?
No, we won't threaten anyone who isn't threatening us.
In Versailles
Why are you sad?
Who did you leave behind?
Soldiers!
Thieves, prostitutes and murderers have taken over Paris!
I left my girl behind.
She won't survive over there.
They take away your land and divide it.
No violence.
We will solve everything peacefully.
Friends! Let us sing the hymn of a free France:
The Marseillaise!
Arise, children of the fatherland
The day of glory has arrived
Against us, tyranny
Let blood flow!
To Paris!
The 49th day of battle
The Commune has been surrounded and cut off.
The enemy has broken through!
This sitting is over.
Over?
The new Babylon the bourgeoisie looks on from a hill at Versailles
Let their blood flow in Paris!
French!
You're lying.
We are not French!
We are communards!
Your deputies are done for.
You want Paris?
The old Paris?
Never!
The new Babylon
Be the boss?
Never!
Sale!
Peace and order is restored in Paris peace and order long live the Commune peace and order
Our army has brought peace and order!
I'm completely wet because of that rabble!
Mademoiselle!
And so you wanted to be the boss?
I'll show you who's boss.
I'll show you.
May tainted blood water our fields
Where did they take the prisoners?
The French soldier is tall and strong!
He once conquered half the world.
He will conquer the whole world.
Where did they bring the prisoners?
He will conquer the whole world.
It's prohibited to beg in caf√©s.
The trial
Next!
Death!
Death!
Admit, you prostitute... that you led a wild life during the Commune.
Take this shovel and dig a grave!
Death!
Mama!
They shoot us as if we were arsons...
Prostitutes...
Murderers...

We, the communards!

September, 12. I killed a crow.
The weather is nice.
Niki.
You've missed your aim, Ivan.
There exist gases that amuse a human soul.
Where is the enemy?
- Everything rushed and buzzed along Ukrainian paths.
Give back, foe, our Ukrainian boots!
- For three hundred years I was tortured by the damned Katsap.
Is it about me?
Arrived at the post, at "Volynskyi".
- I can't go further, comrades. Here is a slope.
The breaks broke.
You drive? - No.
You drive? - No.
You drive?
- Calm down, lads, we'll fix the breaks by ourselves.
- By the name of the Ukrainian
People's Republic, lay down the weapons!
By the name of the Ukrainian nation?
Who said that?
How to steer the train?
Move, Havrylo!
Hey, move, Havrylo!
Hey, move, move up, Havrylo!

I will become an engine operator.
Who?

Do you know who Bohdan Khmelnytskyi was?
One of the Khokhol's generals.
Soldiers! The Central Council calls upon you!
- I wonder, can we kill bourgeois and officers on a street if we meet them?
And you are Ukrainian?
Yes, a worker.
Yes, a worker.
- We have the congress here as good people do
- the first Pan-Ukrainian one.
- This is that Ukrainian presidium, which the teacher told us about.
- The representative of the Bolsheviks is taking the floor.
- We, workers, we support Ukraine too, but we demand factories, land...
The Soviet power!
Let us see how you will commit the self-justice over unarmed representatives of workers and peasants!
- Well, good, you say that the power is Ukrainian, than whom land belongs?
And land belongs to lords or peasants?
- The floor is taken by general ataman Symon Petliura.
- Gentlemen, we have received the greeting from the Black Sea Fleet.
Do not lie to our brothers and sons, because they'll see soon your reality and you will be cursed by all Ukraine's sons.
Do not rely on the Black Sea Fleet, because we will be the first ones who will aim twenty-inch guns at you.
Gentlemen, this is mistake...
I'm voting, gentlemen.
Who is for to considerthis a mistake?
Who is against?
Dreadnought Maria!
Three apostles!
Donbas! Poltava!
Bohunians!
Taraschanians!
Arsenal was listening.
Strike.
The proletariat is cancelling trains.
Arsenal.
Well, lads, let us start working!
Come on!
It seems they are shooting already.
I bow low...
I bow down to the raw earth for you...
And what is the address?
Whom should the letter be addressed to?
He bowed down to the raw earth for you...
And asked everybody of you whether one can kill bourgeoises and officers outdoors if one meets them.
Yes you can!
Bakhmach and Nizhyn are flooded with blood.
Hey you, my brothers, comrades in arms...
Served for four years and was in four wars...
And one year as a civil, brothers...
Petliura wounded me by a bullet, and I feel my heroic death.
Bury me at home for a half an hour.
I have not seen it for nine years.
Hurry up, brothers, Arsenal is dying.
Hey, you, our battle horses!
Hurry up to bury our friend...
The dead fighter of the revolution!
We hear...
We hear, our masters!
We are rushing on our 24 legs!
- Take, mother, we have no time to explain.
Our life and death are revolutionary.
Armoured vehicle "Vilna Ukraina"
("Free Ukraine").
You toppled over our "Free Ukraine".
- Stand with your face to the wall so I could kill you in your back.
Can you if I look into your eyes?
And why can I?
Seventy second hour.
What weather will we have tomorrow?
We stopped...
I think that tomorrow we will be done.
We stopped...
We moved and then stopped.
Shells!
Where is the father?
Where is the husband?
Where is the son?
- Where is metalworker?
- We do not have one.
- Where is the smith?
- We do not have one.

A Ukrainian worker. Shoot at me!
