The End

RUSClCO Company presents a new project: the first in the national history film in a fantasy genre by Yakov Protazanov, "Aelita" , based upon Alexei Tolstoy's novel of the same name.
The film is released with frame-by-frame cleaning of the picture and in a new musical arrangement using the works of composers
Alexander Skryabin,
Igor Stravinsky and Alexander Glazunov.
On December 4, 1921 , at 18:27 European Standard Time, all the radio stations on Earth received a strange message.
Anta... Odeli... Uta...
Anta... Odeli... Uta...
Anta... Odeli... Uta... ln charge of the Moscow radio station was engineer Los (N.M. Tseretelli).
Pass it immediately to the bureau of deciphering.
At the evacuation center of the Kursky
Railway Station.
Among the employees of the center was Natasha, engineer Los' wife.
Red Army soldier Gusev (l.P. Batalov) arrived from the front for recuperation.
The deciphering bureau failed to make out the mysterious radio.
- Couldn't it be a radio from Mars to our inventors?
Los' close friend and colleague - engineer Spiridonov (N.M. Tseretelli)
Anything's possible! Perhaps they on Mars got worried about you and me!..
Come here, happy newlywed.
Your wife is calling again. l can leave earlier today.
Come and meet me.
Anta... Odeli... Uta... 18-27
All Los' brain power and energy have been devoted to one task - to the trip to Mars, and in his imagination he often pictured...
Aelita the Queen
(Yu.l. Solntseva). lkhoshka, Aelita's favorite servant
(A.F. Peregonets ).
Tuskub the Ruler (K.V. Eggert).
Gor, keeper of the planet's energy
(Yu.A. Zavadsky).
A model of the apparatus built by Gor for observing the life on other planets. lt's a great discovery, but let it remain a secret... for everybody!..
Show me other worlds...
No one will know about it.
All right... ln the evening l'll meet you at the tower of radiant energy... ln the evening
Only to you l'll show the life on a neighboring planet.
Time to go back.
Tuskub may come and see us.
Touch my lips with yours, like humans do... on Earth.
Spiridonov spent all evenings at his friend's place, working with him on building a spaceship to fly to Mars. lf only we could find the source of energy that would overcome
Earth's gravity!..
From the first day Gusev had become the infirmary's favorite.
Nurse Masha (V.G. Orlova)
"Love me or not, honey!.."
" A soldier got no money!.." ln 1921 the railways had no lack of passengers.
Comrade Erlikh and his wife, Yelena
We don't provide quarters.
Go to the women's section.
You're so...
Get out of here!
What the cheek!
Victor, l have the address of an old acquaintance... Let's give it a try!..
That day they were distributing food rations at the evacuation center. l'm not angry... about the past,
Yelena. lntroduce me to him as your brother.
White bread...
Victor Karlovich Erlikh
Who's that character writing to you?
You're so charming that l cannot believe you would be so cruel to me...
You're jealous, aren't you?
The food Erlikh brought made it possible to have a feast that was rare for Moscow, and remember "the beautiful past" .
What the hell! lt's sour, this wine! l remember the wine we had before...
Oh!.. Before, all human relationships were so sensitive, delicate...
Yes... Before we had order...
The days went on... Los stubbornly continued his experiments.
After each failed experiment,
Los went on dreaming...
Anta, Odeli, Uta
Excuse me!.. l'm the Chairman of the House Committee, l do my duty.
You'll have to vacate your laboratory for a new tenant.
You know, we have met before.
Do you remember?..
This is Erlikh, our new tenant.
At the evacuation center, an active preparation for a show was going on.
Join us... We're having such fun!
Yelena was successfully carrying out her husband's instructions.
On the day of the show, Natasha received a food ration at the club.
As a Soviet functionary,
Erlikh was doing fine.
To Mr. Pavlov - one sack of sugar. l've brought sugar... We must hide it!
Hurry!.. l told you we could pluck that goose.
The evacuation center's people decided to outdo the academic theatres.
Comrade Gusev is our chief assistant director.
The chocolate is real! l have to go home. l got a lot of work.
At the distribution center, an unpleasant discovery was made.
The center's manager went for help to the Chief of the Criminal lnvestigation. lnvestigate it and, if necessary, search Erlikh's apartment. l've got talent. By God, l've got it... l'll prove to you!
Citizen Kravtsov, l repeat it again: l'm not hiring you. l believe you're incompetent.
For the lndian ink, it was necessary to go to Spiridonov.
Got tired, comrade?... l sympathize. l sympathize with you very much. l know everything... l found it in your coat's pocket...
You're lying. You're lying all the time!..
The night seemed agonizingly long after that first quarrel.
Would you like to go to a ball and have fun in spite of all the comrades?
To engineer M.S. Los.
The administration of Volkhovstroi thanks you for almost a year-long work...
Will you go?
Kravtsov decided to investigate on his own the case of the lost sugar.
The meeting place of "businessmen" ...
All tickets are sold out.
You'll make good money!
What a miser! ln a whole week, just one medallion!..
Each reminder of the mysterious radio made his fantasy work with a new force.
For many days now Aelita could not see Earth and...
Today is the meeting of the elders.
No one will know if you go to the tower.
How dare you hide from me the apparatus built by Gor?!
You're a queen, but we're the rulers.
The tower will remain closed.
So, by the decision of the elders, a third of the living workforce is put into cold storage for keeping.
All the workers - the population toiling for the " elders" , never left their dungeons.
The first third to the cold storage!
The first third!
Are you avoiding me, Aelita?..
Your thoughts are occupied with an Earthman..
Wait for me here. l'll come out to you.
Martians were not alien to a feeling of jealousy...
You're in love with an Earthman.
You will never see him! l'm leaving with you all the designs of my "interplanetonef" .
Save them. This is the work of my life.
Are you going alone?
How about Natasha?!
Natasha was impatiently waiting for her husband...
Let's go to the ball. There'll be a most select society there. l'm sure your husband won't mind.
Let's go!.. To spite him!..
Let's have fun!
Anta, Odeli, Uta lllegal ball of the " select society" .
The ball's organizers talked Natasha into having supper with them. l thought you were at the station seeing off your husband going on a trip.
My ravishing, my dear.
Stay at least for half an hour.
Well, a quarter of an hour. l have to leave today. l regret l couldn't say goodbye to you. l may be on this business trip for a long time. Yours, L.
The only joy for Los was the realization that he, too, could take part in the great work of building the new Russia.
Slowly, yet inevitably, life was taking its normal course, and there was less and less work at the evacuation center...
Allow me to go and see off this torturer...
Moscow. March 3, 1922. lt's been over 2 months since your departure, and in this time you've sent me only 3 postcards. lf it's the end...
Krasnopresnensky District
SOVlET
MARRlAGE
REGlSTRY OFFlCE
With the evacuation center closed,
Natasha went to work in a kindergarten.
Los' business trip was coming to an end.
To engineer M.S. Los.
The administration of "VOLKHOVSTROl" thanks you for your 6-month work.
Dear friend! lt's been 2 months now since l left Russia... for good. l feel ashamed to admit it, but the ways and habits of the past proved stronger than me... l hid your designs in the fireplace in your room, where...
And the dream took hold of him again. ln his dreams Los disguises himself as Spiridonov. lt's strange... He hasn't showed up for two months, and today he appears as though he fell from another planet.
The new crime was promising new laurels for Kravtsov.
A suspicious character.
We must found out who he is.
At one of the out-of-the-way outskirts of Moscow.
Kravtsov at his work.
Don't touch it! By this glove l'll find the criminal.
The absence of foreign and home fronts, as well as the enforced inaction, burdened Gusev. l can't do nothing! l've established four republics, and now l'm going sour here...
Hot on the trail. l'm arresting you on a charge of...
Do you have a warrant?!
About the flight... l'll go with my great pleasure!...
Think it over, comrade. lt's a lot of risk and very little profit...
The heights l'm reaching! l'm flying to Mars tomorrow!
On the eve of the flight, the last workers were let to go home.
Next morning Moscow was celebrating one of the great Revolution days.
Where a good detective cannot ride, he will walk.
Five minutes before the flight.
- We're flying! We're flying!
Engineer Spiridonov, you're under arrest for unauthorized return to the RSFSR and murder of engineer Los' wife.
Some Pinkerton! Couldn't tell a false beard and a wig. ln that case... Engineer Los, you're under arrest for... living under someone else's disguise.
This projectile is coming from Earth!
The observatory will fix the time and place of the projectile's fall.
The aliens from Earth must be destroyed.
You must not do harm to the aliens from Earth.
They'll be destroyed! We won't let the plague of earth mutiny onto Mars! l know the time and place of the projectile's fall.
The " elders" did not leave, waiting for the Observatory's report.
Hurry to meet the guests from
Earth and bring them to me.
The moment indicated by Chief
Astronomer was nearing.
Comrades, are you from the militia?..
A man here must be arrested.
May l introduce myself? Commander
Gusev from the Budyonny Cavalry.
Tuskub! Tuskub!
This is an Earthman!
Comrade Tuskubov, allow me, by my mandate, to arrest the criminal Los who arrived on your territory.
Touch my lips with yours, like you do it on Earth...
Do you recognize this necklace,
Tuskub?!
"Love me or not, honey!.."
" A soldier got no money!"
You're mine! We'll be ruling over everybody here together!
Never! Never will l forgive myself for raising my hand against you!
Aelita, on the " elders'" orders, this Earthman is under arrest.
The free speech of free men has won over the " elders'" thousand-year hypnosis.
Comrades! Only you can help yourselves!
We had the same situation.
Everything began with...
October 25, 191 7
...following our example, comrades, form one working family of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics of Mars. l'm with you! l will lead you! l don't believe her... lt's not for the masters to make revolutions!
You've got power.
Lay down your arms, you will never need them again on Mars.
Victory! The troops are on our side!
Open fire on the insurgents!
Drive them back to the dungeons! l alone will reign and rule now!..

Buy tires by
ANTA... ODELl... UTA!!
We're exposing the mysterious radio - it's our tires trademark.
We're going to the Far East Front.
Our train will be in an hour.
And l've been dreaming again...
Half an hour ago l killed my wife...
But l'm not running away, no... l'll go back to her...
We can't leave the man like that.
He may need help! l was insane when l was shooting at you... l'll be thanking providence all my life for having missed.
Do you still have any doubts?..
No, l believe you... Forgive me.
By the order of a court investigator, you're under arrest.
Enough of dreaming. A different, real work is awaiting all of us!

{4413}{4578}The town in the past...
{4728}{4807}Every evening, the high notables|of the small town
{4810}{4887}met at the Golden Unicorn|for the twilight cup...
{4945}{5018}His Ponderousness|the Mayor...
{5153}{5223}His Reverence|the Pastor...
{5386}{5461}His Erudition|the Doctor...
{5689}{5762}His Measuredness|the Notary...
{6071}{6163}... and the new teacher...
{6306}{6420}In other days, the ancient candlesticks|heard every evening the most|important news of the town...
{6423}{6502}But since some time,|the esteemed notables|had but a single topic:
{6505}{6559}the stranger,|and ever again the stranger...
{6674}{6742}One day, a stranger|asked the gravedigger|for the way to the town.
{6745}{6789}To the latter,|he looked strangely known,
{6792}{6836}though he had never|seen him in person...
{7842}{7925}"Who owns the land|beside the cemetery?"
{8003}{8116}"The Municipality has destined it|to the enlargement of the graveyard..."
{8658}{8728}"I hardly believe that|the Municipality is willing to|give away the cemetery land...
{8731}{8783}But, why the devil are you|interested exactly in that one -?"
{8871}{8982}"I'm a much tired wanderer...|I wish to make me a garden here..."
{9027}{9112}"Next to the graveyard - ?!"
{9155}{9264}The stranger's request|gave rise to a fierce debate|among the counselors;
{9267}{9339}but the gold he offered|was highly appealing...
{9976}{10041}The stranger's proposal|was approved unanimously,
{10044}{10125}and he was granted|the graveyard land|for ninety nine years...
{10210}{10269}But the joy of the conceited town-dwellers|was not unclouded;
{10272}{10345}because the stranger had built,|between his mysterious being|and the others,
{10348}{10398}an evenly unclimbable wall|all around his estate...
{10628}{10678}"You can see by yourselves, Sirs!
{10681}{10773}I've run all around the wall,|and found neither door nor gate - !"
{11521}{11551}"Stop your efforts, men!
{11554}{11604}I alone know the door|that opens this wall!"
{12056}{12139}"And nobody has yet found|a door in that weird wall - ?"
{12145}{12201}Second Verse.
{14263}{14314}"It's a good old custom|of the Golden Unicorn,

The reconstruction was carried out in 2002/2003 by Luciano Berriatúa and Camille Blot-Wellens on behalf of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-
Murnau-Stiftung in Wiesbaden.
The basis was a camera negative and a dupe negative from the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, Berlin.
Most of the intertitles were obtained from the flash titles on the original negative.
The missing intertitles were restored by referring to the shooting script.
The newly appended titles are recognisable by way of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-
Murnau-Stiftung (FWMS) logo.
The reconstruction of the hues was made possible by tinting the negatives.
Laboratory work:
L'Immagine Ritrovata, Bologna
In 2008, an export copy was discovered in the Cineteca Nacional de Chile in Santiago.
In 2013, the tinting was revised and inconsistencies in the reconstruction rectified, for the 2K digital version.

FIRST ACT.
What were you just thinking about,
Lorenz?
About my former life...!
Write the story of your life in this book, which Father himself bound for you!
Do you think the memory will be less agonising then?
I, former convict Lorenz Lubota, hereby write down,
as my dear wife Marie wills it so, the story of my guilt and my atonement.
Melanie doesn't have any time for this - does she?!
Call Lorenz!
Always you with your books, Lorenz!
With the amount of money you earn even God doesn't know how you could be able to afford them!
Just let me have my poor books, Mother.
At the very least they provide one with dreams of all the things one will never experience...
Isn't it time for you to get to art-school,
Hugo?
I'll be coming home a bit later today.
I want to help Aunt Schwabe with some accounts.
I don't want you to have anything to do with her - with that... usurious witch!!
She's gotten fat and rich off her cutthroat business!
And I, I've slaved away my whole life like a horse...
The neighbours.
Lorenz should be getting here soon, at this point.
It seems to me, my child, that you divide your day up into Lorenz's comings and goings!
Does Lorenz know that?!
...hold onto your heart, Marie!
Once Lorenz wakes up from his dream world...
Here are a few poems I've done,
Father Starke...
I'd like to hear what you think of them...
Well well, now you of all people are wishing to tread among the poets - ?!
Please, don't hold me up!!
I have to go to work!
What kind of work is it that you do anyway - ?!
Where did you get those silky rags?!
Where have you been running around night after night - ?!
Get a grip on yourself, Mother!
You're rid of me now - !
I have no desire to wither away and rot in this miserable hole!
I can stand on my own two feet!
I don't need anybody's help!
Misery, hunger, poverty - everything's coming down on me!
And now disgrace too!
Can't Lorenz Lubota ever get to work on time?!
The good Lord in a fit of wrath made Lorenz Lubota town clerk!
Well - take care, Mother!
Melanie... where you're headed... there's no way back...
What do you want here?
Why are you running after our dear girl?
END OF THE FIRST ACT.
SECOND ACT.
So, I'm telling you, Marie... This Lorenz, who would have thought of it!
This is more than talent - this is genius!
Mist- Mister Lubota!
Professor, old Starke doesn't just throw his support behind anyone, but Lorenz Lubota - that's a genius!
Are you the one, Muse, /
Who takes me in her service, /
And like the Sphinx /
Tears with her claws from my breast /
My song?
Lorenz!!! Are you ill?!!
Have you already found out - ?
From your sister - ?
How ugly... how terribly ugly it all is - !
I want to go get a little fresh air... maybe - that will put me more at ease...
You, sir - man - lad, do you know you're a genius?!
I gave your poems to a man who would consider it an honour to be your mentor.
One fine day, at the hall where you were once a lowly clerk, you'll be made an honorary citizen of our town!
Do you really think... that I'm a poet...?
That I could be a great and eminent man - ?!
I think that now the boy realises he's a poet, he's losing his head!
What's the name of the daughter in this house here?
I can't give you anything more, child...
I've got nothing myself...!
Either the money - or the pawn-ticket!
Rules are rules in this world!
This must be your first experience with Schwabe... as you think you can persuade the old bird by pleading?!
You know Mr Wigottschinsky,
Lorenz - don't you?
Pretend I'm not here; act like you would in your own home!
I gave a number of poems that I composed in my spare time to an excellent judge of literature - a certain Mr. Starke, to read...
Now he wants to introduce me to a well-known publisher who's supposed to print my poems...
My boy, you might very well become quite the famous man.
How can an old hand such as you be so far off the mark in your judgment!
The poems are nice enough... but they are certainly not, and never will be, publishable material - !
Now I don't dare go to the publisher... with my shabby suit...
Considering your impending fame, you do look pretty shabby...
We'll just have to help fix that for you...
The old dame seems to have taken a fancy to you.
It's usually hard to pull one over on her!
I think I'll accompany our poet to look for some new clothes.
I'm something of an expert there!
Will you come back again?
This so-called professor claims Lorenz's poems have no merit.
Yes, but... what will Lorenz say about that?
No, no - my good fellow - we must drink to the beginning of this promising literary career!
Where on earth is Lorenz?!
...and why on earth isn't Melanie here yet?
First off, champagne - !
Even if all the money gets burnt through - the old lady has more in the cashbox, - right?
Cheers, poet!
I'll look at whomever I please!
You've made a conquest, Lubota!
He's my brother - !!!
Have you heard, - old Harlan wants to have his daughter
Veronika engaged to rich Wiedenberg!
Is that true what you've just said, - about Veronika Harlan's engagement?
END OF THE SECOND ACT.
THIRD ACT.
Say there, little one - your brother Lorenz - he's tight with old Schwabe, isn't he?!
My brother Lorenz is the most upright man in the world - and the only one my Aunt Schwabe doesn't consider a scoundrel!
We would like to enquire as to why the town clerk Lubota has been away from work without an excused absence!
My son is sickly...
We have received complaints against the 'sickly' Mr Lubota, who's been carousing in bars and making a scandalous scene in front of the Harlan residence!
According to the coachman you're supposed to have followed
Miss Veronika once already -
You used to be town clerk, Mr. Lubota?
Do you have any idea, Father, where Lorenz is today - ?
I'm in no hurry to tell him what failures his poems are!
Now for God's sake, Lorenz, what's going on with Harlan - ?
Mother - last night -
- the whole world fell apart around me - !!
If you love me, Mother, don't ask!
I have no time to lose!
I have to get to the Harlans - !
If I only knew how I could get your brother to pull the wool over the old dame's eyes!
I've told you once already!
Leave my brother out of it!
He's above all of this!
Madame... is it true... that you wish your daughter to be engaged to Mr Wiedenberg?
I know I have no say in this matter!
Nevertheless - for God's sake... have pity! Give me an answer!
Call my husband in!
Madame... I saw your daughter only once...
But I can't go on any longer - without the hope of someday acquiring her for myself!
Don't consider me a fool, Madame!
This love overtook me like fate!
To give up on it would be like - giving up on God!
Don't you want to tell me what's on your mind, Mother Lubota?...
Is Lorenz ill?
I don't know what's happened to him!
He's no longer my Lorenz at all!
He's a stranger that I don't know - who doesn't know me!
How can one have doubts about Lorenz, even for a minute, Mother!
I take my leave, Mr. Harlan, without the assurance that you will support my courting your daughter...
It would be an honour, Mr Lubota, after some time, let's say a year from now - to discuss this matter further...
To the best tavern in the city!
Forgive me... please... an almost unbelievable resemblance...
You may stay... if you like!
We were just on our way in any case!
Champagne - !
I'd like to drink some champagne!
Tell me, Marie, do you think it's possible... that Lorenz could go astray?
No, Father!
What I meant to say... Lorenz Lubota is developing his poetic genius.
He only moves in the best circles now!
What that boy could become - if only he had some money - !
He'd only need some money... just some money!
Don't - ! Don't - ! Don't you too run - from me! Not you too - !
Who are you - ?
I am - a town clerk down on his luck!
Don't tell this joke in front of my mother, or she'll throw you out - !
Tell me who you are!
I... am a poet... a man with no luck... chasing after a shadow... a phantom!
I want to know... what drove you to me, like a sleepwalker...
I want to know who you think you're kissing... when you're kissing me!?
END OF THE THIRD ACT.
FOURTH ACT.
My daughter and I are, unfortunately, destitute...
You understand me, don't you?
Melitta let slip that you're a well-known poet...
I hope your income corresponds to your fame!
You're right... one has to pay...
There is a price for everything!
My son isn't home...
Mr Lubota doesn't need to bother coming to the town hall -
He's free of that concern!
Love at first sight, brother-in-law! - you know how it is!
Children, if we stuck together and had the right threads - we'd make for setting up a splendid business!
I... I... need money!
My dear child, I don't concern myself with your love affairs; be so good as not to interfere with my business affairs!
The only person we can tap is old Schwabe, that's for sure! -
What if Lorenz put the royalties on his poetry up as collateral - ?!
Well, my boy, if you pass yourself off as a poet, you have to pay the consequences - or else do without the support of a gullible aunt.
The shakedown.
Only you can help me, Aunt Schwabe!
The world is closed to those who come with empty hands!
People are scoundrels, Lorenz... each and every one of them!
I only trust one... That's you!
This boy here, - he wouldn't get a penny from me!
But you... you shall have the money!
I can't stand this - !!!
I don't want this - !!
I'm no scoundrel - !!
Then blow the lid off the whole swindle and remain a nothing and a starveling your entire life - !
And - her?
From Miss Anna Schwabe
60,000 marks are certified to be paid -
The practical application...
I'd like to speak with Lorenz!
You've come to the wrong place!
For days now I've had no idea where Lorenz is at.
Now let's go shopping!
A hundred thousand things to buy - !
You don't seem well...
I thought Lorenz took better care of you.
To Mr Lorenz Lubota,
It is a fact that you have been away from work without an excused absence,
but you have frequented and behaved scandalously in a questionable tavern
and, further, you have harassed highly esteemed citizens of the town.
- Moreover your unqualified behaviour toward civil-servant Hermann Schaat
is considered a serious offence against a public administrator.
As such, you are dismissed from this day forward, without claim to further wages.
What do you really want - ?!
Why are you snooping around on me?
You've never once shown any concern for me - why today all of a sudden?!
What do I want here - ?
I loaned Lorenz 60,000 marks - and now I'd like to know what he's using it for.
My Lorenz is an honest man - !
What my Lorenz does, he can answer for - !
Bear that in mind - and leave me be!
I want to know where I stand!
I'll be making enquiries... in any case you can tell Lorenz that I expect him at my place today!
I'd like to buy this piece for my mother!
The founding of the Wigottschinsky-Lubota firm calls for a celebration!
I brought something for you, Mother!
Did you buy that with the money from your Aunt Schwabe - ?!
She was here... she was asking about you... you have to go see her today...
Why did you want to talk to me, Aunt?
Lorenz, you are the biggest scoundrel that I've ever come across in my entire life!
I've made some enquiries...
I now know where I stand with you!
I demand back the money you swindled me out of!
...and if you don't have the money anymore, as you claim - where did you blow it?
I owe you no explanation of how and where I spend my money.
Your money? -
You dare talk about your money? -
What's come over you, you - ?
Have you been suddenly taken over by the devil?!
Either you give me back the money - or I'll have no qualms about handing you and your fine friend over to the police!
I'll give you three days to clear the matter up completely; not an hour longer.
If you haven't done it by then,
I'm turning you over to the police!
END OF THE FOURTH ACT.
FIFTH ACT.
She's given everything away... she's been to see Mother...
When she thinks her money's in danger, the old beast knows no pity!
She'll break your neck without mercy!
You'll just have to pull the wool over her eyes a second time, - and if you have to - with force!
I'd rather stand in the square and admit my mistakes in front of everyone and do penance!
Do you think that will get the money back?
I'll pay the money back!
I'll pay back every last penny!
From what? From your income as a discharged clerk - or from the royalties from your poetry?
I can't break free from her! -
I can 't break free from her!
Don't you see
I'm on the brink of madness - ?
Then help me!
Why aren't you helping me - ?
If I could help you... if I could save you... then I wouldn't love you anymore...
The topsy-turvy day...
The grey day...
Mother is very ill...
I have to run to the drugstore quick!
Mother... Mother!
I've come to you.. Help me!
There outside... it's my son!
Your mother is very ill, Lorenz...
We have to keep her away from any excitement!
I'm giving you three days' time... not an hour longer!!
Marie... I have to ask you something...
Marie... what would you say... if someone told you... that I've turned into a scoundrel...?
I would laugh at him, Lorenz!
But if he were right, Marie?
The final attempt...
I have to talk with you, Aunt...
Aunt... I beg you... have mercy...
I can't give you back the money now...
And I can't tell you where it went!
Then the police will have to concern themselves with this matter.
You can ask the gentleman who discovered your talent to post bail for you... or you can sign your future royalties over to me...
But none of that's at all true!
It's all lies!
Nobody would even give me 50 marks for my ten measly poems!
Yes!! I lied to you!
But I don't want to lie anymore - no more!
You would have been better off if you kept lying, you fool!
Then maybe I would have deferred your debt!
But now - To what end - !?
I can well imagine what kind of slut you threw my good money at, but I'll have the police as much on that woman's throat as they are on yours!
Where is Lorenz?
I don't know, Mother... he'll be back soon!
Now you have no other choice!
When the whole affair comes to light, you'll go to jail and it'll be the death of your mother - !
Agreed, then... tomorrow night...
END OF THE FIFTH ACT.
SIXTH ACT.
The black day...
Do you have the money?!
I don't want to hear anything about business right now; right now I want to have a nice dinner with you.
Cheers, old lady, live it up!
Who's making so much noise going back and forth?
Won't you go to sleep, Lorenz, it's 2 o'clock!
We're lost...
Both of us are lost... gone to ruin!
Can you tell me where this addressee lives?
The house number isn't clear.
Damn it! The old lady's night bell!
Don't! - Don't! -
Don't! -
You don't need to handcuff me...
I'll go with you willingly.
Don't ask any questions; be good to mother! Farewell!
Atonement...
...and redemption.
We've been waiting, Lorenz, to bring you home!
Look, Lorenz - your new homestead!
But I have the consolation
that my good mother died in the firm belief that I was a sick man.
A letter from your sister, Lorenz!
Life toyed with me like life toys with a rudderless boat.
Now I've reached dry land, far away.
Think of me with love, as I think of you.
Did Father's book fulfill its duty?
Yes, Marie! -
Die Nibelungen
Die Nibelungen
Dedicated to the German People
Siegfried
Canto I
How Siegfried slayed the dragon
Thus spoke Mime, the artful blacksmith: "Siegfried, son of King Siegmund, ride home to Xanten. Even I cannot teach you any more!"
Have you never before heard of the king's castle at Worms on the Rhine and the kings of Burgundy who reign there?
I shall go there to win Kriemhild!
Show me the way to Worms or you will lose your life!
Farewell, Siegfried, son of king Siegmund. You will never get to Worms!
Young Siegfried understood the bird's song:
If the dragon slayer would bathe in the dragon's blood, his body would become invincible, forever safe against sword and spear!
Here ends the First Canto
Canto II
Now Volker, the bard, sang of Siegfried in front of Kriemhild, and how Siegfried came to Worms.
The violin sounded and Volker sang:
The dragon slayer, the son of Siegmund entered the realm of the Nibelungen.
He won the fight against the dragon.
There is no one on earth like him.
Thus spoke Alberich, the Nibelung: Spare my life and I will give you the wonder cap. Whoever wears it becomes unseen or may take whatever form he chooses!
Spare my life, O hero, and I will make you the richest king on earth!
The crown of the King of the Northland, the ruler of the Ice Giants is being wrought here by the Nibelungen.
No sword on earth compares with Balmung. The Nibelungen forged it in fire of blood.
All is lost. Cursed be the heritage of the heir!  Return with me to stone all ye whom from stone were wrought.
The violin sounded and Volker sang:
Siegfried became the dragon slayer
The lord of the Nibelungen Treasure.
Twelve kingdoms subdued the powerful. Twelve kings became his vassals.
Kriemhild, the daughter of Ute: "Volker, take this cloak, as reward for your song! I embroidered it myself.
Siegfried, son of King Sigmund, is outside the castle door with twelve of his knights, and asks for an audience with King Gunther.
Thus spake Hagen Tronje:  King Gunther, let the dragon slayer go his ways, don't welcome him here!
No one shall say that at Worms one does not know the way kings greet each other! Siegfried, son of King Siegmund, has my welcome!
I dreamt last night an awful dream...
And now this dream comes to my mind!
I come, King Gunther, to ask for your sister Kriemhild's hand.
King Gunther, too, has marriage plans. He has set his heart on a bold and mighty maiden.
Her name is Brunhilde and she is Queen of Iceland. Ringed by fire, her invincible castle towers in the Northland.
Why must you speak of Brunhilde?  You know she has set dangerous conditions: Thrice must the suitor best her in feats of strength or die!
Siegfried, the unique hero, has come to Worms at an opportune moment.  He may help us win Brunhilde for you!
Twelve kings have I for vassals.  But vassal am I to no man, now or ever!
Prepare for the quest to get your bride, King Gunther. It is Siegfried the mighty hero who will win Brunhilde for you. 
Here ends the Second Canto.
Canto III
How Siegfried won Brunhilde for Gunther
The dragon ship is carrying foreign heroes to your shores!
The foreigners are nearing the flaming sea.
If he be strong enough and favored by the gods, the flames will consume themselves and die.
My maidens, help me put on my armor, this will be a a fight I've never fought before!
Welcome, hero, for the fight for life or death!
Neither life nor death do I desire from you, Brunhilde.  It is King Gunther who woos you!
Before it is evening, King Gunther, your smothered weapons will adorn my hall.
Give me leave, King Gunther, to make ready your ship for your royal bride. We should set sail for home before sundown!
Let the triple battle begin, King Gunther!
You have to defeat me three times, o king: with the stone, the spring, and the spear.
Fear not, o king! Make you the motions and my strength will win each contest. I'll throw the stone for you and carry you in the jump.
Here ends the Third Canto
Canto IV
How Brunhilde enters Worms and how the kings celebrated their wedding.
Start the prepartions for marriage! The king's ship is arriving!
We have reached our destination, my queen!
Are you really the man who defeated me threefold?
I am your captive, but I shall never be your wife!
Keep your word, King Gunther, as I have kept mine!
If Kriemhild gives her consent, o hero, we shall celebrate a double wedding here today.
Since when is it customary among Burgundians to give the King's daughter in marriage to a vassal?
Siegfried is no vassal. I love him as though he were my brother.  We shall become blood brothers today!
Blood is mingling with red blood, the drops fuse inseparably.  Whoever forsakes loyalty to the bloodbrother will perish at the wayside, all honor is lost!
Brunhilde has been defeated, not cowed.  Shall the king of Burgundy be scorned by an obstinate woman?
Damned be the deed half done!  Will you forsake your friend who gave you his own sister?
The magic cap will change you into what you wish.  Take Gunther's form and break Brunhilde's iron will.
Here ends the Fourth Canto
Canto V
How, after half a year, Siegfried's gift to his bride, the Nibelungen Treasure, arrives in Worms and how the two queens quarrel with each other.
O king, Burgundy's glory is waning, we need the Nibelungen treasure.
It would be folly to reject what Siegfried offers you as a brother and Kriemhild is worth more than all the gold in the world!
See what I found!
Put away the armlet, Kriemhild, it guards an ugly secret. The Mistress of the Nibelungen Treasure has no need for it!
Listen, Kriemhild, at how I won the armlet - and keep silent!
The Nibelungen treasure has arrived!
How long, King Gunther, will Siegfried and Kriemhild tarry at the court of Burgundy?
They stay for the sake of my mother.  Would you, Brunhilde, be willing to take up the daughter's place for Queen Ute?
Your brother's honor is entwined with this armlet. It never should be seen again by human eyes!
It seems to me high time, King Gunther, that you send Siegfried back home to Xanten!
Never! He shall leave of his own freewill!
I am going to attend mass, my daughter. Follow me soon!
I'll go to the cathedral in the regalia of the queen of Burgundy!
The wife of a vassal may not precede the Queen of Burgundy!
How did you dare refer to Siegfried, my husband?
Siegfried introduced himself to me as Gunther's vassal and servant.  He did servant's work for my husband!
You, whom he disdained. You, whom he gave away. You dare to belittle Siegfried?
Make way for the Queen of Burgundy, vassal woman!
You recognize this armlet, you queen of Burgundy?
How came that armlet into your hand?
The carrier of the magic helmet who, disguised as Gunther, defeated you three times - Siegfried, my husband gave it to me!
King! Speaks your sister the truth?
Kill Siegfried!
Kill Siegfried!
Your babbling, hero, was worse than murder!
Kill Siegfried!
Siegfried is safe from your wrath.  None can slay the dragon slayer!
Save in one spot, where the linden leaf clung, is he vulnerable as other men!
King Gunther, let me deal with the dragon slayer!
We pledged blood brotherhood.  How can I be party to his death?
The one who took the armlet from me made me his wife, took my maidenhood from me!
Tronje, announce to the people of Burgundy that I invite everybody to a royal hunt to kill a mad dog and a ravening.
Here ends the Fifth Canto.
Canto VI
How Gunther betrayed Siegfried.
Can you keep a secret Kriemhild?
I once broke the oath to be silent and never will do so again!
Well then, the upcoming hunt might easily turn into a chase for men. A secret message warns me of war against Burgundy!
Good for you, Kriemhild, that your husband is the dragon slayer, the invincible!
Who warrants me that in the heat of battle not a chance blade should pierce where the lime leaf fell?
If you want me to protect him, I have to know the exact spot where the invicible could be hurt!
You are good counsel, you truest of true. I shall mark the spot with a little cross myself!
I come to take leave, Brunhilde.  We are starting for the hunt in the Odenwald forest.
Mind my vow, King Gunther, I shall not eat nor drink until my disgrace has been vindicated!
O my dear lord, don't leave me.  I dreamt last night a furious boar tore you to pieces!
O my dear lord, don't leave me.  I dreamt further that two mountains collapsed and buried you!
Today Gunther and I will reconcile.  Who else is my enemy?
Mother, I feel as if blood is draining from my heart!
The hunt in the Odenwald forest lasted from morning until sundown.
A handful of red gold for a cooling draught of white wine!
A wheel broke from the wagon loaded with wine. But I know of a cool brook nearby!
I always heard of you as the fastest runner of all heroes, let's run, you and I, for the first draught!
Gunther, my brother, let's be friends again!
When you are back from the spring!
Grim Hagen spoke:  "The hunt is over!"
Here ends the Sixth Canto.
Canto VII
How Kriemhild swears revenge to Hagen Tronje.
You may break your fast, Brumhild, Siegfried is dead.
Hail to you King Gunther! For the sake of a woman's lie, you have slain your most loyal friend!
I call to you for justice, King Gunther!  Hagen Tronje has slain my husband!
Loyalty for loyalty, Kriemhild.  His deed is ours. His fate is ours.  Our breast is his shield.
You might try to hide among my clan, behind the altars of God, or at the end of the world - You cannot escape my vengeance. Hagen Tronje!
Announce to King Gunther, my brother, the Queen of Burgundy is dead!
Thus ends the tale of Siegfried.
A German folk tale
Behold!
The portals of darkness are open, and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
"Back! Hold! Why dost thou scourge mankind with War, Plague, Famine?!"
"The Earth is mine!"
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God!"
"Look below!"
"All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil!"
"Dost thou know Faust?"
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed!"
"A wager: I will wrest
Faust's soul away from God!"
"If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!"
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
The devastating pestilence raged: in a few days half the town lay dying.
To find a cure for the Plague,
Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead.
"Lord God, bless this act of redemption!
Only you can alleviate our misery!"
"Help... help!
My mother is dying!"
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town.
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death!"
"Have respect for the dead!"
"We still live, we still love! We shall die dancing in each other's arms!"
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!"
"Get hence! We are lost!
No faith is any help.
No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "
Mine God, thou art merciful and a great goodness.
The third great Key to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.
And if thou would summon the Prince of
Darkness to aid thee and give thee all the might and glory of the world, go to a crossroad and call on him three times.
"I invoke thy aid,
Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"
"Come forth, demon of evil!"
"As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear!"
"You have summoned me!"
"Here I am!"
I renounce God and his heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.
"Be gone from me, Satan!"
"To have the power to help for only one day!"
"One day! Try it!
Just one trial day!"
"When the hour-glass has run out... "
"... you go free, the Pact canceled! Sign!" glory... power
"Can you help the hungry and the sick?"
"What you wish I will perform: you are the master and I am your servant. "
"A drop of blood!"
"Blood is quite a remarkable substance!"
"Only for one day?"
"Until the sand has run out!"
"Faust! Help us!"
"Then I shall help in the devil's name!"
"A miracle! A miracle!"
"In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!"
"He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!"
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him! Stone him!"
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"
"You may not cheat me! Remember our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "
"Death sets all men free!"
"Is that death?"
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth. "
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek death? You have not yet lived!"
"I despise my life!"
"Your life was only the dust and mold of books! Pleasure is all!"
"I am too old!"
"I offer you the greateast happiness: youth! Seize it!"
"Give me youth!"
"I've caught you, old boy!"
"Take me to her!"
"Step upon my cloak... "
"... and the spinning Earth will spread before you!"
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of
Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"
"Strange guests!"
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"
"The day is over! The sand has run out!
Be as you were!"
"Youth... Leave me youth!"
"Our pact stands for eternity?"
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust! From indulgence to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you!"
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!"
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"
"Home!"
"Take me home! And at once!"
"Is today a feast day in your town?"
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter?"
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was!"
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest... she is not for you!"
"Tedeum laudamus
Praise the Lord. "
"Vacation, mother!"
"I know more obliging wenches. for you here!"
"I want only her.
Do as I command!"
"Brother Valentin!"
"Once she has this little golden chain in the house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"
"Any lovers yet?"
"What have you, child?"
"Tell the mother of God, if you cannot tell me!"
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
"Three little drops from this love potion by night and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found in my drawer... "
"A rich treasure!"
"I found it in my jewelry box!"
"Just once let me try on the beautiful necklace!"
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride!"
"Pardon, lovely lady.
I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"
"From your cousin... from Lombardy...!"
"He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!"
"Those we encircle within this ring shall be sweethearts...!"
"One, two, three.
Makes you free!"
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!"
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink as I learned it in Padua!"
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"
"He loves me...
...loves me not...
...loves me... "
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"
"She loves me... "
"She loves me not. "
"She loves you!"
"I am yours forever!"
"He loves me!"
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you!"
"Cursed matchmaker!"
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"
"To the prettiest girl in town!"
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister: long live Gretchen!"
"A pretty girl is not pure!"
"Here's to Gretchen!"
"Here's to your Gretchen!"
"If you hurry you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room. "
"Flee!... Flee!... you have murdered him!"
"Murder!"
"Murder... murder!"
"Murder... Murder... Murder!"
"Flee!... Flee! The deputes already seek the murderer!"
"Touch me not, you wanton, your lover has slain me!"
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot!"
"Gretchen... Gretchen!"
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes. "
"For now before the Judge severe
No crime can pass unpunished here. "
"All hidden things must plain appear. "
"Mother! Mother!"
"And has born a little child in the depth of winter. "
"Have mercy on my child!"
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"
"Mercy! Mercy! My child is dying!"
"She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!"
"Faust... Faust... help your Gretchen!"
"Mephisto!"
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers! She suffers!"
"To the stake with the child murderer!"
"Save her, save Gretchen!"
"Too late! Even now they build her funeral pyre!"
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken!"
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!"
"Faster! Faster!"
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!"
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant!"
"Be as you were: an old man!"
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"
"Gretchen!"
"Here is no place for thee!"
"I claim my wager!"
"One Word breaks thy pact!"
"Tell me the Word!"
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"
"Tel me the Word!"

I have a presentiment that you are going to propose, Ed.
I do wish you wouldn't, for this are so much nicer as they are.
But why can't you love me, Gladys?
Now tell me what's amiss with me.
I will only marry a man of great deeds and strange experiences...

London-Record Journal.
I want your legal advice. Profesor
Challenger threatens to sue my paper... for doubting his yarn about live dinosaurs.
FAMOUS ZOOLOGISTS RETURNS FROM SOUTH
AMERICA WITHOUTH PROOFS OF STRANGE TALE
Profesor Challenger, well-known author and scientist, has returned to London...
...with a strange tale of Mammoths,
Pterodoctyls and other prehistoric monsters...
...roaming at large somewhere on the upper reaches of the Amazon. Unfortunately...
...for the professor's reputation for veracity, he refuses to give the exact location of his alleged...
...discoveries, and still more unfortunately, the photographs in his possession are so badly damaged...
(when the Professor's canoe is said to have been overturned)
...that they certainly cannot be acepted...
...as evidence in this case.
I believe Challenger is insane!
He nearly killed three reporters
I sent to interview him today!
Mr. McArdle, couldn't you send me on a dangerous assignment?
All I need is an opportunity -
You seem very anxious to lose your life!
Have you been interviewing
Challenger, Malone?
Don't apologize - hurry over to Zoological
Hall and cover Challenger's lecture.
Reporters are barred
- but get in!
There's Sir John Roxton
- famous hunter and explorer.
He's here to check up on
Challenger's cock-and-bull story.
Well, Malone, we're in for a lively session tonight.
- the students are out in force to heckle old Challenger.
Challenger has made himself a public laughing
- stock by his tale about live dinosaurs!
What can he hope to gain by such lies?
The back country of the
Amazon contains over...
...fifty thousand miles of unexplored water-ways.
Who can say what may be living in that jungle - as vast as all Europe?
But how can Challenger's story be true?
These creatures have all been dead ten million years!
You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.
Reporters are barred-
...if I show my press pass I'll get kicked out. I wonder if you -
Gladly - I'll take you in on my pass.
That's profesor Summerlee, the eminent coleopterist.
- owing to lack of proofs, this
Society cannot sponsor Profesor...
...Challenger's statement, but is glad to afford him this opportunity to state his case, and, we trust, clear his name.
Bring on your mastodons!
Bring on your mammoths!
I will - if any of you spineless worms are brave enough to go back with me...
...into the trackless jungles where these monsters live!
I told you old Challenger is sincere!
And I'm not here tonight to defend my statements - but to demand that...
...a committee be formed to go back to the Lost World with me -
Looks like a riot.
It's a beastly shame!
When dealing with undeveloped minds,
...it is useless to appeal to reason
- for they have none!
I am calling for volunteers!
Volunteers to face death - or worse
- for the sake of science.
I am sixty-seven years of age - but, because I think you are a liar and a fraud -
I accept your challenge, sir!
Accepted! Better an old fool - than a young coward!
I'm neither a student nor a scientist
- but I'd like to be counted in on this!
My friend, Sir John Roxton!
Accepted!
Your record as a hunter of big game will add weight to your testimony - if we return!
Professor Challenger,
I'd like to go on this expedition!
Probably the brain of a child
- but the body of an athlete.
Accepted.
What is your name?
Edward E. Malone -
And your occupation?
I- I'm a-a-er-a reporter, sir.
London-Record Journal.
Take me home - I've had enough of this!
Eleven Enmore Park, Kensington, West!
Professor Challenger, I've got to go on this expedition! The girl...
...I'm engaged to won't marry me until I've faced death or -
This man attacked me!
Do you give him in charge, sir?
No. I was to blame.
I intruded upon him.
Now, sir, can't we talk this expedition over sanely?
Sir John Roxton is a friend of mine-
Why didn't you mention that before?
You've hurt another nice young man!
I saw you from the dining room window!
If my husband gets abusive again - just call me!
You betrayed a glimmer of intelligence just now while talking to the policeman-
Sit down!
Do you want to join this expedition because you believe my statements are true?
Austin!
Tell Miss White
I wish to see her at once!
Have you shown Malone - the diary?
Property of Maple White?
BRONTOSAURUS
Miss Paula White - daughter of poor Maple White - the unfortunate explorer whose notebook you hold in your hands.
Miss White was her father's trained assistant.
She will tell you why she came to me.
I was in camp with jungle fever when my father...
...went up to explore that terrible plateau.
Carnivorous beast Allosaurus.
Evidently already almost externet even lea for I saw few of they.
A Living Brontosaurus
You mean that you actually saw living descendants of these monsters...
...that are supposed to have been dead for millions of years?
Yes, they were tremendous in size and ferocity.
Our bearers were so terrified they deserted-
...carrying me back to the coast - leaving my father...
...marooned up there - with those beasts -
He would go
- in spite of what we had - seen.
My husband promised to raise funds for a rescue party - but instead of...
...getting people to help him, he throws them out of windows and things!
Why, this is a great
human interest story -
And even if my paper was not convinced of the scientific value of your statements -
...it might finance a rescue party provided that the exclusive publication rights-
I'll swear not to send an article back to my paper without your full approval, sir!
If Sir John Roxton will go with me -
I believe we can make my managing editor see this thing!
I'm sure you know why I am going on this rescue party, Paula - don't you?
LIVERPOOL
AMAZON RIVER
I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our voyage.
Eventually we found ourselves in that no-man's-land...
...which is formed by the half-defined frontiers...
...between Peru,
Brazil and Colombia.
The sealed map we promised Challenger to not open untill we arrived here is only...
...a blank page.
Excepting a miracle, our expedition seems to have come to a premature end.
May I come in?
From henceforth
I take command of this expedition.
Let it be clear that you are all perfectly helpless without me!
If that mischievious beast is to go with us,
I remain behind!
Jocko knows which berries and roots in the forest are edible, and which are poisonous...
- he will be far more use to us than you, my dear sir!
RECORD
EXPLORERS REACH LAST
OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
Record-Journal Party Searching for Lost Scientist to Make Way into Mystery World via Secret Rivers.
MAY NOT BE HEARD
FROM AGAIN FOR MONTHS
It's a Brazilian sloth - they always walk head downward. See the baby clinging to her?
Dear Mr. McArdle: It is three weeks since we sent back the canoes...
...and tonight we are camping at the base of the great plateau upon which...
...Maple White was marooned.
Challenger has guided us to this spot, and proven that...
...the Plateau is a fact -
...but we have no reason to believe that any monsters are roaming...
...about up there.
In fact, I don't think...
They're not cubs - but full grown
"spectacle bears" - great camp followers.
Paula says her father felled one of the trees on that pinnacle so that it dropped across...
...the chasm and made a bridge.
You can still see the stump of the old tree.
In the morning we'll climb the pinnacle - and drop the other tree over.
A Pterodactyl -
...proving definitely that the statements in poor Maple White's diary are true!
A Brontosaurus
- feeding merely on leaves.
Perfectly harmless - unless it happens to step on us.
Who would believe this! My elephant gun might as well be a bean-shooter!
Great guns!
We can't get back!
We're prisoners
- exactly like Maple White!
That means our folk are still alive!
What are you thinking of, Paula
- in this lost world of ours?
I was thinking if my father were still alive
- he would have seen our fire...
- and come to us.
An Allosaurus - a meat-eater - the most vicious pest of the ancient world.
The barrier might as well thistle-down
- and fire may not work with the next one...
- we've got to find a safe camp!
Jocko will be mighty lonesome down here without Miss.
Paula
- he climbed that big rock...
...this morning to get to her - he can't bear that girl out of his sight!
I have an idea! After supper bring all those hammocks into the tent!
We must establish camp here - our only refuge from these monsters -
...if we'll live long enough to search for your father.
Now that we've found these caves we could live here the rest of our lives -
...if we had some weapon capable of making a dent in a dinosaur!
I am now inventing such a weapon.
We can't rest until every inch of this plateau is explored!
It's miles in length - your father may have found other caves -
When I release the tree it will snap back with terrific force -
...and by calculating the curve the rock will describe as it rushes through the air-
A curve? Nonsense! Any school boy could tell you the rock will describe a parabola.
A curve!
A parabola!
I was right - you described a curve!
We'll work all night and make enough ladder to get you in the morning.
Fine! But how in thunder do you expect to get it up to us?
Bring Miss Paula to call Jocko - he'll climb anything to get to her!
There's only a small cave above this -
...but your father must be somewhere on the plateau...
- it's impossible to get away!
Do you mean we are to be here - always?
What difference does it make where we are
Paula - so long as we are - together?
But your engagement to - Gadys?
Paula, dear, we're as cut off from the world and its obligations and promises...
...as if we were on the moon.
I'm going to ask Professor
Summerlee to marry us.
You know he used to be a minister.
Go hunt up the professors
- I have something to - tell Paula-
A lovely specimen!
We'll stalk it and observe its habits!
That dormant volcano is waking!
The whole plateau will be covered in lava!
But this has been going on for hours -
I'm afraid they're lost -
If they get back we must be here to show them the way to the tunnel opening.
It's their only hope of escape!
The professors and Mr. Malone are safe - they'll be here in a minute or two!
I certainly hope that mud holds!
We're back in the world
- and its obligations.
Why should we let Gladys rob us of happiness, Paula?
I can't steal my happiness from another woman.
I'm Major Hibbard, of the
Brazilian geodetic Survey.
Yesterday I saw a cloud of smoke over the plateau -
And we smoked out quite a rat, Major!
I'd give my entrie personal fortune to get that beast to London - alive!
I'll send for men to dredge out this stream
- built a steel cage and a raft -
...and when the big rains come next month, we might float your "rat" out!
If we once could get our raft as far as the Amazon, you could charter a steamer from there!
Later - In London.
Tonight you will not jeer -
...for I have brought back a living proof of my statements!
May I ask what you mean when you say
"proof", Professor Challenger?
A living Brontosaurus
- nearly sixty feet long...
...from the nose to the tip of the tail!
Mr. Edward Malone, through whose efforts this expedition, was financed, is now superintending the unloading of the monster...
...from the ship we chartered-
The message I have been expecting has come!
I'll inform you in a moment when and where the Brontosaurus will be on view!
As we swung the cage out over the dock the cables broke-
The fall smashed the cage
- and it got out!
It's running wild
- the streets are in an uproar!
My Brontosaurus has escaped! Keep off the streets, untill I recapture it!
This is outrage - we've been hoaxed again -
Challenger should be run out of town!
How d'ydo, Gladys.
You see I'm - back.
And, as you really owe it all to me,
I hope you'll forgive me - for not waiting.
My husband, Percy Potts.
May I ask what great stunt, what heroic deed Mr. Potts performed -

Prince Achmed, her brother
"l will not part with this horse for mere gold!"
"So choose any of my treasures"
"May l have whatever l desire?"
"l swear it - by the
Beard of the Prophet!"
The Story of Prince Achmed
"How can one bring the horse back down to earth?"
"The lever at the head drives it into the air..."
"...and the lever at the tail brings it to earth"
"Does the Prince know this?"
Far from his homeland he landed on one of the magic islands of Waq Waq
The Prince was young, and brave and eager for adventure
"Who are you, maidens?"
"We serve the Princess Peri Banu, ruler of the spirit land of Waq Waq"
"Stay with us, handsome stranger"
On a neighbouring island lay a magic lake
...where every night the exquisite
Peri Banu and her attendants bathed
"Give back my cloak of feathers!"
"Come with me to my beautiful homeland"
Thus was the Princess Peri Banu taken from the land of spirits
The horse carried them to far away China
"Do not be afraid of me"
"l am yours to command to the end of time"
"You do not know the power of the spirits of Waq Waq!"
"They will kill you!"
"Allah's mercy will protect us if you will be my wife"
Meanwhile, the Sorcerer searched for his magic horse
"We will find our home and you will forget all about Waq Waq"
"l will follow you!"
"The Prince sends you this garment"
"He bids me lead you to him"

"Now, my brave Prince, l shall return to your sister" ln this mountain dwelt the

"How dare you come to my magic mountain?"
"The African Sorcerer brought me hither"
"He is my greatest enemy!"
"And we are friends"
The Bridegroom
"Help me free Peri Banu"
"l fear no spirits!"
"With these weapons you can conquer the spirits"

...MAGlC LAMP OF ALADDlN...

Aladdin and the Magic Lamp
"l am Aladdin"
"Where is the Magic Lamp?"
"Do you not have it?"
"l will tell you"
"l was a poor tailor in the city of the Caliph"
"One day l was visited by a mysterious stranger"
"Behold Dinarzade, the daughter of the Caliph"
"You shall have her, once you do something for me"
"He led me to a high mountain"
The Magic Lamp
"Fetch the Lamp"
"Give me the Lamp!"
"First let me out!"
"Then die! l have other ways to obtain the Lamp!"
"l languished long in the dark cave...
...until l succeeded in lighting the Lamp"
"What is your command, O Master?"
"l am your servant, l and all the Spirits of the Lamp"
"Take me home"
"Now l knew l could win the Princess Dinarzade"
"ln a single night l built her a splendid palace"
"Next morning the astounded Caliph visited the enchanted building"
"So she became my wife"
"The Caliph is my father,
Dinarzade - my sister"
"Tell me, what happened further?"
"One day everything vanished - the palace, Dinarzade and the Lamp"
"l fled before the fury of the Caliph"
"l set out to sea"
"A fearful storm blew up"
"And so you found me"
"Do you know who did this to you?"
"The African Sorcerer!"
"He loved Dinarzade"
"Hurry, Achmed, and free Peri Banu"
"The spirits want to kill her, because she left to follow you"
"The Sorcerer has stolen the
Magic Lamp"
"Only the Lamp can open the gates of Waq Waq"
"Kill the Sorcerer and the Lamp is yours!"
"Kill him!"
"l will try"
"Your enemy is dead!"
The Spirit Battle of Waq Waq
The spirits rose up against their faithless mistress
"Prince Achmed stands before the gates!"
"Bring out Peri Banu!"
"Summon the Spirits of the Lamp,
Aladdin!"
Yet the spirits of darkness came before him
Aladdin was overwhelmed
"The Lamp!"
The Witch intervened
Now legions of benevolent spirits streamed out of the Magic Lamp
"Behold! The palace!"
"Return and seek happiness in the land of mortals"
"Dinarzade must be in the palace"
The towers of the Caliph's city soon appeared before them
"Aladdin's palace has returned!"
Meanwhile, the call to morning prayer sounded from the minarets
At the beginning of the Middle Ages the legend of the mandrake was born. 
According to legend, a root was transformed into a human being. 
We have to go out at night to find the root, when the clock strikes midnight. 
You should place the stick into the ground below the gallows. 
The root of the mandrake, with its strength and
Magic brought fortune to men, but misfortune and pain. 
His Excellency, Professor 
Jakob ten Brink was famous for his ability to experiment with the hereditary character of man. 
During my studies, I have found the legend of the mandrake, and now 
I look at this old superstition scientifically. 
We know the wind carries pollen from flower to flower ... without any will, without a certain goal. 
And thus was born in the laboratory the animal laboratory. I wanted to discover: Is character inherited from the parents or just by chance? 
I always say to my students: 
We should overcome the road open for experiments 
Teacher's Voronoff. XXX
Above all, we should pay attention to the results. Because then we open new possibilities for the study of humanity. 
Franz Braun, nephew of the teacher. 
Wouldn't these men just mock you, uncle? 
On the contrary! It would be the biggest experiment of my life: 
Creating a man in the laboratory. 
A being with a hereditary character that does not come influenced by the parents. 
The woman must be of the same qualities as the land fertilized under the gallows, the "mandrake" must come from the dregs of society
While the prison administration got a man for the professor, 
Franz Braun was looking for women for his uncle needed to perfect the experiment. 
Alraune, daughter of sin ... from the dark days of superstition. 
Franz Baum his uncle was looking for the ideal woman he needed for his experiment 
I am warning you. Forget that your plan violates nature, the finest of life ... 
Beware: the legend of the mandrake is real! It will become a living being, but it lacks the warmth of life, and bears the cold of death inside. 
I tell you, the legend of the mandrake is true.
It is a living being that lacks the warmth of life and bears the cold of death within itself. 
Be on guard ... 
... consequences of your action ... 
Nature will have her revenge! 
Alraune be educated at school 
Convent of the Sacred-Heart. 
I cannot do this to my parents! 
I want to do everything you want. 
On the bank of the Industry and Credit. 
Mom sends you greetings. 
And the Mandrake? 
The evolution of Mandrake. 
24 October 1908 
It is a success, with the help of my nephew, the creation of a Mandrake root. 
He is a dreamer, I, by contrast, am a man of science ... I am above prejudice. 
According to legend, the mandrake brings fortune and wealth. Today I have selected a name: Alraune ten Brink. 
It is blasphemy ... and you will be punished.
Alraune disappears without a trace ... 
-School of the Sacred Heart convent. 
I want champagne! 
At one stop, Alraune lies for the first time to people from a traveling circus. 
Aren't you afraid of a mouse? 
After months of investigation, 
Alraune ten Brink was found. 
In the end, I knew I would succeed. 
Alraune, doesn't it embarrass you? 
I'm scared of you. 
You used to be my nephew. We moved away until your story was forgotten. 
Enough of this visit by a gentleman. 
Who do you think is your father? 
I offend, Alraune. 
If you knew where you came from!  
... and then presented in high society.
Father, come here! 
Surprisingly, father, we seem so little alike. 
Do I look more like my mother? 
Yes ... I think of your mother often. 
What if she looks like her mother? 
Never! 
Dear lady, I want to ask the professor for you hand. 
Sorry, sir ... Alraune is yet very young and should remain with me. 
Tonight at eleven I flee with her. 
What a shame ... An experiment by a cynical scientist ... a daughter of vice and crime. 
What is my place among men? 
I play him. I get even with him. 
You are right ... I stayed with him. 
Dear Dad, I think you're jealous. 
His letter was brought to me here. 
In the diary of my "father" I read everything that happened before my birth. 
Have mercy on me ... 
I want to know everything. 
I'll give you everything you want, but we go from here. 
Alraune ... you and me ... 
You're a cheater! What were you thinking? 
I have now learned that this woman is not you daughter. 
I cannot deceive you. 
You must stay with me, or I will kill you ... 
Dear Professor! It is as if a ghost followed you ... as if a devil wanted to harm another. 
All speculation has failed ... 
She has destroyed ... 
Come to the gaming table, Alraune. 
You will bring me luck. 
Play red, the color of good fortune. 
Red five times in a row. 
Place your bets! 
For the ninth time the ball has landed on red. 
I want to leave. 
We have not lost everything yet, Alraune. 
We still have your jewels. 
We have not lost everything, Alraune.
We still have your jewelry.
Yes ... but not with you ... 
Take me out of here ... 
Give me another soul, a heart ... and I will become a human being and love as a human being. 
Alraune began a new life together the one she loved. And the one who violated the laws of nature, fell into a hell of loneliness and insanity.

{121332}{121429}Thou must be brave. Go now.|Control thy destiny.
{121917}{122045}Give this to her who hath|already my heart.

{126263}{126353}Knowest thou, rash youth...|devouring flames,
{126357}{126456}...foul monsters, shapes of death|beset the path?
{126532}{126607}A hundred years have I been here.
{126611}{126731}Many have gone this way|and none returned.
{126773}{126927}But, if thy resolve be firm,|I will help thee.
{126964}{127089}If thou dost reach the Cavern|of Enchanted Trees...

{128682}{128804}He too may return by the seventh moon.
{129111}{129259}... but his road is hard.|You must pray for him.
{129624}{129760}The first moon.
{129823}{129897}The Valley of Fire...
{131879}{131936}The second moon.
{131990}{132198}In search of rare treasure, The Persian Prince|came to the bazaars of Shiraz.
{132855}{132978}A crippled beggar knew a priceless secret.
{133121}{133250}The magic carpet.|They know not its value.
{133987}{134072}My Prince, here is|the greatest rarity in the world,

Only a young man's kiss could restore them..."
"Follow me: you shall be rewarded!"
"We are in the hospice for old fairies"
"Nowadays, nobody believes in fairies anymore.
So, my old sisters shut themselves up in this antrum."

Realisation:
F. W. Murnau
Costumes and decorations:
Albin Grau
ACT I
Report on the great mortality which prevails in Wisborg in the year of grace 1838
It is words lugubrious like the call of a bird of death.
Take care not to say them or your life will be populated shades and the phantoms which will haunt your dreams will be nourished of your blood.
I reflected a long time with the mortality which had struck my birthplace.
Here its history.
In Wisborg lived Hutter and his young woman Ellen
"Why you killed... these beautiful flowers?"
"Not so quickly, my young friend!
Nobody escapes from his destiny."
There was certain Knock, realtor.
All kinds of noises ran on him.
But it paid its people well.
"count Orlok, the lord of Transylvania... wishes to buy a beautiful house in our city..."
"You could earn much money..."
"Even if that costs a little efforts, of sweat... and perhaps a little blood... "
"He would like a beautiful abandoned house..."
"This house... opposite yours.
Propose it to him!"
"you start, my young friend, and made happy voyage to the country of the phantoms."
"I leave to travel far, to the country of the robbers and the phantoms."
Hutter left the concerned young woman
Under the protection of
Harding the ship owner & his sister
"Would be without fear."
After having traversed many dusty roads, the young person Hutter finally saw the summits of Carpates the horses tired.
"I have to eat... quickly.
I must go to the chateau of the count
Orlok!"
"do not go further. there are werewolf  in the wood."
VAMPIRES
Malfaisants spirits with the damned heart
Nosferatu nourishes on human blood.
It lives in the caves and in coffins, in the ground maudite of the cemeteries of Pestiférés
"more quickly!
The sun drops!"
"Pay what you want!
We will not go further!"
"let us not go there!
This place is sinister!"
As soon as Hutter had crossed the bridge, its fears, that it had entrusted to me, were not long in materializing.
"You made me wait.
It is almost midnight.
The servants sleep!"
END Of ACT I
ACT II
"You hurt yourself... Invaluable blood!"
"do you Want to hold me a little company, very expensive?
"There remains time until the rising of the sun and the day, my good,
I sleep of the deepest sleep." the paddle dissipated the shades of the night.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far. the mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle but is not worried.
At night, a spectral light seemed to animate the castle.
"Your wife has a splendid neck..."
"I buy the abandoned house...
We will be close... "
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims.
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams.
At the same time
"a doctor... a doctor!"
"a benign congestion." the doctor allotted the anguishes of Ellen to an unknown disease.
But I know that your heart answered the call of the bird of death.
Nosferatu unfolded its wings.
Hutter sought to include/understand the terror of its nights. the boatmen did not know which terrible burden they went down in the valley.
END Of ACT II
ACT III
"Of the peasants transported it yesterday, at the hospital.
They say that it made a fall.
It is still feverish..."
"Of the coffins..."
Nosferatu was on the way.
The danger approached Wisborg. professor Bulwer, who studied the secrecies of nature, had spoken to me about it.
One had charged on Empusa of the coffins filled with ground. ship must even take the sea this night
Loading of Empusa Destination: Wisborg
At the same time, professor Bulwer explained to his pupils the cruelty of the plants carnivores. the secrecies of nature appeared in horrified eyes.
"is not this... like a vampire!"
It seems that the approach of malfaisant Nosferatu the realtor had a knock on influence.
"yesterday the patient had a delerious crisis."
"blood, it is the life!"
"See this one..."
"polyp with tentacles..."
"Transparency... Almost incorporeal... "
"A few things close, a phantom..."
"Of the spiders...!"
Ellen often walked in the loneliness of the dunes.
Its sadness flew away towards its beloved, while its eyes scanned the waves and the horizon.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far.
The mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle, but is not worried
"Now, I must leave... to regain the house as fast as possible!"
New epidemic of Black plague in the seaports.
Young people are decimated in mass.
All the victims carry the same wounds to the neck whose origin is still a enigma for the doctors.
Dardanelles are closed with all the suspect ships.
"a sailor is sick. The fever makes him delirious." the first sailor reached of this disease involved all the crew with him, in the black tomb of the waves
The evening, the captain and his second immersed their last comrade.
"I go down! If I am not there in ten minutes..." the ship of death had a new captain.
END Of ACT III
ACT IV
In spite of its weakness,
Hutter overcame the difficulties of the voyage the funeral breath of Nosferatu inflated the veils of the ship which sailed a such spectrum towards its goal.
"I must join it. It arrives!"
"the Master arrives..."
I wondered a long time about these coffins filled with ground that Nosferatu had carried. the vampires were to rest in this damned ground to preserve their diabolic capacities.
"It does not have there heart which lives on board."
July 12.The crew: a captain, a leading seaman, a foam, five sailors.
July 13. A sailor reached of fever.
Cape: south, south-west.
Direction of the wind: the North-East.
July 14. State of the sailor worsens.
The fever makes him delirious.
July 22. Rats on board. Danger of plague.
"Danger of plague!
Return on your premise! You barricade!"
Opinion with the population.
The plague is in the city. do not leave your houses. The burgomaster.
END Of ACT IV
ACT V
Hutter begged Ellen to give up the book which frightened it so much.
But it could not resist strange temptation.
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams. another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
"I have the same vision, each evening...!" the fear reigned on all the city.
Which was still healthy? Who was sick?
"I run to seek Sievers..." another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
The terrified city sought a victim: it was Knock.
"One saw it! It fled!
It strangled the guard... "
"It strangled it... the vampire!"
"Bulwer! Will seek Bulwer!"
"One captured Knock!"
"the Master... the Master...!"
"the Master...... died."
At the same moment, as by miracle, deaths ceased and, in the victorious rays of the morning sun, one saw disappearing the shade from the bird of death.

ZVENIGORA
Cinematographic poem by M. Yogansen, Yu. Yurtik
Adapted by

Director
Oleksandr Dovzhenko
Cinematography by B. Zavelev
Production designer - V. Krychevskyi
Starring: Old man - M. Nademskyi
General - M. Nademskyi
Tymishko - S. Svashenko
Pavlo - L. Podorozhnyi Oksana-Roksana - P. Otava
Ensanguined national assets of the country, buried treasures sealed by a mystery and shrouded in legend lay in the Ukrainian land for ages.
A centuries-old sentinel, guardian of the past, a moss-grown old man is still guarding them the way he did it in times of the Haydamachyna - for three hundred years... a thousand years...
- Have you seen Poles?
- The damned are wandering near zvenyhora!
They dig soil in search of vaults, want to steal our Ukrainian treasures.
- Harness a horse, get on a horseback, you will go with us.
- Give a sabre to the old man
- He will be a Haydamak!
- Here is Zvenyhora!
- I will go straight ahead, and you, old man, will lead a company of comrades and make a detour.
But mind! Do not dig the soil without me.
Do not touch treasures... Come on! Ahead!
- Where are your Poles, old man?
A Pole was sitting on an oak... there will be no more Pole...
- Use knives, lads!
- Mount!
- Where are your vaults, old man?
- The same place where the treasures are.
Centuries passed by...
People were born and died.
Trains began to travel in Ukrainian steppes...
And the zvenyhora-mountain and forests and rivers kept the old man's secret.
The destiny flows by...
Oksana watches on it.
For centuries year in year the old man's senile mouth put down maidenly destiny on the Ivan Kupala night...
Fern blossomed at dark nights...
The old man had a grandson by name Pavlo.
The old man had a grandson by name Tymishko...
- Spit, boys, spit thrice: the devil is in the house.
- Cross yourself, cholera, cross: the devil is in the house.
Do what I say - cross!
We would live and grow the way corn does in the field, unless...
More than one mother cried for her son both on the German and Ukrainian soil.
- "One people rose against another people, kingdom against kingdom.
The enemy of the human kind reins over us..."
- The treasure is in here.
Dogs are fed not before hunting... They construct roads, when they wage the war.
- Nobody can cover treasures up with earth.
It is impossible to build a road by unclean hands.
Zvenyhora can not be defeated.
On Sunday at daybreak.
- Your the brightest, kindest, the most just
Excellency! Stop or the treasure will perish!
- You, old man, are a genuine engineer, but I forbid digging.
Cast away the old man. Place under guard.
And Tymishko conceived, the Cossack intended...
- Freeze! Name yourself?
- It cannot be! Align!
- I will talk to them personally. I will work wonders with them.
- Hello, young fine men!
- Hello, young fine men!
- Hello, eagles!
- Hello, eagle...
- Your Excellency, may the former
Knight of the George order command its own shooting... personally...
- On the standing in front...
...platoon fire...
- P-l-a-t-o-o-n...
- Raise the bayonet up...
- Fire.
- My hand works wonders.
And one people rose against another one, a kingdom against another one, brother against brother.
Sit down, my only consolation and hope.
- Listen to a secret... A great treasure is hidden here in zvenyhora... that time when aliens trod upon our land...
They were lead by chieftains...
People dwelt in villages, just like us...
There was a girl named Roksana among them...
Oxen perished and people perished, and the chieftain decided to make a stop on zvenyhora and to impose a levy...
- Unharness people.
A shield.
Roksana betrayed her people, she fell in love with the chieftain... but not for long...
He cursed Roksana and his treasures with a terrible word.
Waterflooded into a lake, the place where Roksana fell... soil gave way down into that ravine...
Tresses turned into humming reeds, eyes turned into wells and caves.
Our family will get the treasure...
We know the secret.
Be aware, native village. Pavlo advances riding on a white horse.
The sun did not rise yet - red guerrillas left the village, abandoned their native village to the villain Pavlo.
- Come back.
- I will not, my dear Tymishko, will not.
- Come back, crazy woman.
Or I will get mad!
- Speed up.
Hey, leave women there.
- Oh, this is my death, Tymishko. I cannot come back! Go back, Tymishko! Kill me or go back!..
The revolution is in danger.
The revolution is in danger.
The revolution is in danger.
The revolution is in danger.
Proletarian - Mount!
Proletarians, move to engines. Open fire-boxes wider. Fire!
The revolution is in danger.
Eh, it was time when...
- And in a foreign land
- in Prague - a Cossack walks along a street, sweeping it with his wide trousers...
And Tymish? He is studying on a worker's faculty, burdened with scientific figures and formulas, striving to find a real secret of zvenyhora, the secret of the Ukrainian treasures.
Prague - Paris- the Poltava region
- The Ukrainian prince will deliver a lecture about the death of Ukraine due to the Bolsheviks.
At the end of the lecture...
Before respected audience's eyes he will shot himself dead with his own revolver...
- Gracious ladies and gracious gentlemen!
I appreciate your attention very much...
I know that you are not interested in Ukraine or Bolsheviks...
Ladies, especially...
For this reason I will try not to bother you...
Gracious ladies and gracious gentlemen. Thank you... I am finished...
I beg your pardon, I forgot to tell...
- Six thousand dollars. Fine.
You have the fund for a new treasure expedition.
We are sure that we will be lucky this time.
- The treasure is ours. But be quick. Restrain a fire serpent who wants to crush your treasure.
- Stop, evil spirit. Be gone. Vanish.
Stop, fire monster!
- Gracious ladies and gracious gentlemen...
Thank you. I am finished...

KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE
The First Canto:
How Kriemhild Mourned Siegfried, and How König Etzel (King Attila)
Courted Her
Through Rüdiger von Bechlarn.
King Gunther, Margrave Rüdiger von Bechlarn asks for an audience!
I come as ambassador to King Attila.
He who is called the Lord of the Earth -
He who seeks the hand of your sister Kriemhild in marriage.
I am afraid King Attila knows not whom he woos.
In the name of Siegfried, who was murdered and whose murderer lives!
Keep in mind how Siegfried died!
Lord Attila sends me, O Queen, to ask for your hand on his behalf!
You seem to know quite well, Rüdiger, that I have been exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan!
Brother! Where is your brother Siegfried?
Deliver unto me the murderer of my husband, O King!
He has remained loyal to me; so shall I remain loyal to him.
This, Kriemhild, is my final word!
Lady Kriemhild, Margrave Rüdiger, wishes to speak with you after evensong!
Now, Gerenot, is the time to keep close watch over Burgundy!
Speak to me of Lord Attila, Rüdiger!
You court a dead woman, Rüdiger!
He who murdered my husband flaunts the greensparkling sword that he stole from the dead man.
If ever you were done wrong at Attila's court, my lady,
- Lord Attila would know how to avenge you!
Lord Margrave, swear this unto me in your and in King Attila's names!
Not on the cross, Lord Margrave,
- on the sharp edge of your sword!
My lady! Lord Hagen has stolen the Treasure!
You have my word,
Lord Margrave Rüdiger!
Hagen Tronje, where is the Treasure?
Thus spake loyal Hagen:
Somewhere, my lady, where no-one might use the gold to forge arms against the kings of Burgundy!
Thus ends the First Canto.
The Second Canto:
How Kriemhild Fled Her Homeland, and How She Was Received by Lord Attila.
You have drunk Siegfried's blood, O Earth!
One day I shall drench you with Hagen Tronje's blood!
I shall return! Rest assured, I shall return!
My daughter, shall you not proffer your hand in farewell to your brother Gunther?
No, mother.
You are heading far away, Lady Kriemhild.
Don't you want to make peace with your family first?
No, my priest.
Don't you even once want to hail your people, my lady?
No, Rüdiger.
As Kriemhild approached, springtime blossomed in the land of the Huns.
That sack full of gold is mine!
The queen is coming!
Meet her, brother!
Royal jewellery!
My lady, King Attila's brother,
Blaodel, gives thee welcome!
Choose for yourself a kingdom from my lands, Rüdiger, in gratitude for this woman!
Ask King Attila, Margrave Rüdiger, whether he is prepared to make your oath his own!
Upon my oath, O Queen:
Any man who insults you or does you wrong shall die a hundredfold death!
Thus ends the Second Canto.
The Third Canto:
How King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild
Summoned Her Brothers.
Lord Attila swore he wanted to turn Rome's churches into stables for our horses!
Why does Lord Attila no longer uphold his oath?
We traipsed headlong into war!
Why don't we ride further onward?
Why is Lord Attila's horse tethered to his tent?
A great horseman was King Attila!
A mighty mare for him was the world!
Lord Attila whipped the world - his mare!
What does Lord Attila do now?
He sleeps! He sleeps!
Lord Attila, Attila sleeps!
This white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses!
With her tresses does she bind up the horseman,
The great horseman, Lord Attila!
This white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses!
With her tresses does she bind up the horseman,
The great horseman, Lord Attila!
My lord -! Kriemhild...
My lord -! Kriemhild has borne you a son!
O Earth... sacred Earth...
One wish, O Queen!
One wish that I might fulfill for you!
If you would honour me and make me happy, Lord Attila, then summon my brothers as guests to your court!
To Worms, Blaodel, to request as guests to our court the royal brothers of my wife!
Thus ends the Third Canto.
The Fourth Canto:
How Kriemhild Received Her Brothers.
For more than one moon's time your brothers stayed as guests of Rüdiger in the house of Bechlarn.
The minstrels sing a new song of the love between your brother Giselher and Rüdiger's only child, the beautiful Dietlind!
And so I bind in faith -
Bechlarn and Burgundy:
One heart, one life, one death!
To honour your brothers,
Lord Attila has sent the noblest of his knights -
Dietrich von Bern - to greet them.
Once more, Nibelungen, before Lord Attila comes to greet you:
Forget not to whom Attila leads thee!
How could we forget, my lord, that we come to visit our sister Kriemhild?
Whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!
It was the day of the summer solstice, and the Nibelungen arrived at Attila's court.
King Attila, I now exhort you to your oath!
Siegfried's murderer is in your hands!
Think upon my sorrow!
Will you never forget
Lord Siegfried, my lady?
Hagen Tronje shall fight me for his life!
You mustn't fight with the murderer, Attila!
You must have the murderer killed!
Have our guest killed?
You swore to me, Attila!
On the life of your child:
Make good upon your oath!
I hail from a desert land, O Queen.
If only one thing is sacred, it is a guest!
So long as Hagen Tronje regards the peace of my house, he shall be left in peace!
She spoke: Whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!
Whoever brings me the head of Tronje,
I shall fill his shield with gold!
But I beseech you:
Do no harm to the sons of my mother!
Play on, bard!
Thus ends the Fourth Canto.
The Fifth Canto:
How the Huns Celebrated the Summer Solstice with the Nibelungen.
Is it the fashion at Worms upon the Rhine to sit at table armed from head to foot?
Lord Hagen Tronje knows why he never lays aside his sword!
Methinks that at such a feast the heir to all Attila's crowns mustn't be absent!
Methinks the boy will not live long.
Scarcely shall we as guests attend any court of his!
Treason!
The child!
The work of your guest, Lord Attila!
Now, Nibelungen, you are fair game!
I demand safe conduct from this hall for myself and my men!
Thus ends the Fifth Canto.
The Sixth Canto:
The Nibelungen's Distress.
Alert Lady Kriemhild of what it is you see!
Open the gate!
No Hun survives any longer in Attila's hall!
Avenge thy dead, Huns!
O Queen, it is impossible!
Avenge thy dead, Huns, and the royal child!
Sister!
Sister! Consider your mother!
Hand over Siegfried's murderer - and you shall be free!
The fight is too uneven!
Not one of the Nibelungen will gaze upon this next dawn.
In Giselher does my own child die!
Stay out of it, Rüdiger!
Blood shall follow blood!
Get me Rüdiger!
The time is nigh, Lord Rüdiger!
Make good upon your oath!
Lord Margrave Rüdiger,
I demand from you Siegfried's murderer!
You do not send me against Hagen Tronje,
- you send me against your brothers, my lady, who defend him with their very lives!
You've sworn an oath, Rüdiger!
You've sworn it upon the sharp edge of your sword!
I engaged my only child to Giselher!
Blood shall follow blood, Lord Rüdiger!
My lord! Do not force me to kill my only child!
Thus ends the Sixth Canto.
The Seventh Canto:
The Nibelungen's End.
Lord Rüdiger stands before the gate!
He will bring us peace!
What do you bring us, father?
Death!
My lord, do not allow they who love one another to kill one another!
Tell them:
They must deliver unto me the murderer of my child
- and they are free!
You know not the German soul, Lord Attila!
The oath I made to Kriemhild is older than the oath between myself and you!
Don't force me to break my oath! Fight!
Do you wish me to lose my honour?! -
Defend yourself, Hagen Tronje!
O sister, what you have wrought!
Deliver Hagen unto me - and you are free!
Exalt in your revenge, Kriemhild!
Your younger brother is dead!
Rüdiger and his men are dead!
But Hagen Tronje lives on, who slew your Siegfried!
Hurl fire into the hall!
My lord! The Queen bids the hall be bombarded with fire arrows!
The palace is burning!
Lady Kriemhild is right, she is more than right!
I myself will stand at her side as the fire flushes the murderer Hagen from his hole!
You have my thanks, Kriemhild!
Although we were never united in love, we will, in the end, yet be united in hate!
Never, King Attila, was my heart so filled with love as now!
I don't want King Gunther of Burgundy to die a smoky death!
I shall offer Lady Kriemhild my head!
Speak, ye Nibelungen, will you buy your lives with Hagen Tronje's head?!
Loyalty, unbroken by iron, also will not melt in fire, Hagen Tronje!
Look! Volker prepares his fiddle for one final song!
I call it a shame and a disgrace,
Lady Kriemhild, that you let these heroes whom you could not defeat in battle be annihilated in fiery distress!
Do you hear? Lord Volker is singing!
O, that we were on the cool, green Rhine!
Do you hear? Lord Volker is singing!
You are no human being,
Lady Kriemhild -!
No! I died when Siegfried died...
An end -! An end -!
One vassal still lives, Lord Attila!
I cannot go home to my dead Siegfried before having atoned for every wrong...
Here is the sword, Lord Hagen.
Where is the Treasure?
I swore never to betray the location of the Treasure so long as one of my kings still lives!
Now, Kriemhild, no-one knows anything of the Treasure other than God and myself!
And God is no more discreet than I!
Now, Earth, drink your fill!
Deliver her home to Siegfried, her dead husband!
She belonged to no other man!
Here does the myth have an end.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
A tale told in moving pictures under the direction of VICTOR SJÖSTRÖM
At the camera - J. JULIUS
Once there was a poor
Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She'd been stricken with galloping consumption and had only held out for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left, she'd gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had worked alongside the sick girl.
Don't fret over those poor souls now, Sister Edit.
You've done enough for them.
Send for David Holm!”
Please don't!
My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life.
Now that she's dying, let me have her to myself.
Sister Maria, why don't you do as I ask?
Send for David Holm!
I shall go find him at once. ”
You can't be serious!
Asking David Holm to attend to a dying person!
I wasn't able to find him, but Gustavsson is looking too.
He'll bring him here if it's at all possible.
Poor Mrs. Holm!”
03 p
It wouldn't do for her husband to see her if he should come here.
The evening on which these events took place was no ordinary evening.
It was New Year's Eve.
Well, we'll certainly know when it's time to toast the New Year. ”
It's a spooky place to wait for midnight, here among the dead. ”
You gentlemen aren't afraid of ghosts, I hope'?”
Then I'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour. ”
„I once had a pal named Georges, who was generally a jolly fellow.
He came from a good family and had studied at Uppsala University, so he knew a bit more than the rest of us.
But a change would come over him on New Year's Eve. ”
Remember that it's New Year's Eve, the last day of the year!”
Whoever dies on this eve must drive Death's carriage. ”
There is an old, old carriage... ”
It is no ordinary driver who holds the reins, for he's in the service of a strict master named Death.
For him, a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth.
Night and day he must Carry out his master's business.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
PART 2
Wherever he goes, he's greeted with sorrow and despair. ”
There is no escape.
He must perform his forlorn duty. ”
Though horse and carriage are always the same, the driver is not. ”
The last soul to die each year- the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight- is destined to be Death's driver for the following year.
Now you know why I'm afraid of something fatal happening to me on New Year's Eve.
And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve.
Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm?”
Come with me, David Holm!
Sister Edit is dying, and she has asked for you.
If Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go to her at once!”
David, I can't believe it's you!
It is you who is to relieve me!”
You should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can. ”
No living soul rides in that carriage.
By the time I arrive, it's too late for a doctor.
You know full well that
I am no longer among the living. ”
But worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime.
David, do you think I'm unaware that it's my fault you've met such an end'?
If you hadn't fallen in with me, you'd have led a good life with your wife, children, and brother.
By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior.
But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you.
Behold your brother.
While you were here, he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits.
But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place, since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer.
Does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways, David Holm?”
Yes! Only now do I realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one.
What about your wife and children?”
Now I know how miserable they've been, but I will turn over a new leaf.
They need never despair of me again.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
PART 3
No, she's not ill.
She was well enough the other day when she left.
And here I thought
I'd come home to her with such joy!”
If she had gone openly,
I would have understood.
But to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless!
I'll wipe those smiles off your faces.
I'll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has now!
I'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger.
I will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came to this town, bringing such misfortune in your wake.
A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town, and it was ready for use on New Year's Eve.
Keep your food!
I just want to sleep. ”
Leave it alone!
It may be full of germs, and our sterilizing oven isn't working yet.
Don't you realize, Maria, how happy I am to help the first guest God has sent us?
Please go to bed.
It's been a busy day.
Let me attend to this.
Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year. ”
All night long she bent over the coat, never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled.
By the time she went to bed, the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room.
Was it you who mended my coat'?”
Would you mind calling the person who did this?”
It's a shame you went to all that trouble, miss, but I'm used to having it like this.
Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me again next New Year's Eve. ”
You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year, and I'd like to know if my prayer was answered.
Oh, I'll be here.
I'll come show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle.
The time has come to honor that promise before you take over here.
From you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed, and now she awaits your visit.
You possessed all that is most wonderful, but you lost it!
You cannot avoid the torment of remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year.
"Captive, come forth from thy prison!
Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight, thou wilt relieve me of my office.
For a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm.

PART 4
It is Death, but he has come too soon. ”
You see that I'm not afraid of you.
I will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's reprieve, for there is someone
I must talk sense into.
You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused.
I cannot approach the Lord until I have set it right.
The person I'm waiting for is the man I love.
Do you understand?
The man I love!
I would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you.
But you have no power over this man!
Believing he was good, you've tried to make him mend his ways, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again.
It was you who enticed him away from his home and work!
You made him the drunkard he is!
Don't let yourself be dragged under!”
SALVATION ARMY RALLY
Run along and be saved, and I'll be sure to come watch!”
Why turn away so carefully?
I'm a consumptive myself, but I cough in people's faces in hopes of finishing them off.
Why should they be better off than us?
He's merely amusing himself.
He's not as wicked as he pretends to be. ”
How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man'?”
You needn't worry about that.
I'll be leaving town in a few days. ”
No, you mustn't do that!”
I would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again. ”
Tempting as that may be,
I still can't stay. ”
You see, little missy,
I'm on a journey throughout Sweden in search of someone
I must find at all costs.
Who is this person you seek?”
You'll know that when I find the person in question!”
I am the one
David Holm is looking for. ”
I am his wife. ”
I couldn't endure the life he was leading.
I deserted him.
I took my children and crept away in secret.
I moved to this town, for it was so far from our old home that I never expected him to come looking for me here.
You must take him back! it's his only hope!”
„I didn't mean you must make up your mind on the spot.
Only promise you'll listen to your heart, and let us talk again later.
She had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.
Just come with me!
A surprise awaits that will make you happy.

PART 5
She hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns.
And she may well have succeeded had it not been for...
The doctor says it's pneumonia.
And her resistance is poor, for she's been in ill health since last New Year's Eve.
Yes, that David Holm has been her undoing.
She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth.
You might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children!”
It wasn't so easy to run away this time!”
Haven't you had your fill of revenge, David'?”
If only I hadn't brought them together again.
His sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me.
You must grant me a reprieve!
I cannot die yet!
I must see him turn over a new leaf!
Just spare me a few minutes!
You know I love him!
I've never loved him as I do today. ”
Captive, ye of loving head, come forth from thy prison!”
Come along.
We have no business here.
Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly.
You know, David, if I could send a message to mankind,
I would like to send them a New Year's greeting.
„I would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer:
'Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. '
Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!”
No, I can't go on!
I can't go on!”
I'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind. ”
Please don't be angry with me. it's not my fault. ”
This will do, David.
It will suffice for the children and myself.
"Yes, David, I see what's coming.
I'm obliged to watch.
I will not shirk my duty.
You mustn't let this happen!
This mustn't come to pass!
Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!
„I have no power over the living.
Where should I turn?
Should I pray to God or to Christ?
Who can tell me where to direct my plea'?
I'm a poor, miserable sinner, and I beseech the Lord of life and death!
I'm not worthy.
I've broken your every commandment.
Condemn me to eternal darkness!
Let nothing remain of me!
Do what you will to me, my Lord, but spare the three of them!
"David, I see that I no longer need grieve for you!
"Captive, return to thy prison!
She didn't do it yet!
I made it in time!”
Sister Edit is dead.
I was at her side.
I promised her I'd become a good husband and father.
You're lying!
Sister Maria told me you refused to go to her!
Are you owing, David'?”
No one believes I want to reform.
I want to be good, but no one believes me. Is it any wonder I cry'?
It's hard to believe, David.
But I do believe you.
Your tears have convinced me.
I can't help crying too.
I won't be truly happy until all my sorrow is drained.
Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. ”
THE END
