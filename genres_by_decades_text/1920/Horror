THE PENALTY
From the story of COUNERNEUR MORRIS
A victim of the city traffic.
It was young Dr. Feris' first serious case.
The injured child is still
I unconscious of his fate.
I dared not wait any longer.
I amputated both legs above the knee.
There is a contusion at the base of the skull.
Good God! You should not have amputated!
You have mangled this poor child for life.
His father and mother...
My poor boy, I will do what I can for you.
I shall lie for you, and may Got forgive me.
Only immediate amputation could save your child's life.
I heard them say...
He imagines he heard us. It's the effect of the ether.
He lies! He lies!
Twenty seven years later... San
Francisco is the richest city in the western world.
She has one hideous blemish...
The Barbary Coast.
Barbary Nell.
Frisco Pete.
Blizzard, lord and master of the underworld.
Lichtenstein, of the Federal
Secret Service.
Rose, his most daring operative.
Rose, this detail I'm offering you is so dangerous, I hope you will turn it down.
It' s always Blizzard, that cripple from Hell.
Do you remember sweet Barbary
Nell who wandered from our fold?
She' s dead!
I could get him for theft, arson, murder, but his criminal machine would still grind on.
Through the Master I must reach his slave, the underground powers of the Reds.
He' s gathered up his dance hall girls and he' s put them to work in his house, making hats, thousands of hats.
I must know why!
"I believe Blizzard is hatching something so big, it endangers the city.
I must find out what!
By the way, Barbary Nell, who strayed from us, now sleeps upon a marble stab...
... in the morgue.
Blizzard' s favorite for the moment.
A woman who enters that den risks worse than death.
That' s all in the day' s work.
... and I shall walk as men walk.
I shall be the master of a city!
"And for my mangled years the city shall pay me...
... with the pleasures of a Nero and the powers of a Caesar!
But you won' t live to see it... if you don' t pedal better.
It means living in that devil' s house till you find out what he' s up to.
Of course. Well, I' m game.
Dr. Ferris, now the most famous surgeon in his line.
Dr. Wilmot Allen, his assistant.
Blizzard had agents in strange places.
Barbara asked me to call for her.
The surgeon' s daughter Barbara, had dedicated herself to Art.
I' m dreadfully discouraged.
I have done nothing worth while.
Some day she will realize that this is all nonsense.
Sorry you have to go.
Haven' t I waited long enough?
Why don' t you chuck it, Barbara?
Not until I have done at least one thing that is worth doing.
And I' m going to do Satan, after the fall'.
If I fail...
... I will marry you.
Nothing to report.
Blizzard keeps plans to himself.
His people obey orders not knowing their meaning.
My knowledge of music...
...has been my protection.
He likes my pedaling.
Rose
Rose has been there a week... and she' s learned nothing.
You' re a find!
You are not afraid of me... you look me in the eyes.
How could I be afraid... when you play like that?
You are a find!
WANTED - Model to pose of
"Satan After the Fall".
If you thing look like Satan, apply at studio of Barbara Ferris,
32 Institute Place.
Be in front of that studio tomorrow and see that no applicant but myself enters it.
Everything comes to him who waits.
You have mangled this poor child for life.
Do I look like Satan?
Before I am through with her and her father, they' think
I' m the devil himself.
9 A.M, Barbara' s Studio at 32 Institute Place.
Model already engaged.
Bubbles, a street waif whom
Barbara has befriended.
Whenever Blizzard was absent,
Rose hunted for clues.
Some excellent judges think that I resemble Satan.
If there is enough of me.
I seem to please.
I knew about when I was bumming the streets cat-throat' s his middle name.
You ought not touch him with a pole.
Gawd! Look at that face!
If I could catch that expression in the day...
I' d be famous.
How do you happen to know so much about Art?
My father, who shall be nameless, was a distinguished man.
But he detested little boys with their legs clipped off. So at fifteen I hoppled out of his life.
I could write a better treatise on sculpture myself.
Why do you live in the underworld?
When Satan fell from
Heaven he looked for power in Hell.
Hugely satisfied with his morning s work.
Rose, my dear!
Under the piano my darling... we will have some music.
I have a feeling I shall waft you into Heaven.
A death song, Rose!
Rose was my best bet... so far she' s learned nothing.
"I could not have played that way without your help.
Go back to work...
I can murder anything but music.
Days passed and the clay grew into the image of the man who was like Satan...
Into a face clothed with evil intent.
In time man would mangle the soul of the daughter, even as the father had mangled the body of the man.
The end of this passage is barred by a gate but through it
I could see what...
But the most remarkable of all is a fully-equipped operating room.
If you say it' s good,
I know it' s good.
But she hesitated for this would mean the end of Blizzard.
I know of Dr. Allen... and of his great master,
Dr. Ferris."
I will come tomorrow at the same time.
What an admirable pair of legs.
I gave mine to science.
That monster ought to be chloroformed and put out of the way.
He shows me only courtesy and helpfulness.
The end of this passage is barred by a gate, but through it I could see what...
Doctor Ferris investigates.
May I talk with
Mr.  Blizzard alone?
I have followed every step of your career, and you have indeed profited by your early mistakes.
You were the child whose life I ruined?
Don' t let that trouble you too deeply.
It is now in your power to repair your error.
Command me in any way...
But don' t come here any more.
Only your daughter' s request can keep me away. She is making a masterpiece.
Barbara, let me tell you a story.
He lies! He did not have to cut them off.
Behind his visits there is some sinister motive.
I can read it his eyes.
If you have made him what he is, it is all the more our duty to help him.
Blizzard' s man O'Hagan, his back in town.
He has organized thousands of disgruntled foreign laborers.
Hats and men... what' s the devil up to?
Blizzard' s chief lieutenant,
O'Hagan.
You have worked in the dark long enough... this is the plan I have been developing for two years.
2 December
At twelve noon on that day I shall loot the City of San Francisco.
Your 10.000 foreign malcontents will filter into the city in small detachments.
The signal will be an explosion.
By fire and riots I shall draw the police and military into the suburbs.
The heart of the city will be left defenseless... ours to loot at will.
And then we shall vanish with our treasure.
You talk as if you had legs! By God!
You have gone mad!
Perhaps... but with the madness that succeeds!
Better come out of that closet or I will begin to shoot!
Crying won' t help... talking may.
What the use...you' re going kill me anyhow.
I doubt it... you' re the best pedaler
I ever had.
But the most remarkable of all is a fully equipped operating room.
You see, you haven' t been allowed to do much damage.
I think I' m glad.
Don' t you see?
Master!
With exultation he felt the power that his mind was gaining over Barbara.
You are the best critic in the world.
Live your own life... go where I shall point... to your place among the stars.
How am I ever going to thank you the help you have given me?
When you have finished that, don' t give me op.
I love you, Barbara, with my whole heart and soul.
At her laugh his Hell - born loose passions broke.
But almost instantly he knew that he had blundered...
...and like a good general tried retrieve his mistake.
I am the unhappiest beast in the world.
Forgive me having dared to lift my thoughts to you.
Laughter burns a cripple like acid.
I don' t know why I laughed.
You frightened me.
Will you forgive me?
I have come to prescribe a little, Barbara.
Call me a taxi.
True women need love, a home, children. He has made you forget that.
I will marry you, dear, whenever you wish.
After a night of jealous fury, the Beast takes action.
Hello Doctor, this is Bubbles.
It' s about Barbara... she' s gone to
Blizzard' s house.
I do not know why she went. She was crying.
He will run all the way... on those magnificent legs.
Once before a woman surfeited me with her caresses.
She' s dead!
Rose just shows herself at the window and nods... and that' s all.
Where is Miss Ferris?"
She is probably in her room.
Shall I search your house, or will you take me to her?
Listen, my baffled hero... if you wish the lady to go free...
... you must hand over to me your superb legs.
Dr. Ferris will cut them off for you.
Then he will graft them to me.
They will be very becoming.
Your daughter is in my house. She has been hurt. Cowmen at once.
That fairy tale about your daughter was merely to make certain that you' d come.
You' ve played the trick with apes... now I' m putting human beings at your service.
Your victim is fulfilling destiny in making you the master surgeon of the world.
You must make it possible... unless you would have your charming daughter married to these.
Out of my house is not out of my power... that' s here.
Suppose you and your assistant should disappear... then your daughter and I...
Give me legs and I will be a model son-in-law.
Then I will be a tower of strength...
I will be a Caesar!
You are right... you' d be a superman!
I will do it!
Doctor Ferris' sudden decision to operate brought about starling results.
I have waked from a terrible dream!
I was a devil...
I did things that I shudder to think of!
What' s happened... you did not do what he wanted?
That was a madman' s request...
I operated on his head.
There is a contusion at the base of the skull.
That caused pressure on the brain... he has never been wholly responsible for his acts.
This man, let alone may become as great a power for good as he was for evil.
He shall have the chance.
The tyrant' s hand relaxed... the whirlwind breaks.
‘he old Blizzard is no more.
I have assumed my real name
In my madness I built power from evil. I shall undo my handwork.
I am still your friend, but it must be for better things.
He' s got religion... that means he will raise Hell!
How do we know he won' t snitch on us?
If we don' t finish him, he will finish us.
The New Man... and his wife.
We shall do great things together.
Fate chained me to Evil... for that I must pay the Penalty.
"That is a great puzzle,
Perhaps I am going to see it solved.
Don' t grieve, dear... death interests me.
All that' s left of him... an evil mask of a great soul.

MARGARET DAUNCEY
Sculptor
Doctor Porhoet, uncle and guardian of Margaret 
Dr. Burdon on the line.
"Her spine has been injured in the fall..."
... and now she is completely paralyzed." 
... yes, exactly after the fall, when you operated last week.  
The patient is my niece, 
Margaret Dauncey. 
Okay. I will operate on her tomorrow at 11 o'clock here in the clinic.
The medical world has gathered to watch the American surgeon, Arthur Burdon, demonstrate a new miracle in surgery. 
Oliver Haddo - hypnotist, magician and student of medicine. 
This Burdon is almost a magician!
Nonsense! Saving a human life is a relatively simple thing. 
But the scientific creation of life requires magical power. 
Your niece is the most beautiful patient I have ever had.
The Arsenal Library.
Here much of the old magic 
- Almost forgotten - deteriorating 
Here, Oliver Haddo has made a search for months for an old magic formula for the magical creation of human life. 
Formula: The creation of human beings through alchemy, with the help of this formula, is possible. 
These additives must be added at a temperature of 115 Degrees Fahrenheit, with the blood from the heart of a virgin.
Then you can observe the first sign of life...
Dr. Porhoet, here is the book that you were asking for. 
- But the formula you are looking for isn't there.
Margaret's convalescence brings a time of great happiness to her and Arthur Burdon.
Oh, Arthur, such a poor child to be so crippled, - what a fate! 
If it were not forbidden, I would have you cut one of these beautiful roses for me.
He looks like a character out of a melodrama. 
And then - New Year's celebration at the Lowen Von Belfort -  
Please allow me to give you this gift, the only existing portrait of 
Oliver Haddo, the magician. 
Do not worry - these people are working only with snakes that have had their fangs removed.
It's not so, Dr. Burdon. 
They are only deprived of their poison! 
This man has a horn viper, the most deadly of all snakes. 
I will now demonstrate how I can render the poison from this snake harmless - my means of magic! 
You have not shown us that the snake was poisonous.
Arthur is taking the girl to the hospital 
- But this idiot can get you killed.  
All the next day, Margaret was haunted by memories of the previous evening. 
Dora Clark writes that I should come to meet her in the city.  
I am not waiting any longer. 
I am very sorry about the tragedy that occurred last night. 
I came to express my regrets to you. 
Oh Arthur, thank goodness you're here.  
I was supposed to meet Dora here, but she has never arrived.
Can you take me home? 
Would you like to see something special? I can show you! 
Concentrate on the head of the faun -  
If you want me, you can find me at this address. 
Oh, Arthur, I cannot explain it 
- But stay with me - do not leave me! 
Margaret invited Arthur Burdon for dinner. 
Only in his presence did she feel safe from the hypnotic power of the magician.
I wish we were already married, Arthur 
- I hate this waiting ... 
In only two days, my dear. 
I am afraid of what might happen in the mean time.
You were never more beautiful than you are now! 
Come tomorrow morning at 10:30 am  
- it is very important! Oliver Haddo
Come tomorrow morning at 10:30 am 
- it is very important! Oliver Haddo add the blood from the heart of a virgin.
Then you can observe the blood must be from a girl with white skin, blond hair and blue or gray eyes.
Why was I asked to come? Why don't you leave me alone? 
You know that I cannot go. 
Tomorrow will be my wedding day.  
... and therefore you will never marry 
Arthur Burdon! 
Oh - what shall I do? 
What shall I do?
The wedding day. 
Dear Susie, 
I was married this morning to Oliver Haddo. 
Please tell Arthur 
- Margaret.
I know one thing - Margaret is not marrying Haddo by her own will 
- she is under his hypnotic power. 
We cannot let her out of our sight! 
Following Dr. Porhoets advice, Arthur followed Margaret and Haddo to the Riviera. 
He lost her there.
Monte Carlo. 
I won 4000 francs after following the system 
And so it is a working system ... 
I have heard that this man, who stands behind you and tells you how to play, must be a magician.
The run of luck is always turning 
- who loses today, wins tomorrow.
Margaret, look, this is your unlucky suitor, the genial Dr. Burdon! 
I could not reply to your message as long as Haddo was there. 
Tomorrow morning he will be in his laboratory in Latourette. 
Come to me then! - Margaret.
Latourette 
The retreat of Haddo, the magician.
Arthur ... please understand ... that was not me that you saw ... 
- It was something in me, that 
I had no power over. 
I no longer have a free will -
I don't have my own soul.
Margaret, I know that it was not your fault 
- Nothing has changed my love for you.
I'm not really Haddo's wife. 
We are married in name only! 
What does he want with you? 
I think he wants to kill me in a magic experiment. I often think 
I will die from fear! 
Come with me now. Your uncle is already on the way here and we will immediately arrange for a divorce. 
Haddo traced to Latourette 
- in a small village outside Monte Carlo 
- has his laboratory in an old magician's tower. 
Stop. 
Investigation confirms that he was a patient in an insane asylum
That to me is enough - he is completely insane! 
That means that we can free 
Margaret from his hands.  
Dr. Burdon, I am so happy that you are here. 
I cannot find Miss Dauncey. 
She left this message for you on her pillows. 
My dear Burdon,
You and your honorable colleague,  
Dr. Porhoet shall see, that it is useless to interfere in my affairs.  
Yours sincerely, - Oliver Haddo 
You can't go there by car. 
I can only take you as far as Sospel. 
The lights of the magician's tower gleamed in the stormy night like two evil eyes.
These additives must be added at a temperature of 
115 Degrees Fahrenheit,    
After that you can observe the first signs of life. The blood from the heart needs ...
Looking for a guide, gentlemen? 
Neither man nor beast will go to the magician's tower at night.
Arthur ... Arthur! 
These additives must be added at a temperature of 
115 Degrees Fahrenheit,  
After that you can observe the first signs of life. The blood from the heart needs ...

THE WITCH
- 1922 AB Svensk Filmindustri
A presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures.
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921.
For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne and to Mr. Richard Louw for the art direction.
My main sources are mentioned in the theatre's playbill.
Let us look into the history of mysticism and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the Witch.
The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind.
When primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible, the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits.
In Persia, the imaginary creatures depicted in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases.
The English scientist Rawlinson and French scientist Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits, believed to have resided amongst the first civilisations.
The belief in evil spirits, sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naïve notions about the mystery of the universe.
Here we see how the Egyptians perceived the shape of the world
The ancient Egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides.
The sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains.
The stars, like lamps, hung from the sky on ropes.
According to the beliefs of other ancient civilisations, the sky was vaulted and the earth shaped into terraces.
The evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval folklore to devils, sneaking around and tempting children.
The devils lived in the earth's core.
In the latter part of the Middle
Ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe.
Above the earth and its waters -
- the medieval man first imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire -
- and outside the fire were the planets, moving celestial bodies.
Each planet was attached to its transparent, movable sphere.
And outside the planetary spheres were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own.
Above it all, in the tenth crystal sphere, sits the Almighty surrounded by nine choirs of angels...
...and He is the One keeping the spheres revolving.
Deep down in the earth's core lies Hell, where those tempted by the
Devil shall suffer forever.
In the upper part of the following picture
The devils are stuffing the damned into large pots.
A sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the cauldrons.
A devil pours the nasty sulphur oozing from a horn down a man's throat.
Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth.
I have found a strange old mechanical presentation of Hell, which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the Middle Ages.
Observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the cauldrons.
During the Middle Ages, devils and Hell were considered real and constantly feared.
Witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the Devil, and therefore they were burned at the stake.
The floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air.
This picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from "German Life in the Past in Pictures."
In this image a witch is milking an axe handle.
In the following image a witch has bewitched a man's shoe.
Witches usually meet in councils.
And after the gathering they might, for instance, sneak into a barn and bewitch a cow.
The small angular symbol, noticeable under the drawing, was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches.
In this old naïve drawing, a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells, setting a village on fire.
Witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer's powder and magic potions.
Notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed.
That was habitual in the past.
It was a general belief that the witch was naked when, at night, during the so-called Witch Sabbath, she danced with the devils.
Women who wanted to participate in the "Sabbath" went to the sorcerer...
...where they could have their backs smeared with "witch ointment".
The witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air.
The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following pictures of the Witch Sabbath...
...a secret satanic rite to which thousands of women asserted their participation.
At the Sabbath witches and sorcerers first desecrate the Church's holy cross.
Satan gives all the participants devils' names.
And a ceremonial banquet is held.
The Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows.
All witches had to show the Devil their respect by kissing his behind.
After a merry dance with the devils, the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock.
These scenes are often found on famous Witch Sabbath pictures from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
To be continued.
THE WITCH
Chapter 2.
We go now to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488.
"Tonight the stars shine favourably over the gallows' hill."
"What a stench
The thief's body has been hanging too long on the gallows."
"When such a thief's finger is too dried out, it can no longer lend the brew any healing power."
"Hurry and open up, Karna, so that the passers-by won't see me."
"Karna, can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church?"
"Here, young maiden, take a potion of cat faeces and dove hearts, boiled in the moonlight."
"A drop of this in a man's drink will soften his heart at once."
"Karna, can I have an even stronger potion?"
"If the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love..."
"...I have a potion boiled in May from a young and playful male sparrow."
"Hold your coin, maiden 
First smell my ointment "
"This salve is good, should you wish to travel to Brocken, one night."
"Secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber."
"You will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses."
"Listen Brother, I wonder... shouldn't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise?"
"Holy Mother, forgive us for cutting open a person's dead body with a knife "
"It is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin..."
"...but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us."
"Help. Hurry.
The peace of the cemetery has been desecrated by two witches."
Such were the Middle Ages, when witchcraft and the Devil's work were sought everywhere.
And that is why unusual things were believed to be true.
"Damned woman 
You shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honest people."
"You beware.
Now your filthy mouth shall remain open for eternity."
So it happens with witchcraft as with the Devil; people's belief in him was so strong that he became real.
The Devil is everywhere and takes all shapes.
He shows himself as a nightmare, a raging demon, a seducer, a lover, and a knight.
The devils' companion can be young and beautiful, but she is more often old, poor and miserable.
Is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night, you poor old woman of the Middle Ages?
When the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes, the Devil fetches Apelone for his adventures.
High up in the air is Apelone's dream castle, and there the Devil will fulfil all her secret wishes.

THE WITCH
Chapter 3.
In "Rites and Rights in the
German Past" by Franz Heinemann, we can observe pictures of inquisition judges at work.
A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not.
In "History of Customs",
Edward Fuchs shows us how the accused is tied up.
Two executioners use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support.
If she floats, she will be pulled up and burned.
If she sinks, the judges thank God for her innocence.
I will now illustrate a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the Pope sent travelling inquisition priests out to Germany.
"My husband could not have been struck by faintness so suddenly, unless a sorceress had bewitched him "
"Be comforted Anna, wife of the Printer, the power of lead will soon reveal it."
"You powerful Saturn, allow this lead to show if Jesper the Printer is bewitched."
"It is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft."
"Peter, look, where is the evil sorceress?"
"You might see that witch, before you wish to..."
"...before I wish to."
"Jesus Holy Cross and Wounds
I did not hear you come,
Maria the Weaver "
"Maiden, please have mercy on me, a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door "
"Are you hungry, Maria?
If so, sit down."
"Here, eat now, if you can, in the name of Jesus."
"Watch out, little sister, watch out. That woman has evil eyes."
"The youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden."
"How wonderful.
It felt like fire when the young maiden took my arm."
"Young maiden, you know quite well that what you're accusing this woman of, endangers her life?"
"Swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies "
"Let's go, young men, before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won't turn us all into mice."
"Now you can have a scalding death, just what you deserve, you damned mistress of the Devil "
To be continued
THE WITCH
Chapter 4.
Two "honest" matrons will change the accused in jail, so that she will not wear hidden witch powder.
"Maria the Weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft."
"Master, look carefully, there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress' hair."
The suspect's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges.
Two honourable men try amiably to persuade her to confess.
If she stubbornly denies her charges, they will use a kind of mental torture.
"Woman, see here the seven holy words of Jesus crucified, written on consecrated parchment."
"I will hang them around her neck, so that the Devil will no longer help her to be silent."
"Does she see this length of consecrated wax as Corpus Christi?"
The accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber, so as not to bewitch the judge when entering.
"For the last time I ask:
Does she want to confess her witchcraft and her misdeeds?"
"Let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the harshness of her heart."
"You learned men.
How do you expect me to confess to that which is not true?"
"Well, Rasmus the Executioner 
Let now the evil witch's body sting."
"Let her catch her breath, Rasmus the Executioner, and loosen the screw a little at a time, as she confesses her sins."
"Learned men I confess that
I've given birth to many children fathered by the Devil."
"And when I gave birth, Karna and all her coven helped me."
"If I am spared the pain,
I will confess that Trina has smeared me with witch ointment."
"Yes, learned men, miserable me has flown through the night air to Brocken on Trina's broom."
"And the Devil's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft."
"And many a woman, who had not accomplished enough evil deeds, was treated miserably by the Devil."
"And masses spat upon all that is holy."
"And a meal of toads and unchristened children was cooked by Karna."
"Listen, Maria the Weaver, did you also see how the Devil put his mark on the witches' foreheads?"
"Learned men,
I saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind."
"And Anna's mother, the wife of the Printer, who wished me a scalding death -"
"- that damned woman, I saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly... and Sissel, her servant, that old fool, was also there."
"And Elsa, who kicked me some time ago, she shall also burn at the stake."
"She passed Martin the Writer's door one moonlit night with her sister."
"And they cast a spell on
Martin the Writer with the water they threw against his door."
"And it was the very same night that death took Martin the Writer."
"And now I will tell you everything about the witches, who yell after me in the street where I live."
To be continued
THE WITCH
Chapter 5.
In this way begins the endless turn of the wheels during the witchcraft era.
Each witch gives ten others away.
The town wardens busy themselves.
If you oppose the capture of a witch, you must be a witch yourself.
The destiny of young Anna, wife of the Printer, is sealed.
So now only two people are left in
Jesper the Printer's haunted house.
During the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly, but it was not safe to be young and pretty either.
"Brother, help me.
My thoughts are sinful."
"Bare your body, Brother "
"I'll whip your sinful body and your poor soul, into faith healing."
"Brother, why did you stop the beating of the scourge?
Now my soul will surely be damned."
"Father Henrik,
Brother John is spellbound."
"A witch appears in his cell to tempt him."
"And she has grabbed him by the wrist."
"Stand up, Brother,
Father Henrik is coming."
"Brother, you have not given the maiden away for a witch, have you?"
"You know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch?"
And so they fetch you too, young maiden, giving you their unfailing test.
"In the name of the Holy Trinity, if you are not a witch, you will now shed tears "
"See for yourself
- you cannot shed tears, as you are allied with the evil one."
We assume now that the young woman resists; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess.
I have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances.
And I see in front of me some scenes, which I do not find pictured too darkly here, on the white screen.
"Wake up, young maiden 
I bring you great happiness."
"See, young maiden,
I give you your freedom -
- if you would just show me a small favour in return."
"Why do you taunt me, monk?
What favour can a poor creature like me show you?"
"Teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water "
"If you do not want to take my word, young maiden, stand up and look out at the jail court."
"Did the guards leave?"
"Yes, they went far away, maiden.
The keys are now in my hand and I can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight."
"And I swear eternal silence to you, maiden, about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder."
"Do you remember, maiden, that Jesper, the Printer's child, is all alone in the world, without relatives besides you?"
"Father Henrik, see the tears of the young maiden.
Look, she cries, hence she cannot be a sorceress."
"Silly boy  Don't you know that witches secretly smear themselves with spittle, so that we might believe it to be tears?"
"Here, maiden, see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonourable, rejected witch's offspring without you."
"Stand here and listen to all the maiden's words, so that later you may bear witness against her."
"And will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me, if I speak?"
"Then I will tell you that once a travelling stone cutter told me..."
"...that when witches call for thunder, they put their hands in the water..."
"You hardened witch 
Before the sun is down tomorrow, you will burn alive at the stake."
"And then they will burn you too, maiden,
"as edification for man, as sweet scent for God."
And one pyre after another burns in the town square, until the judges will one day move on to the next town.
The witch madness, like a spiritual plague, ravages wherever these judges go.
In the arc of a few centuries, over 8 million women, men and children were burned as witches.

THE WITCH
Chapter 6.
There are witch confessions that are totally insane.
Many women, for instance, confess that - transformed into cats - they soiled the altar during the night, while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door.
But there are also confessions, which might very well be close to the truth, namely during the times when superstition ruled.
Many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by "tying knots "
For each knot a pregnancy is destroyed.
And the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses.
Many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects.
But, if we should judge from the confessions, we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber.
You and I would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools.
Isn't that so?
The French doctor Paul Regnard describes the way this collar was used.
The collar was tightened with the help of four taut ropes.
The wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor.
When a fire bowl was put under the poor victim -
- his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck.
Doctor Regnard shows another picture, which speaks for itself.
It is simply called
"After the interrogation."
The "painful interrogation" preferably began with a "lighter" torture:
The thumbscrew, for example.
One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures.
I will not reveal the terrible confessions I forced from the young lady in less than a minute.
In the convents during the Middle
Ages, fear of the Devil escalated into an almost hopeless despair.
The pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self-punishment.
Often a single nun was seized, and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was overtaken by insanity -
- a mysterious, contagious insanity.
In writings that have survived to this day, these unhappy women wrote down with touching simplicity how the Devil penetrated the convent.
"Get thee behind me, Satan."
"May all good saints stand by me.
Sister Cecilia is conniving with the evil one."
How these religious women must have suffered, before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out?
In their biographies, this desperate cry is always found:
The devil forced us into it.
"Holy Mother, the evil has a terrible power "
"Look, now he forces me into doing what I want the least."
"Burn me at the stake, pious fathers
Can't you see what the Devil forces me to do?"
"Take me  Don't you see him?
The evil one stands over there and threatens me."
To be continued
THE WITCH
Chapter 7.
We pass over the Devil's actual possessions
And come to present times.
The majority of witches in the old days were poor women; those who are taken in by pious organisations and nursing homes nowadays.
One or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era.
Let us not believe that the Devil belongs solely to the past.
The lovely old woman, who plays the role of Maria the Weaver in my film, once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot -
- and said: "The Devil is real.
I have seen him sitting at my bedside."
With the old woman's permission,
I show here the prayer book in which a woman thinks she can tell the Devil by sight.
The witch's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that I will try to exemplify here.
I ask my viewer to understand that in the following I let the same actress -
- portray many different patients of related nervous disorders.
I have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep.
Why did she always enact the very same thing she was most afraid she would do?
Like a witch forced by the devil, this woman -
- both when sleeping and awake - gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches.
Had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home?
She stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own.
Isn't there something "witch-like" with this sleepwalker, who moves through the slumbering household with her matches?
Doesn't she remind us of the nun, who walks through the chapel with her knife, forced by the Devil?
This poor woman, also in a bewildered condition, does during her sleep just what she fears the most.
These possessions - these somnambulistic, dazed conditions - are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria.
And there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person.
We remember for instance that the witch received nightly visitations by the Devil.
Today it is not the Devil, but rather a famous actor, a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor, who disturbs the calm of the night.
The hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window.
Notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed. A person afflicted by hysteria always displays some artificial mannerisms.
In the Middle Ages it was believed that during the Sabbath the Devil put some invisible marks on the witch's body, where all sensitivity vanished.
The executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused.
"I see clearly that you are a witch.
You do not even feel the master's instrument on your back."
Today, this strange insensitivity is considered a symptom of hysteria.
"No sir, I do not feel you touching my back at all."
"Yes, it is as I thought; your daughter is suffering from hysteria."
"From what you told me,
I must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic."
"It would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police."
Poor little hysterical witch.
In the Middle Ages you were in conflict with the church.
Now it is with the law.
"I ask you to step into my office."
"Or do you prefer that
I call the police?"
"Your name? Do you have a card?"
"Your address? Do you have a telephone in your home?"
"Thank you, that's fine. You can leave. I will contact you later."
"If my family learns about this,
I will be forcefully detained."
"I beg you to understand that
I am an unhappy, sick person.
I do not know what I am doing."
"I have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war.
I am a broken person."
"It is as if an unknown power compels me to commit this terrible theft."
"Look here  I just stole this little, expensively bound Russian book."
"What shall I do with it?
I do not know a word of Russian."
"My husband died in the war, and
I have not been the same since..."
"I promise not to pursue this matter, but I have to ask you never to visit my store again."
Centuries have passed and the Almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere.
We no longer sit in church staring terrified at the frescoes of the devils.
The witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops.
But isn't superstition still rampant among us?
Is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now?
We no longer burn our old and poor.
But do they not often suffer bitterly?
And the little woman, whom we call hysterical, alone and unhappy, isn't she still a riddle for us?
Nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or -
- if she is wealthy - in a modern clinic.
And then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly temperate shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times.

THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER based on stories by Edgar A. Poe sick... worried... my wife Madeline...
"I need someone to drive me to Usher tonight. "
In the nearly decaying manor-house,
Slr Roderick kept his wife Madeline in a strange seclusion, dominating her through his tyrannical disposition.
"No. I would not make my horse take a step further for all your Lordship's gold."
The oppressive melancholy of USHER'S surroundings seemed supernatural.
"The doctor."
The illness of Lady Madeline,
Roderick Usher's wife, baffled the skill of her physician.
As a result of a curious hereditary flaw, every Usher devoted himself to painting the portrait of his wife.
"It is there that she is alive."
"My dear Roderick, you are burning with fever."
"Her Grace is feeling tired and begs you to excuse her from the table. "
"It is there that she is alive."
Roderick was seized again by his strange impulse to paint.
His only thought was to be alone with Madeline, his sole model.
How could he get rid of his visiting and now unwelcome friend?
Twisted as by a tempest, the Usher's ancestral past weighed upon Roderick, who was the last survivor of the race, with all the weight of his heredity.
"My dear and only friend,
I am touched by your concern.
"But you too must take care of yourself.
"A few steps outside will do you good before you go to bed. "
Roderick's brush was like a magic wand.
Each stroke gave more life to the portrait while making Madeline more pallid, as though the young girl gave to the painted picture the very strength she was losing.
"This is indeed life itself."
Obsessed by all mysteries, Roderick had long meditated upon the theories of Magnetism.
"I tell you, Doctor. She may not be dead."
"She shall not leave me.
We shall bury her right here."
"I forbid, do you hear,
I forbid anyone to nail the coffin."
After the burial of Madeline, the hours, the days went by
In frightening dreariness and oppressive silence.
Tense and nervous, Roderick seemed to be waiting for a sign.
The slightest noise exasperated him...
Roderick dared not repeat the insane thought that oppressed him... Madeline...
This was a stormy night, charged with electricity.
There is a two-fold Silence.
One is bodily silence; be not afraid.
But should some urgent fate bring thee to meet his shadow, nameless elf, that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod no foot of man, commend thyself to God.
"Now can you hear her?"
"Roderick, you should not see that.
"Let me read you something to amuse you. "
And Ethelred uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made a path through the boards of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped...
And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pestilent breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing...
And now, the champion approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet, with a mighty great and terrible...
"Yes, I can hear. I have heard for a long time, since the first day... "
"We have put her alive in the tomb."

 El golem (1920) [ESP] sub spanish (this one is more stable).avi 681MB (714,752,000 bytes)
 which is re-encoded by me using VirtualDub ;)
 for the original one is a bit unstable when playing.
 and because the original file contains the audio data half as much as the video data
 when re-encoding, i used its audio data twice.
after all, this is a silent movie. u may never notice that ;) script :
 from another divx which is English subbed.
 and i added some which are not included in the English subbed divx
 by Babel translator. i don't know Spanish :)
so if you are good at Spanish, you'd better correct this sub.. author : feel_you (http://back.to/nineteen) tool : CCMP comment : 
 you can get this movie's script at http://www.monstrula.de/ or http://www.geocities.com/classicmoviescripts/.
 this sub. is made with the text of another divx above
 for there's no crucial difference between it and script at web.
 this movie Der Golem has two versions: the one made in 1915 and the other 1920
 and the divx above is the one made in 1920 not 1915.

Sanctuary of song lovers,
The Paris Opera House, rising nobly over medieval torture chambers, hidden dungeons, long forgotten.
Melody floats through hall and corridor, even to the executive offices, where a strange deal is being closed.
Now the Notary's seal, gentlemen, and you are the fortunate new owners.
It is barely possible you may hear of a ghost, a Phantom of the Opera!
The attendant of Box Five will not laugh when you ask about the opera ghost!
You jest, Messieurs! We are not children!
Who occupies Box Five?
I do not know.
I have seen only the cloaked figure of a man who hides his face and will not speak!
Is it the Phantom?
The Phantom! The Phantom is up from the cellars again!
We saw him for an instant...a gray shadow...and he was gone!
He had no nose!
Yes, he did, it was enormous!
That man came out of the cellars...just after we saw the Phantom.
Could it be that he...?
Joseph Buquet has really seen the Phantom! Let's ask him...
His eyes are ghastly beads in which there is no light... like holes in a grinning skull!
His face is like leprous parchment, yellow skin strung tight over protruding bones!
His nose...there is no nose!
Have a care, Buquet...ghosts like not to be seen or talked about!
Come, I'll show you where I saw him... in the scene-dock of the third cellar.
I saw him there! A flash of shadow, and he was gone!
My daughter, Carlotta has been insulted!
She, the favorite prima donna of the Paris Opera!
Mlle Carlotte,
Christine Daaé will sing the role of "Marguerite", Wednesday night!
Any jealous attempt on your part to interefere with the performance will prove disastrous to your career.
The Phantom
"No ghost will frighten Carlotta!
Wednesday evening you will hear her singing!"
Wednesday night found Mlle.
Carlotta strangely ill, and Christine Daae singing "Marguerite'.
"What is this I hear about Christine favoring some mysterious admirer. instead of you, Raoul?"
"Don't worry, my dear Brother- nothing shall interfere with our love.
"I hear alot of rumors, Raoul-be careful!"
"At last you have realized your ambition, my darling, and now we shall be married."
"I can never leave the Opera, Raoul.
You must forget out love."
From hidden places beyond the walls a melodious voice, like the voice of an angel, spoke to her.
"Christine tonight I placed the world at your feet!"
"To you I have imparted the full measure of my art.
You will triumph - all Paris will worship you!"
But I warn you, you must forget all worldly things and think only of your career - and your Master!"
"Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and command your love!"
"Call for me when you will. I shall be waiting."
In Mlle. Carolotta's correspondence there appeared another letter, edged in black!
Mlle Carlotta
If you appear tomorrow night you must be prepared for a great misfortune, and therefore I advise you to be "ill"
The Phantom
"Christine Daae's friends are plotting again!
But my daughter shall sing tomorrow night, come what may!"
My dear Managers -
The role of "Marguerite" shall be sung again tomorrow evening by Christine Daae, instead of Carlotta
The Phantom
P.S. If you refuse this you will present Faust in a house with a curse on it.
Encouraged by her mother, Carlotta defied every warning, and the following evening appeared as - "Marguerite'.
"So far so good - for a house with a curse on it!"
I cannot explain, but you must never intend to see me again. - Christine
"Beware! She is singing to bring down the chandelier!"
"Christine I have come for you -'
"I am ready, Master - waiting!"
Walk to your mirror, my dear - - have no fear!"
"Christine, it is I - your Master!"
"Look not upon my mask - think rather of my devotion which has brought you the gift of song."
A black lake, hidden from man and the sun, leading to the Phantom's rendezvous.
"I have brought you here - - five cellars underground -"
" - because I love you!"
"For long weary months I have awaited this hour!"
"So that which is good within me, aroused by your purity, might plead for your love."
"That is where I sleep."
"It keeps me reminded of that other dreamless sleep that cures all ills - forever!"
"You - Your are the Phantom!"
"If I am the Phantom, it is because man's hatred has made me so."
"If I shall be saved, it will be because your love redeems me."
"Men once knew me as Erik, but for many years I have lived in these cellars, a nameless legend."
Another Phantom Tragedy
Christine Daae Disappears
Opera Singer Mysteriously Vanishes Following Chandelier Disaster
The night passed - a night of vague horrors -- tortured dreams--
Christine
My dear Christine
You are in no peril as long as you do not touch my mask.
You will be free as long as your love for the spirit of Erik overcomes your fear.
Erik
Don Juan Triumphant
"Since first I saw your face, this music has been singing to me of you and of -
-- love triumphant!"
"Yet listen -- there sounds an ominous undercurrent of warning!"
"Feast, your eyes - glut your soul, on my accursed ugliness!"
"Oh, mad Christine, who would not heed my warning!"
"If you love me, as you say, let me go.
I promise to your slave forever!"
I shall prove tlo you the debth of my love.
You may return to your world for the present.
You may sing in the opera once more."
"But, remember, you are mine-mine-and you shall not see your lover again!
If you do, it is death to you both!"
"Oh, I swear it, I swear it! I shall never see him again!"
Although I gave my word never to see you again I must.
I will be at the Bal Masque tomorrow night, but not alone beware!
Christine
One night each year, all Paris mingled, forgetful of caste-- the merry. mad Bal Masque de l'Opera.
Into the midst of revelry, strode a spectral figure, robed in red.
"Beneath your dancing feet are the tombs of tortured men- this does the Red Death rebuke your merriment!"
High above Paris on the roof of the Opera!
Are we alone, Raoul? Can anyone overhear what we say?
I have seen him, Raoul! I have seen the Phantom!"
He is a monster- a loathsome beast!
You must saveme from him, Raoul!
Mlle. Carlotta, under the spell of his curse will never sing again.
Tomorrow I take her place in Faust.
After the performance you must take me away!"
I shall be at the stage door. We will flee to England.
She has betrayed me!
Not that way- this way!
That was the Opera ghost!
-ERIK-
Born during the Boulevard Massacre
Self educated musican and master of Black Art
Exited to Devil's Island for criminal insane
ESCAPED
NOW AT LARGE
This is your man. Monsleur le Prefect - The Phantom of the Opera!"
At nine o'clock the following evening a mysterious barouche stopped on the rotunda side of the Opera.
Wait for me at the west gate.
I have heard his voice once more, Raoul.
He knows our plans -- everything."
Believe in my love, Raoul. Save me from that monster - oh, save me!
My barouche is waiting outside.
We leave immediately after the performance!
Dry your tears, dear, and hasten -- you must make ready for your performance!
Come quick! The strangler's work again!
It was there!
I saw the body dangling in the air!
My brother - - poor Joseph, he knew too much about the Phantom!
The Punjab lasso - the strangler's cord!
Assassin! Hide yourself in the deepest shadows
- but I shall find you out!
Fear for his brother's safety, brought Comte de Chagny to the Opera house that night.
I think i can take you to Christine Daae
- if you do exactly as I tell you.
Who are you that knows the Phantom's secrets - and betrays them?
I am Ledoux of the Secret Police.
I have studied this Phantom for months.
I found his hiding place deep within the torture chambers where he himself was confined during the second Revolution.
Keep your hand up- the strangler's noose coils quick!
Your hand up - it is a matter of life or death
The discovery of this trap-door cost Joseph Buquet his life.
I am a messenger from the shadows
-- turn back ere ye perish!
You lied to me! Do you think you and your lover could cheat the Phantom?
Ungrateful fool! You have spurned the spirit that inspired you
-- the spirit that made you great!
Now, you shall see the evil spirit that makes my evil face!
No Longer like a toad in these foul cellarswill i secrete the venom of hatred -
- for you shall bring me love!
We should be within his hiding place, now.
We have fallen into the room of many mirrors-
- the old torture chamber!
I am human like other men -
- I will not be cheated of my happiness!
Raoul! Raoul! My Brother- where are you?
It seems we have callers.
Christine! Christine! Can you hear me?
Your voice sounds near-
Try to find a door that will lead to us.
Look about you - try to learn where he keeps the keys.
The callers have departed.
I have discovered the Phantom's hiding place
- tonight my brother will be avenged!
Did you hear voices?
Perhaps we have more callers.
Heat - intolerable heat!
Fools - do they think they can match their wits against Erik?
What do you offer for their lives?
Your answer. quick - they can survive but a few moments!
Gunpowder!
You have your chance of saving him. Will you be the bride of Erik, or do you prefer to watch your lover die?
Will you be the bride of Erik, or do you prefer to watch your lover die?
If you turn the Scorpion - you have said 'Yes' and spared de Chagny.
Turn the grasshopper -- and the Opera House is blown to a thousand bits!
I'll do anything you say, if you will only save them!

A German folk tale
Behold!
The portals of darkness are open, and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
"Back! Hold! Why dost thou scourge mankind with War, Plague, Famine?!"
"The Earth is mine!"
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God!"
"Look below!"
"All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil!"
"Dost thou know Faust?"
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed!"
"A wager: I will wrest
Faust's soul away from God!"
"If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!"
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
The devastating pestilence raged: in a few days half the town lay dying.
To find a cure for the Plague,
Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead.
"Lord God, bless this act of redemption!
Only you can alleviate our misery!"
"Help... help!
My mother is dying!"
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town.
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death!"
"Have respect for the dead!"
"We still live, we still love! We shall die dancing in each other's arms!"
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!"
"The Plague! The Plague!"
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!"
"Get hence! We are lost!
No faith is any help.
No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "
Mine God, thou art merciful and a great goodness.
The third great Key to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.
And if thou would summon the Prince of
Darkness to aid thee and give thee all the might and glory of the world, go to a crossroad and call on him three times.
"I invoke thy aid,
Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"
"Come forth, demon of evil!"
"As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear!"
"You have summoned me!"
"Here I am!"
I renounce God and his heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.
"Be gone from me, Satan!"
"To have the power to help for only one day!"
"One day! Try it!
Just one trial day!"
"When the hour-glass has run out... "
"... you go free, the Pact canceled! Sign!" glory... power
"Can you help the hungry and the sick?"
"What you wish I will perform: you are the master and I am your servant. "
"A drop of blood!"
"Blood is quite a remarkable substance!"
"Only for one day?"
"Until the sand has run out!"
"Faust! Help us!"
"Then I shall help in the devil's name!"
"A miracle! A miracle!"
"In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!"
"He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!"
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him! Stone him!"
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"
"You may not cheat me! Remember our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "
"Death sets all men free!"
"Is that death?"
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth. "
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek death? You have not yet lived!"
"I despise my life!"
"Your life was only the dust and mold of books! Pleasure is all!"
"I am too old!"
"I offer you the greateast happiness: youth! Seize it!"
"Give me youth!"
"I've caught you, old boy!"
"Take me to her!"
"Step upon my cloak... "
"... and the spinning Earth will spread before you!"
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of
Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"
"Strange guests!"
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"
"The day is over! The sand has run out!
Be as you were!"
"Youth... Leave me youth!"
"Our pact stands for eternity?"
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust! From indulgence to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you!"
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!"
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"
"Home!"
"Take me home! And at once!"
"Is today a feast day in your town?"
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter?"
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was!"
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest... she is not for you!"
"Tedeum laudamus
Praise the Lord. "
"Vacation, mother!"
"I know more obliging wenches. for you here!"
"I want only her.
Do as I command!"
"Brother Valentin!"
"Once she has this little golden chain in the house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"
"Any lovers yet?"
"What have you, child?"
"Tell the mother of God, if you cannot tell me!"
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
"Three little drops from this love potion by night and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found in my drawer... "
"A rich treasure!"
"I found it in my jewelry box!"
"Just once let me try on the beautiful necklace!"
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride!"
"Pardon, lovely lady.
I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"
"From your cousin... from Lombardy...!"
"He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!"
"Those we encircle within this ring shall be sweethearts...!"
"One, two, three.
Makes you free!"
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!"
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink as I learned it in Padua!"
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"
"He loves me...
...loves me not...
...loves me... "
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"
"She loves me... "
"She loves me not. "
"She loves you!"
"I am yours forever!"
"He loves me!"
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you!"
"Cursed matchmaker!"
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"
"To the prettiest girl in town!"
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister: long live Gretchen!"
"A pretty girl is not pure!"
"Here's to Gretchen!"
"Here's to your Gretchen!"
"If you hurry you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room. "
"Flee!... Flee!... you have murdered him!"
"Murder!"
"Murder... murder!"
"Murder... Murder... Murder!"
"Flee!... Flee! The deputes already seek the murderer!"
"Touch me not, you wanton, your lover has slain me!"
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot!"
"Gretchen... Gretchen!"
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes. "
"For now before the Judge severe
No crime can pass unpunished here. "
"All hidden things must plain appear. "
"Mother! Mother!"
"And has born a little child in the depth of winter. "
"Have mercy on my child!"
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"
"Mercy! Mercy! My child is dying!"
"She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!"
"Faust... Faust... help your Gretchen!"
"Mephisto!"
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers! She suffers!"
"To the stake with the child murderer!"
"Save her, save Gretchen!"
"Too late! Even now they build her funeral pyre!"
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken!"
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!"
"Faster! Faster!"
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!"
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant!"
"Be as you were: an old man!"
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"
"Gretchen!"
"Here is no place for thee!"
"I claim my wager!"
"One Word breaks thy pact!"
"Tell me the Word!"
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"
"Tel me the Word!"
Love
THE END
The Hands of Orlac
Beloved, In one day and one night I will again be with you.  I will hold you in my arms ... my hands will run over your hair
I will feel your body tremble under my hands
Orlac's concert 
Madam, it is 9 o'clock and the train arrives at 11
To Montgeron
He is alive!
It is 6:30, Professor.  Vasseur will be executed at 6 o'clock, and 8 minutes later the car will bring the body to the clinic.
A train accident.  Mr. Orlac is severely injured.
And yet there is hope. There is damage at the base of the skull, where we will operateà only à only his hands
The hands ... holy God ... the hands ...
Save his hands ... his hands are his life ....
Save his hands ... his hands are more important than his life.
Save his hands ...
I will try.
After only a short time, you can come home ... and sun, light and many flowers will greet you, when you come.
We will remove your bandages - a little at a time.  Today you will see your face again.
Your eyes - how I love you ... your hair ... and your hands ... your beautiful, dear hands ...
There ... his head ... doesn't he see my hands?
"Is he laughing?"
Now ... he is so strong!
Tell me, what are under these bandages?  What secret do they hide?
Well, then, in God's name, we will reveal the secret.
Can these hands ever play again?
The spirit rules the hands ... nature and a strong will can do anything.
Tomorrow ... back tomorrow! 
I will wait here ... his first kiss and the first stroke of his hands.
The last night.
Your hands were not saved ...
Dr. Serral gave you different ones.
The hands of the executed murderer Vasseur.
Is it true?  Do I have the hands of the murderer Vasseur?  
How much longer?
In half an hour.  No, only 30 minutes.
These hands will never strike a man again.  
How much longer
I love you ... I love you ...
Do you have the paper for January 15?
The murderer Vasseur before his judges.
Vasseur denied the act ... but the fingerprints which were found gave the real evidence.
The dagger, which was stuck into the heart of the old racketeer, bore the same X mark on the handle. 
Also, the dagger bore Vasseur's unmistakable fingerprints.  
The evidence was so clear that he received the death penalty.
I feel it also go out ... the arms spread ... until then in the soul ... cold, terrible, grim.
Twisted - twisted hands!
I don't want to save you?  I will not come ... not my ... no more ... 
I cannot any more ... you are coming to kill ... . but I will not follow your terrible orders any more ... no more
Don't come any closer to me!
Go away ... I will not listen to you any longer.
...Debauch your hands...
Don't mix ... away with your hands ... such murderer's hands ...
Take away your hands.  I don't want these terrible hands.
Creditors
Only wait a short time ... one month ...
I know it ... You demand blood  ... Crimes ... Murder ...
Only one week!
Men don't just control the hands ...
The head, the heart control the body ..., also the hands ...
Until tomorrow!
My hat and my coat ...
I am going to my husband's father.  He is rich ... he can help ... if he will ...
Don't go there ... he is an evil man ... he hates all men and even more so your husband ...
I can't leave anyone to him ...
At the least everyone from ... there
Mr. Orlac - you know, what bad luck has happened to him
Mr. Orlac - Paul cannot play now.  
So we are in need.  But Paul doesn't know ... help us.
He is your son ... your flesh and blood ... will you let us be ground in to the earth ...
Yes, I would like to see it!  I hate him ...
Mr. Orlac must himself go to see his father ... today!
How will madam pay ...
Beloved, yet one day and one night, and then I will be with you again.  I will hold you in my arms ... my ...
That was ... once ... my handwriting
After one day and one night, 
Go to your father ... today ... he must help us ... we can't go on ...
He refused to help ... and I have begged him so ... he is not a good man, your father ... he is evil.  I fear him..
Murder!
The murderer Vasseur's dagger!
The fingerprints of the criminal Vasseur!
Your sister is very ill ... come right away, if you want to see her while she is still alive ... come today ...
Vasseur's handwriting!
I do not know what secret he is going to give us.  
Vasseur has been dead for years, but his hands still live.
Paul Orlac, you are your father's heir.  
You will bring me a million tomorrow.  At this time!
Money?  Money?  
And therefore you follow me awake and in my dreams?
Why?
For my hands!
Who are you?
I am Vasseur, who was executed on July 13th.
The experiment that Professor Serral performed with your hands his assistant made off with my head.
If I don't get the million tomorrow at this time 
I will go to the State Prosecutor and tell him who your father's murderer is.
Who is the murderer?
You are ... Paul Orlac!
These fingerprints, which are clearly visible are the fingerprints of Vasseur.
And who has those fingers now - you, Paul Orlac!
The letter, which passed through all the servants in the house, was written by the hand of Vasseur, and this hand is now - your hand!
The dagger, with which the murder was done is Vasseur's dagger with the X.  
Your maid will swear, that she saw you with it - in your hand..
Perhaps you did not do the murder - but you cannot deny ....
What is  happening to me?  Am I crazy?
Won't you tell me what is bothering you?
I have the feeling, that these hands are drawing me ... to crime ....
I must bring him the money.
You will tell the State Prosecutor everything ...
Who will believe me?
They will believe you - as I believe you.
I go in a free man.
Wait, perhaps, and we will have news for the evening paper.
It is odd, but I don't know, whether I am experiencing reality or a dream.
It is odd, but I don't know, whether I am experiencing reality or a dream.
A stranger.
He was then executed ... I have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck.
He was then executed ... I have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck.
Mr. Orlac, we thank you for your evidence ...
Go this evening, bring the money with you to the stranger,
And we will follow you.
Someone well known to us - Mr. Nera, at last.  Assistant to Professor Serral,
One of the least talented crooks in the world.
I am also a blackmailer.  But, you are searching for the murderer?
Haven't you considered, that the murderer has Vasseur's hands ... I don't have those hands.
Haven't you considered, that the murderer has Vasseur's hands ... I don't have those hands.
I can tell you who has those hands.
Mr. Orlac, I arrest you!
Mr. Orlac is not guilty - Nera is the murderer.
Keep silent!
Explain the fingerprints of the executed Vasseur!
Nera was Vasseur's friend ...
He secretly made imprints of Vasseur's fingerprints 
And then he had rubber gloves made ... with Vasseur's fingerprints. 
And so he killed the elder Orlac ...
And so he killed the old racketeer and then made it look as if Vasseur had done it.  Vasseur is not guilty of the death.
If Vasseur was not guilty ... then my hands are pure ...
At the beginning of the Middle Ages the legend of the mandrake was born. 
According to legend, a root was transformed into a human being. 
We have to go out at night to find the root, when the clock strikes midnight. 
You should place the stick into the ground below the gallows. 
The root of the mandrake, with its strength and
Magic brought fortune to men, but misfortune and pain. 
His Excellency, Professor 
Jakob ten Brink was famous for his ability to experiment with the hereditary character of man. 
During my studies, I have found the legend of the mandrake, and now 
I look at this old superstition scientifically. 
We know the wind carries pollen from flower to flower ... without any will, without a certain goal. 
And thus was born in the laboratory the animal laboratory. I wanted to discover: Is character inherited from the parents or just by chance? 
I always say to my students: 
We should overcome the road open for experiments 
Teacher's Voronoff. XXX
Above all, we should pay attention to the results. Because then we open new possibilities for the study of humanity. 
Franz Braun, nephew of the teacher. 
Wouldn't these men just mock you, uncle? 
On the contrary! It would be the biggest experiment of my life: 
Creating a man in the laboratory. 
A being with a hereditary character that does not come influenced by the parents. 
The woman must be of the same qualities as the land fertilized under the gallows, the "mandrake" must come from the dregs of society
While the prison administration got a man for the professor, 
Franz Braun was looking for women for his uncle needed to perfect the experiment. 
Alraune, daughter of sin ... from the dark days of superstition. 
Franz Baum his uncle was looking for the ideal woman he needed for his experiment 
I am warning you. Forget that your plan violates nature, the finest of life ... 
Beware: the legend of the mandrake is real! It will become a living being, but it lacks the warmth of life, and bears the cold of death inside. 
I tell you, the legend of the mandrake is true.
It is a living being that lacks the warmth of life and bears the cold of death within itself. 
Be on guard ... 
... consequences of your action ... 
Nature will have her revenge! 
Alraune be educated at school 
Convent of the Sacred-Heart. 
I cannot do this to my parents! 
I want to do everything you want. 
On the bank of the Industry and Credit. 
Mom sends you greetings. 
And the Mandrake? 
The evolution of Mandrake. 
24 October 1908 
It is a success, with the help of my nephew, the creation of a Mandrake root. 
He is a dreamer, I, by contrast, am a man of science ... I am above prejudice. 
According to legend, the mandrake brings fortune and wealth. Today I have selected a name: Alraune ten Brink. 
It is blasphemy ... and you will be punished.
Alraune disappears without a trace ... 
-School of the Sacred Heart convent. 
I want champagne! 
At one stop, Alraune lies for the first time to people from a traveling circus. 
Aren't you afraid of a mouse? 
After months of investigation, 
Alraune ten Brink was found. 
In the end, I knew I would succeed. 
Alraune, doesn't it embarrass you? 
I'm scared of you. 
You used to be my nephew. We moved away until your story was forgotten. 
Enough of this visit by a gentleman. 
Who do you think is your father? 
I offend, Alraune. 
If you knew where you came from!  
... and then presented in high society.
Father, come here! 
Surprisingly, father, we seem so little alike. 
Do I look more like my mother? 
Yes ... I think of your mother often. 
What if she looks like her mother? 
Never! 
Dear lady, I want to ask the professor for you hand. 
Sorry, sir ... Alraune is yet very young and should remain with me. 
Tonight at eleven I flee with her. 
What a shame ... An experiment by a cynical scientist ... a daughter of vice and crime. 
What is my place among men? 
I play him. I get even with him. 
You are right ... I stayed with him. 
Dear Dad, I think you're jealous. 
His letter was brought to me here. 
In the diary of my "father" I read everything that happened before my birth. 
Have mercy on me ... 
I want to know everything. 
I'll give you everything you want, but we go from here. 
Alraune ... you and me ... 
You're a cheater! What were you thinking? 
I have now learned that this woman is not you daughter. 
I cannot deceive you. 
You must stay with me, or I will kill you ... 
Dear Professor! It is as if a ghost followed you ... as if a devil wanted to harm another. 
All speculation has failed ... 
She has destroyed ... 
Come to the gaming table, Alraune. 
You will bring me luck. 
Play red, the color of good fortune. 
Red five times in a row. 
Place your bets! 
For the ninth time the ball has landed on red. 
I want to leave. 
We have not lost everything yet, Alraune. 
We still have your jewels. 
We have not lost everything, Alraune.
We still have your jewelry.
Yes ... but not with you ... 
Take me out of here ... 
Give me another soul, a heart ... and I will become a human being and love as a human being. 
Alraune began a new life together the one she loved. And the one who violated the laws of nature, fell into a hell of loneliness and insanity.

NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE
According to Bram Stokers Dracula.
Adapted freely by Henrik Galeen.
Realisation:
F. W. Murnau
Costumes and decorations:
Albin Grau
ACT I
Report on the great mortality which prevails in Wisborg in the year of grace 1838
It is words lugubrious like the call of a bird of death.
Take care not to say them or your life will be populated shades and the phantoms which will haunt your dreams will be nourished of your blood.
I reflected a long time with the mortality which had struck my birthplace.
Here its history.
In Wisborg lived Hutter and his young woman Ellen
"Why you killed... these beautiful flowers?"
"Not so quickly, my young friend!
Nobody escapes from his destiny."
There was certain Knock, realtor.
All kinds of noises ran on him.
But it paid its people well.
"count Orlok, the lord of Transylvania... wishes to buy a beautiful house in our city..."
"You could earn much money..."
"Even if that costs a little efforts, of sweat... and perhaps a little blood... "
"He would like a beautiful abandoned house..."
"This house... opposite yours.
Propose it to him!"
"you start, my young friend, and made happy voyage to the country of the phantoms."
"I leave to travel far, to the country of the robbers and the phantoms."
Hutter left the concerned young woman
Under the protection of
Harding the ship owner & his sister
"Would be without fear."
After having traversed many dusty roads, the young person Hutter finally saw the summits of Carpates the horses tired.
"I have to eat... quickly.
I must go to the chateau of the count
Orlok!"
"do not go further. there are werewolf  in the wood."
VAMPIRES
Malfaisants spirits with the damned heart
Nosferatu nourishes on human blood.
It lives in the caves and in coffins, in the ground maudite of the cemeteries of Pestiférés
"more quickly!
The sun drops!"
"Pay what you want!
We will not go further!"
"let us not go there!
This place is sinister!"
As soon as Hutter had crossed the bridge, its fears, that it had entrusted to me, were not long in materializing.
"You made me wait.
It is almost midnight.
The servants sleep!"
END Of ACT I
ACT II
"You hurt yourself... Invaluable blood!"
"do you Want to hold me a little company, very expensive?
"There remains time until the rising of the sun and the day, my good,
I sleep of the deepest sleep." the paddle dissipated the shades of the night.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far. the mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle but is not worried.
At night, a spectral light seemed to animate the castle.
"Your wife has a splendid neck..."
"I buy the abandoned house...
We will be close... "
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims.
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams.
At the same time
"a doctor... a doctor!"
"a benign congestion." the doctor allotted the anguishes of Ellen to an unknown disease.
But I know that your heart answered the call of the bird of death.
Nosferatu unfolded its wings.
Hutter sought to include/understand the terror of its nights. the boatmen did not know which terrible burden they went down in the valley.
END Of ACT II
ACT III
"Of the peasants transported it yesterday, at the hospital.
They say that it made a fall.
It is still feverish..."
"Of the coffins..."
Nosferatu was on the way.
The danger approached Wisborg. professor Bulwer, who studied the secrecies of nature, had spoken to me about it.
One had charged on Empusa of the coffins filled with ground. ship must even take the sea this night
Loading of Empusa Destination: Wisborg
At the same time, professor Bulwer explained to his pupils the cruelty of the plants carnivores. the secrecies of nature appeared in horrified eyes.
"is not this... like a vampire!"
It seems that the approach of malfaisant Nosferatu the realtor had a knock on influence.
"yesterday the patient had a delerious crisis."
"blood, it is the life!"
"See this one..."
"polyp with tentacles..."
"Transparency... Almost incorporeal... "
"A few things close, a phantom..."
"Of the spiders...!"
Ellen often walked in the loneliness of the dunes.
Its sadness flew away towards its beloved, while its eyes scanned the waves and the horizon.
My love! My beloved! would not be sad to know me with far.
The mosquitos are a true plague, they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle, but is not worried
"Now, I must leave... to regain the house as fast as possible!"
New epidemic of Black plague in the seaports.
Young people are decimated in mass.
All the victims carry the same wounds to the neck whose origin is still a enigma for the doctors.
Dardanelles are closed with all the suspect ships.
"a sailor is sick. The fever makes him delirious." the first sailor reached of this disease involved all the crew with him, in the black tomb of the waves
The evening, the captain and his second immersed their last comrade.
"I go down! If I am not there in ten minutes..." the ship of death had a new captain.
END Of ACT III
ACT IV
In spite of its weakness,
Hutter overcame the difficulties of the voyage the funeral breath of Nosferatu inflated the veils of the ship which sailed a such spectrum towards its goal.
"I must join it. It arrives!"
"the Master arrives..."
I wondered a long time about these coffins filled with ground that Nosferatu had carried. the vampires were to rest in this damned ground to preserve their diabolic capacities.
"It does not have there heart which lives on board."
July 12.The crew: a captain, a leading seaman, a foam, five sailors.
July 13. A sailor reached of fever.
Cape: south, south-west.
Direction of the wind: the North-East.
July 14. State of the sailor worsens.
The fever makes him delirious.
July 22. Rats on board. Danger of plague.
"Danger of plague!
Return on your premise! You barricade!"
Opinion with the population.
The plague is in the city. do not leave your houses. The burgomaster.
END Of ACT IV
ACT V
Hutter begged Ellen to give up the book which frightened it so much.
But it could not resist strange temptation.
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims
Take guard that its demonic shade does not torment your dreams. another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
"I have the same vision, each evening...!" the fear reigned on all the city.
Which was still healthy? Who was sick?
"I run to seek Sievers..." another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart by offering her blood to him would make the vampire forget the song of the cock
The terrified city sought a victim: it was Knock.
"One saw it! It fled!
It strangled the guard... "
"It strangled it... the vampire!"
"Bulwer! Will seek Bulwer!"
"One captured Knock!"
"the Master... the Master...!"
"the Master...... died."
At the same moment, as by miracle, deaths ceased and, in the victorious rays of the morning sun, one saw disappearing the shade from the bird of death.
END
Please! Take me with you!
Hey! Take me!
Hey!
Lift up the ramp.
Do not leave me here, dad!
Save yourself, Gwynplaine!
You can't come with us.
Your presence would cause us trouble.
But I'll be back.
I promise!
Please dad, don't leave me here!
You will survive!
And I will find you!
You are a part of me.
Hello there!
Open the door!
Help us!
Don't die! Please don't die!
Be quiet damn wolf!
What are you doing there?
Have no place to go?
Oh, not everyone can be happy. Keep walking, you will find another village.
There you'll find better accommodations.
- I�m just coming back from there.
No one helped me.
- Oh, but listen to this... there great Christian charity.
Well, come inside. Come on.
It's cold.
Come on!
What are you hiding there?
Ah, great, that was missing.
Where is she from?
- Not far from here.
Her mother died from cold.
Died? At least she's happy.
Hmm ...
The snow made her blind.
For her is always night.
Dea. Let's call her Dea.
What about you, what's your name?
Gwynplaine.
- Gwynplaine?
Who did this to you?
The Doctor.
Monsieur Jean ... Pablo.
Is the Doctor Hardquanonne?
The head of the "comprachicos"?
You don't remember anything, do you?
- No.
Not even your parents?
What have they done to me?
Have you never seen it?
Your face looks like one from a Gargoyle.
But don't worry.
It doesn't make you less human. rheumatism, insomnia, tuberculosis ...
Every evil has its cure in a leave, in a root or or in a herb.
Even leprosy or the plague...
Sir, I see you suffer from gout.
Do you know that there is a tree that could heal you?
You talking about lime tea?
He's not gonna understand you.
To those magical words?
It has no use!
I see the lady knows herbs as well.
Lime tea but with which kind of flower?
Queen of the meadows?
The Queen of the meadows!
This name fits with you.
But against gout is the elderberry flower.
Plants have no secrets with me.
The consultation is free.
But do not forget, tomorrow at dawn, will be too late.
I will be gone by then.
Do you think it will work here?
I hope so.
We need money.
Come on, move!
Hmm .. a cat?
No.
And this?
What is it?
You know.
A. .. a wolf?
Almost.
Small, long ...
A fox.
Bravo.
Gwynplaine, he is hungry.
Don't worry, he will be done in a minute.
There is a farm near the village.
Give them this and they will give you six eggs and a bottle of milk.
Can I go?
No, it's too dangerous for you.
Go now, run!
Don't forget your scarf.
The scarf!
Do you have a cleft lip?
Thank you, ma'am.
Take off the scarf.
We want to see your cleft lip.
Did you hear? Take it off.
Take this off!
- Stop!
Come on, get him!
Monster! Monster!
Monster! Monster!
Monster!
You should not leave the house!
Leave him or I send the wolf!
Get out of here, you bastards!
Gwynplaine, Gwynplaine!
Gwynplaine, are you okay?
Are you okay?
- Yes, allright.
People are not necessarily bad.
Only when they are afraid.
Everything that is different, unusual, scares them.
As you grow older your smile will become more visible.
And people will be more scared of it.
And they will reject you.
That's why you have to always wear the scarf.
Understand?
Do you think I never had reason to cry?
However, this one you see now in front of you, never, never cried.
I cooked a stew.
Don't need to eat the roots.
It's only to take off the bitterness.
Mmmm!
Mmmm!
God protects only our souls.
But the well-being of our body is a matter for nature.
Gwymplaine, I'm hungry.
For all evils there are cures.
Infusions, potions, inhalations ... poultices, gargles.
Knowledge passed down from father to son since the time of the druids.
The consultation is free. The price of herbs depends on its rarity.
That having been said, as a nomad, I know the value of a piece of bacon or half a dozen eggs.
Observe the face of this child.
Look! He was possessed by the devil and  he was exorcised.
The devil was cast out of your body with a large explosion.
This laughter was indelibly marked in your face for eternity.
Since then, this boy can fight against the evil eye.
A single strand of his hair is enough to end any big eye.
Five cents for a piece of his hair.
Come on, there's enough for everyone.
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!
A ... five cents!
Five cents!
The capital of the kingdom.
If there's people in all those houses it'd take a lifetime to meet them.
But why did we have to come here?
Fame.
The success of "The Man Who Laughs".
The country became small for us.
No shame in admitting that.
The most frequented places are those offering a bigger chance of success.
You decide, Gwymplaine.
Let's go!
Come on, speak up! 
What do you see?
It's ...
It's wonderful!
What is it?
- A musician.
He is playing with a saw.
A saw to cut trees.
Thank you.
My dear public, the man you are about to see, is called Gwymplaine.
As a child, Gwymplaine was abducted by
"comprachicos". who mutilated his lips.
He had never seen his face.
From that day on, Gwymplaine decided to hide his face forever ... in order to not insult the daylight.
It's starting to get full.
On a stormy day ...
- More and more people. the carriage of a Prince got lost in the forest and fell inti a ravine.
Only his daughter, blind, has survived.
Then came the spring.
As she was blind, he was not afraid she could see his face.
For one good thing, another bad one.
They participated in the universal law which is ... to please oneself ... to seek oneself... and to find oneself.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Can you hear it? It worked! It worked.
- Yes, it worked.
Go back, they're waiting.
Go! Go!
Gwymplaine! One portrait, just one portrait!
Great for him!
You will see, soon he's gonna be overimpressed by this success.
Hi there! I would love to have my neighbors for longer!
What you mean? - I imagine you will be sailing off tomorrow,
But you're coming with us.
You are part of the show now.
I can't stay there anymore.
I need fresh air.
Come with me.
We leave through the back.
Go.
This way.
Thank you.
Are we close to the water?
Yes, it is a river.
The moon is reflecting on it?
Yes.
Must be nice.
It is very ... very romantic.
It looks so beautiful.
The water shines like a clear mirror.
Gwymplaine.
I'm afraid.
Of what?
- Fear of losing you in this city.
There are too many people.
Many things that I do not understand.
Do not worry.
No one can separate us.
You notice that we don't spend much time together anymore?
Like when we were kids.
That's because ... we are no longer children.
Sometimes I think on certain things ...
Thoughts that I shouldn't have.
Why?
Thoughts that a brother cannot have for his sister.
But you are not my brother.
And I have these thoughts, too.
You wouldn't have these thoughts if you could see how ugly I am.
Ugly?
What does it mean to be ugly?
Hurting is ugly.
And you just make me good.
In our shows ... when you hear people laughing, they are laughing at me.
Because of my face.
It's disgusting.
You are wrong.
They laugh because you make them laugh.
You also make them feel good.
I can't sleep.
Can I sleep with you?
Hm-hmm.
Dea.
Hm?
What happened between us was not a good idea.
Let's stay as before.
We have always been happy together, no?
There is nothing better in the world than to be with you.
I think so, too.
You know what is most important in the world to me?
You are at the same time my sister and my daughter.
I like to think like that.
Are you sleeping, Ursus?
Like it was easy.
Don't you think we look happy, the three of us together?
I have never been happy in my life.
Not even about myself.
I'm only proud of my dry eyes.
I never cried in my life.
Never.
Not for me, not for others.
And you are happy, right?
See that no one sees you. Be discreet, try to be smaller than you already are.
Happiness will shine through your ass, then.
What are with these caresses?
And also I'm tired.
Looks like a goddess.
It is more than a goddess.
It's a duchess.
Attracting the royalty is the first step towards glory.
We should excel ourselves.
- What for?
Well, she knows princes, princesses. Even the queen!
The crowned heads have always been the best clients of "comprachicos".
The court loves the monstruous. Be monstruous and you will excel yourself.
In her castle, Dea fell more and more in love with Gwymplaine.
And with Gwymplaine, was the same.
He loved her.
They could not live without each other.
Night after night he could be seen wandering along the river.
One night he managed to infiltrate in the palace gardens,
Dea, feeling his presence, left her room and went downstairs.
Gwymplaine!
Finally!
Gwymplaine was for Dea a brother, a friend, a guide.
Where everyone could only see a monster, she saw an Archangel.
You are so beautiful!
Her blindness could in fact see his soul.
If you had eyes to see me, you would be scared of my ugliness.
The view is something that hides the truth?
I see nothing,
I feel.
How do you dare to provoke the Duchess like this?
Whether to ban the show?
And what about that endless kiss?!
They can censor us because of it.
Do whatever you want behind the curtains, but not in front of them.
A lot of things we do in front of the curtains we do because you tell us to.
This has nothing to do with censorship.
And also I am the author.
It was the Duchess who provoked me, with her air of contempt over everyone!
The world is like that.
There's no point in making a scene.
Go give attention to the public.
And let the duchess alone!
Everyone is excited about Gwymplaine ... but, for me, you were radiant.
They are all talking about the Duchess.
- She must be very beautiful, no?
More than that.
So that's why.
- How so?
I am blind but I know when you are looking at me.
And you weren't looking at me earlier when I was talking to you.
Dea, I spend my life looking at you.
As soon as I open my eyes you are the first thing I see.
Well, I'm gonna have a walk by the river.
Take this. It will be good for you.
You shouldn't get so attached to
Gwymplaine.
Men are hard to be understood.
Especially when they are successful.
It is dangerous to live only by one person.
Happy are those who can be happy only with themselves.
You'll feel better in a minute.
Gwymplaine!
When you were with "comprachicos", don't you remember seeing a girl she's about two years.
Redhead with some problem in her eyes.
No.
I don't remember.
Sir.
Someone is waiting for you.
Follow me, please.
Come on in, Gwymplaine.
Because of you I had a wonderful evening.
You made me laugh ...
You touched me ... and disturbed me.
You were less shy early on the scene.
Had more spark in your eyes.
What do you want from me?
- Your smile.
When I look at you ...
I feel inside of me a fingernail scratching a blackboard.
I love it.
I've heard the court loves the monstruous.
It is true. Do you know why?
- So they forget themselves?
Not only that.
The uglier the more fascinating.
You fascinate me.
You attract me.
Don't you think I'm disgusting?
- On the contrary.
I like you,
Gwymplaine.
No man has ever looked at me like you do.
When you look at me I feel pure.
No one can hear us, no one can see us ...
Kiss me.
Kiss me as if I were Dea.
Madame ...
I'm glad you enjoyed our show.
I'm yours.
Sorry, Dea.
I could never make you happy.
I just can't.
Only you can make me happy.
Maybe not.
What about Sylvain?
I really like him.
But if I can't hear your voice ... or feel your presence ...
I will have no more reason to live.
The love of a Princess for a monster coming from the obscurity.
In vain the two lovers tried to hide.
But they were discovered ... and Leviathan was punished.
Gwymplaine.
Because God took from them the small piece of paradise they had, they could only be together on the other side.
They left behind them a trail of pain.
That's the lesson of this fable.
Life is but a long loss of those we love.
Goodbye, Dea!
If I had been rich ... and noble as you, they would have allowed us to love.
The princes, princesses, the duchess, can fall in love with their servants.
But what if a servant dares to love someone of a higher class?
You will punished!
The hell of the poor is the paradise of the rich.
What has gotten into you?
Want to get us in trouble?
I say only what you taught me!
If what you want is to insult who you feel attracted to, just forget it.
I knew you would come back.
So?
Will you dare to get what you came after?
That's not what I want.
Oh, Gwymplaine.
No man has ever made me feel this way.
You are the solution to my boredom.
I will bring you to the Court.
You will present your show to the Queen.
You will be rich in a matter of days.
These fairs will be only a vague memory.
No, ma'am.
The court is not a place for me.
I belong here, to these fairs.
I offer you the Court and wealth and you refuse?
Yes.
I offer myself to you and you say no?
Here is where I belong. Your presence here is an insult to poverty.
Go back to your paradise.
And please, don't ever come back.
Ursus?
Gwynplaine?
Who's there?
What do you want?
Where is Gwynplaine?
He left.
Do not hurt Gwynplaine.
Who are you?
I'm just a ...
I'm his father.
You're not his father.
- And you are not his sister.
What difference does it make if there's love involved?
You are not welcome here,
Doctor Hardquanonne. - Ursus!
I am here because of a promise.
What promise?
Of one day come back for him.
He will never leave us.
He hates you.
I cast his flesh, shaped his spirit.
He is my work, my creation.
My son.
- Never! He will never be with you.
He loves Dea and "The Man Who Laughs".
He loves success.
He loves to see the shining eyes of the public.
Especially the eyes from the beautiful duchess.
You also noticed it, didn�t you?
Ursus!
Hello, Gwynplaine.
It's him!
It's him.
He is Dr. Hardquanonne.
The head of the "comprachicos".
He kidnapped my daughter.
Where is my daughter?
Killer!
Where is my daughter?
His victory will be brief,
Ursus!
Gwynplaine will lose, just like you.
Gwynplaine!
Think about it again. Let's not waste this chicken with golden eggs.
It's already decided.
Right Dea?
Yes, I'm looking forward to going back to our old life.
Listen to the wind hitting against the trees.
But it's not worth to leave now.
Just when Boucharet started ...
To attract the court?
We have more to do than to entertain the duchess.
Enough, Gwynplaine.
Stay with Dea, marry with her.
Have a child with her. Two, three!
To educate them, bathe, put to sleep ...
And they will scream and run around you.
Because our creations are alive!
Think about all of this!
Who among you answers to the name of Gwynplaine?
I am Gwynplaine.
On behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, please follow me for a hearing in the Supreme Court.
He is my kid. 
I�m coming too.
No, sir.
Any attempt to obstruct this will be punished.
Gwymplaine.
Once again I'm leaving you.
Only this time I won't be back.
It is him.
Lord Marquis of Clancharlie ...
I'm Barkilphedro, your valet.
I served your father.
I saw you being born.
And your father, God rest his soul, went against the king.
The monarch thought he could make your father surrender by kidnapping you.
You were only two years old.
Your father refused to give in to blackmail...
And the king, in retaliation, sold you to Dr. Hardquanonne ... so he could make you ...
Gwymplaine.
I lived all my life,
Gwymplaine, surrounded by children.
And I've never got attached to any of them.
With you ...
I always felt there was something... different.
I will be available to your lordship, day and night, in order to help you have your kingdom back ...
Excuse me ... Gwymplaine.
The young man you brought here earlier.
Where is he?
You can close your business,
Gwymplaine is dead.
Gwymplaine.
Why he had to say those things? Why to be such a rebel? What imprudence!
He was supposed to stay hidden, not to expose himself!
They found him in the end.
He's dead!
He is dead! They killed him!
Gwymplaine, my boy, my son!
My son is dead!
Is your Lordship looking for something?
Yes, the exit.
The exit?
I want to go home, tell my family I'm fine.
We are in the castle Clancharlie.
As the sole heir of the Clancharlie, you are at home.
This is your home.
My name Barkilphedro, I'm your ...
- Valet, I know.
Is there any law that forces me to accept this heritage?
Hmm .. no.
So I rather go back to my old life.
- I respect your choice ... but I'm not sure you ... really understand what you are about to give up to.
Come and see.
All this is yours.
The vineyards, but also the hills back there.
From the river to the border with the kingdom, everything belongs to you.
Castles, forests, farms and villages included.
And all this is mine?
- Yes, it is.
And the title and privileges.
What do I do with all this?
Whatever pleases your lordship.
No. My place is on the stage next to mine.
You are not only rich.
You are powerful.
Powerful?
Why powerful?
You have a seat in the parliament.
In the Parliament?
Can I change the laws?
- Yes, like any parliamentarian.
I must have a carriage too.
- Indeed, several.
Wanna know the exact number?
- No.
I want you to prepare me one.
I will get Ursus and Dea at the fair.
They need to know that.
I'm not sure here would be the place for such people.
They are my family.
I will never leave them.
I'm gonna get them.
- It's not possible.
Not possible?
I have the power to change the laws ... but not to leave my own house.
But you can't leave. The Queen is coming tonight with all the court.
You have to get ready for her.
The Queen comes to visit me?
Of course.
And if you want to take your seat at the Parliament, before you must officially receive your title.
And when is the next session?
- In a few days.
If we send a carriage to your friends ... they could attend to the reception tonight.
Very good!
I'm counting on you,
Barkilphedro.
I am here to serve your Lordship.
Sylvain is there.
Good morning, Sylvain.
Morning.
Can you play a bit?
Yes.
More.
Wherever he is right now, he is living like a prince.
He's waiting for me next to a marble staircase.
Dea, Gwymplaine will always be in your heart, as well in mine.
But he didn't turn into a prince.
He is not waiting for you in a castle, nor he's coming with a carriage.
Sir Ursus and Madam Dea,
The Marquis de Clancharlie, known to you as Gwymplaine, invites you to join him in his
Castle Clancharlie.
A carriage is waiting at the entrance of the fair.
Your mother.
My mother?
Is she still ...
- No, she died giving birth ... when the Lord came into the world.
She looks sad.
Your father!
Member of Parliament!
A painting of you shortly before the kidnapping.
If memory serves me, the painter almost went crazy, because it was hard to make you stand still.
So, how is the castle?
- If that's the one... looks wonderful.
It is almost as great as the palace of the Queen.
Must be immense, as in fairy tales.
There will be guards in uniform, with flags all the way.
It's exactly like that.
I saw it in my dreams.
It looks just like your dreams.
Look at me.
And the queen?
I introduce myself to her?
The Queen has just informed that state affairs have retained her in the palace.
Ah ...
What a pity.
I had so much to tell her.
I was gonna tell her about all the misery I saw in the kingdom.
I'm sure she has no idea.
With your permission, your Honor.
I will go to my room.
Your Lordship the Marquis of Clancharlie.
How ugly!
Is the scarf covering his mouth?
No, his face is uncovered.
Looks like the ass of a monkey.
Unclean!
Repulsive. Abject.
I think it's horrible.
I miss you so much!
I have so much to tell you!
I'm a Marquis now! 
Can you imagine that!
Come with us.
Do not stay here with these people.
They pretend to respect you.
- You are wrong.
They are sufficiently educated to accept me as I am.
You're the blind one.
They are sufficiently educated to hide what they really think.
Inside they all think the same as our public. Even worst.
The duchess has just arrived and wants to see you.
You should come see her.
Here my title gives me the right to show my face.
In the Court or in the Parliament.
My son, you bit the golden fruit.
You'll end up spitting ashes.
So, my cousin?
It seems that now we are cousins.
Should we follow the protocol?
I enjoyed "The Man Who Laughs" in the fair. I really did.
Girl, you look like what all women want to see on the other side of the mirror.
The image of purity.
I'm sorry to have to take him ... but royal life is filled with tedious obligations.
Come, my cousin.
It's time for the toast.
To fate, that gave me back my title, my family, and my possessions.
To my father, who always trusted me.
In all circumstances.
To my cousin, who we missed so much.
Finally he is with his real family.
You are so beautiful.
As much as Dea?
It's not the same thing.
- I know.
Dea is pure and intact.
She is beautiful like an angel.
Untouchable.
I am beautiful like a woman.
A woman you want.
You want to touch, you want to caress.
Gwymplaine ... we were made for each other.
The monster that you are outside,
I am inside.
I was looking for you.
We wait our driver to take us back home.
Ah!
The Marquis finally escaped from his obligations.
And he is resting now.
If you wish to go and meet him ...
Oh no! Only Dea is requested by your lordship.
For now.
You can go.
Walk a few steps ahead.
The Marquis, or rather Gwymplaine will be waiting for you.
Just behind the bed.
Oh, Gwymplaine ...
I love you.
Say it again!
I love you!
Hey, guys!
Look at what we got here!
Stop! Are you looking for the exit?
Yes!
- Then follow me.
Follow me, milady.
Come, come on.
Come, come ...
No, no, here, here ...
This way.
Over here!
Just do not lose anything.
Let's have some fun.
Let's dance.
Let her go!
Stop it!
I will smash your heads!
Cowards!
It's with the weak that the mean show his worst side.
Come, Dea.
Cowards!
Even when we don't see you you are present anyway, Barkilphedro.
Something I have in common with the ghosts.
Or with the rats.
- Do not be so severe, Lady Duchess.
We have common interests.
Common interests?
If Gwymplaine renounce to his title you lose your yours of chamberlain.
If he leaves you will be nothing.
This is your interest.
What would be mine, in your opinion?
I noticed lady feels something ... different for your cousin.
You may not like very much to see him back with the young Dea.
I do not need you,
Barkilphedro.
And I never asked you to serve me this young lady's head on a tray.
I would offer you her soul.
But I wasn't asked to.
Your servility disgusts me.
I don't want to harm Gwymplaine.
His fate now no longer interests me.
I received this from the coachman who drove the artists.
He was told to deliver it to the Marquis.
Gwymplaine,
I know you have to do what your heart says.
We will wait as long as it on Thursday.
I know you will come back.
I know that your tenderness, your trust and your love are the most important parts of the fortune you will always have.
Ursus and Dea.
Give a good money to this driver ... and tell him that his duty was accomplished.
Hey!
No one disturbs the Marquis.
I hope that Your Lordship slept well.
I wish you a great day.
Your breakfast will be served in a minute.
Take it as you get ready for the day as there are several hearings scheduled.
Are Ursus and Dea comfortable?
Oh, your lordship did not know?
They returned last night.
Despite of our insistence.
It was my fault, I should have taken care of them myself.
Well, I'm going to see them.
Ursus left you a letter.
Gwymplaine,
We don't belong to the same world anymore.
Each must live in his.
You found your destiny, and we must follow ours.
I prefer to be among artists than with the royalty..
Dea can not compete with a duchess.
Let's leave it like this, it will be better.
Be happy if you can. 
And forget us.
It's not possible.
I'm going to talk to them.
They will understand.
They left the city this morning.
No one knows where to.
I'm sorry your lordship.
Thank you, my cousin, for this deliciously melancholy concert.
My cousin, I need to talk to you.
Unfortunately
I do not have time to hear it.
Last night you had time.
Last night I wanted everyone to know how abject I am.
Today they all know.
I know you loved me... in your own way.
I can have the man I want.
The most beautiful, the most brilliant.
But a man grotesque and ridiculous a disgraceful man, was great.
Do not forget that I am just like you.
Better, you are my mirror.
If my soul could talk it will laugh.
Now I see your true face.
And I love as you are, anyway.
Do you love me?
Your laughter is sadder than mine.
Gwymplaine.
The Marquis de Clancharlie.
Your Majesty ... members of the parliament.
I am the Marquis of Clancharlie.
But my real name is a name from the poor:
Gwymplaine.
Some of you knew my father.
I've never met him.
I am a miserable, made from a great man, by a king for his work and grace.
But my heart is not here.
But I felt I need to address myself to you.
Why?
To warn you.
Gentlemen, I'm here to tell you the latest news!
The human race exists!
Lower the look.
Look around you, beneath you.
You are marching on thousands of heads.
Observe the laws you create.
Yes, people are terrible.
There is unemployment everywhere.
We want grimace, not speeches.
Minstrel! Shaker!
Clown! Get out of there!
Idiot!
Laugh, yes laugh louder!
I've already suffered all contempt one could.
I grew up in the poverty.
And shivered in the winter.
The hunger, I had a taste of it.
I drank the shame.
And I will vomit it on you.
Enough Sir Clancharlie!
Stop immediately with this, unworthy of a gentleman.
Honor your position!
Majesty!
What they have done to my face, you do with people.
They are mutilated.
You deformed their rights, their justice, their truth, and reason and intelligence.
As I am deformed because my mouth.
Look at me.
I am the people.
Take care, Your Majesty!
The real lord will come knocking at the door.
Clown!
Laugh as much as you can, gentlemen!
One day you won't be masters anymore.
No more kingdom!
No more unequality.
No more ignorance!
And courtisans, and ballet, and the king!
Only freemen and the light!
Go back to your cage!
And you go back to your wealth!
To your indigestion!
One day we'll eat your guts!
We will eviscerate you. With our teeth we will rip your hearts off.
My dear.
My child.
If you could leave behind an illness the same way we leave a city ... you could hear the breeze knocking on the trees.
Unfortunately Gwymplaine left.
And here you are.
Laying in the arms of death.
Calm down. Everything is gonna be fine.
Gwymplaine?
Oh, Gwymplaine ...
Forgive me, Dea.
We are together.
All evil is over.
No need to be afraid anymore.
Oh, Gwymplaine ...
My love.
What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.
I felt a blow, a blow of happiness.
I felt something pounding in my chest.
What's wrong with you?
She took arsenic.
There is nothing else to do.
I will die, Gwymplaine.
You can not die.
You're all I have, Dea.
It's too late.
How difficult it is to be happy.
Remember when we were kids?
And we slept under the bearskin?
I need to say it again:
I love you, Gwymplaine.
Do not forget my voice.
Take me to the river.
It was there where we first kissed.
It was like we would stay together forever.
What a beautiful life we had.
I would like to have lived longer.
Gwymplaine!
Will you remember me?
I will need it when I will be dead.
Do not let me waiting for you too long, Gwymplaine.
Kiss me one more time.
The light!
I can see it ...

He thus became the only owner of all the inheritance ... "

"I would remind you once more that I am expecting this very night the widow of your brother as my guest!"

The widow of the victim.  She married Baron Safferstätt a year ago.

Waiting for the Baroness.
"They may arrive at any moment, and Count Oetsch is inside..."
"So, you pretend to have learned the art of prophecy in India?"
"Will you then tell us whether, considering that this is a hunting party...
"Whether one shot will be fired!"
"There will be ONE shot ...!"
"...  Maybe ... even two?"
"Oetsch is here!"

- we cannot stay with you..."

I must go at once and get his letter.  I'll bring the letter to you soon."

But, alas, only fifteen minutes later ...
The day.
"His Reverence, Father Faramund, has just announced his arrival for tonight."

"So we lived for months in blinding happiness. "
"One day, he went away ..."
"He returned a few weeks later and ... He was someone else.
He buried himself in his writings ... sacred books ... "
"Believe me, dear child, true happiness lies only in the renunciation of everything worldly."
"He wanted a saint ...
And he wanted to see in me only the qualities of a saint ..."
"So for months ... I froze ... the purer he became, my attachment to the mundane seemed more terrible..."
"I was craving ... to do something evil ... wanting something evil ... "
"That's when I met Baron Safferstätt ...
"My husband wanted to give away all his possessions, and distribute his assets to the poor, and that brought many conflicts with his brother ... until, one night, a complete breakup occurred."

My husband ... was shot dead."

"A crime?  Maybe ... Committed by ... Count Oetsch!"
Dreams.
"Enough is enough!  Tomorrow I'm leaving!"
But the assistant in the kitchen dreams of what happened in the last few hours ...
End of the Third Act.
Schloss Vogeloed.
Fourth Act
The morning of the third day.
"So, try to understand!  Suddenly there are important affairs to be attended to!"
"They don't feel quite at ease any more in my house."
"I have informed the authorities of my suspicions about this Count Oetsch...!"
A happy man.
"She is so strange... she doesn't say a thing, even not about the Father who disappeared?"
At noon.
"Have you ever murdered anyone?"
"What ... did you say ... that?"
"Gentlemen!
Why not let me finish speaking?"
"Last night I had a dream!"
"Count Oetsch!  The present atmosphere in my house does not seem appropriate for that kind of joke!"  "
"Believe me, my investigating eye is experienced!"
"...and yet, Count Oetsch is involved in the Father's disappearance."
"He is acting so superior in order to conceal his new crime."
"He will have to apologize for his inappropriate joke in the presence of all the guests!"
"You absolutely have to speak to him.
"You already know everything, Sir!"
"Perhaps you also know who is suspected of causing the Father's disappearance?" causing the Father's disappearance?"
"Me!"
"But, I know even more, Mr. Ex-Justice.
I also know how to discover secrets."
"To give you an example, I am now going to give away one of the Baron's secrets."
"Count Oetsch!  If you know other people's secrets, you are not allowed to disclose them in front of everybody." to disclose them in front of everybody."
"My compliments for your opinion!
I just want to whisper a few words into Baron Safferstätt's ears."
"No. ... no ... I am ... not a murderer."
"What are these suggestions?"
"Do you perhaps suddenly accuse the Baron of the assassination of your brother?"
"Perhaps?"
"I will question Baron Safferstätt."
"Today I'll find out!"
He murdered my husband ...!
He shot his own brother during an argument!
End of the Fourth Act.
Schloss Vogeloed.
Fifth Act
Half an hour later.
"What do you know of that day, my dear - speak!"
"My Lord, the Count, preferred to run away!""
"And so I tell you, he has the disappearance of the Father also on his conscience."
"Father Faramund... has returned again!"
"Yesterday I was seeking comfort, and you did not come!
- Today - I will make my confession to you!"
"Because you, as a priest, must keep silent!"
"We must not do anything now!
The events of these last days will now probably clear up!"
"A few days before the murder of my husband ... "
"I am appalled at such holiness ...!"
"I'd like to see something evil ... something very very evil!"
"A murder ... !"
"Baron Safferstätt, burning with passion for me, had terribly misunderstood me!"
"He killed my husband!"
"He confessed to me two days later."
"Then I realized I was guilty. "
"The Count was arrested.  If he had been convicted ... "
"...  We would have been poisoned ... to prove his innocence ... "
"But, he was not convicted!"
"Thus accursed, both of us!
Fearing life!  Fearing death.  "
Tied together by our guilt!"
We got married!  That is our marriage!"
"So we became two comrades!  And today I have saved him!!"
"I implicated Count Oetsch in the murder of his own brother!"
"I have followed my destiny so far!"
"Now you know everything!  And you must remain silent!"
"...  I ... I understand!"
"Act like a man!"
"I ... was ... not happy ..."
"A shot ...?"
Evening peace.
"His struggles are over!"
"I, who was innocently accused, had always guessed..."
"So, some way had to be found for me finally to clear myself from this ignominious suspicion!"
"So, I arrived before Father Faramund, who was also expected at the castle!"
Thus I came to the castle to await Father Faramund!"
"We have to beg your pardon for so many things!"
Nightfall.
"I am Father Faramond of Rome."
The End
The story, "Vogel Castle," by Rudolf Stratz was published by Ullstein.
The Unknown
This is a story they...
...tell in old Madrid...
...it's a story they say is true.
"You all know me...
...Antonio Zanzi... and my gypsy circus..."
"...and now, the sensation of sensations!
The wonder of wonders!
ALONZO, THE ARMLESS!"
"Assisting Alonzo in this...
...death-defying act, is my...
...daugter...NANON!"
MALABAR THE MIGHTY.
"You are right, Alonzo...
...brute strength does not...
...mean everything to all women".
"Alonzo, all my life men...
...have tried to put their beastly hands on me...
...to paw over me".
"I have grown so that I...
...shrink with fear when...
...any man even touches me".
"You are wise, Nanon.
Always fear them... always hate them".
"And remember...
...I am always near you...
...ready to help you".
"If it takes ten million years, Nanon...
...I will keep saying 'I love you'...
...until you believe me".
"No one will get her...
...no one but me!"
"See, Nanon! Eyes that adore you...
...hands that long to caress you...
...and strength to protect you!"
"Why do you always draw away from me?"
"Why isn't he different... 
...from other men!
Why doesn't he keep his hands of me?"
"Hands! Men's hands!
How I hate them!"
"Men! The beasts!
God would show wisdom if he took the...
...hands from all of them!"
"Forgive me, Alonzo...
...I did not mean you".
"You are the one man I...
...can come to without fear".
"She is with Alonzo again!
Are you afraid to deal with him?" 
"Putting crazy ideas in her...
...head again!
I'll settle this!"
"A thousand thanks, Malabar.
I will try to repay same day".
"You have Nanon in your heart,...
...haven't you?"
"In my heart... in my soul...
...in my blood!"
"You are fortunate.
You have arms...
...and strength that she loves".
"Go take her in your arms...
...and let her listen to the...
...song of your blood".
"Cojo... I said no one is going to have her!
No one but me!"
"There is a time for fear, Nanon...
...and a time for hate...
...and a time for love".
"You worry, Alonzo, that sometime...
...will find out you have arms?"
"What would the police give...
...to know I have hands...
...and who I am?"
"There they are, Cojo...
...and Zanzi may be another...
...to find how I have them".
"I have been waiting for you... to teach you...
...that my orders are law!"
"Stop them!
They've burned enough clothes to keep twenty...
...gypsy souls out of hell!"
"The same hands that strangled Zanzi...
...committed the robberies in other towns...
...where this circus played!
They're somwehere in this troupe!"
"Get your finger-prints taken!"
"What will happen, Alonzo...
...if they sell the circus to pay...
...my father's debts?"
"Do not worry, Nanon,...
...I promised your father I would...
...always take care of you".
"The circus has gone... every caravan.
Why did we not travel with them, Alonzo?"
"Because I want to take you...
...away from the things you hate, Nanon".
"I could not go away without...
...telling you again that I will...
...love you always".
"I am so sorry Malabar put his...
...hand on you again... so sorry".
"Cojo, did you see her?
She kissed me!"
"You must never let her touch... you that way again".
"She will feel that you have arms!"
"Cojo will never tell!"
"There is nothing I will not do to own her! Nothing... do you understand? Nothing!"
"You are a riddle, Nanon.
You shrink from me... yet you kiss my flowers when I am gone".
"Then if you do care for me, why won't you ever let me hold you in my arms?"
"I know now what you fear".
"Some day that fear will die.
You will find me near you always...waiting...loving hoping".
"Cojo, I've got to have her!
She has got to marry me!"
"No Alonzo! On your wedding night she would see your arms....and hate you!"
"No, Cojo....she would never hate me... she would forgive me".
"But you forget....she saw her father strangled by a hand with two thumbs".
"You are forgetting that you have arms!"
"No, no Alonzo! Not that!
Never do that!"
Leave the door to the operating room open and be there at midnight - alone.
Remember Algiero, 20 years ago!
"Why this letter... and who are you?"
"You're here to backmail me!
It's money you want!"
"Well....what is the price of your silence about my past?"
"And be careful that I do not die in this operation.... because I left a letter telling who you are".
"I am afraid any more, Malabar.
All my foolish fears are gone".
"You're recovering rapidly.
You'll be able to leave in a few weeks".
"But we must wait until...
...Alonzo returns.
I want him with us at our wedding".
"Perhaps the landlady knows where she is.
Go ask, Cojo".
"But it's strange I've never heard from Alonzo... not one word since he went away".
"The landlady says she is at that theatre on the plaza".
"You are thinner, Alonzo!
Have you been sick?"
"No not sick... but I have lost some flesh".
"How is Cojo?
You love him best of anyone, don't you?"
"No, Nanon... not best".
"I am happy you have returned
Alonzo, now we can be married".
"Oh... I forgot. You have been away.
I well call him".
"Has Nanon told you the good news,
Alonzo?"
"Remember how I used to be afraid of his hands?"
"I am not any more.
I love them now".
"Alonzo is laughing at the way everything has happened".
"I did what you told me, Alonzo.
I took her in my arms..."
"I'm all right now".
"It was just something in here that stung like the lash of a whip".
"They said you were rehearsing.
Is this your rigging!"
"See... I have a horse hitched to each hand and they pull in opposite directions".
"You see, when the horses are tugging he could not let go if he wanted to".
"It's very dangerous.
Suppose the treadmills broke or stopped suddenly".
"If that happens the horses would tear my arms from my body".
"Do not say that! You make Alonzo worry that something will happen to you".
"Do not worry, Alonzo...
Nothing will happen.
We have been rehearsing for weeks".
"I couldn't reach Nanon's robe.
Will you get it for me?"
So... for Alonzo there was an end Hate called Death... and for Nanon, an end to Hate... called Love.
"Malabar, if I live ten million years,
I'll always say, 'I love you.'".

The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Notre Dame, the Cathedral Church of Paris
... a spiritual haven in a brutal age ... a sanctuary where the persecuted could find protection.
The enduring monument of a mighty faith.
It was in the broad cathedral square that the people met to celebrate-
The Festival of
Fools ...
The one day of the year when the people, crushed by tyranny, gave themselves to unrestrained pleasure.
Ten years before Columbus discovered America, there dwelt within the rocky fastness of the cathedral a creature whom the Parisians of that day knew as "the Hunchback of Notre Dame"-
Quasimodo.
LON CHANEY
Deaf - half-blind - shut off from his fellow- men by his deformities the bells were the only voice of his groping soul.
To the townspeople he was an inhuman freak, a monstrous joke of Nature- and for their jeers he gave them bitter scorn and hate.
His most Christian
Majesty, Louis
XI.-a crafty oppressor of his people, whose dungeons were always full, whose executioners always busy.
"We like not this ribaldry.
It savors of disrespect to both God and King."
And Paris had an uncrowned monarch-
Clopin, "The King of Beggars"
-the enemy of kings.
Dom Claude, the saintly
Arch-deacon of Notre
Dame.
The Cathedral also sheltered the Arch- deacon's brother, Jehan, who had foresworn a priest's robes for more worldly garb-
"So even you bow your head to my reverend brother!"
"Our day is coming - when we'll bow our heads to no man!"
"That freak is my slave. He will be useful to us.
"Esmeralda! Esmeralda!"
Esmeralda, a child of mystery, whom Clopin had bought from Gypsies and raised as his own.
PATSY RUTH MILLER
"Cursed gypsy! Daughter of
Satan! Hell take you-"
Marie, Queen of the Gypsies.
"That poor, mad creature was once rich and happy-"
"While she was away-"
"Her child was never found.
She secludes herself in this dark place, and lives but to curse and pray."
"Give her back to me, O Lord
-if only for a moment. Give me back my baby!"
The festival continued on into the night.
Gringoire, a poet of the streets.
The climax of the Festival came when the ugliest man in Paris was crowned
King of the Fools.
"Let Esmeralda dance!
Call her out!"
"Esmeralda! Esmeralda!"
Clopin's fierce heart burned at the injustice of the world; but it became tender only to his foster- child.
With the noise of the revelling mob still ringing in his ears King Louis tried to find peace in his favorite lodging place, the fortress of the Bastille.
"Send in that young rascal,
Phoebus de Chateaupers."
Phoebus de Chateaupers.
Men yielded to his sword
-and women to his smile.
"This commission makes you
Captain of our Guard. You see how we reward loyalty to the King and watchfulness over his safety."
The home of Madame de Gondelaurier.
Fleur de Lys, fiancee of
Captain Phoebus.
"Fie! I know your reputation.
You would say as much to any maiden."
Madame de Gondelaurier, aunt of Fleur de Lys.
"Phoebus - see that pretty goat."
"Very pretty - indeed!"
"Your company is waiting at the barracks!"
"Au revoir!"
To Esmeralda, this dashing soldier had long been the Prince Charming of her dreams.
Each time that Jehan beheld Esmeralda he longed to possess her.
Jehan knew the lonely streets where Esmeralda had to pass on her way home.
"Tie up this varlet!"
Alas, for man's ingratitude!
"It isn't safe for a pretty child like you to be out alone at this hour!"
"I am not afraid - now!"
The Court of Miracles - the city of thieves - a hideous blot on the face of
Paris - a sink from whence escaped every morning, and to which returned to stagnate every night, that stream of vice and vagrancy which ever flows through the streets of a capital.
Called the Court of
Miracles, because here the "blind" saw-
... because here the
"lame" walked ...
It was here that Clopin reigned supreme.
At the sign of the
Pomme d'Eve.
"Just a bit of supper - a sip of wine - before we say good-night?"
For Phoebus it was just another girl to hold in his arms. For Esmeralda it was a golden dream come true.
"Then it is true - what the fortune-teller told me -"
"... that I should be wooed by a noble Captain of the
Guards."
"It was put about my neck by mother, I scarce remember her. But I know that so long as I wear it, no harm can befall me."
"If mademoiselle will permit me, I shall see her safely on her way."
Those who strayed near the Court of Miracles were in danger of losing their lives - Gringoire lost his clothes.
"Here is a spy of the aristocrats. We found him at our very threshold."
"Who are you?"
"Merely a poet, a singer of sweet songs ... by name.
Gringoire."
"What shall we do with this singer of sweet songs?"
"Hang him! Hang him!
That's what the aristocrats do to us!"
"Have you so little misery that you must create more?"
"Cut him down, I say!"
The hunchback, for the attempted crime of kidnapping, had his first taste of the King's justice.
"For that, add twenty lashes to his punishments!"
Again was a slave to suffer for his master's crime.
"... for nocturnal attack and disturbing the peace of
His Majesty, our King."
Swift run the sands of life except in the hour of pain.
Thus was "Justice" rendered in the reign of King Louis XI !
"I thirst!"
"Cursed gypsy! You should be whipped!"
To celebrate the honor conferred by King
Louis upon Captain Phoebus,
Madame de Gondelaurier gives a ball.
"Where is that young jackanapes, Phoebus?"
"The ball in honor of my promotion takes place tonight.
You promised to go with me."
"But - my clothes!"
"I have prepared for that."
In Quasimodo's soul was born a bitter hatred for his betrayer.
"Esmeralda! --- The Captain of the Guards!" ---
"Be calm-"
"Be calm, my lord, and do not stir - 'Tis he who is entrapped by her!"
"An aristocrat has taken our
Esmeralda. To the rescue!"
"You are fairer than any lady in France!"
"Her Highness, Princess of Egypt!"
"She descends from a line more ancient than that of the Kings of France."
"I have a message for
Captain Phoebus - I am commanded to bring it to his own hands."
"Hold your blades! Our quarrel is with only one of you - this time!"
"There he is--!"
"Stop! This is my affair - and mine alone!"
"What do you mean by this outrage?"
"Do you think you can take our Esmeralda for your plaything? Leave her alone
-or I'll slit your throat!"
"But I tell you,
I love her!"
"-for my sake!"
"My place is with my people.
I do not belong here."
"Keep to your own women!"
"Esmeralda, would you forsake me now? Did you not promise to be my bride?"
"I do not love you."
"You nobles have lorded it over us and trampled on us
-but you can't do it forever."
Just when Phoebus had decided that life held no further interest ...
Monsieur Phoebus de Chateauper could heal a broken heart before a last farewell, let him come to Notre-Dame this eve at Angelus.
Esmeralda
"She saved my life in the
Court of Miracles."
"And you saved my life by bringing me this message.
Let me command this honor of the Prince of Poets."
"She gave you the letter with her own hand?"
Slowly it dawned on
Clopin that he was losing Esmeralda.
"As if the cursed aristocrats were not enough, the girl now talks of taking the veil."
"I will give myself to the
Blessed Virgin - and She will give me peace!"
"What say you then? Half of the treasure of Notre Dame to you - for the hand of
Esmeralda in marriage."
"See you - 'tis gold that makes kings and keeps them on their thrones."
"Gold - gold and steel! My people in the places of the mighty!"
"Strike quickly, then, else the treasure may be gone."
"The hour for an uprising is not yet! There lacks the spark to make my people flame."
Angelus.
"Phoebus, it was only to see you once more - and say good-bye!"
"Dear heart, can you not see?
I must give you up for your own sake - for your future!
Even your life itself!"
"You speak of trifles when
Heaven itself is at stake."
"By this sacred emblem
I plight my troth."
Again the King's justice-
"Girl! Do you persist in denying that you stabbed
Phoebus de Chateaupers?"
"Of course I deny it! How could I? I love him more than my own life!"
"It was he - he who stabbed Phoebus!"
"The girl is bewitched!"
"Put her to the question!"
The "question" - the system of the Middle
Ages to force confession.
"Do you still deny-?"
"I do - I love him!
I love him!"
"I confess ... I confess!
I confess to anything you wish!"
Through nights of delirium,
Phoebus of Chateaupers wondered if the charge brought against Esmeralda were true
-whether it was she who stabbed him.
"Monsieur, the brother of the
Archdeacon inquires the health of Captain Phoebus."
"The wench who stabbed you has confessed her crime. She has been ordered hanged."
"I come to get Esmeralda."
"She has been carried to prison by his Majesty's servants."
"I'll get her if I have to tear down Notre Dame rock by rock."
"You - in the robes of the Church!"
"Only in these robes could
I pass the prison-guard.
Quick - come with me!"
"I'd rather die!"
"Phoebus died of his wound last night. I promised him to save you!"
"Oh, Esmeralda, pity me! All
I have done was for love of you!"
"Assassin!"
"Very well, then hang!"
Suddenly the date for
Esmeralda's execution was secretly set ahead, and orders came to the hunchback to toll the death-knell.
For what poor soul he rang, he did not know.
When the great bell tolled like that, all
Paris knew some prisoner was on the way to execution.
"Let me kill the gypsy! Her life for the life of my child!"
"Cursed gypsy! Cursed-
Cursed!"
"My baby! My baby!
Save her, O God!"
"Requiescat in pace!"
A pleasant diversion for the workmen who were repairing the Cathedral.
"... and first appear on the steps of the Cathedral of
Notre Dame ... there to do penance."
"Sanctuary! Sanctuary!"
"Would you violate the sacred law of Sanctuary?"
All Quasimodo knew was that this girl had once been kind to him.
"My daughter, the law of sanctuary protects you pend- ing an appeal. Until then,
Mother Church will give you shelter and clothing."
The night had brought a dreamless sleep.
Esmeralda's presence inspired Quasimodo to express his wild joy in the only way he knew.
With plans all made for rescuing Esmeralda on her way tot he gallows, Clopin was awaiting the day that had been announced for the execution.
"They feared an uprising to rescue Esmeralda. To prevent bloodshed the King suddenly ordered he hanged today!"
"The hour has struck. They are about to surrender the maid to the officers of the
King."
"Hear me, you two-legged cattle, and learn how to become men. Were you not also born of women after the manner of kings?"
"Long enough the aristocrats have treated us as sheep.
We'll show them - we are wolves."
"Follow me to Notre Dame!"
"To arms! To arms! Rescue
Esmeralda! Sack the City!"
"Ere dawn my people will live in the palaces of the aristocrats."
Clopin's call to arms reach all the hidden corners of Paris - a kingdom was the stake.
"To arms! To arms! 'Tis
Clopin who calls you!"
Through all the man- made rat-holes beneath the ancient city.
Phoebus had recovered- but the wound in his heart still ached.
"Clopin and his rabble have risen!"
"They've sworn to bring back
Esmeralda! She's in the tower of Notre Dame!"
"Esmeralda! Alive!"
"Rouse the garrison!"
Preparing a fiery baptism - MOLTEN
LEAD!
"To arms! To arms!"
"The hunchback has sent us a battering-ram!"
"My children, I would have set you free ... Fight on!
Fight on!"
"Why do you struggle?
You are mine, now!"
"Never! - God will protect me!"
THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER based on stories by Edgar A. Poe sick... worried... my wife Madeline...
"I need someone to drive me to Usher tonight. "
In the nearly decaying manor-house,
Slr Roderick kept his wife Madeline in a strange seclusion, dominating her through his tyrannical disposition.
"No. I would not make my horse take a step further for all your Lordship's gold."
The oppressive melancholy of USHER'S surroundings seemed supernatural.
"The doctor."
The illness of Lady Madeline,
Roderick Usher's wife, baffled the skill of her physician.
As a result of a curious hereditary flaw, every Usher devoted himself to painting the portrait of his wife.
"It is there that she is alive."
"My dear Roderick, you are burning with fever."
"Her Grace is feeling tired and begs you to excuse her from the table. "
"It is there that she is alive."
Roderick was seized again by his strange impulse to paint.
His only thought was to be alone with Madeline, his sole model.
How could he get rid of his visiting and now unwelcome friend?
Twisted as by a tempest, the Usher's ancestral past weighed upon Roderick, who was the last survivor of the race, with all the weight of his heredity.
"My dear and only friend,
I am touched by your concern.
"But you too must take care of yourself.
"A few steps outside will do you good before you go to bed. "
Roderick's brush was like a magic wand.
Each stroke gave more life to the portrait while making Madeline more pallid, as though the young girl gave to the painted picture the very strength she was losing.
"This is indeed life itself."
Obsessed by all mysteries, Roderick had long meditated upon the theories of Magnetism.
"I tell you, Doctor. She may not be dead."
"She shall not leave me.
We shall bury her right here."
"I forbid, do you hear,
I forbid anyone to nail the coffin."
After the burial of Madeline, the hours, the days went by
In frightening dreariness and oppressive silence.
Tense and nervous, Roderick seemed to be waiting for a sign.
The slightest noise exasperated him...
Roderick dared not repeat the insane thought that oppressed him... Madeline...
This was a stormy night, charged with electricity.
There is a two-fold Silence.
One is bodily silence; be not afraid.
But should some urgent fate bring thee to meet his shadow, nameless elf, that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod no foot of man, commend thyself to God.
"Now can you hear her?"
"Roderick, you should not see that.
"Let me read you something to amuse you. "
And Ethelred uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made a path through the boards of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped...
And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pestilent breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing...
And now, the champion approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet, with a mighty great and terrible...
"Yes, I can hear. I have heard for a long time, since the first day... "
"We have put her alive in the tomb."
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
A tale told in moving pictures under the direction of VICTOR SJÖSTRÖM
At the camera - J. JULIUS
Once there was a poor
Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She'd been stricken with galloping consumption and had only held out for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left, she'd gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had worked alongside the sick girl.
Don't fret over those poor souls now, Sister Edit.
You've done enough for them.
Send for David Holm!”
Please don't!
My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life.
Now that she's dying, let me have her to myself.
Sister Maria, why don't you do as I ask?
Send for David Holm!
I shall go find him at once. ”
You can't be serious!
Asking David Holm to attend to a dying person!
I wasn't able to find him, but Gustavsson is looking too.
He'll bring him here if it's at all possible.
Poor Mrs. Holm!”
03 p
It wouldn't do for her husband to see her if he should come here.
The evening on which these events took place was no ordinary evening.
It was New Year's Eve.
Well, we'll certainly know when it's time to toast the New Year. ”
It's a spooky place to wait for midnight, here among the dead. ”
You gentlemen aren't afraid of ghosts, I hope'?”
Then I'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour. ”
„I once had a pal named Georges, who was generally a jolly fellow.
He came from a good family and had studied at Uppsala University, so he knew a bit more than the rest of us.
But a change would come over him on New Year's Eve. ”
Remember that it's New Year's Eve, the last day of the year!”
Whoever dies on this eve must drive Death's carriage. ”
There is an old, old carriage... ”
It is no ordinary driver who holds the reins, for he's in the service of a strict master named Death.
For him, a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth.
Night and day he must Carry out his master's business.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
PART 2
Wherever he goes, he's greeted with sorrow and despair. ”
There is no escape.
He must perform his forlorn duty. ”
Though horse and carriage are always the same, the driver is not. ”
The last soul to die each year- the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight- is destined to be Death's driver for the following year.
Now you know why I'm afraid of something fatal happening to me on New Year's Eve.
And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve.
Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm?”
Come with me, David Holm!
Sister Edit is dying, and she has asked for you.
If Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go to her at once!”
David, I can't believe it's you!
It is you who is to relieve me!”
You should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can. ”
No living soul rides in that carriage.
By the time I arrive, it's too late for a doctor.
You know full well that
I am no longer among the living. ”
But worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime.
David, do you think I'm unaware that it's my fault you've met such an end'?
If you hadn't fallen in with me, you'd have led a good life with your wife, children, and brother.
By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior.
But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you.
Behold your brother.
While you were here, he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits.
But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place, since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer.
Does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways, David Holm?”
Yes! Only now do I realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one.
What about your wife and children?”
Now I know how miserable they've been, but I will turn over a new leaf.
They need never despair of me again.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
PART 3
No, she's not ill.
She was well enough the other day when she left.
And here I thought
I'd come home to her with such joy!”
If she had gone openly,
I would have understood.
But to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless!
I'll wipe those smiles off your faces.
I'll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has now!
I'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger.
I will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came to this town, bringing such misfortune in your wake.
A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town, and it was ready for use on New Year's Eve.
Keep your food!
I just want to sleep. ”
Leave it alone!
It may be full of germs, and our sterilizing oven isn't working yet.
Don't you realize, Maria, how happy I am to help the first guest God has sent us?
Please go to bed.
It's been a busy day.
Let me attend to this.
Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year. ”
All night long she bent over the coat, never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled.
By the time she went to bed, the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room.
Was it you who mended my coat'?”
Would you mind calling the person who did this?”
It's a shame you went to all that trouble, miss, but I'm used to having it like this.
Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me again next New Year's Eve. ”
You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year, and I'd like to know if my prayer was answered.
Oh, I'll be here.
I'll come show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle.
The time has come to honor that promise before you take over here.
From you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed, and now she awaits your visit.
You possessed all that is most wonderful, but you lost it!
You cannot avoid the torment of remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year.
"Captive, come forth from thy prison!
Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight, thou wilt relieve me of my office.
For a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm.

It is Death, but he has come too soon. ”
You see that I'm not afraid of you.
I will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's reprieve, for there is someone
I must talk sense into.
You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused.
I cannot approach the Lord until I have set it right.
The person I'm waiting for is the man I love.
Do you understand?
The man I love!
I would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you.
But you have no power over this man!
Believing he was good, you've tried to make him mend his ways, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again.
It was you who enticed him away from his home and work!
You made him the drunkard he is!
Don't let yourself be dragged under!”
SALVATION ARMY RALLY
Run along and be saved, and I'll be sure to come watch!”
Why turn away so carefully?
I'm a consumptive myself, but I cough in people's faces in hopes of finishing them off.
Why should they be better off than us?
He's merely amusing himself.
He's not as wicked as he pretends to be. ”
How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man'?”
You needn't worry about that.
I'll be leaving town in a few days. ”
No, you mustn't do that!”
I would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again. ”
Tempting as that may be,
I still can't stay. ”
You see, little missy,
I'm on a journey throughout Sweden in search of someone
I must find at all costs.
Who is this person you seek?”
You'll know that when I find the person in question!”
I am the one
David Holm is looking for. ”
I am his wife. ”
I couldn't endure the life he was leading.
I deserted him.
I took my children and crept away in secret.
I moved to this town, for it was so far from our old home that I never expected him to come looking for me here.
You must take him back! it's his only hope!”
„I didn't mean you must make up your mind on the spot.
Only promise you'll listen to your heart, and let us talk again later.
She had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.
Just come with me!
A surprise awaits that will make you happy.

She hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns.
And she may well have succeeded had it not been for...
The doctor says it's pneumonia.
And her resistance is poor, for she's been in ill health since last New Year's Eve.
Yes, that David Holm has been her undoing.
She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth.
You might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children!”
It wasn't so easy to run away this time!”
Haven't you had your fill of revenge, David'?”
If only I hadn't brought them together again.
His sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me.
You must grant me a reprieve!
I cannot die yet!
I must see him turn over a new leaf!
Just spare me a few minutes!
You know I love him!
I've never loved him as I do today. ”
Captive, ye of loving head, come forth from thy prison!”
Come along.
We have no business here.
Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly.
You know, David, if I could send a message to mankind,
I would like to send them a New Year's greeting.
„I would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer:
'Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. '
Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!”
No, I can't go on!
I can't go on!”
I'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind. ”
Please don't be angry with me. it's not my fault. ”
This will do, David.
It will suffice for the children and myself.
"Yes, David, I see what's coming.
I'm obliged to watch.
I will not shirk my duty.
You mustn't let this happen!
This mustn't come to pass!
Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!
„I have no power over the living.
Where should I turn?
Should I pray to God or to Christ?
Who can tell me where to direct my plea'?
I'm a poor, miserable sinner, and I beseech the Lord of life and death!
I'm not worthy.
I've broken your every commandment.
Condemn me to eternal darkness!
Let nothing remain of me!
Do what you will to me, my Lord, but spare the three of them!
"David, I see that I no longer need grieve for you!
"Captive, return to thy prison!
She didn't do it yet!
I made it in time!”
Sister Edit is dead.
I was at her side.
I promised her I'd become a good husband and father.
You're lying!
Sister Maria told me you refused to go to her!
Are you owing, David'?”
No one believes I want to reform.
I want to be good, but no one believes me. Is it any wonder I cry'?
It's hard to believe, David.
But I do believe you.
Your tears have convinced me.
I can't help crying too.
I won't be truly happy until all my sorrow is drained.
Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. ”
THE END
