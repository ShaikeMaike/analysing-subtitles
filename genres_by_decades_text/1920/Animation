Prince Achmed, her brother
"l will not part with this horse for mere gold!"
"So choose any of my treasures"
"May l have whatever l desire?"
"l swear it - by the
Beard of the Prophet!"
The Story of Prince Achmed
"How can one bring the horse back down to earth?"
"The lever at the head drives it into the air..."
"...and the lever at the tail brings it to earth"
"Does the Prince know this?"
Far from his homeland he landed on one of the magic islands of Waq Waq
The Prince was young, and brave and eager for adventure
"Who are you, maidens?"
"We serve the Princess Peri Banu, ruler of the spirit land of Waq Waq"
"Stay with us, handsome stranger"
On a neighbouring island lay a magic lake
...where every night the exquisite
Peri Banu and her attendants bathed
"Give back my cloak of feathers!"
"Come with me to my beautiful homeland"
Thus was the Princess Peri Banu taken from the land of spirits
The horse carried them to far away China
"Do not be afraid of me"
"l am yours to command to the end of time"
"You do not know the power of the spirits of Waq Waq!"
"They will kill you!"
"Allah's mercy will protect us if you will be my wife"
Meanwhile, the Sorcerer searched for his magic horse
"We will find our home and you will forget all about Waq Waq"
"l will follow you!"
"The Prince sends you this garment"
"He bids me lead you to him"

The Emperor's Jester
Hither the Sorcerer brought Peri Banu to sell her to the Emperor
The Emperor smiled upon Peri Banu
"Kill her, or take her to wife!"
"Now, my brave Prince, l shall return to your sister" ln this mountain dwelt the
Sorcerer's greatest enemy...
...the Fire Mountain Witch
"How dare you come to my magic mountain?"
"The African Sorcerer brought me hither"
"He is my greatest enemy!"
"And we are friends"
The Bridegroom
"Help me free Peri Banu"
"l fear no spirits!"
"With these weapons you can conquer the spirits"
The Bride
Far below, at that moment, the wedding of Peri Banu
"We must stop the wedding"
The spirits of Waq Waq look for their mistress
"Take me to Waq Waq"
THE GATES OF WAQ WAQ...
...OPEN ONLY TO THE ONE...
...WHO...
...THE...
...MAGlC LAMP OF ALADDlN...
...POSSESSES
Aladdin and the Magic Lamp
"l am Aladdin"
"Where is the Magic Lamp?"
"Do you not have it?"
"l will tell you"
"l was a poor tailor in the city of the Caliph"
"One day l was visited by a mysterious stranger"
"Behold Dinarzade, the daughter of the Caliph"
"You shall have her, once you do something for me"
"He led me to a high mountain"
The Magic Lamp
"Fetch the Lamp"
"Give me the Lamp!"
"First let me out!"
"Then die! l have other ways to obtain the Lamp!"
"l languished long in the dark cave...
...until l succeeded in lighting the Lamp"
"What is your command, O Master?"
"l am your servant, l and all the Spirits of the Lamp"
"Take me home"
"Now l knew l could win the Princess Dinarzade"
"ln a single night l built her a splendid palace"
"Next morning the astounded Caliph visited the enchanted building"
"So she became my wife"
"The Caliph is my father,
Dinarzade - my sister"
"Tell me, what happened further?"
"One day everything vanished - the palace, Dinarzade and the Lamp"
"l fled before the fury of the Caliph"
"l set out to sea"
"A fearful storm blew up"
"And so you found me"
"Do you know who did this to you?"
"The African Sorcerer!"
"He loved Dinarzade"
"Hurry, Achmed, and free Peri Banu"
"The spirits want to kill her, because she left to follow you"
"The Sorcerer has stolen the
Magic Lamp"
"Only the Lamp can open the gates of Waq Waq"
"Kill the Sorcerer and the Lamp is yours!"
"Kill him!"
"l will try"
"Your enemy is dead!"
The Spirit Battle of Waq Waq
The spirits rose up against their faithless mistress
"Prince Achmed stands before the gates!"
"Bring out Peri Banu!"
"Summon the Spirits of the Lamp,
Aladdin!"
Yet the spirits of darkness came before him
Aladdin was overwhelmed
"The Lamp!"
The Witch intervened
Now legions of benevolent spirits streamed out of the Magic Lamp
"Behold! The palace!"
"Return and seek happiness in the land of mortals"
"Dinarzade must be in the palace"
The towers of the Caliph's city soon appeared before them
"Aladdin's palace has returned!"
Meanwhile, the call to morning prayer sounded from the minarets
