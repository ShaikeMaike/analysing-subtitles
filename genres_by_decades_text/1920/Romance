THE TREE MUSKETEERS
Life knows no age nor time. Youth will ever set out to seek fortune.
Man will ever fight for the love of a woman. Kings will threaten-Queens weep-Ministers conspire. And so-though our story is of three hundred years ago, It is as young as Yesterday or
To-morrow.
Then follow us to France of old.
To frery days when hearts beat high,
When blood was young, and hate was bold. When sword crossed word to dare and die. For love and honor gloried then. When live was live, and men were men!
In 1625 the Court of
France teemed with plot and counterplot, faction and cabal, enmity and jealousy-its men and women merely pawns in a game.
Louis XIII, the King, jealous, suspicious, easily moulded---
Cardinal Richelieu, the Prime Minister, iron willed, bent on being the sole power to dominate the King...
In another room in the palace...
Anne of Austria, Queen of France, whose influence over the King is the one obstacle in Richelieu’s path to power...
Constance Bonacieux...
Seamstress to the Queen...
Milady de Winter...
Father Joseph, the familiar of the Cardinal, fearsomely know as
His Grey Eminence...
Madam my Queen
I hear again how cruelly the Cardinal persecutes you. I pray you let me come to you that
I may throw around you the protection of the love you have ever scorned
Your mort humble slave
Bnechingham
In England, the Duke of Buckingham, whose mad infatuation for the Queen of France offers Richelieu the means for accomplishing his purpose…
Madame my Queen
I heard again how cruelly the Cardinal perseruter you. I pray you let me come to you that
I may throw around you the protection of the love you have ever scorned
Your mort humble slave
Bnechingham
Monsieur le Cardinal, your medicine.
The Queen has but now received a letter from Buckingham
I thank thee, Joseph.
That is very stimulating.
Your Queen is in danger.
Your queen is in danger- menaced by a knight.
Why do you harp on my Queen?
What do you mean?
I but spoke of your CHESS queen, sire.
Always double meanings.
Speak out, I command you.
What shall I say of the Queen save that she is profoundly devoted?
Devoted! To whom?
Not to me. She is in love with Buckingham!
I cannot but thing you are wrong, sire. If it were true, letters would have passed between them.
Letters! We shall soon see.
Madame, it is imperative that I see all your papers at once!
Your Eminence was right. There was a letter. Nothing about Buckingham.
Plenty about you.
To monsieur my Brother
The King of Spain
The humiliations put upon me by this odious Cardinal are becoming the gossip of every court. I beg you send an emissary to urge his dismissal
Your good sister
Anne R
Your Majesty knows that I have always warmly defended the Queen.
If she distrusts me I must bear it with humility.
In Tarbes, a town in the southern province of Gascony---
An impoverished nobleman sends forth his son to seek his fortune.
D'Artagnan
Remember, my son, that your ancient nobility gives you the right to the best in France.
You have thews of iron and wrists of steel. Fight on all occasions!
Fight the more since duels are forbidden, for that means double courage.
Never forget these things- loyalty to the King- reverence for the Cardinal- devotion to the Queen-
...and my pride in you... my love for you.
In Paris... fresh intrigue...
Milord
Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intrust to a letter
Repenting the impulse that led to the humiliation of the Queen, the
King strives to make amends...
It took ten years to collect and match those twelve stones. They cannot be duplicated.
And the world says kings and queens are not happy!
I have come at a propitious moment to secure your signatures to a decree.
And D'Artagnan little realized, as he leisurely made his way toward
Paris, that he was soon to be enmeshed in a scandal involving the foremost courts of Europe.
What we do now promise is by our concurrence and consent.
Luis
Milord
Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intriest to a letter.
Anne
Meet Milady de Winter at Meung. She is to deliver this letter to
Buckingham and remain in England until I send for her.
D'Artagnan takes every smile for an insult... every look as a provocation...
The Inn at Meung...
The exact shade of a buttercup!
The color is common enough in botany but... until now... very rare among horses.
Who laugh at my horse... laughs at me.
Pardon me, Madame.
I must kill your friend.
To Buckingham without delay... by order of Cardinal.
Coward!
Thus chance left these two men with a score unsettled... but they were to meet again.
Paris...
A horse for a hat.
Bonacieux, uncle to Constance...
Can you tell me where I might and lodgings?
Thus fate plays her part again...
Pardon me, mademoiselle.
Do you live in this house or that house?
Marvelous!
I desire to secure lodgings here.
In England... Buckingham receives the forget letter...
Milord
Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intrust to a letter
Anne R
The letter has been delivered, madam.
In Paris, the next morning,
D'Artagnan calls on his father's old friend, the Captain of the King's Musketeers...
Monsieur de Treville, Captain of the King's Musketeers...
The ambition of his life... to be one of this...
Athos!
Porthos!
Aramis!
You Know that fighting is prohibited yet you fight... fight... fight!
And always with the Cardinal's Guards.
But if you MUST fight... fight as you did yesterday.
The three best swordsmen in Paris.
So you are from Gascony... and the son of my friend.
What hat brought you to Paris?
I came to join the Musketeers.
My boy, these Musketeers are all picket men.
All my life I've dreamed, I've hoped, I've prayed to be in your regiment.
Impossible! Serve your apprenticeship with the cadets for two years... and... we shall see.
My man of Meung!
Excuse me. I am running after someone.
You can find ME without running.
Do you understand?
Where?
Behind the Luxembourg.
When?
One o'clock.
Behind the Luxembourg.
Permit me to observe, monsieur, that in one respect you are absolutely perfect. You are the most perfect idiot I have ever met!
Behind the Luxemburg at one o'clock.
Possessed of Gascon courage,
D'Artagnan wasted not a moment in regret that his first day in
Paris had involved him with the three best blades of the time.
Behind the Luxembourg at one o'clock...
Gentlemen, I desire to explain...
If you kill me, I shall have been honored...
If I kill you, I shall regret it all my life... for I love you every one.
Monsieur Athos, on guard!
The Cardinal's Guards!
Hola! We are in luck!
You are under arrest
Come and take us!
We are four against three!
Pardon, Messieurs.
Four against Foul!
A young Gascon played me foul.
I'll find him and carve him to ribbons.
My young harpooner, perhaps you'll arrange time for me to show you how to use a sword correctly.
That is Bernajoux... the Cardinal best swordsman.
One for all and all for one.
Thus D'Artagnan, in two days, became the talk of Paris and won for himself the loyal comradeship that was to last throughout his life.
Richelieu lodges complaint that the
King's musketeers have assaulted his guards...
Remember! I cannot have the Cardinal annoyed. Those who disobey the edicts must be... punished.
Rest assured, Monsieur le Cardinal, these men shall be dealt with... properly.
I commanded you to fetch me these four devils who have so maltreated seven of the Cardinal’s best men.
Where are they?
But where is that young cadet?
You rascal... you have kept the King waiting!
So you are that wild Gascon who fights a regiment single-handed?
For the future I shall expect you to be discreet.
But TOO discreet.
I have a servant for you... a fellow who reflects before he acts.
I found him on a bridge, spitting in the water to see which way the river was glowing.
Your province?
Picardy.
As Richelieu's plans begin to mature, Constance makes ready to keep a mysterious appointment...
Certain messages have been confided to you. Tell me what they are and to whom they are to be delivered.
I dare not delay. Midnight is striking.
It is the hour I am expected.
Do not question me.
My mission is secret.
Who is he?
Stop, in the name of heaven!
His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham.
Lead on. I'll follow. If anyone looks at you I shall kill him.
The river entrance to the palace...
Milord, you have been told that it was not I who wrote to you... yet you rashly insist on this interview!
What does it matter?
Nothing matters but that
I see you again.
You see me at the risk of my honor... rat the risk of your life.
So sweet a voice can never pronounce the words that separate us.
...the depth of seas,
...the enmity of kingdoms...
...the sanctity of vows!
I beseech you... relent.
Then something for remembrance... something that you have worn... a ring... a chain... a brooch... that I may wear it always.
And now, Madame, your Majesty and I share a secret.
The last of the King's gold...
Richelieu prepares to make use of the Queen's secret...
How many days away is the court ball?
Twelve.
Go to England. Deliver this to
Milady de Winter.
While poverty still stalks the four friends, Aramis has secured for himself an invitation to dine...
Father, I have a friend I know you'll like. He's outside now.
May I Bring him in?
I trust I am not intruding.
Father, I have a friend outside... a fine fellow.
Monsieur de Cardinal,
YOU always win!
When I have bent my energies to a purpose, I have never failed.
D'Artagnan invites his friends to dine...
I wagered D'Artagnan that he could not provide a dinner without money.
Does he think Paris is paved with food?
Patience, my friends. This Gascon has a fashion of winning his wagers.
Certain fortune favored members of the Cardinal’s Guards are gathered for a feast...
Marvelous!
Intruder! How dare you meddle with our dinner!
Pardon, monsieur.
MY dinner.
I would allow you to get your swords, but... really, Messieurs... the dinner is not worth it.
Porthos must pay.
While in the palace, the Queen, who has been to a fancied security, receives a rude awakening.
Madame, I wish to remind you that the court ball is only six days away. I request you to honor me by wearing to it the diamond buckle
I recently gave you.
This is the end! I am lost!
Ten minutes later Constance arrives at home...
Can I trust you?
I love you.
As rivers love the sunlight.
Are you sure?
I would give my life for you.
This may mean your life.
Go to England. Get the jewels from the Duke of Buckingham and return in all haste. The Queen's happiness, her life, her honor are in your hands.
When you come back.
Find Porthos and Aramis and me at De Trevilles.
Bonacieux sells his information...
Search Paris. If D'Artagnan is within the gates, fetch him to me.
On perilous expeditions of this kind you must pay toll.
Four must start if one is to arrive.
All for one and one for all!
Be at the Barriere du
Nord in half an hour.
See that the way to Calais... and beyond... is made unsafe.
His Eminence presents his compliments and desires to see you at your earliest convenience.
At your EARLIEST convenience.
D'Artagnan is below.
When I drop this handkerchief... fire.
You were about to leave Paris,
Monsieur D'Artagnan?
We can make it VERY COMFORTABLE for you in Paris.
It is imperative that I go.
Monsieur D'Artagnan, if you were about to die, what would you do?
Your Eminence, I should write the history of France.
And what would you say?
I should speak of her great men,
Monseigneur.
Whom do you call great?
Monsieur le Cardinal,
Duc de Richelieu.
And what would you write of him?
That he is a great statesman...
...a great poet...
...a great swordsman.
You, yourself, are somewhat of swordsman.
By the way... what trick you employed to best my man, Bernajoux?
Thus four men rode forth in the service of their Queen...
That is D'Artagnan.
Porthos pay toll...
An inn near Calais...
Athos pay toll...
The port of Calais from which
D'Artagnan plans to sail...
NOTICE
THE PORT IS CLOSED
AVIS
LE PORT EST FERME
The port will remain closed until you receive further orders from the
Cardinal.
It shall be as you say,
Count de Rochefort.
My man of Meuhg!
You are on the Queen's business, master.
In England...
Buckingham wears a buckle set with twelve diamonds. Let possession of this and fetch it to me at once.
Richelieu
Good! Say to His Eminence that I am attending the Duke's fete to-morrow night.
Under the cover of midnight...
Watch every boat for my return and have the horses ready.
Set sail for England this instant or I'll blow out your brains!
My heart fails me. Ever foot of this road is sown with danger.
I'll stake my life he is near the shores of England at this moment.
You love him?
The fete at the palace of the
Duke of Buckingham...
To the harbour.
That is Milady de Winter.
Milady de Winter has just left your house... bound for the harbour.
She is a friend of Rochefort, a tool of Richelieu. She has the jewels!
The boat leaves in half an hour.
Perfect!
After you leave Calais, go by way of
Boulogne. This ring will get you fresh horses along that route.
Next morning... just before the ship drops anchor at Calais...
We go by the long route. No food, no sleep, no rest until we reach Paris.
The inn near Calais...
Has Monsieur D'Artagnan passed this way?
Then he has gone by the longer road.
We can reach Paris ahead him.
Drive on.
The evening of the court ball...
You bungler! I place the resources of a Kingdom at your command and you fail. Imbecile!
Guard every entrance to Paris.
Line the streets. D'Artagnan must not pass.
Go to the ball. Join the Queen... never leave her for an instant.
Block every way that leads to the palace.
Arrest that seamstress, Constance.
D'Artagnan... dead or alive!
The grand ball room of palace...
Her Majesty is late. I trust she will not forget that you desired her to wear your gift of jewels.
At the gates of Paris D'Artagnan scents danger...
Our luck runs too high.
I smell the Cardinal.
Madame, why do you appear here without your diamond buckle?
Sire, I feared some accident might befall it.
You do wrong to slight my wishes!
This is Fate!
This is for Meung... and this for Constance!
Your Queen.
My brave D'Artagnan, let this token ever remind you that you have won the eternal gratitude of a Queen.
Constance has disappeared.
Joseph, I never acknowledge defeat,
I make use of it.
If you were about to die, what would you do?
Your Eminence, I should still write the history of France.
Then set down in your book, Monsieur
D'Artagnan, that Richelieu was a generous foe.
Marvellous!
And now, Monsieur D'Artagnan, what say you to a lieutenancy in my Guards?
Your Eminence, my dreams, my hopes, my ambitions are all with the
Musketeers.
I am offering him a commission in my Guards.
A commission in the
King’s Musketeers.
And so, later in the evening,
De Treville presents to the King a new Musketeer...
'D'Artagnan!
So thus they lived in
France of old,
When blood was young and hearts were bold,
And sword crossed sword for honor then,
When life was life and men were men.
MEZHRABPOMRUS 1927
THE GIRL WITH THE HAT BOX
Written with the goal of promoting the issue of public loans, this comedy, one of Barnet's first works, is interesting for its lyricism and for its new way of presenting characters.
Natasha Korostelyova and her grandfather lived in a small house in Moscow's suburb.
Every day Fogelev, the railroad clerk, rushed after the object of his hopeless love.
Natasha and her grandfather made hats at home.
I'm afraid, Natashenka, that you'll soon fly away from me!
You mean marriage?
Don't be afraid!...
Every morning Natasha brought the ordered hats to Moscow...
From his remote village
Ilya Snegiryov was coming to Moscow dreaming to enter the worker's faculty.
MADAME IRENE, HATS, was the shop for which Natasha worked.
Marfushka, the shop owner's servant.
Madam, the house committee is here!
One of the apartment's rooms of Mrs Irene was registered under Natasha's name but it was in fact occupied by Nikolay
Matveevich Trager, Irene's husband.
And where's Natalya Korostelyova, the tenant registered here?
Darling, you should spend the night here sometimes!
The house committee is bothering us again!
I'd like to know your turnover.
I'm the tax assessor.
Idiot! It's the tax assessor!
In search of housing.
Excuse me, is there a room for rent anywhere?
Ilya Snegiryov spent all nights at the railway stations.
For heaven's sake, what do you want from me?
Excuse me, I...
Incidentally...  dropped a rouble... searched... I have nowhere to sleep...
What were you dreaming of, Natasha?
Poor boy, he has no place to sleep.
In search of another meeting.
Madame Irene's home was preparing to receive guests.
I can get you a room if you want.
Ilya Snegiryov. small farmer.
Single...
...Married.
Natalya Korostelyova. Milliner.
Single...
...Married.
You asked, I got it fixed : here is my husband!  He's gonna live in my room.
I'll let nobody in! Though you're registered in this room, it is not yours!
You'd better not offend my wife!
Is it her room or not?
Where is it?
Well, here's our tenant... and she's just got married!...
May I ask you to go into the next room!
It's falling.
Good-bye "husband"!
I'll visit you some day...
The first night went perfectly.
Mr and Mrs Trager declare war.
I declare that tenant Natasha Korostelyova, de facto, doesn't intend to inhabit her room.
On the basis of all above mentioned it is obvious that Ilya Snegiryov, inhabiting the room, turns out to be her so-called husband and, thereby, is entitled to be evicted from the apartment that I'm responsible for.    N. Trager
Nothing, but lottery bond...
Irene darling! give me some money...
I'm broke! heads and tails...
You're still indebted to me for my work.
Pay this trollop!
STATE LOTTERY LOAN
Stop singing!
Madame, the house committee has come to see the new tenant!
And where is your, so to speak, wife?
I'm here!
Lend me 30 kopecks for the return ticket till tomorrow...
Fogelev still hoped that
Natasha would come with the last train.
I'm late for the last train!
...The last train swept his last hope away...
Aren't you sleeping?
Yes, I am!
I'm afraid! A mouse is running!
My God! A rat!
In the morning...
Let's listen now to the first winning numbers of the state lottery loan...
10.000 roubles prize goes to the bond 7219, serial number 05...
25.000 roubles prize... goes to the bond n掳 1419963, serial number 03...
Natasha's address! Quick!
She won 25.000 roubles with my lottery bond!
Natasha's address!!
Working with a round jack.
Going to the station for a newspaper...
I love you!
Natashka, marry me!
Give me back the bond!
It is a dear souvenir to me...
I left it in Ilya's room.
Here's your bond!
You won 25.000 roubles!
Farewell...
I wanted to say...
I agree, I'll...
... be your wife!
Now I don't agree!...
Farewell!
I request to dissolve my marriage with citizen N. P. Korostelyova, she won 25.000 roubles and people could consider that I'd married her for money.
Ilya Snegiryov
I agree - - - -
Your wife wanted money instead of bond...
It's for me the uttermost pleasure!
The lottery bond is in her hands!
Give me back the bond!
Before it's too late, Fogelev decided to make an offer to Natasha.
Sign the divorce petition...
I DO NOT agree - - -
Why are you making fun of me?
- - - N. Korostelyova
Here's your bond!
Idiot! Go and buy one hundred bonds!

The Unholy Three
Twas a balmy summer evening,
And a goodly crowd was there.
Hercules! The mighty...marvelous... mastodonic model of muscular masculinity!
Never smoke cigarettes and you'll be a strong man like him.
Professor Echo! God's gifted genius!
The velvet-voiced ventriloquist!
Nemo, how would you like to walk over to my house and have a drink?
Why walk? Let's run!
Sweet Rosie O'Grady.
That's all there is to life, friends, a little laughter...a little tear...
This dollar pamphlet contains one thousand wheezes and jokes, a guaranteed tonic for dull care!
The price is ten cents, one dime!
Now, folks, that's just a sample of the lady's art!
The show on the inside starts immediately!
See her do the dance that broke the Sultan's thermometer.
You're there, Rosie, the best pal a guy ever had!
And tonight when we eat,
I'm goin' to buy you a swell steak!
I just couldn't hold out on you, Echo.
You're to square a guy!
I'm glad you done that, Rosie.
Money got that way never done no one no good!
Tweedledee! Twenty inches! Twenty years!
Twenty pounds! The Twentieth Century Curiosity!
The Demi-Tasse Daddy.
Fools!
Midnight.
You see, my plan is so ridiculous... so simple... that it scares you.
But... if you come with me, we'll clean up millions.
It's spooky! It sounds... unholy!
That's it!
We'll be the Unholy Three!
The day before Christmas...
And how is Hector McDonald, my
Grandma's little parrot seller?
Don't let her tease you, Hector.
Little Willie darling heard your voice.
He wants you to take him bye-bye.
You're just an old darling, Hector.
I won't tease you any more.
You're makin a play for that guy!
Since when do you own me?
If you tip that boob off to who we are,
I'll lay some lilies under your chin!
If you don't stop yelling, you'll tip him off yourself.
I'll get a Mrs. O'Grady.
I think you'd better show the parrots.
They talk so well for you.
Echo, the ventriloquist, could make wooden dummies talk... now watch the jolly parrots.
Isn't it wonderful how the parrots always talk to your Grandma?
That house, where you called about the parrot, was robbed last night.
This is Mr. Arlington.
The parrot you sold me doesn't talk.
Here's another parrot that won't talk.
All right, I'll come over.
I'm sure when the bird sees me it will feel more at home.
The lady from the bird store, Mr. Arlington. may I leave him here?
He might cry if he sees the...
B-I-R-D
Take mine, darling... and Granny will get you some red beads just like those.
He's always been so fond of beads!
Christmas Eve...
...and then, Echo says to my, "Granny will get you some red beads just like those"!
Yes, and before morning Granny will have those pretty red beads.
Hector's out there with a
Christmas tree for little Willie.
Didn't I order you to stay away from that guy?
I wasn't with him!
I met him on the corner headed for here!
Wait for me in the kitchen.
You go back to bed, Mrs. O'Grady.
Rosie and I will trim the tree.
Get rid of him! we're gonna pull that Arlington job tonight.
Oh, I'm mad at Granny!
She won't stay in bed!
Perhaps she wants to help us trim the tree.
Yes, she'd love to do some trimming.
That guy bossin me... me and my strength!
He's too jealous to leave her with that boob. Come on... we'll turn this trick alone!
I've a secret I want you to share.
I'm going to ask Rosie to merry me.
But I'm not going to give her the ring until tomorrow.
You and your strength! You're yellow, you big stiff... or you'd come with me.
You heard me! You're yellow!

IN HOME BY JEWEL THIEVES.
'Oh, spare my life', said
Mr. Arlington, 'spare my life'!
You... filth!
Don't you realize that you've murdered a man?
That's why I said we'd never carry a gun!
Was there anybody beside yourselves know the rubies were here in the house?
Ther was on old woman from a bird store who saw the rubies.
If you don't want no part of these, because of how we got 'em... then me and the Kid wll take 'em.
You're gonna put 'em back in the safe with the rest of our stuff!
I'm from Police Headquarters.
Oh, yes. Isn't it terrible? Mr. Arlington was one of my best customers.
You were at Mr. Arlington's home yesteday, weren't you?
Did the man you saw with Mr. Arlington look as if he would commit such a crime?
The reason I ask is because sometimes the least little thing gives us a clue.
I hate to see anybody tease a baby.
I don't like to take his toys from him.
Let's finish our talk in the store.
You sold a parrot to Mr. Arlington.
Who delivered it?
Oh! So you delivered it yourself?
You forget easy, don't you?
So long. I'll see you later.
That dick has a line on us... we gotta think fast!
He's got a hunch Hector turneed this trick. 
Let's plant the jewels in the boob's room!
That's it! Make him the fall guy!
That's what we hired him for, isn't it... in case we got in a jam?
Christmas night...
Don't you think my savings are enough for us to start on?
If I loved a man, he wouldn't have to have a dime!
Oh! If you loved a man!
Then why have you let me go on hoping?
Aw, I've just been kidding!
Oh, Hector, I tried so hard to let you know I love you...
I've been a crook... a pick-pocket!
But you're not going to be any more.
I did some pretty bad things myself... when I was young.
Gee, but you've made this a great Christmas, Rosie.
Gee, but you've made this a great Christmas, Rosie!
Ain't you the kidder?
No, Echo, I'm on the lovel. I love him!
Thanks.
What are you going to do?
You'll find out soon enough!
Extry! Extry! Arlington murderer arrested!
What a bonehead I was to overlook that!
McDonald's alibi, that he was at
Mrs. O'Grady bird store, will, be investigated by the police.
That means more investigation... but there ain't goin to be no Mrs. O'Grady when they get here!
Yes there is goin to be a Mrs. O'Grady... that dick saw me here...
You guys can get out of your make-up... but I can't! ¡And I ain't going to the chair alone!
And neither is Hector McDonald going to the chair!
Now, laugh that off... you big stiff!
What are you going to do?
You'll find out soon enough!
Regan is on his way to
O'Grady's bird store.
Here's one thing stronger that you... and I might need him.
It was Spring before the grim machinery of the law worked around to the case of 
Hector McDonald.
Does the defendant's attorney intend to produce the alleged witnesses, Mrs. O'Grady and her grand-daught?
127er
We're making every effort to locate them.
While in a secluded cabin in the mountains...
In his prison cell he sits.
How about just us two dividin the stuff?
Maybe I got a better palan.
You can save him, Echo. And, if you will,
I'll stick with you. I'll never see Hector again.
Yes! You'd stick with me... but you'd go on loving him.
...and the minute he's free, you'd double-cross me and go back to him.
Don't you understand... I'll do anything to save him! I love him, Echo... I love him.
I'd even take that from you.
After that, you don't want to change your mind about sticking with me?
He would always have Rosie... if he saved Hector. This was the thought that took Echo secretly to the city.
Your Honor, I object!
He is mis-stating the evidence!
Objection over-ruled!
Have you lawyer put you back on the witness stand. When you get there keep repeating the Lord's prayer. 
Move your lips But don't utter a sound.
Have faith in miracles.
Mrs. O'Grady.
It's Mrs. O'Grady's handwriting... and she's not here!
Your Honor, may the defendant take the stand again to give new evidence?
In a case so serious as his, with a man's life at stake, the court cannot reasonably deny your request.
Speak louder!
Your Honor, and gentlemen of the jury...
There was an old woman who was a man... and two others... the Unholy Three...
First, it was an old woman and her grand-daughter.
Now, the old woman is a man!
What next?
That wasn't me talking!
I didn't say a word!
...and it must be remembered that defense has failed to produce a single witness to confirm the prisoner's story!
You mean... you want me to go with you?
There's a fortune for just us two to split. What do you say?
Do you think he's guilty?
Will he get the chair?
I'm Echo, the ventriloquist...
Grandma O'Grady of the 'Unholy Three'!
Your Honor, I want to make a full confession!
The Law can be kind... And Echo's confession won freedom for both himself and Hector.
Dear Hector: I'll never see you again...
I can't explain...  but always summber I love you, Hector... I love you.
Good Bya. Rosie.
Echo, you remember what I promised if you saved Hector?
Well... I'm here.
Aw, what's the use of us kiddin, Rosie. We don't love each other. You run along to Hector.
Do you really mean that, Echo?
Good-by, old Pal!
That's all there is to life, friends... a little laughter... a little tear...

Is another train coming?
You've got so many flacons, you are worse than my daughter.
Wait here until it stops raining.
Do you know what? Let it rain, you can spend the night in my house.
Hurry up, Andrea, I must go to work.
You know that I am afraid of strangers, Father.
Don't be silly, this man is no thief!
Where would you go? There is no hotel in our village. Stay here.
The storm must have cut off the wires.
I know you shall never come back...
And...
What's the matter?
Would you mind if I leave, Father?
Do you want to visit your aunt?
Very well then, go.
Why do people forget so quickly?
Why do people forget so quickly?
I yearn for you though I know you will never return. I do not dare to die.
It would kill my father if I told him.
I am so helpless!
I cosset it inside of me, even if
I feel that my life has reached its end.
I do not know why I write this letter, but I feel relief in knowing that you have not thought about me once.
My poor husband is waiting for me at the theatre.
What will you tell him about where you were?
With my lover!
You would never say that!
Your key!
Who is that gentleman?
Where does he live?
Tell him to wait!
You can say whatever you wish!
I know you are lying!
I would not like to be in her shoes.
You're impossible, you would even delude a saint! I will divorce you!
Did your "little daughter" write?
It is said he will soon be a grandfather!
They say she tied that man who spent the night at your house.
No one will dare touch the chastity of my daughter!
Your child was stillborn.
Perhaps it is better for you this way.
How some men handle their love affairs.
You see, you were here a few days longer and bed and board costs money.
Wandering aimlessly.
I am sending you some money, do not take everything so tragically.
But you wanted to go the other way.
The man who was to come for the blood transfusion is not here.
Maybe I...
Do you know how you got injured?
Your wife saved you your life.
My wife?
Yes, your wife. Don't you remember?
You brought her here in your car.
Could you bring my wife here then?
I am sorry but I can deliver this piano model only in a few weeks as I have just sold the last one.
My wife.
I can wait a few weeks for the other piano.
Dangerous friendship.
You were not home, because you knew I would come.
He is a fine man. I hope he will make a good impression on you.
...And in the evening...
...In the morning...
...In the morning...
...I ask you to reject my husband's invitation.
Forgive me, I should have done that myself.
...I know what pain I have caused you.
You may laugh at whatever I say to apologise to you. But I love you.
Have you forgiven me?
Yet in the evening...
I love you and I am jealous of you because you love your husband.
Andrea, I want you to...
Do not lie to me, he is the man who had your picture!
Who? That annoying man!
I do not know him at all!
I will keep an eye on that gentleman!
You must come with us tomorrow, we will be most pleased if you join us.
If you only knew what I think of him!
And what I think of you! Not even an angel could put up with you!
I love you so much because you are not like other men, you are not jealous.
I am not jealous, because I trust you.
I have a terrible headache.
I am so tired.
...I almost forgot.
I will give you back your key, you will need it for someone else.
On the "trip".
On the "trip".
Don't you think that leading a simple family life is most fortunate?
Why don't you get married then?
It is quite simple and easy.
That is what you think!
...I think you will lose.
Do you want me to lose?
We did not have time to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow.
It is my wife's wish. It is so nice in the south at this time of the year.
Yes, it is nice, indeed.
I hope to see you soon again!
What kind of a comedy is this!
Why aren't you sincere, Andrea?
I was never more sincere as today!
I think our trip will do you good, you will calm down.
I am calm, but you are jealous, and you are running away like a coward!
How "love" ends...
Give this letter to my husband at 5 o'clock.
Very well!
This is the end then!
You shall never see me again!
Was anyone here?
Will you believe me if I say that no one?
To loyalty - to all women!
I swear your wife is not in the room!
Liar!
The past that shall always be the past.
Shall we go?
Yes, let us go!
The End
There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.
Hot, eh?
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.
I've got the hottest song you ever heard in your life.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.
Got it? Have you got it?
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.
The second chorus, a little jazz, a little pep.
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.
Go on, Herb.
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.
Hot dog!
Listen, kid, if we can get that number, we're a cinch for the Palace.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song and smack it over for you.
Sure!
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming from the West to put it over for me.
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste a swell number like that...
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?
Nix cracking, Rosie.
Half of that sister team is going to be the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
If you wanna be made overnight, just give us a crack at that number.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. Positively not.
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.
Oh, but listen, if you want a song...
...see Georgie Cohan.
He writes good music too.
How about it, Jimmy?
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.
Quiet. I told you to pack that cooking outfit in the trunk.
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel holds the trunks, we still eat.
And, baby, when you don't eat, you lose a lot of calories.
Calories? What are they?
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?
You never got that complexion from the Greeks.
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.
And I counted them.
How high can you count?
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, food.
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the window and give me the high sign.
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
Screw.
Say, did they run out of everything but dollar signs on this thing?
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.
- Hank.
- Yes?
Come look at the elegant view.
Oh, that will be all, thank you.
Cup of coffee, order of rolls, a couple of eggs.
It worked.
Oh, Queenie, New York.
The place we've dreamed and talked about.
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.
But there's something about it that scares me, Hank.
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, it seems like we're taking an awful chance.
We were getting along so well out west.
Plenty of work, small jumps, a chance to save money.
And the act always went over big.
But here, nobody knows us.
Oh, I'm afraid.
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.
But we haven't got much money.
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back, just for one more year?
Back to those opera houses and town halls?
Those cheap hotels and their lobby comics?
Cooking our own food...
...washing our own clothes and ironing them on mirrors.
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.
Going ragged all summer and then darn near freezing in the winter. And why?
Just to save money enough to get to New York and show our act.
Oh, honey.
With your looks and my ability...
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Now don't worry.
You see that electric sign of the fellow in BVDs?
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...
...they're gonna have the Mahoney Sisters.
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...
Baby, they were plenty smart when they made you beautiful.
Come on, let's get cleaned up before Eddie gets here.
I'll run a tub for you.
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.
Hey, what are you singing?
The bubble song from Lux.
Will you join me?
No use of us both getting wet.
Will you wash mine?
I might as well. You never wash anything but your neck.
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.
Oh, you never do.
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.
Oh, I'll go.
Can you imagine my embarrassment?
Uncle Jed!
Hello, honey. How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Great.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!
Uncle Jed?
I'll be right out.
What a break for you.
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.
What do you know, Uncle Jed?
I've got you booked for 30 weeks over at the Manley Time.
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.
Say, listen, girls...
...you know, I know this town better than you do. And there are more sisters...
...doing their acts over the lunch counters in New York than over the...
Than in the theaters.
You're just a crapehanger.
Maybe, but let me tell you...
...tell you, tell you, tell you...
What's the name of that record you're playing?
Say, listen, girls...
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
I love both you girls, and I want to see you get along.
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.
But we aren't leaving this town till we get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...
Your coffee's here.
Bring the toothbrush glass when you come.
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!
Queenie!
Gosh, what a big girl you are.
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?
Well, I suppose you've decided to stay in New York.
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?
You bet.
I think we're making an awful mistake not to take that work.
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.
What did the Duncans have when they hit Times Square?
"My Patio."
Say, we've got more than the Duncans ever had.
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.
Say, what'd we do to them on the Gus Sun Time?
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.
- Eddie!
- Hank!
Oh, baby.
Let me have a good look at you.
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!
That's my Queenie!
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.
Queenie, all grown up and everything.
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss won't be so hard to take now.
I'll say it won't.
- Take it big.
- I did.
You were a funny-looking thing the first time I saw you...
...with those gangly legs and freckles.
But you certainly turned out to be a beautiful girl.
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.
Of course she is.
Well, Hank, now that you're here, when are we going to get married?
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.
Always doing something for somebody else.
No wonder I love you.
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Swell, Eddie.
Yeah, and you can feature that anytime in the electric lights.
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.
Hank, did you pack my new dress in the trunk?
I'll get it for you in a minute.
Come here, Queenie.
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.
Three carats.
Platinum.
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.
Gold garters!
Oh, Eddie, I always knew you'd make good.
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the little girl that made me come to New York.
Remember when I wanted to quit and give the whole thing up...
...and you made me stick it out?
Well, now I'm gonna do something for you.
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."
And he's naming his revue after it.
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.
True? You don't know how I stand with Zanfield.
- If we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?
And how much do we get?
You're gonna sing my "Broadway Melody" with me.
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.
Yeah, Eddie Kearns and the Mahoney Sisters.
Well, how does it go?
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse, and you come in on the chorus.
Then we do another chorus, and then go into a little dance.
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.
All ready, girls?
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?
Look at her.
Attagirl!
You like that?
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.
Go on, sit down, take a load off your mind.
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?
Come here.
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.
All right, now watch.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?
In a few minutes.
I haven't had a chance to talk to Zanfield yet.
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?
Sure, it's in the bank.
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!
Yes, sir?
We don't wanna take all afternoon to set one dance.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.
All right, Sam, let it go.
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.
The sets are all ready for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.
That's just an idea of what it's gonna be.
I can see that. It's just an idea.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
But don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.
Remind me to see that rehearsal in the morning. Make a note of that.
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't get it in the gold design, only in the silver.
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.
All right, wheel them in.
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?
Well, go over there and tell him what you want.
The Baloney Sisters.
Give us the introduction pickup and some choruses. And swell to the finish.
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.
Sam, looks like some carnival lost a good act.
I'm gonna lay that dame like a roll of linoleum.
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.
Well, all right, shoot.
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.
What's the matter with them?
There's something wrong with the piano.
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.
All right. All right, girls.
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.
I saw enough.
I can use the blond, but that little cluck is out.
But don't you know it's tough to put comedy over on a bare stage?
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.
I know, Eddie.
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.
We stopped the show every performance we did for Jake Wells.
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.
Say, you've been asking for trouble, and now you're gonna get it.
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond, you! What do you think of this act?
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!
Come here!
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!
Next time I'll give you a facial instead of a scalp treatment.
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick on me? I didn't start any fight with her.
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?
Don't let them throw you up in the air.
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.
Flo, what was the trouble about?
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.
Never mind who started it. Now run along and be a good little girl.
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?
I heard what you said about me.
Please, couldn't you use the both of us at the same salary?
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.
My sister is the business manager of the act.
You won't let on that it ain't the both of us you want, will you?
Of course not.
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!
All right.
Oh, Hank!
He can take his old show and put it where it'll do him the most good!
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?
Well, so am I busy, with 30 weeks waiting for me.
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!
Let me handle this. I can always take care of these things better with nobody around.
I'll talk to him.
All right, girls, we'll take this right from the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.
I heard what you said to Zanny.
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.
I could kiss you for that.
You mustn't do that, Eddie.
I guess I shouldn't.
I never realized you were...
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.
You mean next to Hank.
Yeah, sure.
You know, Hank's been everything in the world to me.
She's looked after me and worked for me, and fought for me, protected me.
I could never repay her for all her love and care.
Of course you love her, Queenie.
And you're gonna be everything that she wants you to be.
And I don't blame her for loving you.
Gee, but you're a cute kid.
And she loves you, Eddie.
I guess you and me are about all she ever thinks of.
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes so I couldn't sing...
...and go lame so I couldn't dance than to hurt Hank.
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!
I ain't booked acts for 10 years and not know how to handle them!
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!
- And plenty smart!
- And how!
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.
And we splits up for nobody!"
And with that, he smiled as nice as you please...
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.
"Maloney"!
Hey, come on and get those clothes on, will you?
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?
Yes, sir, everything ready to go when you say the word.
All right.
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.
Yes, that's perfectly safe.
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup for just one show a day?
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.
It ain't a bit different than it was in Reading, PA.
And we're going over just as big.
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.
"Big mammoth appearance of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.
Zanfield saw them once, and they were in.
With appreciation and regards to our agent, Uncle Jed."
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?
I'm nervous!
What's eating her?
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.
I get you.
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told you they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman, I design the costumes for the show...
...not the doors for the theater.
I know that. If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's killing my "Broadway Melody" number.
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, you!
When you get through with that noise, try and play my number.
Cut out the brass, and keep it very piano.
Are you back again?
Yes, and I'm telling you how I want my music played.
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.
You don't have to listen.
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was for buying it.
Maybe he'll get you to write the music for the show.
If I couldn't do better than this...
If you could, you wouldn't be waving a stick!
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.
What are you trying to do, ruin my profile?
Your profile was ruined the day you were born.
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.
Hey, put that spotlight over here on this girl!
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.
Say, you couldn't sing if you had a searchlight.
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.
Would you okay this bill for Miss William's second act?
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!
But you said ermine.
You'll giggle yourself right out of here one day.
Yes, sir.
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal, and he says there's a fortune in the show.
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.
From all the gold-diggers you got in the troupe.
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget off of his ledge, they're going some!
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.
Get out of here and hurry up.
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!
- Over there!
- Over where?
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.
More. With those beads.
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.
Elgin, call a doctor.
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.
Why, has he cut us out altogether?
Ain't it awful, the way they cut out these big stars?
I'll get to you in a minute.
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield, you can't cut us out like that.
We've got equity contract.
Kearns, go into the dance on the first chorus and end it there.
One more cut for you, dearie, and you'll be holding a spear.
And one more crack from you, bimbo, and you'll be holding a lily.
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out and give me a chance to do my number?
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage a moment? It's very important.
- All right.
- Yes, sir.
What's the trouble now?
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?
No, sir.
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.
Mahoney's the name, and let me tell you something...
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.
You may not know it, but we've played some of the very best...
Listen, we want you on the prow of that boat.
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.
But I don't want to take my clothes off.
No, that'll be all right.
But listen to me. I've never taken my clothes off in my life.
I know all about that. Come on.
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.
Over here.
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?
That's tough. I missed him.
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.
- That's fine.
- Great.
Sit down with us.
Oh, Jules. Jules.
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?
I guess it's just a gift.
By the way, what's the name of that little beauty on the boat?
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.
Yes, sir.
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.
What a flock of Johns will be waiting at that stage door!
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.
I may be there myself.
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.
Hank, did you see Queenie?
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had to get by on our legs before.
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face.
This is Broadway.
Yeah. Broad's way.
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.
Attagirl.
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek at you up there on that boat...
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?
I bet them that the most beautiful girl in New York will have supper with us.
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.
- No. Not tonight.
- No?
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.
We got a couple of others.
"Zanny saw them once, and they were in."
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.
Not altogether. And what of it?
Yeah, I know.
Do you think that's all I'll get to do, go on without any clothes on?
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.
You got a lot more on when you ain't got anything...
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.
Well, I guess I'll go get undressed again.
Come in.
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.
Well, listen. Zanny is giving a big party at his apartment tonight.
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?
That guy threw me out of your song tonight.
I ain't gonna give him a chance to throw me out of a window.
Let's get a bowl of chop suey, and we'll rewrite the show.
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.
Well, you can get most anything out of a bowl of chop suey.
Oh, cutie!
Come on, Queenie.
You two run along.
I've got some things to do, and I'll join you later.
Why, what's the matter?
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.
Get your hat. You'll feel better when you get out of here.
Oh, sure, honey, come on.
I can't go.
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?
You've got a date with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.
I'll have to show you whether I can or not.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.
Maybe you had better wait for me just a few minutes down on the stage.
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.
- Hurry.
- I will.
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.
He ain't the right kind of a guy for you to go out with.
What difference does it make what kind of a guy he is?
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.
I can take care of myself. And you can both mind your own business.
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.
You keep out of this.
I've got my own life to live, and I'm gonna live it.
I'm not gonna be the third wheel to anybody's bicycle!
Oh, Queenie!
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?
Why, she's never gone against my advice before.
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.
I guess the bright lights got under her skin.
Come on, let's go and get a bowl of chili.
Queenie!
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.
Oh, they're elegant.
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.
Good morning, beautiful lady.
Oh, you frightened me.
Good morning.
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?
You have some place to go, haven't you?
Are you putting me out?
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.
Any girl that can look beautiful so early in the morning...
That sounds like you know a lot about girls.
I do. I'm an expert.
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.
Well, so long.
- Must I go?
- Please do.
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.
I'm arranging a little party tonight for your birthday.
- A party for me?
- Yes.
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.
Then I'm gonna wait right here till she gets back.
Well, it looks as if I'd better take the air.
I'll give you a ring a little later, shall I?
Fine.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And thank you again for the flowers.
Well, I've got my suspicions about any guy that kisses a girl's hand.
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.
What are you burned up about?
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.
Hank'll be here in a minute, and you can start raving to her.
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.
Why do you let a guy like that hang around you?
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick of hearing you crab all the time.
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.
What do you think of that?
I know. But you haven't anything to do in the show.
I can team you up with this blond and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.
Nope. I've gotta stick around and keep an eye on Queenie.
Queenie? What has she been doing?
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.
Night after night, she's out with Jock Warriner.
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.
With Eddie?
Now, now listen, Hank.
Why don't you give Eddie a break and marry him?
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.
That's it.
Now, watch this one.
Boy, if you could do that with my wife.
Say, give us something good, something new.
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?
Hello, everybody.
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."
Take this cake in the other room, and when you hear us yell "surprise"...
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.
Someone's coming. Are you all set?
Quiet, quiet.
Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?
Why, there was another party, and I forgot to tell her about this one.
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.
Jock Warriner, huh.
Say, listen, I've got an idea.
Let's give the party...
Let's give the party...
- For Hank.
- Great!
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.
Hank doesn't feel very well.
Well, all right, we'll go down to your room.
Good night. I hope you feel better.
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
You see what you're missing?
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.
Good night, dear.
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.
But don't make it too long. You know that bottle won't last very long.
Queenie and me have always been on the level.
And now I'm fronting for her.
Won't you please give her all the best of the breaks?
What's the matter, Hank?
I lost something.
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.
That's one break.
Goodbye, baby.
Happy birthday.
Queenie, aren't you having a good time?
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.
Call me Jock, won't you?
All right.
Mr. Warriner.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.
I want you to stand up here where everyone can see you.
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!
A happy birthday to Queenie, the queen of New York's beautiful girls.
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!
I can't say anything but thanks, everybody. A lot.
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?
That cake is just elegant...
...but I can't eat it all.
Well, you eat as much as you can, and we'll save the rest.
Please, Mr. Warriner, ask them to play something else.
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.
"Broadway Melody."
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.
Tell me...
...why don't you like that song?
I don't know.
Well, what do you like?
I like cake.
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?
Maybe.
You mean it?
Maybe.
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?
Maybe.
Please, I wanna dance.
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.
But look, everybody's dancing, and the music is playing and everything.
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?
Why, of course.
Diamonds should only be worn by beautiful girls.
Oh, it's just adorable.
I'd like to do a lot of things for you, Queenie.
How would you like an apartment all your own?
Say, on Park Avenue.
And a car all your own.
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.
Well, I'd have to think about that.
Say, where have you been?
I've been looking all over the place for you.
You would come in at a time like this.
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.
Let's have this dance.
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.
Well, that's swell, because I wanna to tell you...
...about the grandest party that ever happened to me.
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see anything more beautiful in all your life?
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.
And Eddie said he wouldn't even give me a ring.
What would I want with his ring?
There's more diamonds in a bracelet, ain't they? Ain't they?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying this for...
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.
And an apartment on Park Avenue.
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.
Now, honey, listen to me.
I know we ain't had the greatest break in the world since we hit New York.
But that's gonna change.
That's got to.
And you're gonna meet somebody that's right.
Somebody you can be proud of, who'll just be crazy about you.
Somebody who's really worthy of you.
Somebody like Eddie.
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...
...with some song-and-dance guy...
...who expects me to cook his meals over a gas-jet...
...listen to a lot of smart wisecracks and bum songs.
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.
Move over.
No more of these kind of dumps for mine.
I'm gonna have everything in the world I want.
That's me.
And you're gonna have Eddie.
Queenie, I don't want you to answer me like that again.
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.
How are you gonna stop me?
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?
And don't you see what I'm doing is for your...
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.
You're not gonna go out with that guy, hear me?
I'll stop you if I have to tie you up to do it. You hear me?
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.
Well, you hear me. I'm going out with whoever I want...
...and I won't hear orders from anyone about it.
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!
You ain't my boss. So mind your own business and shut up.
Oh, Queenie.
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet, and you don't know things.
What Hank has been saying to you is for your own good.
Yeah, and I suppose what you're saying is for my own good too.
As far as that goes, yes, it is.
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because I...
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.
And whether you like me or hate me, you're gonna pay attention to me...
...because I'm...
Well...
Me and Hank won't let you go out with that guy. He's no good.
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.
You and Hank...
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.
Here's your pants, sir.
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.
Oh, can't I say nothing that will make you see what I mean?
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Warriner. Do you know what they say about that guy?
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?
What are you so interested for?
What business is it of yours where I go and who I go with?
It's my business because...
Well, because it is.
Oh, you ought to know why I'm doing this.
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.
And you gotta hear it.
I love you, Queenie.
I love you, and you know it.
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.
But it's easy to say now.
I love you, dear.
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?
Yes, Eddie.
And that's why we can't...
Oh, don't you see now why...
Why what?
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.
Here's your coat, sir.
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.
Get on there, Kearns.
Queenie, you better be here when I get off.
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got no idea what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun without you trying to stop me?
Oh, I ain't trying to stop you having fun...
...but this thing will turn out bad.
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.
He ain't the type to take a girl out and buy her drinks...
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.
I'm old enough to know what I'm gonna do.
And I don't want no more cracks from you and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
What I'm saying's for your own good.
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.
You will give it to me.
Queenie.
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.
You're not gonna leave except with me and Hank.
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.
I'll make him suffer the way he's making me suffer.
Shut up!
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.
Gonna stay right here. No.
Let go of me.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from either of you. You've said enough.
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Queenie, Queenie!
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?
You gonna let a john like that steal her from you because he's got a little more jack?
Well, if you do, all I can say is you're a rotten quitter.
You love her, don't you?
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.
Say, if I loved a girl like you do Queenie...
...l'd fight for her. What's the matter with you? Where's your nerve?
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.
What do you think I've been meaning all along? I was on the level with this thing?
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.
Say, I wouldn't marry you if you was the last man on earth.
And at that, I ain't so sure you're the right guy for her.
You're a coward.
You're afraid of Jock Warriner, or you'd go out and fight for her.
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!
You're yellow. Do you hear me?
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.
You're white.
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Jed?
It's Hank.
Say, I've decided to take those 30 weeks.
You can team me up with that blond.
I'm breathless.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.
It's not half good enough for you.
I want you to have everything in the world.
Thank you.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?
I want you to meet my girlfriend.
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.
Why, I haven't had you to myself for a moment tonight.
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.
Wait, Queenie.
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.
Wait a minute, Queenie.
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.
You're going to stay right here with me.
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.
You won't keep me here, do you hear me? You won't.
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.
I won't stay with you another minute.
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.
What do you mean coming in here? Get out.
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.
Oh, Eddie.
What's the matter?
Oh, darling, let me see you.
Oh, Eddie. Have they hurt you, sweetheart?
Have they?
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.
You don't realize what you're doing.
You let me go. And you can take your jewelry and your presents...
...and everything. I don't want anything to do with you.
Let me get a sock at that guy.
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.
And stay out.
What do you know about that guy?
Got rid of that guy anyhow.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.
You dirty bums, you.
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.
I am.
I don't know why you feel sorry for anybody like me.
I'm no good.
I can't even scrap a little.
I let a heel like that take a sock at me and get away with it.
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.
I suppose you found that out from his hugs.
Well, if you couldn't stop them from throwing you out...
...how could I stop him from hugging me?
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.
Oh, Eddie, aren't you gonna take me home?
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?
Like you? Why, Queenie, I...
Oh, what is it? They've hurt you, I know they have.
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.
Now understand, it took six of them to throw me out.
Yes, Eddie.
Oh, what is it?
Oh, they'll be here any minute.
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?
Well, what's the matter with this thing?
See who that is.
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!
Oh, gee.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.
Oh, come here.
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be in the electric lights this time?
Queenie Kearns and Company?
No, sirree.
I'm only gonna be connected with the stage by marriage.
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest little home down on Long Island.
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.
And say, when you're finished with this tour, you're coming to live with us.
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine, where I can get service.
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
No home, no nothing.
Hank, you're just a born trouper.
Doggone this weather. It certainly is tough on colds, isn't it?
Well, say, I want Queenie and Eddie to see the act.
Say, where is that blond, anyway?
I don't know. She's always late.
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have a good time on your honeymoon?
Yeah, great.
Oh, Eddie, when you open your new show...
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.
Oh, you're grand.
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.
Okay.
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.
We're gonna break in the act and bring it to New York.
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.
I want two choruses...
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part in your show for that dame, get me?
Of course not, honey.
It's kind of rough yet, but don't you say it's pretty good for an opening?
You know, if you don't hurry, you're gonna miss that train.
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.
Oh, Hank.
That's all right, Queenie.
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.
Here. Here. Here's your valise.
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.
The season will be over before you know it, and she'll be back here with us.
It ain't that, honey.
But it seems like Hank ain't never had a real break.
And I guess I haven't done much to make her any happier.
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.
And now that she knows you're taken care of...
Don't cry, honey.
People can't help falling in love.
It comes to you no matter what you do.
And I love you, dear.
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.
You were just meant for me.
Opening in Peoria.
Four shows a day.
Zanny said he'd make me a star in six months.
Say, listen, it's better to star in...
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.
That's a bunk.
Say, now you listen to me, stupid. I'll handle things.
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway and in the Palace in less than six months.
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
Sure, it's...
It's... It's in the can.

WAY DOWN EAST
A Simple Story of Plain People.
Since the beginning of time man has been polygamous
- even the saints of Biblical history - but the son of
Man gave a new thought. and the world is growing nearer the true ideal. He gave of One Man for One
Woman.
Not by laws - our Statures are now overburdened by ignored laws - but within the heart of man, the truth must bloom that his greatest happiness lies in his purity and constancy.
Today Woman brought up grom childhood to expect
ONE CONSTANT MATE possibly suffers more than at any point in the history of mankind, because not yet has the man-animal reached this high standard
- except perhaps in theory.
If there is anything in this story that brings home to men the suffering caused by our selfishness, perhaps it will not be in vain.
Time and place - in the story world of make-believe,
Characters; Incidents - never occurred-yet always happening.
Let us suppose a remote village in New England.
Ana Moore and her mother.
We call her "Anna" - we might have called her
"Woman" - for is not herw the story -
Sore need of money drives the mother to appeal to the
Tremonts, their rich relatives in Boston.
Oh Mother, I hate to ask them for money.
So, through the troubled twilight...
All right Mother, I'll go.
THE DEPARTURE
Tell Cousin Emma I made this hug-me-tight my own hands.
The fashion paper says these gloves are style in the city.
An errand undertaken with the tremulous footsteps that ever mark the trail of the
"poor relation"
Her cousins, the Tremonts, were giving a bridge whist party the afternoon of
Anna's arrival.
Cousin Emma Tremon
Herself.
Diana Tremont, her daughter.
An occasional interloper in
Society - The dashing
Lennox Sanderson, who depends go his living upon a rich father.
He has three specialties:
Women! Women! And
WOMEN.
There is a young person - says she's your Cousin
Anna Moore - from
Greenville.
My dear child! Whatever brought you here?
Well, you see, things haven’t been going very well - and we wanted to ask you - if -
Courage failing, she changes the subject to the hug-me-tight.
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Tremont imparts the embarrassing news of the country cousin's arrival to her daughters.
Well, get rid of her.
But to impress their eccentric, but enormously rich aunt, the sisters pretend to be nice to Anna.
I knew you both from your pictures.
Yes, I expect to stay quite a time - that is, if we suit each other.
CHAPTER II
Near the country estate of then Santerson family is
Bartlett Village.
Also the home of Squire
Bartlett, the richest farmer in the neighborhood.
The clock hand points to blossoms - and awakening.
David Bartlett though of plain stock, haw been tutored by poets and visions as the world.
Squire Bartlett, a stern old puritan, who lives according to his awn con- seption of the Scriptures, particularly the "Thou
Shalt Nots".
Mrs. Barlett, whose gentle soul is as sweet as her beloved Scriptures.
Day dreams of twenty-one.
The great Tremont ball - the climax of the social season.
Anna's dress that she and her mother had made in case she should go out in
Society.
It's quite all right - and from the balcony you can see uis dancing.
Solely to pique the sisters of whom she is not over-fond, the aunt makes different arrangements for Anna.
Oh, Aunty! - This dress
- where’s the top?
Beneath the alcove lights' golden glow.
Anna's delicate beauty a whip to Sanderson's laded appetite.
In your beauty lives again
Elaine, the lily maid, love dreaming at Astolat.
Tell me more.
Cousin Emma hurries Anna off to bed - perhaps in fear of her own daughters being outshone.
The susceptible Sanderson, obsesed by a new desire.
Sanderson, after managing several meetings, finally lures Anna to the apartment to meet a mythical aunt.
Wait - I'll call Aunty.
Strange, she isn't here.
Just five minutes! She'll be back any time.
If she doesn't come in five minutes - I must go.
You don't understand...
I mean... I want you to... to marry me.
Anna's inexperienced heart caught in a tide of infatuation.
Oh, I' m just going to tell everybody.
But Sanderson, dreading to cross the wishes of his rich father, upon whom he is de- pendent, persuades Anna to promise secrecy.
Sanderson belongs to a class which, if it cannot get what is wants in one way, it will go to any length to get it in another.
Evil plans.
Passion's urge knows no conscience and various its ways to betrayal.
Sanderson induces Anna to marry secretly before going home.
Far away it happens that
David Bartlett is dreaming a troubled dream.
Don't worry... everything's all right. Don't you trust me?
So... it is done.
The bridal suite at
Rose Tree Inn.
To her it is the fulfillment of the dreams of girlhood
- to him but another adventure.
Here conscience knocks at the door... perhaps the slightest interruptions might still avert this tragedy, but...
My... my husband!
The afternoon the Bartlett post office was robbed.
The dread minion of the
Law - Rube Whipple,
Constable.
Seth Holcomb waiting for
Martha Perkins, whom he has been following around for twenty years.
Seth takes his liquor under tha name of
"Long Life Bitters".
Martha Perkins, a relic, nobody needs newspaper when she is around.
The Constable on the man hunt.
Napoleon, his fiery steed.
Napoleon refuses to climb the hill.
The temptation of
Napoleon.
These men! I just can't keep tem from following me.
Great news! Post office bin robbed! Dollar eighty-two cents in postage stamps, eighteen postal cards!
Heavy loss to the government.
I'll 'low bno man to laugh at the law, Seth Holcomb.
The both win.
Charter IV.
One day of the honeymoon before Anna starts home with her great secret.
Promise now.
Only two days!
Anna's return home.
Anna relieves her mother's anxiety with happy mysterious hints of wealth to come.
The old way too pleasant to give up.
Less and less frequent their secret meetings until at last...
In answer to her urgent letter...
All right. I'll wait.
You haven't told anyone aboyt our marriage?
She tells him of a tender new reason why the secret cannot be kept any longer.
You mustn’t tell ANYONE.
Well...
Well... if you MUST know
The truth...
Because we aren't married at all!
You’re just joking... tell me, aren't you joking?
WE MUST be married... see... see... our ring...
Marriage would have meant my losing everything...
I intended to make it right... but...
For Heaven's sake, don't make a scene! I'll let you have lots of money and you can go away.
Mother! Mother!
When the mother returns...
Some time afterwards - left alone by her mother's death
- Anna hides away with her shame in the village of Belden.
Maternity:
Woman's Gethsemane.
Shadows across the time dial.
The baby without a name.
My child, your baby is very sick.
Ten drops of this in a little water every hour until
I return.
Where's your husband?
Oh... he's away.
The landlady solemnly reminds Anna that if the baby dies without being baptized, it will never see Got.
Helpless and alone in the dreadful hours of the night, and stricken with a terrible fear for her baby's soul... she herself performs the sacred rite.
In the name of the Father, and of the son... and of the Holy Ghost...
I baptize thee...
TRUST LENNOX.
The vigil.
The little hands grow cold upon her breast.
My child, your baby is dead.
Sanderson on his country estate at Bartlett.
Everybody is talking about you having no husband.
I guess you'll have to leave.
Upon her back the age-old Cross.
The Pilgrimage.
Hi Holler, the Barlett's chore boy, sprucing op in the barn to meet Kate, the Squire's niece.
A reckless spectator.
Oh! Hi! Hi Holler! Hurry up! It's time to fetch Kate!
Anna, in search of work, reaches Barlett Village.
Kate, the Squire's niece, returns from a short trip to Boston.
The Professor, summer boarder at Squire Barlett's. pursues his studies.
Is this the young niece you were expecting from
Boston?
I am looking for work.
Work? You don't 'pear to have no strength to work.
Where ye from?
Whose your folks?
I haven't any folks.
For all we know she might be some loose woman wanderin' 'round. I won't take her inter my hum!
Sorry, young lady, but I ain't got nothing for yet.
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these... ye have done it unto me!
That's Scripture, Father.
All right, Mother, we'll try her. Nobody can't ever say
I went aging the Scriptures!
Whatever your troubles, child, remember, the Lord is your Shepherd, you shall not want.
Kate's Homecoming.
It has been settled by the
Squire and David’s childhood that they are to marry,
Open admiration.
The Professor, meeting
Kate, is converted to the scientific theory of Love at first sight.
Oh, Professor, my shoe is untied.
Well, well, neighbor
Sanderson, haven’t seen you since Kate went away.
Kate - Sanderson's newest infatuation.
David, you'll have time before supper to show
Neighbor Sanderson that heifer he wants to buy.
What are you doing here?
I am working.
You can't stay here.
I live right across the way.
Come right in, Mr. Sanderson!
Supper's ready.
You father was right.
I'm afraid I'm not strong enough for this work.
Release don't do away,
Miss Moore! I... we all... like you very much.
You'll get stronger after awhile, and...
Anna! David!
Come right in.
END OF PART I
WAY DOWN EAST
Part II
Meanwhile, Anna, her past still a closed book, has become a beloved member of the household.
Knowing only Anna's blameless life among them,
David thrilled with the thought that she is the virginal white flower of his dreams.
By the river and the distant music of the falls - Around them the sweet scent of summer fields.
The David points out the two forks of the river, that go into one...
And all a thrill with a great sincere love,
Visions to her how they two might go,
On through life together...
One heart for one heart,
One soul for one soul,
One love for one love,
Even through Eternity.
At last the freat over- whelming love - only to be halted by the stark ghosts of her past.
I am only trying to say I love you, Anna - it seems
I've always loved you!
So she tells him he must never speak like this again.
The summer goes, the winter comes,
We cannot rile the year,
Nor can we rule the barque of Fate,
Nor all its strange ways steer.
The Professor's love... burdened heart brings him down to the country to see
Kate.
I'm going ter read yer some funny jokes.
Why does a chicken cross the road?
None of the rooster’s
Business.
Ain't that funny?
Three eggs, two bad.
Miss Kate, I want to ask... if you will... be... my...
The ice is going out soon.
When the river starts you'd better look out down below there!
Anna goes ton the store after forgotten goodies for the big party planned for the evening.
The villain still pursues her.
The sewing circle next to the grocery store.
Maria Poole, the landlady from Belden, visits Barlett.
That's Anna Moor lives down to Squire
Barlett's.
Moore? Her name ain't
Moore...
She lived at my house.
Mrs. Lennox, she called herself... but she never had no husband at all!
And then... there was a baby!
The Squire thinks it time that David and Kate come to an understanding.
It's my bounden duty to go and expose this woman to the Squire.
Father's set on getting married but I don't think we can without proper love... do you?
Suppose, Squire, I had been like you suspected when you first saw me?
Would there be any hope of forgiveness?
When the law's broke. it's broke, ain't it? A wrong’s a wrong and nothing can make it right.
Of course...
I was just supposing.
On their way to the big barn dance.
Maria Poole, from Belden, was at the sewing circle and she says...
No. I shouldn't tell you!
It's that...
Oh, it's awful...
But before Martha tells her thrilling news...
On their way to the big party, they stop to warm up at the Squire's with an old- fashioned dance.
No, I am not invited to the party,
The Professor, dazed but happy.
All bound 'round a woolen string!
A great big hat with a great big brim.
All bound 'round, all bound 'round.
All bound 'round with a woolen string!
David, for some reason, suddenly discovers he is not interested in the party.
The neighbors' barn dance.
Moro and worried by Anna's presence... also afraid she will interfere in his pursuit of
Kate - Saderson -
I can't have you around here where I live!
Suppose they find out about your past life?
You'd have to fet out them!
Suppose they find out about YOUR past life!
Oh, it's different with a
MAN! He's supposed to sow his wild oats.
At last Martha gets her opportunity with the
Squire.
Does Lennox Sanderson mean anything to you?
Why do you ask such question?
Because I can't keep silent any longer.
I love you! I want you to be my wife.
It's about Anna Moore.
She lived in Belden under the name of Lennox.
Mrs. Lennox.
A baby was born, but there ware not no wedding ring to the finger.
No, father... you must have proof.
I'll go to Belden in the morning... and if it is true...
Please! Please don't!
I can never be ANY
MAN'S WIFE!
The next morning. The
Squire on his way to
Belden to investigate
Martha's story.
The Squire's on important business, isn't he?
So happens that
Sanderson...
At noon Squire arrives in Belden.
It's all true. Why, her baby was born in this very room.
Late afternoon.
Roses in wintertime!
Lan' sakes!
Don't want no supper of your getting!
The time's come for you to get your things and get out of this house!
Don't want no words!
Just get out!
It means she is going to get out of my house!
I found out all about her... she ain't fit to be here!
She's the mother of a baby, but she ain't got
NO HUSBAND!
Tell them it's a lie,
Anna!
I... I can't!
You found out so much!
Why didn't you find out the whole truth?
That I was an ignorant girl betrayed through a mock marriage.
This man... an honored guest at your table... why don't find out what
HIS life haw been?
For HE is the man who betrayed me!
And then the storm.
The sugar camp.
Anna's lost in the storm... get out men... quick!
Frenzied... tortured...
The calling river.
The storm lulls.
The great ice-break.
The ice jam gives way... rushing to the falls.
Quick! Quick!
The Doctor!
Toward morning.
The Squire asks forgiveness.
Come, Anna, I know I didn't the right thing. I'm willing to marry you now if you want me.
I... I will.
I will.
Interested witnesses.
Seth, wilt thou have this woman to be the wedded wife...?
I... I will.
The one man for the one woman,
Between them the
Sacramental bond...
Life's cleanest and sweetest.

THE END
So fleet the works of men
Back to their earth again
Ancient and holy things
Fade like a dream -
Stately castles whose turrets pierced the sky have left imperishable record -
Though the storms of centuries have laid waste the works of their spirit soars on and poets make live again the days of chivalry.
Mediaeval England - England in the Age of Faith.
Her chronicles tell of warriors and statesmen, of royal Crusaders, of jousting knights. Her ballads sing of jolly friars, of troubadours, of gallant outlaws who roamed her mighty forests.
History - in its ideal state - is a compound of legend and chronicle and from out both we ogger you an impression of the Middle Ages -
Excitement rises high for the final event in a tournament.
From far and near have come all England's knighthood for, on the morrow, they depart on the Holy Crusade.
And so the lofty battlements of the castle look down upon the chivalry of
England in all its glory -
Richard of the lion Heart,
England's immortal King impulsive, generous and brave -
Prince John, the Kings brother- sinister, dour, his heart inflamed with an unholy desire to succeed to Richard's throne -
High above the clash of lance and shield in joust and tourney, the fairest maiden was chosen to reign for a day as the
Queen of Love and Beauty -
Lady Marian Fitzwalter, from whose slim white hands would fall... the chaplet of valor on the
Victorious knight -
Sir Guy of Gusbourne, intimate of Prince John and one of the two contenders for the championship -
Your veil for a favor, fair lady, that you may see it worn in victory.
The other contender for the championship-favorite of King Richard -
The Earl of Huntingdon's trusted squire...
To gain unfair advantage
Gusbourne straps himself to his saddle...
Brother, Ill gage you this against your prize falcon that Huntingdon wins the day.
On the knight with the white plume!
The marshals inspect the equipment of the contestants...
They splinter their lances - ever a good omen for Huntingdon!
I double mine on
Huntingdon!
Huntingdon hath proved his knightly mettle.
We hereby decree that on this Holy Crusade he shall be our second in command.
Go to the fair maid,
Marian, and receive the victor's crown.
Exempt me, sire.
I am a feared of women.
Another woman!
In the great hall of the castle the feasting that followed close upon the tournament has lasted far into the dawn...
Brave hearts that smile through parting tears...
Knightly lovers tell again their love to maidens fair...
Ladies' eyes speak courage to their knights...
Apart from the others, Prince
John and Guy of Gisbourne, dizzy with wine and drunk with thoughts of power...
The King's goblet...
Dog of a servant! This on the morrow shall be mine - and everything that is the King's shall them be mine.
A servant hath a friend and his friend hath a friend.
Be discreet my Prince.
Where is Huntingdon?
With dagger at head he doth try his strength for the goblet.
At such a time as this it were more befitting that he try his love for a maid.
Why hast thou not a maid?
When I return, good my liege.
Nay, before you go, good my knight.
A castle and lands to the maid who wins him.
You too shall have your pick of maidens, my Gisbourne.
So? Sits the wind in that direction? The Lady Marian, eh? A goodly choice.
You forget, Sir Knight.
I am a Prince.
It is only the Prince who has forgotten.
I regret, Lady Marian, that a brother of our noble King should so degrade his knighthood.
I fear you have incurred his enmity... in my behalf.
I was but my knightly privilege...
Interference is a dangerous pastime, my squire.
I... I never knew... a maid... could be... like you...
Now... all too swiftly... comes the hour of parting...
...and o'er the kneeling hosts the Bishop lifts his hand in benediction...
...and for the cross that gleams upon his shoulder each knight breathes a silent vow...
While on the battlements...
HUNTINGDON!
My lord King, I go to the
Holy Land with half a heayt.
The other half I leave in the keeping of a maid.
Good! Now your blade will be keener.
I leave in your keeping my dearest treasure.
Guard her with your life.
See that Richard never returns from the Holy Land.
Nor Huntingdon.
Even Kings must wait on love...
Huntingdon's head for Lady Marian's hand.
Do not forget.
And so the very flower England's knighthood marched on to its high purpose.
Scarce had the dust of the Crusaders settled to the Crusaders settled to the ground when the dire mischief of Prince John was set afoot...
When the throne is mine, I will reward those who serve me. To your task and spare no one.
All of England fell under the pall of
Prince John's perfidy.
By Prince John's order the good officials of the town of Nottingham are ousted...
I am the High
Sheriff of Nottingham.
The poor who cannot pay the tax levy are forced to give up their belongings...
For slaying a wild boar in
Prince John's forest...
For spurning Prince
John's addresses...
In Richard's castle
Prince John's henchmen apprise him of their evil successes...
Your bidding has been done. Huntingdon's castle is razed and burnt.
One woman braver than the rest...
Have mercy on the people of England.
Fred not your pretty head for such as they.
Prince, your oppressions will not please our King.
A Prince at home outranks a King abroad.
Think you not so, beautiful lady?
If Richard knew these things, there would be no Prince at home.
That maid bears watching.
In silence and at night...
Take this message and sleep nor night nor day until you reach your master.
Day after day... across the fields of
France... the Crusaders had plodded on...
Mark how Huntingdon spurs them on. He is the very backbone of the adventure.
A good way to crack a head, my master. Would were thy brother's.
To your tent. These fevers are but passing ills. Ere the night falls thou wilt be able to march again.
He plays his tricks of discipline to cozen favor of the King... the sycophant!
But for discipline
I'd twist you round a tent-pole and crack your spine!
Why come you here?
The people suffer and perish. The women of the castle hang their heads in shame.
Intrigue and death lurk in every corner. Desperately my heart cries out to you.
If the King should know of this, himself would return and this
Holy Crusade would fail.
If Richard had but one friend in England...
Fetch falcon.
My Beloved.
By some pretext I shall persuade the King to allow me to return.
On the heels of this missive
I shall be in England.
Huntingdon
Speed this letter and prepare our departure.
I pray you, my Lord and King, to speak again your trust in me which you have so oft prosed.
As I trust my right hand do I trust you.
You are my friend.
Then, my liege, your leave and favor to return  to
England without unfoldment of my purpose.
I humbly beseech you, not as my King but as my friend, to place unquestioned this trust in me.
Tis not the maid?
You! Turned chickenhearted for a wench!
You do but jest. go join the lances of your King.
Sire, what needs doing... must be done. But my heart aches that your friendship fails me.
My Beloved.
By some pretext I shall persuade the King to allow me to return.
On the heels of this missive
I shall be in England.
Huntingdon
Sire, you must trust me!
We wait not on permission.
We go to England though hell itself should gape and bid us stay.
A deserter.
Is this true?
The truth is... that back in England...
My Beloved.
By some pretext I shall persuade the King to allow me to return.
On the heels of this missive
I shall be in England.
Huntingdon
Sire, the penalty is death.
Have his wound attended.
Place him in that tower.
He will remain a prisoner, until our return. See to it that he is well cared for.
But, my liege, the penalty is death!
My command! Obey!
Give them food and drink until our last column is well on its way. Then let them rot.
In England Lady
Marian's serving woman comes under the dread inquisition of John...
Tell me what has become of
Huntingdon's squire.
I'll tell... I'll tell. Tis true.
He did carry information from mistress the King.
Lady Marian shall pay for this with her life.
So much for melding!
Quick! Fly for your life.
He means to kill.
I seek Lady Marian
Filzwalter.
After her, Bring her back. I'll put an end to tattling!
Scarce was the last column of England's knighthood well on its way when...
Unlock the door.
To England... with all haste.
There is work to do.
While in England, sturdy men, rebellions to Prince John's tyranny, sought refuge in
Sherwood Forest...
Prince John's deed!
These lusty rebels only waited a leader to weld them into a band... an outlaw band destined to live immortal in legend and story.
A friend of Richard returns to his native soil...
Good my lord... poor Lady Marian... it was on this very spot... here... a riderless horse... an overturned saddle...
To God... to Richard... and to her.
Thus it was that Huntingdon buried his Yesterday. Here began a new life... a life to be dedicated to revenge... bitter... but joyous.
In far-off Palestine
Richard meets with victory and concludes a truce with the infidel...
A year passed and then... from the mysterious depths of Sherwood Forest... came whispers of the rise of a robbers chief...
Robin Hood!
The High Sheriff of Nottingham...
Tis the naked arrow of Robin Hood and sings death to the emeries of King Richard.
A butcher's stall in Locksley Town...
The three lions of
Richard. It is Robin
Hoods manner of saying:
If ye be brave, come to
Sherwood Forest.
Richard is your King.
The rich man of Wakefield...
He seems to be everywhere. I confess
I am helpless.
Our very soldiers desert to join this outlaw's band.
Fetch me a bag of gold.
There are lots of visions and the way to a good result, to captures this Robin Hood:
John
This will put a stop to it.
Robin Hood!
Will Scarlett...
Friar Tuck...
Little John...
Robin Hood's lair...
Mark you his hat.
Allan - a - Dale...
Three blasts!
We rob the rich, relieve distressed
On damned John to score.
We'll take a life if sorely presses
Jill Richard reign once more.
While Prince John's dark schemes are sped in distant lands...
Richard's sleeping tent...
Now for England... and my reward!
Alas, poor fool.
Thou hast played king once too often.
Gisbourne!
On the morrow a messenger from England relates full measure of
Prince John's treachery...
Let John get his bellyful!
In Sherwood Forest a gallant outlaw... a some... time Knight now know as Robin Hood... hath a band of followers and doth thwart the Prince at every turn.
A robber knight, eh?
Methinks I know who tis.
Quick... to horse!
We go to England... mayhap to join this outlaw's band.
Prince John's hired soldiers levy tribute on the Priory of St. Catherine's...
Has this Prince no regard for Holy Chutch?
While... nearby... Robin Hood and his Merry Men distribute dole to needy villagers...
Three blasts...
They are of the Priory of St. Catherine's.
The Priory garden...
It is Robin Hood and his men!
Is not that the Earl of Huntingdon?
Tis Robin Hood.
Robin Hood to the poor, mayhap, but he was born
Robert, Earl of Huntingdon.
Prepare thyself. Within these holy walls there is some dear to you.
Lady Marian...
Scarce a day's journey away... a menace to their new-found happiness...
Sir Guy of Gisbourne...
Tis the Earl of Huntingdon with Lady Marian.
Each day do loyal men rally to our cause.
Twill not be long ere we storm the very castle itself.
An hundred troopers approach!
To horse! I'll follow.
When the lark sings in the morn,
I'll send you a message to re-speak my love.
...Robin Hood is the
Earl of Huntingdon!
Lady Marian Fitzwalter lives...
Surround this band of outlaws with all your men.
By hook or crook take
Huntingdon alive.
Seize that wench, Drag her here. She shall die the death promised.
When the lark sings in the morn...
To Lady Marian.
Tell her that when the sun drops... o'er Nottingham hill,
I'll come to her.
His lady and his King...
All the troops from
Nottingham Town surround the forest.
Tis a good time to take the town.
To the trees with all our men. Entrap these troops.
I go to Nottingham with Scarlett and Allan-a-Dale. We three shall take the town.
While in the forest Robin
Hood's men entrap the troops...
Near the gates of
Nottingham Town...
Rouse the townspeople!
Man the walls! Every mother's son of you!
To the postern door!
To the postern door!
The Prince's soldiers...
Lady Marian... brutally abducted... the saints protect her... fly to your master.
Richard is dead!
Long live King John!
Heralds to the north!
To the south! England is mine!
A mysterious stranger invades Sherwood Forest...
He seeks Robin Hood.
Why seek you
Robin Hood?
He says' Mayhap to join him... mayhap to slay him.
So ho, my pretty knight!
To do either you needs must prove your mettle first!
I will beat them.
With such strength... thou almost makst me think thou art Richard himself.
Each member of this band hath an arrow in yon tree. Speed yours!
Exulting in their freedom, then people of Nottingham
Town hang Prince John in effigy...
Well take life if sorely pressed
Jill Richard reign once more.
Soldiers have carried her away to the castle.
Damn their black hides! I'll lash them till they bleat!
Keep the town!
I go to the castle. You to the Forest. Fetch every man.
We'll make John sing a pretty song to-night!
Close the drawbridge!
Gisbourne...
My men are on their way.
Watch for them.
If they fail...
Three blasts...
I surrender.
Robin Hood is taken.
Forty archers make ready.
We shall teach you which way to face!
Bind him to yon post.
When I dip my dagger, he dies.
We have captured the outlaws.
Lower the bridge.
The High sheriff of Nottingham...
Prince John's chief henchmen...
And Richard reigns ance more.
Huntingdon!
Huntingdon!
HUNTINGDON!
Hear ye all!
Until now Richard has never bowed his head to man.
But I did mistrust my friend and with all humility do ask forgiveness.
To-night!
That night...
In the courtyard...
The bride and the groom escape the wedding revels...
Huntingdon!
The End
# I'll lay the dish here
Ooh, là là là là
# To hold the fish here
Ooh, là là là là
# The serviettes here and now the cigarettes here #
# And matches too
They mustn't complain #
# A little candy
Ooh, là là là là

- 
She's terribly jealous.
Oh!
Voilà!
- Mon mari!
- Her husband!
Oh.
Paulette!
Paulette! Ma Paulette!
Paulette!

S'il vous plaît.
Voilà.

Count Renard, this scandal will be your last.
At any rate, your last in Paris.
As the ambassador of Sylvania...
I cannot any longer permit our military attaché... to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless escapades.
Your Excellency, please -
But that is an end.
You will leave at once for Sylvania and report to Her Majesty the queen in person.
But, Your Excellency, I'm sure the stories you've heard about me are horribly- are horribly exaggerated.
Count Renard... for one week, I made it my business to follow you about personally.
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know it,
Your Excellency.
I would have taken you to some real places.
How dare you.
I know more about you than you think.
My wife has told me everything.
You are to take the first train.
I think I had better take the first airplane.
You are going by plane, monsieur?
Yes, Jacques.
And I've got to leave you.
You're not going to take me with you?
- I'm sorry.
- But what will you do without me?
Think how good I am at making up excuses for you.
Why, I can even imitate your voice on the telephone... and pretend you're at home to one lady... when you're really having supper with another.
Yes, Jacques.
You're a very good servant.
And you can tell lies better than anybody I know.
But I won't need you anymore.
In fact, I will probably be sent to a military prison.
But even so, you'll need me, monsieur.
Supposing someone you don't want to see calls at the prison.
Who's going to tell them you're not at home?
I can't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful Paris.
But, monsieur, I am a Frenchman.
And to be a Frenchman in Paris is nothing... because everyone in Paris is a Frenchman.
- That's true.
- But to be a Frenchman in -
- What is the name of your country?
- Sylvania.
That is different.
Why, even my stories will be new there.
I can actually tell them the one about the Frenchman and the farmer's daughter.
Oh, please, monsieur, take me to Pennsylvania.
- Sylvania.
- Take me to Sylvania.
All right, Jacques. I'll take you there.
Go and pack the bags.
Oh, thank you. Thank you, monsieur.
I am so happy.

I am not.
# You'll never miss me when I'm gone
Paris #
# But I know that I'll miss you #
# You took a lot of pains in teaching me #
# Why must we say adieu #
# I've seen your mild days #
# And some of your wild days #
# Down where the Seine flows #
# And where the champagne flows
# You taught me all that a kiss could be #
# Paris, your judgment was good enough for me #
# With you each night meant the thrill of excitement #
Montmartre and ladies
# That love to raise Hades #
# If I've been happy then you're to blame #
# Oh, Paris please stay the same #
# I've seen your blonde girls #
# With beautiful blonde curis #
# Sweet Paris daughters #
# In all of your quarters #
# They taught me all that a kiss could be #
# Paris, your ladies were good enough for me #
I've met brunettes here
# And little grisettes here #
# I've lost my station and my reputation #
# If I've been happy then you're to blame #
# Oh, ladies, please stay the same #
# I'm like my master
Now I'm leaving you #
# He's sad
So am I, Paris #
I try to follow in his footsteps too
# A few may remember me #
# I've seen your mild maids #
# I've see your wild maids #
# Both shy and sporty #
# Tried all under 40 #
# They taught me all that a kiss could be #
# Paris, your servants were good enough for me #
# If I've been happy then you're to blame #
# Oh, Paris please, stay the same ##
Ladies and gentlemen, on your right you see the Royal Opera House.
And on my left, the residence of
Her Majesty, Queen Louise I of Sylvania.
The construction of the castle was begun under Maximilian I in 1537...
and finished in 1687 under Maximilian VIII.
The castle contains one of the most beautiful picture galleries in the world... and its collection of art treasures is unsurpassed.
The castle represents a value of $110 million.
$110 million?
-
- 
Company...
- halt!
- 
You call that a goose step?
Why, that isn't a chicken step!
- You blackguards!
- Lieutenant!
Don't you realize Her Majesty is still asleep?
Quiet here! Take them away.
- Yes, sir.
- Shh!
Yes, sir.
Company... left... face!
Forward- on tiptoes- march!


Good morning, Your Majesty.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I'm so hopeful Your Majesty rested well.
Why am I always awakened from my dreams?
I'm sure it was a nice dream,
Your Majesty.
Oh, it was wonderful.
It was gorgeous.
Mmm. Oh.
Mmm.
I hope Your Majesty's dream comes true.
No.
I'm afraid it will always have to remain... a dream.
# There's a land of charm that I know #
# Land of sweet romance where I love to go #
# And its bounds touch my room #
# In the gloom where the shadows creep #
# Someone I meet there waits for me #
# Someone tender as a lover should be #
# And I whisper each night #
# As I close my eyes #
# In sleep #
# Dream lover #
# Fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# I'm held #
# In your spell #
# Knowing so well #
# Dreams never tell #
# We two can leave the world behind us #
# Nobody indiscreet can find us #
# Oh, dream lover mine #
# Secrets divine #
# I will share them #
# With you #
# Dream lover fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# Oh, my darling
I am just longing for a love of my own #
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us #
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us, I know #
# Dream lover #
# Secrets divine #
# I will share them #
# With you ##
Please, Your Majesty.
Won't you tell us more about your dream?
I'm afraid I can't.
It wasn't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen.
Was it the sort of dream for a lady-in-waiting?
I hope not.
I had a lovely dream myself- about Your Majesty.
I dreamed that Your Majesty got married.
And you call that a lovely dream?
Why not, Your Majesty?
We all wish, we all hope, we all pray...
- that very soon Your Majesty will be -
- Married.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Marriage. Marriage.
In all my country, nothing else is ever spoken of.
What do the children learn at school?
"The queen is unmarried still."
What do the papers write about?
"Is the queen to marry?"
What does my Parliament debate?
"When shall the queen marry?"
And from my ministers:
"Whom shall the queen marry?"
Marriage. Marriage.
That's all I hear, morning or night.
Didn't I tell that conductor never to play the "Wedding March" again?
But, Your Majesty, it is not the same conductor.
- This is a new one.
- Where's the old one?
He is being married today.
Oh.
Oh.
Phew!

-
- 
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
Well?
Whom can you suggest today?
For what, Your Majesty?
For my husband.
Now don't tell me you weren't talking about it.
You're always talking about it.
We have no one to suggest,
Your Majesty.
We have given the matter up.
- Really?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Oh, what a relief.
Oh, how glad I am.
And, uh... why have you given the matter up, may I ask?
Well, uh -
- You see, it's rather difficult.
- Very difficult.
Difficult?
You tell me it's difficult to find a husband for me?

Yes, Your Majesty.
Excuse me, Baron.
How does Her Majesty feel today?
And that's final, Admiral.
I certainly don't need any help from the navy.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But surely Your Majesty must realize that the field for selection is limited.
If marrying you were to make a man a king... that would be different.
But Your Majesty's husband would be simply prince consort.
After all, what is a prince consort?
He is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights.
- He has nothing to say, nothing to do.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
Of course, he has something to do, naturally.
And yet, uh, he has nothing to do, if you see what I mean.
I see.
He is Your Majesty's husband and nothing else.
Nothing else?
- But isn't it enough to be my husband?
- But, Your Majesty-
It never seems to occur to you gentlemen that there might possibly be some men... who would enjoy being my husband even if I were not a queen.
My face isn't actually painful to look at.
My complexion's quite good.
And in case you're too serious-minded to notice such things... let me inform you... my legs are perfect.
There's only one other leg like that in the whole of Sylvania.
And that's it.
Do you see?
Thank you.
I didn't see, Your Majesty.
How do you think I should behave?
Should I be humble, proud, apologetic?
Say as little as possible.
I don't think your French accent will please Her Majesty.
Is it still very notice-able?
No. It's very noticeable.

Oh. But that's terrible.
No. It's terrible.
How did you acquire this accent?
I'll tell you.
Once, in Paris,
I had an awful cold.
I went to see a great French doctor to cure it.
I rang the bell.
The door was opened by a lady.
- Mm-hmm.
- A beautiful lady.
Mm-hmm.
The doctor's wife.
And in less than a month...
I had lost my cold... but I had a terrific French accent.
 And if I'm talked to like this again,
I'll dissolve the cabinet.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I'll dismiss the whole general staff.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- And if that band...
plays the "Wedding March"once more...
- I'll give orders to shoot!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm sorry, Count.
You're next.
- What do you want?
- Count Alfred Renard...
Your Majesty's military attaché at Your Majesty's embassy in Paris.
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty.
- You'll have to wait.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What do you want?
- Count Alfred Renard...
Your Majesty's military attaché at Your Majesty's embassy in Paris.
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty.
- Didn't I tell you to wait?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Then wait.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Count.
Count Alfred, I understand you've been seriously involved... in a disgraceful affair with a woman.
No, Your Majesty.
With several.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I don't think it's funny.
I think it's serious.
Very serious.
- And I shall have to punish you.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- I shall have to punish you very severely.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Otherwise you'd start all over again.
Yes!
I shall think of a punishment that will cure you forever.
An awful punishment.
Let me see.
An awful punishment.
You shall be ordered... to grow a beard.
- A beard, Your Majesty?
- Yes.
That will stop all your philandering.
You'll have to be serious in a beard.
And am I to be permitted to attend
Your Majesty after the beard is grown?
Certainly. I shall want to see that my instructions have been obeyed.
Then I fear Your Majesty will regret the order.
I look terrible in a beard.
- Really?
- Oh, dreadful.
Of course, there are men who look fine in beards, like sheiks.
- Well, yes. That's what I thought.
- But I don't.
- No?
- Oh!
Oh, I grew one once to see.
Ah, it came out all red and scraggly.
Oh, no. No, I assure Your Majesty... it would be the most awful-looking beard in Sylvania.
And -
That's saying a great deal.
- Well, then don't grow it.
- No, Your Majesty.
- Don't do it.
- No, no, Your Majesty.
- No beard.
- No, no, Your Majesty.
- You promise me.
- My word of honor.
But what can I do with you?
I've got to punish you.
May I make a suggestion?
You want to suggest a punishment for yourself?
Yes.
Of course.
Please.
Well, tell me.
If I were in Your Majesty's place...
I would say this:
"Count Alfred...
"the sort of life you've been leading must stop.
You shall not return to Paris."
Very good.
Then I would say:
- "Alfred" -
- Hmm?
"Count Alfred, you shall stay here...
"in the palace...
"attached to me.
And from morning till night, never dare to leave my side."
And you call that a punishment?
You're the most impudent man I've ever met.
You seem to forget you're talking to your queen.
Count Alfred will dine with me tonight.
At 8:00?
Yes, Your Majesty.
White uniform.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You understand?
Oh, yes, I understand.
# With such a bad report of you
I wonder what I ought to do with you #
# You really can't be too severe when my regret is so sincere #
# And true #
# If you were on probation #
# Could I depend on you #
# To make you think more kindly #
# Let me obey you blindly #
# You mean you'd really do #
# Anything to please the queen #
# Everything to please the queen #
# Morning, noon and night #
# I'm yours to command me #
# You want me good
Then I'll be good #
# You want me bad
Then I'll be bad #
# I mean, I could be both #
# If you demand me #
# Understand me #
# What if I demand your head #
# Perhaps you'd like my arms instead #
# I've lost my head the moment I saw you smile #
# Remember you're on trial #
# Will you do as I advise #
- # Madame, you will be surprised #
- # You mean #

- # You mean #
- # Anything to please the queen #
# Anything to please the queen ##
Perhaps you didn't quite follow me, Count.
You're invited for dinner, not for tea.
I followed Your Majesty perfectly.
Hmm. Too perfectly, I'm afraid.
Remember. 8:00.
Oh, Count.
Don't forget. No beard.
Oh, no, Your Majesty.
# Anything to please the queen
Everything to please the queen #
# Morning, noon and night
I'm yours to command ##



Just a minute, monsieur.
In case some lady should telephone, am I to say you have a date with the queen?
- No lady will telephone.
- But if?
Impossible. There is no telephone.
Do you know the story of the Frenchman and the farmer's daughter?
I know it.
I am the Frenchman.
You are not.
How do you know?
I am the farmer's daughter.
Go home.
Are you talking to me or to the dog?
- Is this your animal?
- Yes.
Then take it away. Don't you see it is eating out of the same dish as the queen's dog?
Listen here. If my master's good enough to have dinner with the queen... then his dog can eat dinner with the queen's dog.
- So, that's your master.
- Yes.
- That naughty boy from Paris?
- Yes.
Do you know why the queen has invited him for dinner?
Because the king's away.
There is no king.
- She hasn't got a husband?
- No.
Oh. Now I know why she invited him.
But, gentlemen, even if she liked him, would he be eligible to become the prince consort?
Why, absolutely. His great grandfather was the illegitimate son of one king... and his grandmother the sweetheart of another.
Oh.
I had no idea that he came from such a distinguished family.
And do you think Her Majesty is serious?
Why, how can you doubt it?
The first time she sees him, she invites him to dine with her alone.
- And if it goes on at this rate -
- Then we're entitled to the highest hopes.
Shh! They're coming.
They sit down.
They are seated.
She smiles at him.
He smiles at her.
They both smile... at each other!
At each other?
- She is laughing.
- That's the way they always start.
And how she laughs.
He must have told her the story of the Frenchman and the farmer-
The lackey is bringing in champagne.
Now they are clinking glasses.
She drinks his health.
He drinks hers.
He tells her, " This is the most beautiful moment of my life."
How do you know that he does?
You can't hear anything.
What else could he say?
They've opened the window.
What does it mean?
- The queen is warm.
- The champagne.
No. It's him.
She's going to her boudoir.
She opens the door.
- She enters the boudoir.
- Heavens!
She beckons to him.
He enters.
She closes the door behind them!
Heaven save the queen!
You know, Count... this is the first time
I've ever dined with a man alone.
And this is the first time
I have ever-
Don't lie.
The first time I ever dined with a queen.
But with women?
Of course.
Of course I have dined with women.
These dinners in Paris... were charming?
Yes.
The food in Paris is very, very good.
And the ladies?
Oh -
Well, I feel, by comparison... it must be very dull... dining with a queen.
It would be the most delightful experience of my life...
dining with a queen, if-
- lf?
- If one... could forget -
That I am a queen.
Yes.
Very well. Forget it.
I am no longer
Queen Louise I of Sylvania... but a woman.
A mere woman.
And you're meeting me for the first time.
What would you do?
Oh.
What would you do?
Hello, Louise.
All this the first time you meet?
Yes.
Oh.
Oh, but if it's like this at first... what can be left for later?
Plenty.
If she appeals to you... and if you find out that you love her... oh, there's plenty left...
- if she were like -
- Like?
If she were like -

Stop. Stop that whistling.
- It's unlucky.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
And don't call me Your Majesty.
I'm not a king.
Oh, but you'll be a sensation.
Everyone will applaud when you enter the throne room.
Nonsense.
I feel sure you'll run away with the wedding.
Now, how do I look?
I don't like that medal.
What's the matter with it?
The man looks cross-eyed.
Cross-eyed?
King Stanislaus XXll cross-eyed?
Oh, no. No. That can't be.
That was never taught at school.
Still looks cross-eyed.
Maybe - Maybe it's a silly superstition... but each time I have seen a cross-eyed man...
I've had bad luck.
To me, it's even worse than whistling.

Come in.
Her Majesty is ready.
Just a minute, sir.
It's all right.
-
- 

Long live
Her Royal
Majesty
The queen
Long
May she reign
Serene
Proudly
We serve her
Here at her command
Queen
Of our hearts
And Sylvania
Our land



By personal order extraordinary...
Your Majesty has bestowed upon Count Alfred the title of prince... and by this merciful act has uplifted him to a station... where marriage between you is possible.
Is it still Your Majesty's wish... to select Prince Alfred as Your Majesty's husband?
It is.
Is Your Majesty willing to be a loving wife to the prince consort?
I am.
And will Your Majesty protect him from all danger?
I will.
And you, Prince Alfred... you abide by Her Majesty's selection... and are happy to accept the station of prince consort?
Yes.
You promise always to love Her Majesty?
Yes, I do.
You promise further to fulfill Her Majesty's every wish...
to execute Her Majesty's every command...
and to be an obedient and docile husband?
- He hesitates.
- Incredible.
- He hesitates at promising to obey.
- And to be docile.
He should've thought of that before.
Yes, I do.

I pronounce you wife... and man.
What does he say?
He says,
"Man is man, and woman is woman.
And that to change that causes trouble."
He does not see how any man could stand being a wife.
And therefore he hopes this will be a most unhappy marriage.
For heaven's sake.
If he reports this to Afghanistan -
Tell him this is a love match... and will be the happiest marriage in the world.
No tschungu.
No tschungu.
No tschungu.
Halt. Left face.

Have that firing stopped.
- Your Highness, that is impossible.
- Stopped at once.
I can't. It's etiquette.
Etiquette or no etiquette -
Can't you understand?
- Perfectly, sir.
- Ah.
But I can't help it.
- I command it.
- Very sorry.
I can take orders only from Her Majesty the queen herself.
So. We shall see.

Alfred?


Do you hear those cannons?
Yes. Isn't it glorious?
Our bridal music.


How many-
How many more shots will there be?
What?
And each time they fire, you shall kiss me.

I wish now I'd ordered 500.



That was the last.
- Too bad.
- Thank heaven.
I wish we could have a cannon when we get married.
Let's get married too.
Make it a double wedding.

Jacques.
Jacquesy!
- Lulu. You're cross -
- I'm not cross.
I'm thrilled!
Eh, don't get thrilled.
Perhaps we'd better wait with our marriage and see how they get on first.
But there's no chance of their marriage going wrong.
Why, it even started wrong.
What does that lady think she's marrying - a trained poodle?
She is not a lady.
She is a queen.
Well, he's not a king.
He's a gentleman.
But when royalty marry, they don't quarrel like common people do.
They can't afford to.
That's just the trouble.
They can't let off steam with a good old row like you or I.
That's true.
But we common people can take life easy.
We can act natural, and nobody will care.
We can eat chicken with our fingers.
Look at the names I can call you.
Look at the things I can throw at you.
Oh, it's wonderful being common.
# Snuggle near, baby dear #
# Why so haughty and severe #
# Let's get together and cuddle up right here #
# Bear in mind I'm refined #
# And I'm not that way inclined #
# Where's your proper pride #
# Why be so dignified #
# Squeeze me once
Squeeze me twice #
# S'most improper but, oh, it's nice #
# Let's be common #
# And do it again #
# Hug me do close to you #
# S'a beautiful feeling and thrills me through #
# Let's be common and do it again #
# I'll surely smother #
# Oh, let me go, sir
This isn't right #
# Oh, darling Mother #
# If you could see your daughter tonight #
# Grip my neck, grab my hand #
# S'most improper but, oh, it's grand #
# Let's be common #
# And do it again #
S'a lovely moon
S'a lovely night
# What's the matter with you
You're so polite #
# So let's be common #
# And do it again #
# You crush me
I'll crush you #
# S'possible we'll be black-and-blue #
# Let's be common #
# And do it again #
# Can't you be gentle #
# You'll bruise me till I'm ultramarine #
# Be sentimental #
# But don't act like a threshing machine #
# So let's be rough
You know how #
# S'no use struggling
Too late now #
# So let's be common #
# And do it again ##


Don't do it again!
Ladies and gentlemen... four weeks ago today, our illustrious queen was married.
The desire of her subjects to celebrate this date... is readily understood.
But in consideration of the royal honeymoon...
I must ask the public to refrain just a little longer... from any serenades, torchlight processions... or public demonstrations of any kind and, in particular... to patriotically observe quiet within the limits of the castle... especially in the early morning hours.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
And don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, this program comes to you... by courtesy of the Sylvania Hardware Corporation... the company that gives you two pots for the price of one.


Louise.
Louise.

Why, you're up, dear?
Yes. I'm surprised myself.
I might as well lie in bed all day.
I have nothing to get up for.
Well, what a charming reception.
I spend all morning reviewing the household guards, distributing medals... and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister...
I steal away to have a look at my husband, and-and -
He doesn't even say good morning to me.
Good morning.
Well, that finishes my morning's work.
What can I do now?
I have already shaved.
I had my hair cut yesterday.
There's nothing left.
So, you're bored.
All I'm waiting for now is to have you tell me I'm neglecting you.
Do you realize that not once since we've been married... have I left you alone at night?
And I never will.
Thank you.
It's very kind of you.
And after this foreign loan is arranged...
I'm going to take you to Vienna... and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms.
That's it. You think all you have to do is to buy me a few new uniforms... and I'll be satisfied.
That's the opinion you have of me, is it?
Oh, don't be silly, Alfred.
Oh, I'm sick of being treated as if I were a sort of plaything.
- You're in a horrible mood today.
- Am I?
- You have a cold?
- No.
Why do you cough?
Listen, Louise. You have the power to exclude me from all military affairs... from all cabinet meetings.
But, please, do not interfere with my coughing.
I cough when I want to.
At last, I've found something to do.
I will repair this today.
Yes. Immediately after-
I almost forgot something very important.
Alfred, where are you going?
Something very important.
I am going to have breakfast.
Where is my breakfast?
May I remind Your Highness... that Her Majesty the queen has not as yet appeared.
- Well. And?
- Well, I'm sure Your Highness knows... that breakfast cannot be served before the appearance of Her Majesty.
I want my breakfast.
Your Highness, I am very sorry.
- We must wait.
- I can't wait.
I want my breakfast.
I'm hungry.
Your Highness, I regret it, but it's impossible to -
Her Majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning.
Breakfast for His Highness.
Please, Your Highness.
- Do you speak French?
- No, Your Highness.
You're the only one in the palace who looks up to me.
#Just look at me #
# I think my heart will break #
# Nobody seems to take me seriously #
# Honestly #
# I'm just as lonely as a man can be #
# The days mean nothing at all #
# And when the shadows fall #
# The moon is only wasting time on me #
# Candidly #
# There must be something awful wrong #
# With me #
# I have a pair of hands #
# To hug and hold #
# But nobody's using them now #
# I've loads of love #
# That could be told #
# But nobody's using them now #
# I've a world of time #
# That's all my own #
# They say that you go silly if you spend it alone #
# I'm telling the truth
I'm just wasting my youth #
# 'Cause nobody's using it now
No, no, no, no #
# Nobody's using it now #
# There's a bridal suite #
# In gold and blue #
# But nobody's using it now #
# I've learned to wear pajamas too #
# What's the use of wearing them now #
# I've sown wild oats #
# I have indeed #
# But now that I've stopped sowing them
I'm going to seed #
# For years and for years
I've had great ideas #
# But nobody's using them now
No, no, no, no #
# Nobody's using them now #
# I have a big settee with patent springs #
# I've some pleasing ways and - other things #
# I'm a family man who's out of sorts #
# I'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts #
# I blush to admit
I've still plenty of"it" #
# But nobody's using it now
No, no, no, no #
# Nobody's using it now
Zum, zum ##


...try to see the prince.
Isn't there standing room?
Oh, but I must see the prince.

Oh? Oh.
Oh, is that so?
Mm-hmm. All right.
The moment it was announced that Your Majesty... would attend the opening of the opera in person... the place was completely sold out.
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country.
- Yes, indeed, Your Majesty.
Have the spotlights been focused on the entrance to the opera house?
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
Twelve motion picture cameras will photograph the arrival... of Your Majesty and the prince consort.
The crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm... that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police.
And has all this been well rehearsed?
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
The crowd is the same one that we used at Your Majesty's wedding.
They all know their parts perfectly.
Good. Go on.
When Your Majesty and the prince consort appear in the royal box... the whole audience will rise.
For two minutes, we will have silent homage.
Your Majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles.
You are both in the best of humor.
- In the best of humor?
- Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
And does the prince consort know he's to be in the best of humor?
Well -
Your Majesty, I-I -
- Well, you'd better tell him, to be safe.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty frightens us.
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing your matrimonial happiness to the public.
- And if the prince consort does not smile in joy- - It will mean disaster.
The diplomatic representatives of the whole world will be guests in the royal box.
And unfortunately, the Afghan ambassador too.
And if he sees any coolness between you, he'll report it to Afghanistan.
Well, let him.
But surely Your Majesty knows that if Afghanistan hears anything...
Baluchistan hears it too.
And if Baluchistan hears it, then all Persia will know it.
And what is talked of in Persia spreads all over Turkey.
And when anything is known in Turkey, the Armenians get onto it immediately.
And you know how many Armenians go to America.
So if Wall Street hears of a rift in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty... it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan.
- And without that loan, we are broke.
- Broke!

So, unless I have a smile on my face tonight, we are broke.
- Yes, Your Highness.
- And you call yourselves statesmen.
Borrowing money is all that you're able to do.
Prince Alfred, what are you permitting yourself?
I permit myself to make the following suggestion.
We do not need a loan.
We have enough natural resources.
There is my plan for the national budget.
I have worked out everything - in my sleepless days.
The country can be saved without a loan.
Go on.
Read it.
It includes everything.
Even your dressmakers' bills.
I am not permitted to receive suggestions in the affairs of state... from the prince consort.
Not even when they are good?
Not even then.
- Do you speak French?
- Yes, Your Highness.
Too bad.
Prince Alfred, I must ask you once and for all... not to interfere in affairs of state.
I know.
I'm Your Majesty's husband and nothing else.
Prince Alfred, you may leave the room.
Stay, gentlemen.
Prince Alfred, you will meet me here at 7:00... in full gala uniform - all medals and decorations - and in the very best of humor.
And in case I don't feel like complying with Your Majesty's wish?
This is not my wish.
It is my command.
If Your Majesty had not already commanded me to smile...
I would laugh.


# When they went riding yesterday they never spoke a word #
- # You don't say #
- # Is it true #
- # Think of that #
- # Who's to blame #

- Something's wrong

- Are you sure
- What a shame

You can tell him my patience is exhausted.
If he won't come here voluntarily,
I'll have him brought here... even if I have to send soldiers.
Yes, Your Majesty.

His Highness, the prince consort.

Why are you dressed like this?
What does it mean?
It means I'm dressed for traveling.
I'm going to Paris.
You go change at once.
You're going to the opera with me.
Only with soldiers and handcuffed.
Alfred, you know very well how much depends on this - my name, my position, my reputation as queen.
If you fail me tonight, all will be over between us.
It is already over- and forever.
- Alfred.
- You have gone too far, madame.
You thought you could order the former military attaché around and command the husband.
But you forgot one thing, madame - that first, I am a man.
- I know that, Alfred.
- No, you do not.
But I'm going to prove it to you.
Good-bye, madame.
- You mean you're really going?
- Yes.
Oh, but, Alfred, won't you love me anymore?
Only with soldiers and handcuffed.

Alfred!
Alfred!

As for myself, you needn't have come at all.
All right, good-bye.
Stay here.
Beg me to stay.
I ask you to stay.
Don't ask me. Beg me.
I beg you to stay.
Not commanding.
Begging.
Begging.
I beg you to stay.
Since you beg me so lovingly...
I'll be generous.
I'll stay.
You want to humiliate me.
That's why you came here.
No. I came because -
Why?
Because, after all...
I didn't want to ruin the woman
I once loved.
But tomorrow, I'm leaving for Paris.
And as soon as this loan of yours is signed...
I will file papers for divorce.
If you don't treat me nicely,
I'll go right home.
All right. Go on.
Still here?

If you don't take those glasses from your eyes,
I'll tear them away.
Go on.
You can't do it, eh?
You're a queen.
You must behave.
If you were just a mere woman, you could make a scandal.
But you can't.
That's what you get for being a queen.
Huh?
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh!
He'll never get these glasses back.

Applaud.
Smile.
Oh! We are in the very best of humor, eh?


I blush to admit
I've still plenty of"it"
But somebody will use it now
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Somebody will use it now
She is in her room, and he is in his.
Yes. Sad, isn't it?
When we get married, let's be common... and only have one room between us.
Why even one room between us?


Who is it?
Louise.
What do you want?
A mouse is in my room.
Call your soldiers.

What are you doing?
Packing.
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.

Please.

The key, please.
So, you're trying to use force again, madame?

Where shall we live in Paris?
- We?
- Yes.
I'm going with you.
Wherever you go,
I'll follow you.
You can't get rid of me.
Well, there is no use for me to leave then.
No. No use at all.
I suppose I might as well stay here.
I suppose so too.
But how am I going to punish you?
- And you must be punished.
- Yes.
- And severely.
- Yes.
But how?
Let me see.
An awful punishment.
Let me see.
It's really not so easy.

May I- May I make a suggestion?
Yes.
Sit down.
If I were in your place, I'd say:
"Louise, I don't want a divorce.
- I love you too much for that."
- No, no, no, no, no.
But I'd say: " Louise...
"you can't order me around any longer.
" From now on,
I shall take command -
"not only of the affairs of state...
"not only in the Department of the Navy... but also here at home."
And my first command would be...
"Louise, don't dare to leave this room.
"You shall stay here...
"at my side... attached to me from morning till, uh" -
"from night till morning."
And you call that a punishment?
Yes... my king.

Be careful, Sterling don't let those Javanese sell you any jungles for tea plantations.
Phyllis, will you tell Mother!
Tell Mother!
I'll write!
Isn't this romantic? 
It's going to be our second honeymoon!
Come and have a last look at San Francisco.
I live in the center of the largest tea district in Java.
Since you are dealing in tea, 
Mr. Sterling, why not make my home your headquarters?
Any big game in Java?
I've always had a secret ambition to shoot a tiger.
If you will honor my house with a visit, I shall be happy to arrange a tiger hunt.
That would be great. I'll tell Mrs. Sterling.
Oh, you are married?
I'd like you to meet my wife.
Dear, I want you to meet Prince de Gace.
I'm sorry, but this is very important. I'll be right back.
Will you have some thing to drink?
I never drink.
Will you dance?
I never dance.
Don't you like dancing?
My wife loves to dance, too.
Your country has always interested me, with its worship of the great
God business.
The East is a country of the senses warm, mysterious, like the kiss of a lover.
You are like the orchids of your country, you have the same cold enchantment.
In Java the orchids grow wild and their perfume fills the air.
And the women of Java do they grow wild, too?
Not wild, but natural. They do not pretend to be cold
The heat, the everlasting heat strips everyone of all pretense.
It would be fascinating to learn whether your coldness is only a pretense.
I am furious!
The steward just told me my hunting outfit is not on board!
Don't worry, Mr. Sterling.
I can supply you with hunting equipment.
I am afraid of your Prince
This gun business gets my goat!
John, didn't you notice anything strange in the 
Prince's attitude toward me?
There's something strange about all foreigners!
He said. I was like an orchid...
He said: Java strips women of all pretense
And then,he took me in his arms and kissed me.
I had a terrible nightmare!
-JAVA-
A land of magic beauty, cursed with heat relentless heat
But you were just saying you wanted a nice, cold drink!
I won't accept anything from him!"
He's a fine chap, what's the matter with him?
I just don't like him!
And I begged you not to accept his invitation!
Don't be unreasonable, Lillie!
Why don't you like him?"
You know I've always wanted to shoot a tiger."
It's the heat.
It's just the heat, dear.
He says your beauty is more dazzling than the sun.
Reminds me of the Army!
Your room.
Your personal maids!
A little arrangement for lowering the temperature
Good Lord, a double-bed!
Now, Mr. Sterling i will show you your room.
Your personal maids.
Pardon, Madame.
Dinner is at eight."
What a fascinating costume!
I trust Madame has enjoyed the evening.
What in Heaven's name have you got on?
You look silly, dear take off that junk and go to bed.
Great eastern company about to bid tea propertiers you are interested
I advise close deals immediately
I've got to cover six plantations it's no trip for you!
Why can't you stay here, like a sensible woman?
Because I want to be with you.
The Prince is going with us.
I think Mrs. Sterling would enjoy it more if the top were down.
You would have the top down!
Now I suppose you'll catch cold!
Top up now, sir.
We'll have to wait for Mrs. Sterling.
You can't travel in that condition.
You'll have to stay here and we'll come back for you.
But, dear, I don't want to stay here alone.
I just told him if anything happened to Mrs. Sterling, 
I would cut his throat.
Your husband thought you would be safer if 
I remained with you.
Why have you shut yourself away from me all day?
You were afraid...
...afraid of yourself!
You wanted to come out hours ago
Where is Mrs. Sterling?
Mrs. Sterling went to her room after supper.
I thought you were never coming back!
Why are you so excited?
I was so worried about you.
Have you lost anything?
I just wanted to say good-night.
Then there is nothing to keep us in Java any longer, is there?
I don't want to leave Java until I've killed my tiger.
The jungle...
My pipe. I must have left it in my hunting coat.
Did you find it?
I have a head-ache
I think I'll go to bed.
Did you hear that?
Did you ever try to get one at night?"
It's exciting enough by daylight, on the back of an elephant.
I am afraid, he knows...
Don't be afraid. I'll see that he knows nothing!
The tiger must be very near camp.
I just heard him again.
Let's try to get a shot at him.
This is ridiculous!
I'm going back!
It's empty!
You ... 
What right had you to do this?
What right had you to take it for granted I loved him, was faithless to you?
You are blind blind, blind!
The doctor says he'll be all right in a few days.
I hope you'll forgive me, but you see I loved you, too.
John, you blind, foolish. Darling, will you never understand you are the only man I love?
"BLONDE VENUS" 
A beautiful girl ... 
... without voice or talent ... 
... idol of the boulevard ... 
... Nana. 
Bordenave, director of the variety show, cynical and crude. 
The Countess Sabine Muffat. 
The Count Muffat, 
Chamberlain to the Empress. 
The Count of Vandeuvres, distinguished, skeptical, .. 
... the latest in a great lineage, owner of a stable of horses. 
George Hugon, nephew of the
Comte de Vandeuvres. 
Fauchery, journalist and writer. 
"Bravo, what elegance!" 
A passionate admirer. 
Hector de la Faloise 
That woman is the most chic. 
I will cover her with flowers. 
"I will congratulate Bordenave on his success. " 
"Aren't you also in the queue ... 
... of Nana's worshippers? " 
Why not? 
Our young star will be very flattered by your visit ... 
... Monsieur le Comte. 
Dear friends, let me ... 
... I present your excellency, 
Count Muffat. 
Francis, Nana's hairdresser ... 
... and her occasional banker. 
Zoe, Nana's maid ... 
... with blind faith in her mistress's future. 
Francis, hand me the comb. 
In an empty room, far from the husband,...
... under the watchful eye of the cynical Bordenave ... 
... an affair begins. 
Couldn't wait to see you ... 
... later at dinner? 
Muffat is crazy for you ... 
... and Fauchery, for his part also ... 
... wants the Countess to be free. 
Poor Muffat! 
I think this is my opportunity. 
Fauchery accompanies 
Countess Muffat home. 
Has Monsieur le Comte returned? 
Give me my overcoat and hat.
I am going out. 
The next morning, the husband's evidence of guilt... 
... are found at the threshold of his now ruined home. 
There are rumors about the  bad economic situation ...</ i> 
 ... one of the most famous Parisian theaters. </ i> 
 However, its director has resolved to put on a new work. </ i> 
Bordenave distributed the roles in the new work. 
Nana dreamed of playing the role of "The Little Duchess." 
 "The Little Duchess" </ i> 
Like Rose Mignon. 
And the role of "The Little Duchess" ... 
... all grace and elegant distinction ... 
There is a magnificant speech. 
It will be you, my little Rosa ... 
... who gives life to that role. 
And I? Do not you think that I could ... 
... interpret the role of whore? 
It is a great role that is made for me. 
I would be great. 
You may laugh, but for the elegant role ... 
... there is nobody better than me. 
Forgive me, Nana. I love you ... 
... and would do anything for you. 
I can not accept it. 
Why? 
Ah, don't be a child! 
Just because you are young. 
Money!  I spit on it. 
Ah! if only someone gave me what I want ... 
I want to have the role of the honest woman in their machine. 
What honest woman? 
"The Little Duchess." 
I know the role, listen. 
Perhaps you should accept
Bordenave's money. 
Will that be me? 
Oh, how good you are, my pet! 
It is her new lover, my dear, the count! 
If you're ready, you'll have your opportunity. 
This is an eggcup, 
Monsieur le Comte. 
How about giving Nana the role of the Duchess? 
Devil may care, but what will I tell the author! 
Who is it? 
Fauchery. 
Nana will take the role, without question. 
Is it not the case, Monsieur le Comte? 
Not Nana at any price! 
That is what I demand! 
Somewhat prematurely, 
Mignon Rose's friends ... 
... congratulated her for having gotten such a wonderful role. 
My little Rose, giving it up is such a small sacrifice. 
Modesty isn't her strong point ... 
... Nana enjoying her triumph. 
Look at that filthy whore who 
Stole my role ...! 
Oh ... that woman is most vulgar. 
Despite the financial support of 
Comte de Muffat, ... 
... Nana, who wanted to enter the world of great art, 
... merely suffered a huge failure. 
No smoking 
His latest creation was, for his friends ... 
... the burial of many hopes. 
Such a charming character! 
I present the Comte de Vandeuvres. 
Mr. George Hugon. 
Will you give me a few moments, Monsieur le Comte? 
We have had many expenses in the repair of the roof ... 
... and replacment of the upholstery. 
Everything is the product of envy, ... a conspiracy ... by those who dislike me. 
Leave the theater. 
You will be all mine. 
Cancelled 
And Nana, unable to be a great actress, became a great courtesan. 
There was an avalanche of gifts at Nana's home. 
Zoe was unable to sort all of her mistress's dresses. 
In childish love, George Hugon followed the trail of Nana, ... 
... as a pet. 
It is not my fault, is it, that these things are worthless. 
My poor Zizi! 
But if all this is not done things will break! You'll see! 
The Count of Vandeuvres 
What is your uncle doing here?
He wants me to leave you, he doesn't want me to see you again. 
I am going to tame your uncle.
And Nana, changing her attitude, adopts an angelic pose. 
This is my nephew, 
George Hugon, ... who worries me ... by his conduct. 
His presence here is all wrong. 
Do you understand what I mean? 
My uncle is violent. I cannot leave Nana alone with him. 
Come on, don't let yourself get into such a state. 
I swear to you that this child is as a brother to me. 
Is that true? 
Is madam home? 
Insolence ... 
Isn't an honorable woman always at home?
Moreover, I was with the Count of Vandeuvres, ... 
... a true gentleman. 
The two Vandeuvres horses participating in the "Grand Prix". 
The favorite. 
The unknown. 
The Jockey of Nana. 
The Jockey of Lusignan. 
Bordenave, accompanied 
Tatan Nenad ... 
... and Maria Blond ... 
Vandeuvres dreamt of separating Nana ... from her generous protector ... it would require a lot of money! 
And the gentleman was so perverted by contact with the courtesan, ... that he thought of winning such a large sum ... by no matter what method. 
Lusignan, the favorite, should not win first place ... 
Do what is necessary. 
It's Nana who must win the 
"Grand Prix". 
Maréchal, runner, bookmaker, former coachman of Vandeuvres, ... 
... nominees of the latter. 
Accept for me all bets in favor of Lusignan. 
No matter the price. 
The favorite ...! 
But it is crazy! 
Do not worry, it doesn't matter. 
In addition, I will cover you in writing. 
But, Monsieur le Comte, what will happen to Nana? 
Oh no, my dear friend, it has no chance! 
Ah, my dear SATIN, men are like beasts. 
Look, I am wearing your colors! 
Would you kindly bet for me ... 
... 2,000 Louis on Nana? 
And the innocent La Faloise, ... 
... ignorant of the arrangement between Vandeuvres and Maréchal, ... 
... chose the only bookmaker that he shouldn't have. 
You are very clever. 
Nana's bet. 
Maréchal, seeing La Faloise give the tickets to Vandeuvres, 
... did not understand what his employer was doing. 
Nana! Nana! 
Nana has won, 
I have been robbed! 
Thief! Thief! 
 I accept my responsibility ,...</ i> 
 all bets ... in favor of Lusignan ...</ i> 
 ... up to the sum of 2,000 Louis </ i>. 
The man bet against his own horse. 
He knew very well it wouldn't win. 
He stole one hundred thousand francs from me. 
He bet it on Nana instead. 
Too bad, Sir! 
Nana, the unknowing center of these disasters, ... preserves the soul source of her beauty. 
The favorites ... 
The procurer ... 
The hairdresser ... 
The Count of Vandeuvres! 
Nana, I have dishonored my name for you. 
My life is ruined, but I can start again ... 
... if you agree to marry me. 
Whatever the calamity, you don't think 
I am going to support you? 
I, too, offer you my name. 
I love you! 
And you, baby, if I twisted your nose it would give milk. 
Oh, hell!
The uncle, the nephew and their destitution. 
I have had hard times, too! 
Before going to the Tuilleries to attend the Empress, Muffat ... 
Muffat! 
Escuse me, I am speaking of Nana. 
On behalf of our old friendship, ... 
... forget that woman, ... 
... she poisons everything that she touches! 
I know, my friend. 
Georges could not decide to leave ... the room adjoining... the bathroom, where ... 
... Nana's dresses gave off the voluptuous ... 
... odor of perfume ... 
And middled aged one will enter covered with gold. 
You're covered with brocade, my friend! 
Want a bonbon? 
Be good, beg for it. 
On all fours! 
To Georges, witness to such baseness, ... was filled with envy and jealousy. 
Muffat, don't leave me alone! 
Vandeuvres resolved to finish ... 
Take this, my friends, and go. 
I need to be alone here. 
Nana, succumbs to terror ... 
She is obsessed with the bloody memory of Georges ... 
... unremovable stains. 
 ... my beloved Nana. </ i> 
Muffat's misbehavior had wearied the Countess. 
The news of the suicide of Vandeuvres spread throughout Paris. 
Bordenave, with Rose Mignon, the star of his theater, ... 
... and the whole company, goes to Nana to express ... 
... the most emphatic condolences that he can. 
Do not forget that you are an artist, your public life is not yours. 
You have to be stoic before the pain and come with us ... 
We must pretend for appearances sake ... 
Come on! 
Meanwhile, the Countess Muffat, half-hearted lover, ... 
... leaving for unhappy destinations ... 
Muffat, concerned about the fate of Nana ... 
Hello! Is anyone there? 
You dare laugh... 
... when your lady must be sick with despair? 
The mistress is out for a little fun... 
She has gone dancing. 
Enough! 
Dancing
Nana, the cancan! 
Bravo, Nana! 
What brings you here, my pet? 
Nana, things can not go on like this ... 
... You must change your life or we must be separated. 
How can you reproach me ... 
I who has your heart in my hand! 
Do not think only of pleasure! 
Pleasure! Do you think all this amuses me? 
They come to my house to fool me and cause me great pain ... 
... and then they treat me badly! 
You fighten me to death. 
Goodbye, Nana! 
Cursed pig! And to think that 
And I had to love you! 
Muffat, my beloved! 
Well, then?  Are you crying because of a man? 
I have also had many men ... 
... and diamonds and pearls. 
I was called the "Pomare Queen". 
Go search for Nana. 
And it happened, with a desperate impossibility, ... 
Muffat received a final ... stroke of misfortune ... 
Sir  ,...</ i> 
 The indignity of your conduct has dishonored us and scandalized the Tuilleries. </ i> 
 This forces me to leave today for a home much better than my own. </ i> 
 Goodbye. 
Sabine Muffat. </ I> 
Rats abandon a sinking ship. 
The old servants of Nana, after a full-scale pillage of her things... 
... she is carried by her friends to her deserted home, seriously sick. 
Bosc returns with the doctor. 
It is an incomprehensible disease, doctor, a mental breakdown ... 
... and then fever, a terrible fever! 
A few moments later. 
It is smallpox! 
Do not enter, Monsieur le Comte! 
The disease!
"IT" is that quality possessed by some... which draws all others with its magnetic force.
With "IT" you win all men if you are a woman - and all women if you are a man.
"IT" can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.

WALTHAM 
THE BIGGEST STORE 
IN THE WORLD
Leaving his department store to his son, Cyrus P. Waltham... has gone to Herrin, Illinois, for the shooting.
"A gentleman to see you, sir."
Good luck
"For a good boy - on his first work day."
"If you ever go to work, Monty,
I'll do as much for you."
"IT" by Elinor Glyn
"IT" is that peculiar attribute that some people have, which attracts the opposite sex. 
The possessor of "IT" has it unconsciously and has irresistible sexual magnetism.
Mothers spoil boys with "IT", and women never refuse them!
"Old fruit, you've got 'IT'!"
"What the devil are you doing?"
"No - too bad - but you haven't any 'IT'!"
"Run away, Monty, the keepers are coming."
"I'm to look over the store. Come along."
"Hot socks - the new boss!"
"Sweet Santa Claus, give me him!"
"Let's have a double wedding - you and him - and me and the Prince of Wales!"
"Where do you figure?
The Prince is going to be our best man!"
"I've inspected all the lady employees - and not one of them has 'IT'!"
"You went over big, dearie!"
"Just you wait - I'll take the snap out of your garters yet!"
"Look! If I ever saw 'IT', that's 'IT'!"
"Shall we gnaw a chop at the club tonight?"
"Thanks, but I have an engagement at the Ritz."
"Could I - is it asking too much - would it be possible for me to - to drive you home?"
"I'd be very glad to go with you - if you'd ride in my car."
Betty lived in that fashionable downtown suburb -
Gas-house Gables -
"Would - could - do you ever dine?"
"I'd love to -"
"- at the Ritz!"
"Shall we dress?"
"Of course - how absurd!"
"Then I'll pop around at eight?"
"Toodles is hungry."
"The doctor says I can't go back to the store for a month - and
I can't let you do any more for me."
"Don't be sill, Molly! I won't go back on a pal!"
"That pest of a landlady and her friend just left.
The baby shouldn't do this - and I shouldn't do that -"
"If this was my baby,
I'd tell 'em where to head in!"
"I'm dining out tonight
- at the Ritz!"
Every evening in America, eighteen million blondes prepare to dine with gentlemen. One of the eighteen million -
"Mother, would you approve of my being Mrs. Cyrus T. Waltham?"
"He hasn't proposed yet
- but he's going to!"
"Mademoiselle's car is without."
"A nice, quiet table - in the corner, Mr. Montgomery?"
"I don't crave this table.
When I'm in the swim,
I want to be with the goldfish!"
"I'll take the same!"
"Who is the girl with Monty?"
"I don't know - but isn't she attractive?"
"Who's the blonde with
Mr. Waltham?"
"Adela Van Norman - they've been friends for years. Some day they'll marry and end it all."
"Of course you're reading
Elinor Glyn's latest story, 'IT'?"
"Monty was raving about it today. What is 'IT'?"
"Here's Elinor Glyn herself!
Let's ask her to tell us something about 'IT'."
"Madame Glyn, we've been talking about your latest story.
Just what is this 'IT'?"
"Self-confidence and indifference as to whether you are pleasing or not - and something in you that gives the impression that you are not at all cold. That's 'IT'!"
"If you have 'IT', you will win the girl you love."
"Cyrus, do you believe in 'IT'?"
"I certainly do!"
"I'm going to get my wish!"
"Oh, I must telephone!"
"Who is that charming girl with you?"
"This is a great pleasure."
"I'll bet you won't even recognize me, the next time we meet."
"I'll take the bet - and you can name the stakes."
In a shopgirl's day, the first thousand customers are the crabbiest.
"She always takes goods on approval - wears them around for six months - and then finds she doesn't approve!"
"- and the girl insulted me!"
"See that the garment is replaced - and send the salesgirl to my office."
"Young lady, in this store the customer is always right -"
"I'm the salesgirl!
Go on - bawl me out!"
"Well, anyway, I lose the bet for not recognizing you. What's the forfeit?"
"Oh, that wasn't a real bet.
I don't want anything -"
"Thanks, Adela, I'll be very happy to dine with you tonight."
"If you insist on paying your bet, you can take me out tonight."
"All right! Where?"
"Let's go to the beach - and do it up right!"
HOT DOGS!
Tasty and satisfying!
The best on the beach!
House of Amusements
"Hold me tight,
Mr. Waltham."
"Happy?"
"So you're one of those 
Minute Men - the minute you know a girl you think you can kiss her!"
Poverty is no disgrace -- until meddling neighbors hear of it.
"There's no use arguing!
We're going to take that baby to the Home, until you're well!"
"Get that story."
"If women like you would stay home and have babies of your own, we'd all be better off!"
"We're doing our duty.
The mother is ill - and she has no means of support."
"This is my baby!"
"I don't believe it."
"I'm the baby's mother -
I'm not sick - and I've got a job! Laugh that off!"
"Haven't I a job, Monty - at Waltham's? Tell 'em!"
"Is that the baby's father?"
"Him? He couldn't even give birth to a suspicion!"
"Who is your husband?
Have you a husband?"
"None of your business!"
"I say, Betty, this isn't really your child, is it?"
"Are you blind? Can't you see the resemblance?"
...forgive me for last night, Betty, and come to the theater with me tonight?
I promise not to make the same mistake
"I have tashted the milk of human kindnesh - an' it's a lot of Fermillac!"
"B'lieve it or not - my baby is its mother!"
The young mother fights hard for her baby, like a tigress in the sand confronting social workers.
A sharp-dressed man of the city declared that the girl had means enough and was able to keep all the obligations
"I'm the chappie - the man about town -
I'm the ample means!"
"We are investigating the case of a girl who says she's employed here -"
"- she - she - there's a baby."
"She gave the name of Betty Lou Spence."
The young mother clutched the little boy to her chest and defied all who tried to take the child.
"Thank you. You see, we had to verify her story."
"She's the one. She told me it's her baby - told me with her own lipsh!"
"Will you issue the bonus checks now, Mr. Waltham?"
"Are you mad at me because I slapped you?"
"I'm sorry - but a girl
has to do that.
You know how those things are!"
"Let's forget it.
We've got each other straight now, haven't we?"
"Yes - we have!"
"It's a star sapphire."
"It's pretty - but
I like diamonds better."
"Would you like some diamonds for yourself?"
"Betty, I'm crazy about you -"
"I love you, too."
"I'll buy you diamonds - clothes - everything you want -"
"What are you trying to do?
Offer me one of those left-hand arrangements?"
"I'm crazy about you!
Isn't that enough?"
"I suppose that's what you men call love!"
"Cancel my appointments, please. I'm leaving town for a week."
Betty was too poor to quit her job - and too proud to stay. So she quit!
Woman Offered Job
"I - I've come to forgive you."
"You don't mean you thought the baby was really mine?"
"There's its mother!
Can't you see the resemblance?"
"What a joke on Waltham -
I told him it was your baby!"
"He thought it was mine?"
"And he wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt!"
"I'll make him propose to me - and when he does, I'll laugh in his face! And you're going to help me do it!"
"But - he's going on a yachting cruise and - and I'm going with him!"
"Fine! I'll yacht with you."
"But, I say - what about your clothes?"
"That's the joke on you - you're going to buy them for me."
"Give me your word you won't tell him - anything!"
"Is Mr. Waltham aboard?"
"Not yet, sir."
"The party's off. We might as well go back."
"Oh no, sir! Mr. Waltham's expecting you - he'll be here any minute."
"Shall I show you to your cabins?"
"Something I can get for you, Mr. Montgomery?"
"No, thanks - I'm just prowling about."
"Just going for some - some - cigars."
"Everything ready, Captain?"
"Let's get under way."
"I'm not feeling so well."
"Tea, sir?"
"Feeling better, Monty?"
"I feel so low, old chap, that I could get on stilts and walk under a dachshund!"
"Shall I call Miss Van Cortland, sir? She's in her cabin."
"I say, I almost forgot about Miss Van Cortland."
"Miss Van Cortland - the - the girl I asked when you asked me to ask someone."
"Monty, who is Miss
Van Cortland?"
"You - you tell them, old thing."
"She's a very nice girl. I -
I believe Monty met her in Paris last summer."
"You idiot!
Who is this girl?"
"She's a ripping sort, really!
She's positively topheavy with 'IT'."
"Oh, Monty, am I late for tea? I'm so sorry."
"Mr. Waltham! It's been years, hasn't it?"
"Won't you have some tea?"
"Haven't I seen you some place?"
"In Paris, perhaps.
I'm there so often."
"Desirez-vous du sucre?"
"What do you mean by bringing her?"
"You know what sort she is - with her fatherless child!"
"But, I say - it isn't fatherless -"
"I won't have her on board! We'll put back to port."
"Do you think we'll have as nice a day as this all day, Captain?"
"That's the last time I'll get you out of a scrape!"
"Miss Van Cortland seems to be rather lacking in reserve, doesn't she?"
"Personally, I think she has plenty - in reserve!"
"Betty, I've something to say to you."
"Won't it wait until morning?"
"I've been thinking things over, Betty. I want to talk to you - seriously."
"Be serious - with you?
How silly!"
"I don't care what you've been - I want you to marry me!"
"I'd rather marry your office boy!"
"He asked me - and I laughed at him - and now it doesn't seem so darned funny, after all!"
"It was a ghastly joke, old man - her baby's just a moth -
I mean a myth!"
"It's her friend's baby!
And she's crying for you -
I mean Betty, not the baby -"
"But you said yourself it was her baby -"
"Take the wheel, Monty
- I'm going to find her."
"The ballast has shifted to port, sir - but there's no danger!"
"Silly of me, but I'm afraid I overdid it - made a left-hand turn and what not -"
"Take your girl friend.
I had to knock her cold - but maybe it'll do her good."
"Betty, where are you going?"
"I'm going home!"
"Monty will get you."
"Monty, I wonder if there's anything between them?"
"I'm afraid there is."
"We're just a couple of
It-less 'ITS'!"

To hopeful hundreds there is a golden spot in the map called...
HOLLYWOOD.
Golonel Pepper had motored all the way from Georgia to prove that his daughter, Peggy, was a grat actress.
It must be Hollywood.
I like this place, Peggy... even if it ain't Georgia.
It is John Gilbert!
I am General Marmaduke
Oldfish Pepper, of Georgia.
You ain't gonna blame me for that, are you?
I'd like to see the president of your company.
What about, General?
I'm going to let him put my daughter in the movies.
Casting office...
Mr. Oldfish.
I want to introduce my daughter,
Miss Peggy Pepper.
Got one a little more recent?
Got one a little more recent?
The idea is, can you act?
She will now present the various moods. The first will be meditation.
Passion.
Anger.
Sorrow.
Joy.
Very funny. Fill out this card.
There is many a slip between the casting office card and a menu card... especially when one's capital has dwindled to forty cents.
I'm Colonel Pepper of Georgia, Miss.
At first I thought you were
Gloria Swanson.
You big beezark! I gotta notion to knock yer block off
What an uncouth saint he is!
Billy Boone... a custard pie artist from the slapstick "lots". de esos de 'tartas en la cara',
As a Southern colonel your make-up is very
Indiana.
Father, who is this coarse person?
One has to come to
Hollywood to meet such common people.
Aw, boloney... and you're slicing it too thick.
Say, are you punks trying to crash into the movies?
My daughter, suh, is considering a few offers.
My acting is talk of Savannah.
My acting is the scandal of Hollywood.
Crashing the movies is no cinch... but I thing
I can help you.
What'll you have for dessert?
They've got the swellest cocoanut cake today.
Isn't he wonderful!
The Comet Studio, where serious comedians went through the daily grind though of "getting laughs".
Where's the dame you were going to bring out?
She'll be here, all right... you couldn't keep her away.
Gee, Dad... won't they be thrilled back home when they see me as a great dramatic actress?
Stage 4, Lot 5... turn to hour right as you enter the left wing and keep going.
Are you Mr. Comet?
If you don't say yes
I'll kill myself.
I'm Miss Pepper, the new actress.
Remember, Baby... you're not painting a bungalow.
You gotta fall harder... and funnier.
Can she act?
Go on, Baby... show him what they're talking about in Savannah.
Ah, my brave toreador!
In all Spain none is more skillful with the bull.
You have reduced to beggary, kidnapped my husband, and murdered my aged mother... but beware!
Don't go too far!
That's darn good hokum.
I shall always give my public best that's in me.
When I call just come in and show mid surprise, like this...
Remember, the one law of the pictures is, don't anticipate!
Now we'll rehearse it.
Is that all I do?
Until the jolt. Then just take it natural... don't anticipate!
Don't get camera-shy,
Baby, and you're a cinch.
I didn't think they made them that green!
Baby, you did that like a real trouper.
I came here to do drama.
Why didn't you tell me it was this?
Bat, Baby, all the stars have had to take it on the chin... Swanson,
Daniels, Lloyd... all of them.
Come on, Baby... you've gone this far... it'll be easy from now on.
She did that so nifty we'll take it again... in a close up.
Success in this game means work. Show them that you've got the stuff.
Just think of that first big thrill you'll get when you see yourself in a theatre.
I've backed you to win, Baby... show them I'm right.
You're great on water stuff... I'm gonna get you a lot of it.
Go ahead. I'll take it on the chin.
The preview... that trying ordeal when a new picture is tired out before
Mr. and Mrs. Audience.
Don't anticipate!
What's the matter, Baby?
Don't you know you're a wow?
That girl's got real personality.
I'll have Billy Boone bring her over tomorrow.
I can't keep it from you any longer...
I'm the director.
Come on. Let's get out front and hear what they have to say.
What do you want to see a punk drama for? Come on.
That's the kind acting
I'm gonna do some day.
That's real art!
Don't be sil. Make them laugh and you make them happy.
I tell you, Mr. Chaplin... that girl is a find.
Will you please sign my album?
I'm crazy about signatures.
Who is that little guy?
That guy is casting director for High
Arts Studio.
Bring me a nice big piece of custard pie.
Why, I'd be afraid I'd throw it at someone.
The thrill that seldom comes... a call to the
High Arts Studio!
Lew Cody and
Elinor Glyn.
She writes a lot of those IT stories.
I like Mr. Cody... he has such an open face.
Maybe Mr. Morton will only see you... and not me.
I Won't sign up unless he takes you, too.
You want Miss Pepper also, don't you?
I want Miss Pepper only.
I won't sign up unless he takes you, too,
Billy.
Oh, that's all right.
I can take it on the chin
Nothing for you now,
Billy. Maybe next year.
A contract from the "big studio" and the thought of leaving her old friends... brought to Peggy mingled emotions of gladness and sadness.
Goodbye, Jim... I'll always think kindly of you for giving me a chance.
I hate to see you go, Peggy... but I knew I'd make something of you.
I'm all through, Billy.
You mean you're just beginning.
It's going to be hard... working without you, Billy.
But we'll see a lot of each other, won't we?
Yes, but it Won't be the same.
It's all in game, Baby. I guess it's the crossroads... your path leads one way and mine another.
Then I won't go!
"You're going to be a big success, Baby... and I'm going to watch every step of your career.
At the High Arts Studio preliminary test were being made for Peggy's first drama.
That's Marion Davies.
Mr. Telfair, I want you to meet Miss Pepper, your new leading lady.
I understand you're quite popular also.
You're at the Countess De Fray's reception. Yoy look over there and see the man you hate...
Then you look over there and see the man you love.
The man you love!
The man you hate!
It is six months later. You have just received a letter that your lover is dying.
I know there's nothing written on it, but read it anyway.
Your lover is dying... suffer.
Give me tears!
Tears... please!
Would you please ask them to play "Heats and Flowers"?
Louder... and sadder!
Tears... tears... please, Miss Pepper, if you have any respect for me, give me tears!
That's no way to let a lover die!
Imagine your poor old father starving to death.
You don't know my father!
Can't you do something to bring tears?
Imagine forty thousand starving Armenians...
Now that we've got her going... no film in the camera!
Imagine you're very much in love with someone... you're at the crossroads of your lives...
Just once more... a big yelp!
That's what I call good commercial crying.
Stop crying!
Stop it, I say... we've got a big laughing scene to do!
Everybody go to lunch.
Now that you have graduated from cheap comedy, you must forget it...
You must acquire new personality... a superior manner... new friends...
I will be glad to introduce you to the elite of
Hollywood.
Confidentially, I am
Andre d'Bergerac, le
Comte d'Avignon...
And so plain Peggy Pepper acquired the manner of the "elite"... and became known as Patricia Pepoire...
My paper is SO anxious to have a true story of your past...
When I first came on a movie lot I thought a pie was...
Miss Pepoire is fatigued.
With her permission I will speak for her.
First, allow me to inform  you that
Miss Pepoire is a direct descendant of General Robert E. Lee.
This is going to make a splendid story.
Being a lady of quality, she chose the cinema as a medium of self-expression.
She has the temperament of Nazimova, the appeal of Garbo, the sweetness of Pickford, and the lure of Pola Negri!
Hold it! Hold it!
Don't move!
My being in the picture will help get it in the big magazines.
While Billy struggled on the same old way.
Let's have Peggy come over and have chow with us...
Peggy's too busy these days... I seldom get a chance to see her.
I'll bet if ask her she'll come.
Miss Pepoire won't be able to see you tonight. She has important business to them to.
We haven't seen each other for so long...
I was wondering if you'd come over and have dinner... like we used to?
I'm sorry, but I have another engagement.
You're not going out with your leading man, are you?
It's all part of work... won't you please try to understand?
Sure I understand. I'll see you some other time, eh?
No one realized Patricia
Pepoire's importance more than Peggy Pepper.
I'm terribly, terribly sorry if I kept you waiting.
Waiting is such sweet sorrow where you are concerned, dear lady.
Today we're going to do the kidnapping and rescue stuff.
Is it necessary that it be done so roughly?
...one thrust of his sword, and he takes you in his arms.
Ten thousand dollars or your life!
Another troupe on location.
Now we'll take it once more.
Better beat it... Miss
Pepoire's nerves ain't right today.
Miss Pepoire, will you please freshen your make-up?
...we're still making them, but the old troupe sure misses you.
Baby... it's a kick to see you doing so good.
Why, Peggy... surely success hasn't gone to the bean!
Of course not! Don't be absurd.
I knew you were only clowning.
Same old Peggy... anything for a laugh.
I wish you would please refrain from using slag.
Oh, for crying out loud!
Patricia, they are ready for the next scene.
Andre, this is Billy Boone...
I used to know him in the old days.
Why, Andy used to serve me spaghetti down at Tony's.
How can you be so insulting!
Gee, Baby, I'll bet you miss the laughs we used to have!
I never miss lowness, cheapness and vulgarity.
...but I suppose you'll always be the same... a cheap clown.
Would that I had the right to protect you... always.
Come on, Billy... forget the sob squad and jump off that rock.
Studio lunch... at the stars' table.
The boss wants you to come up to his office right away.
I'm having my luncheon.
He says you'll have lots of time for lunch after he gets though talking to you.
Pardon me, Doug... just another one of those boring conferences.
Read these... Miss
"Patricia Pepoire".

You're not on the level with the public that made you... and from now on I want to see the real Peggy
Pepper in the screen.
I'll give you one last chance to change... and
I want your answer now.
If you'll pardon me,
Mr. Morton, I shall finish my luncheon.
These producers are so disturbing... to one's equilibrium.
They don't appreciate what a great artist you are.
You are so understanding!
SCREEN ROMANCE
Wedding oh Patricia Pepoire and Andre d'Bergerac, le Comte d'Avignon, to be solemnized today.
The wedding promises to be one of the most outstanding social events of the season and will be attended by many screen notables.
Just think, Patricia, you'll be a real countess.
It must be wonderful to be in love!
Sorry, but I can't admit you unless you have an invitation.
I must see her right away!
You tell her I've got to see her... and I don't mean maybe.
Pardon my depravity... but that terrible comedian person is downstairs.
You don't realize what you're doing!
I do not know what I'm doing, and I won't have you interfering in my affairs.
"You've ruined your career... just when you were becoming so successful.
...and now you're going to marry a man you don't care a rap for... just for a phoney title.
I'm not pleading for myself... it's for your own happiness.
Think a minute... remember the old days.
I don't want to remember the old days.
I'm going to bring you to your senses... now!
Don't worry... everything is quite all right.
You were right! I'm all you said I was... just a clumsy fool!
Look at yourself! Look at me! We're only fakes... just clowns!
He was the only real person... and now
I've lost him!
But, Patricia... our wedding!
There will be no wedding!
Don't talk to me...
Don't touch med!...
You... you... pie-face!!!
Peggy's trip "down to earth" had brought a clearer view of things worth while.
Peggy, I hope you were right in recommending this new leading man... but can he really act?
He's marvelous, Mr.
Vidor... and we work together so well.
Don't tell him I'm in the picture. Just start the scene...
I want to surprise him.
Mr. Vidor, I want to thank you for giving me this chance.
It's up to you, Billy... and don't let enlarge your hatband.
You boys have been separated from your outfit... and make for this village...
The camera's going... you can't quit now.
Take them on the chin... it's all in the game.
The Cinders resince in Roseville... where the first bowl of wax banabas appeared on an Am;erican sideboard.
Ella Cinders, the stepdaughter slaves for the entire family.
Ella's father waw the secont husband
Ma Cinders had talked to death.
I'm sorry Mam...
You told me to clean the furnace.
Ma's first husband had been Alonzo Pill, author of "Follow the Swallow"... and Prissie Pill.
Lotta Pill... Always anxious to look her best and the best is none too good.
Hurry up and fix my breakfast.
Waite Lifter, Ella's best friend and champion.
AFTER ONE RUB

You're shiftless, lazy... like your father was til the day he died.
I was a fool to marry him!
It's a darned shame... the way they treat you.
Every second Thursday, the
Pollyanna Club met at the Cinders' home... and cheated one another at cards.

{7233}{7268}Let's see
{7389}{7463}-It's a lot|-Out with the money
{7531}{7589}The rear guard!
{7677}{7741}Where's my fortune gone?
{7816}{7845}The rear guard is coming!
{7861}{7917}Let me have the bill
{8171}{8212}Quickly, add this to the other bill
{8256}{8334}The gentleman I was with will|take care of it
{8470}{8518}The gentleman will pay
{8559}{8685}Put it at his table and give him|my respects!
{8955}{9063}Let's get lost before the old boy|catches us with his prey
{15416}{15497}You there... open up!
{15718}{15783}We're the street sweepers...
{15954}{15991}It's snowing
{16023}{16105}Hurry up! We're freezing
{16170}{16196}Coming!
{16264}{16480}'Who found pleasure in his glass'|'and love in a pair of lips?'
{17011}{17119}'There's pleasure in a glass'
{17172}{17277}' But young lips are made for love'
{17577}{17610}The milk-maids are here
{18128}{18163}Butter and cheese!
{18257}{18299}Poultry and eggs!
{18344}{18387}Which way are you going?
{18403}{18448}To Saint Michel
{18460}{18504}Shall we meet later?
{18518}{18562}At noon!
{19811}{19920}Can you tell me...|which way is the inn?
{19938}{20032}There's a painter here,|painting some inn
{20210}{20397}Good woman, would you go and fetch|the painter, Marcello
{20433}{20516}I have to talk to him urgently
{20530}{20656}Tell him Mimi is waiting for him|out here
{20771}{20805}What's in that basket?
{20890}{20933}-It's empty|-Pass!
{21394}{21442}I hoped I'd find you
{21458}{21555}We've been living here a month|at the innkeeper's expense
{21579}{21712}Musetta gives the guests|singing lessons
{21758}{21851}And I paint the soldiers|and decorate the inn's walls
{21936}{21977}It's cold
{22005}{22032}Come on in
{22098}{22170}-Is Rodolfo in?|-Yes
{22221}{22287}Then I can't go in - I can't
{22298}{22346}Why not?
{22448}{22542}Dear Marcello, help me
{22664}{22728}What's happened?
{22840}{22909}Rodolfo loves me
{22932}{23027}He loves me yet he shuns me...
{23173}{23262}He is eaten up with jealousy
{23479}{23622}A gesture, a word, a friendly kiss,|a flower...
{23633}{23717}Anything will make him suspicious
{23733}{23831}He quarrels with me,|he gets into rages
{23852}{23976}At night, I often pretend to sleep...
{24020}{24202}...and I can feel him trying to pry|even into my dreams
{24345}{24502}He keeps yelling:|You're not for me!
{24546}{24710}Get yourself another lover! You're not for me!
{24884}{24963}It's his anger speaking, I know...
{24999}{25092}But what can I say to him, Marcello?
{25111}{25304}A love like yours makes it hard|to live together
{25338}{25392}You're right, that is true...
{25435}{25515}We must separate
{25563}{25612}Will you help us?
{25623}{25757}We've tried to help ourselves,|but we cannot do it
{25766}{25952}I don't worry about Musetta,|nor does she about me
{25958}{26086}- We love in fun and laughter|- It's true
{26123}{26192}Yes, we must separate
{26198}{26302}Songs and laughter - these are|the blooms of constant passion
{26325}{26389}Do what you can for us
{26427}{26480}Very well
{26510}{26627}-I'll wake him up|-ls he asleep?
{26686}{26849}He came in about an hour before|dawn and fell asleep on a bench
{26928}{26977}Look
{27176}{27227}That cough...
{27267}{27375}It's been wearing me out|since yesterday
{27381}{27477}He fled from me last night,|saying:
{27496}{27550}It's over!
{27618}{27707}At daybreak I hurried over here|to find you
{27945}{28025}He's awake, he's getting up...
{28043}{28087}He's looking for me...
{28166}{28232}-He's coming|-He mustn't see me
{28263}{28360}Go on in, Mimi, for pity's sake
{28395}{28469}Don't make a scene!
{29193}{29291}That's it, Marcello!|No one can overhear us now
{29327}{29400}I want to part with Mimi
{29416}{29460}Are you so volatile then?
{29481}{29596}Once before, I thought that|my heart had died
{29633}{29802}But in her blue eyes it found|so much to live for
{29845}{29911}But it's all so tedious now
{29923}{29967}You wish to mourn another?
{29998}{30014}Once and for all
{30023}{30057}Change your rhymes
{30072}{30149}This gloomy love of yours...
{30165}{30232}...can lead only to tears
{30253}{30369}Without fun and laughter|love grows weak and fragile
{30433}{30516}-You're jealous|-A little
{30522}{30661}You are an angry, prejudiced,|tiresome and stubborn lunatic
{30677}{30744}Now he'll make him angry!|Poor me!
{30787}{30877}Mimi is a flirt
{30927}{30992}She toys with them all
{30998}{31112}Some Viscount dandy makes|eyes at her...
{31133}{31265}...and she lifts her skirt and shows|her ankles, full of promise
{31298}{31318}Need I say it?
{31339}{31397}You don't sound sincere
{31495}{31590}You're right, I'm not
{31712}{31800}In vain I try to hide my true misery
{31948}{32062}I love Mimi above all else
{32190}{32276}I love her but I'm so afraid
{32545}{32648}Mimi is so ill!
{32712}{32815}She declines every day
{32828}{32933}The poor girl is condemned
{32976}{33026}What does he mean?
{33103}{33234}A terrible cough shakes|her fragile chest...
{33343}{33449}...and her cheeks are already|drained and ashen
{33716}{33772}Alas, I am dying...
{33810}{33914}My room is a squalid hovel
{33937}{34011}The stove is dead
{34033}{34148}Only the north winds come in|to play there
{34354}{34487}She sings and smiles|and I'm consumed by remorse
{34513}{34654}I am the culprit leading her|to her death!
{34697}{34740}What can we do?
{34793}{34873}Oh, my life is over!
{34966}{35091}-Mimi is a hot-house bloom|-How pitiful!
{35098}{35185}-Poverty has robbed her strength|-Poor creature
{35205}{35319}My love alone cannot bring her|back to life
{35854}{35909}What? Mimi, you're here?
{35948}{36023}'-So she was listening...'|-You overheard me?
{36041}{36142}I worry so easily and|panic over nothing
{36152}{36207}-Come in to the warmth|-No, it's stifling in there
{36379}{36443}That's Musetta's flirtatious laughter!
{36489}{36542}You flirt! I'll teach you
{36645}{36685}Farewell!
{36793}{36840}You're leaving?
{37060}{37217}I came in with joy|when your love called me
{37345}{37482}Now Mimi must go back|to her lonely nest
{37705}{37826}Back to her embroidery|and her flowers
{38028}{38066}Goodbye...
{38191}{38251}And no regrets!
{38305}{38356}Listen to me!
{38428}{38583}Gather up the few things|I've left behind
{38685}{38814}There are things I locked away|in my little chest
{38830}{38996}My gold bracelet, the ribbons|and my prayer book
{39200}{39294}Wrap them up in an apron
{39411}{39533}And I'll send someone to get them
{39802}{39996}Under my pillow you'll find|my pink-coloured bonnet
{40257}{40389}Keep it, if you like,|as a memento of our love
{40759}{40814}Farewell...
{40940}{41060}Goodbye, with no regrets!
{42020}{42123}Then it really is all over?
{42191}{42273}You're leaving, my little darling?
{42392}{42492}Farewell, my dream of love
{42643}{42747}Farewell, sweet morning|awakenings!
{42920}{43042}-Goodbye, life of dreams!|-Goodbye, quarrels and jealousy
{43048}{43158}Those quarrels that your smile|soon soothed away
{43280}{43355}-Goodbye, suspicions...|-...and kisses...
{43373}{43454}...and poignant bitterness...
{43499}{43627}The bitterness which l, the poet,|rhymed with "tenderness"
{44045}{44185}-ln winter one can die of loneliness|-Loneliness is too unbearable
{44353}{44483}Whilst as spring awakens,|we have the sun!
{44726}{44811}-What were you doing with that man?|-What do you mean?
{44963}{45033}'No one is ever alone in April'
{45053}{45100}When I came in you changed colour
{45106}{45224}He asked if I like to dance...|I said I could dance all night
{45237}{45335}'The whispers of lilies and roses'
{45341}{45442}'The sweet chattering of birds'
{45475}{45569}-Deceitful excuses!|-I must have my freedom!
{45588}{45644}You won't find horns under my hat!
{45667}{45764}'When spring blooms'|'we have the sun!'
{45898}{46032}I hate lovers who behave|like husbands!
{46073}{46242}'The fountains murmur and evening'|'breezes bring balm to human anguish'
{46358}{46491}'Shall we wait for another spring?'
{46514}{46665}-Sir, I'm delighted to say goodbye|-Your servant, and I'm off
{47247}{47299}-House painter!|-Viper!
{47315}{47350}-Toad!|-Witch!
{47513}{47626}'Forever yours, for life'

{48227}{48353}'lf only the winter could last forever
{52604}{52630}In a coupe?
{52636}{52708}With livery and pair;|she smiled at me
{52735}{52854}Well, Musetta, I said,|and how is the heart?
{52863}{52954}Either it stopped beating or I can't hear it...
{52994}{53065}...covered by velvet as it is!
{53086}{53122}How very interesting
{53140}{53231}Go on, you fraud!|You suffer, yet you laugh

{53452}{53542}- l, too, met... - Musetta|- No, Mimi...
{53558}{53611}You saw her... did you now?
{53621}{53731}She went past in a carriage,|dressed like a queen
{53752}{53799}Good, I'm happy to hear it
{53808}{53844}The liar, he's in agony
{53859}{53911}-Back to work!|-To work!
{54215}{54245}Useless pen!
{54259}{54301}Useless brush!
{55051}{55225}Mimi, gone never to return,|those lovely days...
{55273}{55412}Those tiny hands,|that fragrant hair...
{55456}{55548}My brush seems to be|at her command...
{55559}{55623}That snow-white skin...
{55654}{55828}-Mimi, my brief youth|-lt paints against my will!
{55845}{56024}If I want to paint skies or land|or winter or spring...
{56076}{56232}...it still traces two dark eyes...
{56342}{56458}...and red, smiling lips
{56562}{56712}It's the face of Musetta|over and over again
{56939}{57059}-And you, gay bonnet...|-And there is Musetta's face...
{57065}{57208}-...which she left under her pillow|-...all charm and deceit

{59003}{59081}A dish worthy of Demosthenes:
{59091}{59191}-A herring! - Salted|-Dinner is served!
{59208}{59256}This is a veritable horn of plenty
{59290}{59352}Put the champagne on ice
{59447}{59525}Choose, Baron, trout or salmon?
{59572}{59649}Perhaps a parrot's tongue, Duke?
{59737}{59842}Thank you, no, it's too filling...|I'm going to a ball tonight
{60042}{60067}Finished already?
{60083}{60147}I'm late - the King expects me
{60190}{60231}Not another conspiracy!
{60470}{60548}The King has summoned me|to the Ministry

{61020}{61092}-Enough! - What a concoction!|-Away with the heel!
{61126}{61248}I feel irresistibly inspired|by a romanza
{61331}{61411}-A choreographic piece then?|-Yes!
{61571}{61658}A dance to a vocal accompaniment
{61739}{61786}Clear the floor

{63767}{63842}Fetch a cemetery
{63879}{63949}And as the duel rages,|Rigaudon whirls and dances
{64631}{64689}I've brought Mimi! She's ill
{64698}{64798}-Where is she?|-She's too weak to climb the stairs

{65581}{65617}You must rest

{65898}{66017}Do you want me here with you?
{66110}{66187}My Mimi...
{66223}{66284}Always, forever!
{66358}{66450}I heard that Mimi had left|the Viscount...
{66470}{66539}She was fading fast
{66553}{66660}But where could she be?|I searched and searched...
{66683}{66787}And just now I saw her|on the street...
{66829}{66911}She was hardly able to walk
{66962}{67083}'l cannot last', she said.|'I'm dying, I know it...
{67158}{67264}'l want to die with him!|He may be waiting for me'
{67284}{67375}I feel better already
{67437}{67485}'Come with me, Musetta', she said
{67622}{67696}I want to look around...

{68138}{68187}I feel revived...
{68504}{68617}-I can feel life returning|-Blessed lips...
{68806}{68912}-You will never leave me again...|-To hear your voice again...
{68929}{69047}We've nothing in the house!|Ah, poverty!
{69085}{69167}She won't last the hour
{69271}{69342}I'm so cold, so cold...
{69420}{69502}If only I had a muff!
{69673}{69760}Will these hands never feel|warm again?
{69991}{70081}Here, warm them in mine
{70121}{70206}Hush now!|Talking tires you
{70225}{70348}It's just a slight cough!|I'm used to it

{70750}{70863}Schaunard, Colline, good day...
{70944}{71042}Here you all are...
{71094}{71213}-You're smiling at Mimi again|-Don't speak
{71227}{71289}I'll speak softly, don't worry

{72030}{72077}And fetch a doctor
{72128}{72246}-Rest now|-You won't leave me?
{72435}{72567}This may be the last time|she'll ever express a wish...
{72587}{72652}The poor thing!
{72728}{72805}I'll buy her a muff...
{72838}{72932}I'll come with you
{73029}{73160}You're a kind soul, Musetta
{73336}{73432}Well, my old trusty cloak...
{73441}{73577}I stay, but you must climb up|the sacred mount as my pledge
{73705}{73798}Let me express my gratitude now
{73897}{74092}Never have you bent your ancient|back to the rich and powerful...
{74197}{74270}But many are the philosophers|and poets...
{74322}{74417}...who have passed through the|tranquil chambers of your pockets
{74618}{74708}Now those pleasant days are over
{74820}{74942}So I say farewell, my faithful friend
{75946}{76112}Schaunard, we can both do an act|of kindness, each in his own manner
{76266}{76323}I - with this coat
{76348}{76377}And you...
{76437}{76508}...by leaving them to themselves
{76652}{76740}Philosopher, you talk sense
{76784}{76863}It's true, I'll go
{78721}{78787}Have they all gone?
{78845}{78932}I pretended to be asleep...
{79023}{79160}Because I wanted to be alone|with you...
{79285}{79391}There are so many things to say...
{79688}{79816}Or perhaps only one thing -|as vast as the sea...
{79995}{80104}...as the deep, limitless sea
{80318}{80441}You are my love and my life!
{81114}{81202}Mimi, my lovely Mlmi...
{81330}{81424}Am I still lovely then?
{81507}{81604}As lovely as the dawn
{81648}{81734}You've used the wrong expression...
{81858}{81964}You meant to say as lovely|as the sunset
{82214}{82289}They call me Mimi...
{82741}{82839}I don't know why...
{82872}{82971}The swallow has returned|to the nest
{83247}{83277}My bonnet!
{83447}{83609}Remember the very first time|I came here?
{83615}{83664}As if I could ever forget...
{83687}{83754}My candle had gone out
{83775}{83952}You were so perturbed...|then you lost your key
{83965}{84077}And you were groping in the dark|to find it
{84086}{84157}I searched and searched...
{84180}{84324}My cunning boy...|I can tell you now
{84370}{84496}I know you found it almost at once
{84579}{84692}I was only assisting destiny
{84772}{84900}It was dark and you couldn't see|my blushes
{85100}{85212}Your tiny hand is frozen!
{85282}{85367}Please, let me warm it
{85517}{85633}It was dark and you took my hand
{86108}{86126}What is it?
{86142}{86217}It's nothing, I'm fine
{86295}{86356}Hush now, for pity's sake
{86456}{86555}Yes, forgive me...|I'll be good
{86881}{86958}-ls she asleep?|-Only resting
{86968}{87072}I saw the doctor!|He'll be here soon

{87397}{87452}It's me, Musetta
{87703}{87811}How lovely and soft it is...
{88012}{88107}No more frozen hands, now...
{88190}{88234}How warm...
{88278}{88337}It feels so good...
{88410}{88502}-Did you get it for me?|-Yes!
{88577}{88667}You... how extravagant...
{88692}{88756}Thank you!
{88780}{88859}It must have cost a lot...
{88916}{88973}Are you crying?
{88990}{89067}But I feel fine...
{89160}{89272}Why are you crying then?
{89431}{89485}My love...
{89529}{89589}...is always with you!
{89646}{89710}My hands...
{89751}{89819}...so nice and warm...
{90017}{90102}...to sleep
{90333}{90417}-What did the doctor say?|-He's coming
{90437}{90496}Blessed Madonna...
{90502}{90627}Grant your grace to this poor girl|and do not let her die
{90683}{90780}We need some sort of shield...|the flame is flickering
{90872}{90952}Please, make her well again...
{90962}{91095}Holy Madonna, I am unworthy|of forgiveness
{91116}{91242}But Mimi is an angel from Heaven
{91303}{91412}-I still hope. Does she seem worse?|-I don't think so
{91426}{91492}Marcello, she is dead!
{91593}{91621}Musetta, take this
{92120}{92142}How is she?
{92183}{92240}As you see, she is peaceful
{92310}{92396}Why is everyone runing around?
{92425}{92469}Why do you look at me like this?
{92570}{92594}You must be brave!
I can die peacefully because I seen a great love.
In the Masters' house.
Tell Mr. Michael to bring my Algerian sketches to me.
I would like to speak with Mr. Zoret the butler. the princess.
Switt, the journalist.
Claude Zoret, the Master.
"Already I have been offered 30000 dollars for these sketches, but I could not bring myself, to let go of them."
Why not? we are not going thus to sell our most beautiful memories.
Please, tell Mr. Zoret,
I will return again before the beginning of the opera.
So, one of these Russian princesses whom at all costs love to be painted by the Master. have they for instance a monopoly on being painted by the Master?
How come you were made a model by the Master, and almost his son?
It was four years ago...
These sketches are not worth anything
Come back when you have learned to see correctly.
I would like to paint to you!
Would you model for me?
You owe much to him, Michael!
But the Master also must thank you!
His glory was born on the paintings in which you modelled.
At table, the conversation turns to death.
It is strange how, sometimes I fear dying so much that I do not know like thinking of it.
I run away from the horror!
I do not fear death because prediction must be fulfilled
I cannot imagine a more beautiful end than to die for being adored
For me, death is simply the last stage of life
You know that your conversation has inspired in me a new picture?
I want to paint Caesar assassinated by Brutus, his adoptive son. and who will look like Brutus?
Switt takes notes from our table conversation for the work that he is writing on the Master
What is your prediction, Duke, of what was spoken at table?
That the last Monthieu will know a great happiness
... and will pay with his life
The butler announces to them that the carriage is leaving
I regret much, I never paint pictures to order but since there is time
I am nevertheless going to paint to you
Michael, the spotlight!
The finances of the princess must be rather disordered
Possibly she hopes to increase her credit by being painted by the Master.
There we are!
I can come in the morning for the first pose?
The "winner" is my best picture,
I give it to you
There will come a day when all will belong to you
Never had a picture given as much pain to Master as the picture of princess Zamikow
You have been up three nights without sleeping!
Is that sensible?
When I am alone,
I see it in front of me, it goes well
But when she is seated here, everything vanishes
Where is Michael?
He goes every afternoon to the Opera to ogle a young ballerina .
Go now, I want to work
I will return after food
You are the culprit of my sleepless nights, princess
Serve the food, we will eat!
We do not wait for Michael?
Today, we will drink in English glasses
The gentleman and the lady are already seated at table
You have sat down to eat without me?
Never have I been treated thus before
Never!
It is your eyes
I cannot render them
It looks right?
You try!
Yes, now, those are her eyes!
Only the youth can guess that
Good eyes
It was Michael who painted them
How did you knew my eyes so well?
Where have you been throughout this time?
I was in the country.
Unfortunately I must leave
I go to the theater this evening.
You are the only one that does not suspect to anything with regard to Michael and Zamikow
Ah so
Tell the butler to take the English glasses to my apartment the Master gave permission
Take away the board,
Mr. Michael has gone out.
Close the window
On this evening, the ballet danced
Tchaikovski's  "Swan Lake"
You do not feel, do not see what I suffer?
Have pity on me, my friend...
Do you desire to have supper with us after the performance, Mr. Switt?
Go now, we meet soon
I want only to believe that the eternity exists.
The visits of Michael to the Master were made more and more rarely only dictated by the last conscience of having to
The thing itself is just a triviality
He came to request lately to me large amounts of money several times
Youth wants to live totally and youth costs money
Book this sum to my account!
From now on you will have your own account with my banker. and then you will be able to begin a new page
Now leave me alone, Michael
"We could see in its last work a picture of princess Z. no brush stroke truer only the eyes make an exception. the effect is so unrealistic that we would swear that the eyes have been painted by another hand "
Who knows the story of the eyes of the Zamikow?
Us
Yes, and he?
Perhaps that to somebody he says the truth and the truth to you, is... that you hated him from first day
Because he broke into  my life, where you wanted to be the only one that played a role
Nobody knows when I am unique
Nobody has the right to increase to my solitude
Claude Zoret, I request to you... that you save the bitterer deceptions.
Let go of the boy
No, Charles,
I do not want to die without my boy.
Why you spoke to me never of this?
Call Mercier, the art dealer
That passes immediately
Calm yourself, my darling
Everything is going to fix itself, I found a solution.
Leave Michael's place setting
Where is Michael? painting in the country.
And Alice?
How is she?
She is well, thanks
Mr. Leblanc, art dealer
I requested that you came, Mr. Leblanc, because I would like through you to sell my "Caesar and Brutus"
That is gorgeous, but...
How to say, I mean... an atmosphere can be cool, not true? and atmosphere can be warm
So in this situation
Another one of your canvases is on the market...
The "Conqueror"...
I want to rescue the "Conqueror" under a pseudonym the price little concerns me
Put the picture in the appartment of Michael, that is its place.
As of that day,
Claude Zoret closed the door to everybody to create his masterpiece completely alone and when this was finished,
Michael returned.
Bring wine!
For the sky,
I have been inspired by the Algerian sketches
Today, for the celebration of return of Michael, we will drink in English glasses
I have borrowed them
I have enough of you pretending
I have enough of being your model, the instrument of your glory
I want finally to be a free man,
Not to depend anymore on your good thanks
Princess Zamikow asks for Mr. Michael to the telephone.
I will never respond to you to what you've just said to me, Michael.
The homecoming....
Why you do not say anything?  speak then
What could I say, that does not make you suffer? finally came the day in which the Master exposed his work. the Duchess, widow of Monthieu Wilhelmine Sandrock
Pardon my preoccupation, Mr. Zoret:
Have you seen my son?
That is a man who has lost all
My girl, pardon this question of a tormented mother:
Do you know where is my son?
Tell Alice that the last Monthieu has paid for his happiness the painter of the pain... the glory of the nation...
Where is Michael?
Soon calm reigned again in the mansion of the Master.
I am sorry I could not come,
I have brought the criticism with me
I can read it for you?
Not now.
I have brought the criticism with me
I can read it for you?
All write about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing that you have ever painted
Now, we propose to you
60000 dollars for the sketches
To the fact, where are your Algerian sketches?
I would much like to see them again
But Mr. Michael has just left.. with a large folder of drawings
Possibly  he has...
Is true nevertheless,
I had forgotten... that I gave the sketches to him
Yes, Charles, now I am tired
I want to sleep now, to sleep...
But in the course at night, the fate of the Master is fulfilled.
The Master is dying.  Switt.
Take this as fast as is possible to Mr. Michael
I, Claude Zoret, that knows the solitude in this world,
I will my last dispositions here
All my goods must go to my adoptive son, Eugène Michael.
Have you found Michael?
Is he coming soon?
Mr. Michael will not be spoken to
I want  to rest in the middle of a field
Where germinate the seeds and grows the grass, and nobody will have to know the place where I am buried,
Swear that for me?
Jules, my friend, do not cry more.
I go where my heart will know rest
Why you smile, Claude?
Charles, now I can die peacefully. because I knew a great love
Mr. Michael, the Master has died!
Be quiet,be still...
I am with you.

Professor of Astronomy
You should have let that skunk break his neck, Helius -!
For thirty years I live like a dog for the sake of my ideas - and then comes this louse-fellow speculating on my misery, and wants to buy my manuscript from me as a curiosity -!
I'd like to have dinner with you,
Professor - can you spare some bread?
I found this in my coat when you left the other day - buy yourself some bread with it, Mr. Helius -!
Spare me having to take handouts from my only friend, Helius...
If you don't join me, Professor,
I won't be able to enjoy it!

Hypothetical Account
of the Gold Content
In the Mountains
of the Moon
I maintain, after many years of comparative analyses, that primitive moon-rock contains more gold than the earth's mountains.
One day, the first spaceship will fly to the moon, to bring its gold back to the earth!
Laughter, gentlemen, is the argument of idiots against every new idea -!!
The progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification -!!!
Professor - I've decided to go...
But not without me, Helius - not without me -!!
Now your idea will triumph after all, Professor...
Naturally Windegger will go along?
What -? Windegger won't -? Your collaborator and best friend?
Friede Velten, student of astronomy, and Hans Windegger, Chief Engineer of Helius Hangars are engaged.
Dear Friede!
Best wishes to you and Hans!
Don't be upset that I can't come tonight to your engagement party!
Please accept the flowers as a substitute.
Yours, Wolf Helius.
He doesn't even know anything about my decision - no-one does - except for you...
I tell you, Helius, more people than you and I know of your plan -
- and the fellow whom I threw down the stairs before is one of them -!
Three nights ago -
So you think someone knows of my plans and is thus also interested in your moon-gold theory?
Helius, don't be angry - it's my life's work - go home -
I can't rest until I know the manuscript is in your safe!
Dear Helius! I write to you in incomparable bliss and you should be the first to know that Friede has agreed to be my wife.
Perhaps I took her a bit by surprise, but she said yes!
Come tonight to the engagement party at Friede's apartment!
I am ridiculously happy!
Windegger
Fresh violets, sir?
Wolf Helius, Bergstr. 86-3
To be delivered in person
Mr. Helius isn't home...
Please... let me wait for Mr. Helius anyway. Mr. Windegger sent me...
To be delivered In person
Dear Helius! Accept this poor soul, if you can, and give him work and a chance to make a life - he won't disappoint you.
Warmest regards,
Windegger
Drive to the nearest police station - don't hold things up with long explanations - just bring some sort of officer here to me!
MINGO:
NICK CARTER OF THE SKY
Saturn-Pirates
The thieves' craft approaches
unlucky Saturn!
God in Heaven: You must have some idea when you last phoned -!
Did you leave the flat unattended -?
Only for a moment, when
Gustav came to get me... but then there was that man whom Mr. Windegger had sent -!
Would you allow me to use your telephone?
My phone isn't working...
Christ, madame - someone has to pick up - there's at least half a dozen people sitting around that phone -!
I'm only the foreman of Helius Hangars - but if you keep working like this, you, Miss Friede, will soon be the forewoman of us all!
I was supposed to have sent you somebody with a letter of recommendation -?!
I'm begging you, Hans, get over here...
I can't tell you over the telephone what this is all about... just, please, come...
You can be assured, Hans, that I would not call you away from your engagement party if it weren't absolutely necessary...
We'll be there right away,
Helius!
Allow me to introduce myself -:
Turner...
If you go flying down those steps again, Mr. Turner,
I won't be standing at the bottom to catch you...
Believe me, Mr. Helius, there's no wiser way to pass the time till the arrival of Ms. Velten and Mr. Windegger than to have a chat with me...
First, a small request... tell your chauffeur it's no longer necessary to inform the police...
The police have already been informed, Mr. Turner...
Just a measure of caution,
Mr. Helius, - as well as this...
Also a measure of caution,
Mr. Turner?
I now grasp the phenomenon,
Mr. Turner, how you haven't been whiling away in prison all this time -!
You do flatter,
Mr. Helius!
Perhaps you can also reveal to me, Mr. Turner, where the stolen manuscript - and the contents missing from my safe are located -?!
Five of the wealthiest and cleverest minds who wish to keep the earth's gold-reserve under their control -
One of the most interesting documents, madame and sirs...
To prove the accessibility of the moon,
Helius sent the unmanned trial-rocket H. 23 filled with magnesium, moonward - the explosion of which, upon impact, was viewed and photographed from the earth!
Thanks to the competence of our representative
I can show you something completely different - things that Helius himself has thus far not made available to the scientific community.
Cinematographic images of the surface of the moon by H. 32 during its first orbit of the moon.
The unmanned register-rocket H.32, equipped with automatic imaging-instruments.
The rocket-jet.
In its nose-cone...
...is located the egg-shaped register-chamber with the automated imaging-instruments.
The imaging-instrument, linked to a clockwork.
The mirror tele-objective.
Schematic depiction of the H.32's trajectory.
Gravitational Field

Zero-G Zone
Trajectory of H.32
Necessary starting speed
11,200 metres per second
First image of the moon,
36 hours after liftoff:
Distance of the rocket from the moon: Approx. 40,000 km.
At an altitude of approx. 1000 km
H.32 flies over the moon-crater Eratosthenes -
- in its depths the astronomer
W. H. Pickering, director of Mandeville
Observatory, Jamaica, believes to have observed swarms of insects.
The objective's eye sees what no man's eye has ever seen:
The opposite side of the moon turned away from the earth.
Cryptic, monochrome planes of colossal dimensions -
Vegetation? Fog?
Water? -
- all seem to confirm the theory of Prof. Peter Andreas Hansen
- of the Seeberg Observatory near Gotha - that on the opposite side of the moon exists an atmosphere and, therefore, life.
Why lose more time?
I for one want the moon's riches of gold, should they actually prove to exist, to fall into the hands of businessmen and not visionaries and idealists!
At this moment our representative is making
Mr. Helius aware of our intentions in a very concrete manner...
You have only two choices,
Mr. Helius:
Either make the trip to the moon in our employ -
- or not at all...
If we don't come to an agreement, Mr. Helius, five minutes after my departure, your hangar, along with the nearly completed spaceship, will be reduced to a heap of rubble...
What would you gain, by killing me off, Mr. Helius? - at the most, a travel companion who is less considerate!
You still don't get the picture, Mr. Helius... we'd rather annihilate all of your plans than let you shut us out of the operation...
Tell your clients,
Mr. Turner, that I do not aim to found upon the moon a criminal-colony...
Give me 24 hours to think it over...
Will your... plans be seriously affected by the theft, Helius?
Don't worry about the plans -!
I have duplicates of everything, safe in my desk's secret compartment!
Hans dear, if I were you, I wouldn't be so sure about that!
Why did you conceal from us,
Helius, the fact that you now actually want to take on the voyage to the moon?
You've called me your good comrade so often at work - in the laboratory - in this very room... now you want to lie to me, Helius?
I didn't mean to lie to you, Friede -
I just wanted to spare
Hans the conflict between his love for you and his sense of duty towards the work we've been doing!
But do you really believe, Helius, that Hans would ever be capable of letting you down?!
Oh no, Helius! You won't make the trip to the moon without Windegger...
- and not without me -!
Have you forgotten, Friede, how those fared that dared this trip to the moon before us -
IN MEMORY OF...
TO THE BOLD PIONEERS
OF SPACE NAVIGATION
WHO DID NOT RETURN FROM
THEIR JOURNEY INTO OUTER-SPACE
THE Y LIVED AND DIED FOR
A GREAT IDEA
HONOUR THEIR MEMORY
Friede - don't you get it?!
I just couldn't stand to know you were in danger -
God in heaven - and what danger indeed -!!!
He's decided to travel to the moon, Hans...
So when do we start -?
And who will go with us?
Ask Friede...
Friede... you want to go with me -?
...in exactly 24 hours...
Mr. Helius, the 24 hours for consideration were up 61 minutes ago...
The explosion is of no concern, Mr. Helius - it's nothing but a small accentuation of my offers...
The price of this first warning, Mr. Windegger, is the hangar:
Just a shack... the second one will cost the lives of men... the third, the spaceship...
Don't force me, Mr. Helius, to take stronger measures:
Choose the lesser of two evils -: Me!
I give you my word,
Mr. Helius, the very hour that we come to an agreement, you'll get your stolen material back, complete and in perfect condition...
...the Spaceship "FRIEDE"
("Peace") is ready for launch...
...at moonrise the spaceship will soar into outer-space...
...only to land - if God sees fit - 36 hours later upon the opposite side of the moon...
...at this moment bells will ring - the sirens of all the factories, trains and ships around the world will wail to honour the pioneers of space navigation...
In this final hour I must once again warn all of you...
You, Manfeldt, and you -
Mr. Turner:
I'm leaving out Windegger:
And as for you... Friede -!
Friede... in this last minute... -
I'm begging you -
Don't beg me, Helius!
Helius, in this last instant, do you want to shame me as a woman?
...the whole world's eyes are directed upon us... -
...the whole world's ears are listening to us...
Everyone to their stations...
We launch in 50 minutes -!
...the whole world's eyes are directed upon us... -
...the whole world's ears are listening to us...
Just now
Just now the
Just now the spaceship
Just now the spaceship has
Just now the spaceship has reached
Just now the spaceship has reached the
Just now the spaceship has reached the launch pad...
...because the spaceship is built too light to stand freely, it's submerged in a water-basin in which it floats upright...
From the moment of launch till attaining the necessary speed of 11,200 km per second...
SPEED
...there will be 8 critical minutes in the battle with the increase in speed, with G-force, which has a fatal effect upon human organisms when it goes over
40 metres per second...
G-FORCE
...after these 8 minutes, during which we'll feel an intolerable burden pulling our bodies back to earth, we'll be victors in the battle with gravitational force... or -
...and if we aren't able to maintain our speed of 11200... then we'll hurtle - and hurtle - further - and further still -
- irretrievably lost in outer-space - never again... never again... to return to the earth...
I'll be the one to pull the stop-lever, Windegger!
60 seconds to go -!
20 seconds to go - lie still - take a deep breath -!
10 seconds to go -!
Seconds to go!
NOW
Launch-rocket depleted!
Full-throttle on middle-rocket!
Win-degger... jet-tison... middle... - ro-cket...
Turn... back!!!
Maybe this chap is dead?!
I think Josephine needs a brandy!
I think Mr. Turner needs one even more -!
Don't you see, someone is stowed away in the cargo hold!
Okay, you wretched scoundrel, how did you get in here?!
I've devoted my whole life to moon-issues, Mr. Helius!
Moon Vampire

Deadly Moon-Rays

The sun is rising on our earth...

FRIEDE
Turning the spaceship's black side toward the sun... to absorb warmth. -
All's well on board.
227,000 km from earth.
Stopping the last jets, flying without propulsion.
Weightlessness on board.
Have entered the moon's gravitational field. -
Are within 9000 km of the moon.
Through the directional boosts mentioned above weight regained on board.
Turning the spaceship with the jets in direction of destination to fire brake boosts to prevent premature crash on the moon. -
Are about to reach the side of the moon facing away from earth.
Watching the earth set.
We're seeing it again, Hans... we're seeing it again!
And when are we finally going to land?!
If we had a spark of reason in us, we wouldn't ever land -!
You're just afraid - you wimp -!!
Tell him he has no right to jeopardise all our lives for the sake of his ambition!
By God now is not the time for arguments, Hans -
Shut the window-hatches -!
Full brake-power - we're plummeting -!
Hold on tight -!!!!
The ignition cable probably isn't going to fix itself!
The moon awaits!
First though we have to do an air-sample, to tell whether we can breathe outside!
Do what you want!
I'm only interested in how
I'll get back out of here!
I'll tell you just one thing, Friede, as soon as I have the spaceship ready to launch again, I'll fly back to earth - and neither Helius nor
Manfeldt will stop me -!
Do you really aim to stab Helius in the back?
Do you really aim to stab me in the back?
Now Helius has no choice but to prepare right away for the trip back -!
But Helius is convinced that we'll find water with the divining rod!
You know what the only thing is that we'll find on the moon -!
- Death!
Professor, please, help me with the air-sample!
For God's sake, don't open it -!!
If he opens the outer door and outside there's no breathable atmosphere, then we're done for good!
He's taken the divining rod with him!
It's as if the rod is pulling him forward!
Mingo would follow this trail, Mr. Helius!
The main objective should be to look for water!
I have enough to do, to get us ready to launch again!
May I volunteer to look for Professor Manfeldt and, at the same time, water?
Atmosfere breathable, not yet analised.
Törner on the trale for 3 hours of Manfeldt searching for water.
Since when is Gustav your secretary?
I can't stand it anymore...
I'm going to look for Manfeldt -!
From Miss Friede... so you won't go hungry!
Professor -!
Professor -!
Professor -!!
Professor -! Manfeldt -!!
Professor -!!!
Don't let him into the ship!!
Don't let him into the ship!!!
Is there anyone in the world to whom we should relay your last regards - if we get back to earth?
The oxygen containers - the shot hit the oxygen containers -!!!!
What does this mean,
Miss Friede, with the oxygen containers?!
Let's pray to God it means nothing!
We've lost more than half of the oxygen!
That means: One of us can't go back to earth -!
One of us has to stay on the moon -!!
Yes, Windegger:
One of us!
Do you know what this means - do you?!
To stay here - alone on the moon - just because you didn't want to listen to me - you and him!!
Short one loses - long one wins... and we draw three times... how's that?!
You draw -!
So draw then -!
Would it be easier for you, Hans, if I stayed with you on the moon?
I have only one desire:
To get back to earth -!!
Let's drink to a happy homecoming to earth - for all of us...
...to a happy homecoming - for all of us, Hans!
The base-camp is ready,
Mr. Helius!
Now you must prove, Gustav, that I can rely upon you!
I'm staying back here on the moon...
- and you will guide the spaceship away from the moon!
Do you want Mr. Windegger to perish -?
And Miss Friede, who loves him -?
The enormous shock of the launch will naturally wake the sleepers - and then Mr. Windegger will take over the command...
Dear Hans! I am convinced that you won't let me down just as I haven't let you down.
I shall wait calmly and with confidence that you'll come to get me.
My greetings to Friede! - Helius.
Farewell!
SEX IN CHAINS
This film is based on a work about the sexual desire of prisoners, by Franz Höllering, and on actual statements by Karl Plättner, the author of the detailed book
"Eros in Prison", the material for which he collected during his eight-year imprisonment.
Following the premiere in Berlin, the German Human Rights League assumed responsibility for this film.
Part 1
Franz Sommer,
Engineer.
Father!
I am just passing through and have only an hour stopover.
This is the maid's day off.
How is your husband?
May I say good-day to him?
I will call the factory to see if he's available.
Too bad... Franz and one of his executives are en route to an important meeting
Help Wanted.
Franz, look sharp, customers arriving!
You have just been filmed!
You still haven't found a job, my dear Sommer?
Go there, maybe my recommendation will be helpful.
Alfred Wernicke asks that you cordially receive the bearer of this card
Full-time employment is out of the question, but if you'd like to act as a sales representative on commission...
- please do.
With such a glum look you won't get anywhere. You need to smile.
Another attempt
- maybe something will come of it.
My father was here, he brought it along.
While we hide our situation from father, you cannot expect anything else from him.
In response to your application, we are willing to engage you.
You may begin work as soon as tomorrow.
Respectfully.
Before you were laid off, we savored the good times together.
Now that times are hard,
I want to help earn our living.
Maybe you can also show us how the device cleans furniture, entirely without obligation of course!
Oh Fifi, it's just the thing for you!
We work all day and still never get done.
Clean already?
The device seems very practical, but
I just can't decide whether to buy it.
Well, here's your commission
- quite a nice start.
You've given me too much by mistake.
Thank goodness you're here
- some guy has been pestering me all night.
Please leave me alone
- I'll lose my job.
Leave my wife alone.
LEAVE MY WIFE ALONE!!!
End of Part 1
Part 2
Did I call Steinau... - or Sommer!?
Don't be so desperate... he will recuperate.
Then you will surely be acquitted!
Keep me in your heart!
If I find out whose lies sent me up,
I'll kill him!
If only she doesn't have to starve!
Nice state of affairs - when some informer can send an innocent man to prison!
Is that your final word?
I don't care if he's found guilty
- I will not get divorced!
Then we have nothing more to say to one another.
I'll sustain a loss from the downtime while I'm imprisoned.
I will be acquitted in the end, but who compensates for my damage?
The bail is accepted. You are free!
I will keep my promise to you:
I shall help your wife.
Jail has taught me to look at the world with new eyes.
From her husband in prison?
Dear Madam,
I promised your husband to relieve his concern for you and for that reason ask you to call on me in my office at your earliest convenience.
Respectfully,
Paul Steiner
I was imprisoned together with your husband during investigation...
Would you care to accept a position in my business?
We can only hope the injured man will live, or the matter can become serious for you.
Abandonment of the proceedings against the Steinau plants
...the State Attorney's Office has dropped the charges filed against the owner of the Steinau plants.
Steinau intends to file suit...
...Max Wallraff, who was knocked down by engineer Franz Sommer, presently held in prison, has succumbed to the injuries...
Now he is in for it.
However I can help you, I shall!
In the name of the people.
- Despite the gravity of the deed...
- emotional act...
- the immaculate past life...
- after long indecision, the court has...
- decreed a sentence of three years of prison...
End of Part 2
Part 3
Three years...! Can one survive that?!
In the night only Friedland stars can beam!
Has it seized you yet?
Just wait, this too will pass.
I've lived to see someone unman himself, just so he could finally sleep.
Human beings will always be such, even if they have sinned against society!
Is it not hard enough to be locked away from the world... must also one punish the culprit in a way that his punishment also hurts the innocent?
Not for me, Mr. Baron,
- My imagination lets me do without such gimmicks!
Why are we allowed to eat, drink, sleep, and only that?
Are we not human?
Stay at home... you're excused for today.
Let me work... otherwise
I don't know how I shall bear it.
I've lived to see someone unman himself, just so he could finally sleep.
To the doctor
Allow me to go to my girl just once or I'll go mad!
Simulator!
Just imagine, a naked woman molded from breadcrumbs. It is hell here.
Even the strongest weakens under this depravation. At the same time
I can understand this man, because I too suffer terribly from the distance to you.
A person gone once astray must not despair of the moral order in prison and become a real criminal!
To be part of this solution shall be my life's work!
End of Part 3
Part 4
Mrs. Sommer!
Are you doing well?
You must not worry about me;
Mr. Steinau is a true friend.
He also gave me employment.
End of visiting time!
Well, Mr Baron, how did the 8 days of sanatorium agree with you?
Plead for me that I'll be allowed my bride... only one day... else I cannot live on.
You've brought the handkerchief back from visitation.
Three days of solitary! Dismissed!
Who is this, who enters there?
Oh, look who's coming there!
He smells like outside!
Tell me about outside.
My husband
My husband...
My husband!...
My husband!......
Husband!......
Husband......
End of Part 4
Part 5
Yield not to temptation, but turn your hearts aloft and
God shall carry you through.
I cannot describe my sufferings to you.
It is horrible here and only thoughts of you, of your fidelity and bravery, hold me up. When I get out...
You shall know everything, everything, everything.
Alfred, what are you thinking of?
Place your hand over your heart and promise that you won't laugh at me!
I shall never laugh at you.
Why don't you say something
- do you despise me?
Prison Warden
Punishment should not be an act of social revenge, but one of instruction for mankind in living together.
We prison officers have no higher duty.
If it isn't always successful, it isn't always due to us.
Why are husband and wife not allowed to spend their few visiting hours unsupervised?
For once I will make an exception!
Just a quarter of an hour
I was with him...
I wanted to tell him everything but I could not do it.
What has become of me!
I am to blame for everything!
You are no more guilty than he or I
- the laws men make are bad and brutal... they mercilessly plunge us into the depths!
If I were to ask him to release you and you were to become my wife...!
No! No! I love him... only him!
End of Part 5
Part 6
Mr Marquis, please honor us with your presence soon again.
Mr von Sommer, you are next.
I thank you with all my heart for everything you have done for me.
Now I will visit Sommer in prison
- he has to release you.
I beg you not to do that.
Live for your idea to moderate the penal system, and forget me!
I hoped to have you at my side as my wife in this battle...
Penal System Reform
Why don't the prisoners themselves complain?
Because they are afraid, Mr. Representative.
Is it not to weep when millions are spent to help horses, cats and dogs... and so little for the betterment of men!
There can surely be no argument that prison must be less agreeable than freedom.
I know in theory there is a modern penal system.
In practice however, everything remains unaffected.
Isn't being caged enough?
Allow the possibility of short leaves instead of trying to contain natural drives with exercise and saltpetre.
Punishment must remain a penalty.
We cannot put sofas in the cells!
Thank you, Mr Representative. In any case,
I know whom not to elect in the future!
To be postponed until further notice
Tomorrow he will come out of prison!
If he is rich, you can get a nice little sum out of him.
This will advise that your husband will be released from prison on October 1, 1928 at 10:00.
Your husband would like you to come for him.
FIRST YEAR
SECOND YEAR
THIRD YEAR
Now I can go wherever I wish
- but no longer to you!
So Steinau has spoken with you after all?!
What is Steinau supposed to have talked about with me?
Back then someone touched you and I struck him down
- today everything is so different!
Forget?... I will never forget how strong and upright was our commitment!
And now... truly,
The Law punishes thoroughly!
Madam, if I've destroyed your happiness
- forgive me.
I cannot continue living... go, you are free.
We belong together... as in love, as in guilt.
Even if it can end only this way?
In the end, too!
The Sheik
In this world of peace and flame
Lies a palm garden of the Sahara
A blessed oasis of the sands
Where the children of Araby dwell
In happy ignorance that Civilization has passed them by.
Maidens chosen for the marriage market.
An ancients custom by which.
Wives are secured for the wealthy sons of Allah.
Zilah, one of the prizes destined for the marriage lottery.

The Sheik, Ahmed Ben Hassan, upon whose shoulders has fallen the heritage of leadership.

When love is more desired than riches, it is will of Allah.
Let another be chosen.
On the way to the harems Of the rich merchants.
To obey and serve like chattel slaves.
Biskra, the Beautiful.
Gateway to the desert.
A city of adventure. Where the new civilization Rubs elbows with the old.
Are you going to attend Diana Mayo's farewell dance this evening?
I am not! I thoroughly disapprove of this young madcap's wild scheme!
The idea of Diana Mayo planing a tour alone into the desert, with only native camel-drivers and Arabs!
The subject of all the gossip, the orphan daughter of an English peer,
Lady Diana Mayo. Agnes Ayres
Her brother, Sir Aubrey, who for years has vainty striven to curb Diana's reckless spirit of daring Frank Butler
Diana's guide into the desert,
Mustapha Ali
Charles Brindley
I have a good mind to make you give up this insane trip.
I've made up my mind, dear brother.
Evening in the Monte Carlo of the Sahara
Diana, I love you. Postpone this trip and give me the right to go with you.
Marriage is captivity - the end of independence.
I am content with my life as it is.
It is the great Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan.
He is entertaining at the Casino tonight.
Mademioselle will be disappointed- the Casino is closed to all except Arabs.
And why should a savage desert bandit keep us out of any public place?
Sheik Ahmed is not a savage.
He is a rish tribal prince, who was educated in Paris.
In Biskra his slightest wish is law.
Go to the dancer and ask if I may borrow one of her costumes for the evening.
Like a page from the Arabian Nights.
The marriage gamble Where bridge are won On the turn of a wheel.
Oh, sons of Allah! Gaze upon the charms of Halima, loveliest flower of the desert.
To the cultured English girl this marriage fair suggests the slave of the barbarous past.
The pale hands and golden hair of a white woman.
By whose invitation do you come here?
I wanted to see the savage who could bar me from this Casino.
With your permission, the savage will escort you to the door.
It is the English woman whom
I am to guide into the desert tomorrow.
Dawn- with the Arab under the lure of the defiant English girl.
Pale hands I love, Beside the Shalimar,
Where are you now?
Who lies beneath your spell?
Into the sand garden of the sun. with her brother accompanying her on the first day's journey
Don't worry, Aubrey, I shall join you in London in a month - goodbye.
Lie still, you little fool!
Her exultant dream of freedom ended- a helpless captive in the desert wastes.
Gaston, the French valet, in the Sheik's service since his school days in France.
Lucien Littlefield.
Why have you brought me here?
Are you not woman enough to know?
Do you know how beautiful you are?
I am not accustomed to having my orders disobeyed.
And I am not accustomed to obeying orders.
You will learn!
You make a very charming boy, but it was not a boy
I saw two nights ago in Biskra.
Your luggage has arrived.
You will dress for dinner.
See that Mademoiselle is given every comfort and attend to her luggage at once.
I speak French, Madame, and come to serve my master's bride.
An hour of anguished revolt, while a savage sand-storm sweeps in from the fevered wastes.
Do you think can keep me here when I am missed by my friends in Biskra?
You will not be missed until it is too late... too late for anyone to learn your whereabouts- the desert is a great hidingplace
Better remain here, for in that sand fury you would not live an hour.
You are so pretty and if I choose,
I can make you love me.
I would rather you killed me.
Master, the horses!
They have broken loose!
Through the dull slumber of despair.
Until morning tempts back.
A desire to live.
For Madame to wear the master's orders.
After a week of sullen obedience.
To my friend, Ahmed Ben Hassan from Raoul de st. Hubert
That I can at last make another visit to you in the desert.
I count the days until you meet me in Biskra. Affection stely Raoul
Pale hands I love, Beside the Shalimar,
Where are you now?
Who lies beneath your spell?
Pale hands, pink tipped!
Then it was you who sang beneath my window in Biskra?
I always sing when I am happy when events and things please me.
My friend from Paris is coming for a visit Raoul de St. Hubert,
That is why I am happy that is why I sing.
Are you going to bring him here and let him see me- like this?
You are here and so it is my wish that you should cordially receive my guest.
You will return Mademoiselle's possession to her at once.
I am leaving for Biskra to be gone three days.
During my absence, amuse yourself.
You will have the saddle horses and Gaston to keep you company.
Gaston will return your clothes.
You hate them so mush my kisses?
As the hour approaches when Diana must face the humiliating ordeal of meeting a man from her own world.
The French novelist, Dr. Raoul de St. Hubert
Adolphe Menjaou
She is very fascinating, Raoul.
Be careful - she will surely bewitch you.
"Does the past mean so little to you that you now steal white women and make love to them like a savage?"
"When an Arab sees a woman that he wants, he takes her!"
A desert bandit trespasses
In the domain of the Sheik Ahmed,
Under the guise of a holy caravan.
Omair, the bandit.
Walter Long
"Where is Gaston?
What are you doing here?"
I did not have the courage to face the stranger.
Oh, be kind to me Ahmed, please!
If I had arrived a moment later, you would have been picked up by that caravan and carried away from me.
At dinner St. Hubert reveals himself as a chivalrous gentleman of tact.
If you will permit me,
I should like to retire, sir!
You might have spared her.
My presence here!
The humiliation of meeting a man from her own world!
She is content.
Desert days bring to the captive and the novelist a closer understanding.
Your story is wonderful, but is it real?
Does there really exit such a man as you have drawn.
As tender and faithful as your hero?
I do know such a man.
One who could develop into such a character.
The men in my life have not known the meaning of tenderness.
Have thought only of themselves.
Unfortunately, beautiful women provoke in some men all that is base in their characters.
And the women pays for the beauty God has given her.
Excuse me. My ideals cannot possibly interest you.
On the contrary, they interest me profoundly.
As what. A subject for vivisection?
The victim is ready.
It will make interesting material for your next book.
If you will honor me with your friendship, my life is at your service.
Come quickly, doctor!
There been an accident!
Ahmed!
One of the men.
A gun exploded in his hand.
You see, Mademoiselle, it is all right!
In the harem of
Omair, the bandit.
The white woman of Ahmed Ben Hassan.
Bring me word of her.
Learn if she is guarded well.
I cannot ride today.
Gaston will accompany you.
You won't run away again?
I want you to carry this always.
The spies of Omair are still in the neighborhood.
I trust you.
You have not changed your mind about Mademoiselle?
Eventide, when the vast undulating sand dunes throw their shadows.
A spy of Omair, the bandit.
One more reason for restoring
Mademoiselle to her people.
Let take her with me when
I return to Biskra.
Has she bewitched you, too?
You want her for yourself!
How I have made her suffer!
Merciful Allah, why does it give me so little pleasure?
Because you love her.
Ahmed I love you
You are right. I cannot see her again.
Take her safely to Biskra.
Bid her goodbye for me. Then, my friend, return to me in my loneliness.
Do not let me fall into their hands.
The stronghold of the barbarous Omair.
Ahmed I love you
Monsieur!
Madame - Omair!
Nightfall on the oasis.
Where the tribal clans gather.
At the call of their chiftain.
I have sent for reinforcements.
When they arrive let them follow.
Bring forth the white gazelle and guard closely the jealous one.
Ahmed! Ahmed!
Call, beautiful one! Your lover will not come! He has forgotten you.
Is he dying?
It rest with Allah.
We must get him away from here.
White tribal hearts appeal to Allah.
He is sleeping.
There is still hope.
His hands is so large an Arab.
He is not an Arab. His father was an Englishman, his mother a Spaniard.
Twenty-five years ago the old
Sheik Ben Hassan found Ahmed's mother and father deserted by their escort.
Left to die on the desert.
Growing to manhood as an Arab, he was sent to Paris to be educated and upon the Sheik's death, returned to the desert to assume leadership of the tribe.
Pray God, dear friend, to save his life.
Oh, if He would only accept my life in exchange for his!
Diana, my beloved!
The darkness has passed and now the sunshine.
All things are with Allah!
Hello.
- Nice day' isn't it?
- Yes, isn't it!
It's swell.
It's perfect.
- Just like you.
- Ah' shut up!
You know' it's a lucky thing
I didn't go out on my yacht today.
- I wouldn't have met you.
- Have you a yacht?
Have I?
A regular floating palace!
You know' I had to put straps on it for people to hang on to...
I have so many friends.
I never heard of straps on a yacht.
Well, ya see, I got the idea... when I was going to work every morning... on the subway to Wall Street.
Are you in Wall Street?
Am I!
Say, I've got 80 acres right in the center of the financial district.
Why, if it was out in California,
I'd subdivide it... and I'd buy you the whole world.
You're kidding.
- My name's Jim. What's yours?
- Mary.
- I'll bet it's Mary Smith.
- I'll bet it isn't.
Well, Mary... you found your little lamb.
Now I'm gonna follow you wherever you go.
Gee, we're alone!
And our day is almost over.
Oh, it isn't over.
It's just beginning.
- For I'm going to make you a promise.
- Promise what?
That we'll never be lonesome anymore.
If I had known when I first saw you... that you were only a telephone operator instead of a swell...
I'd have proposed to you right on the spot.
And if I had known that you were just a punch presser...
I... I would have accepted.
Gee, it's funny how lonesome a fella can be... especially with a million people around him.
You know, you just can't be happy in a hotel room... especially when all your friends... have homes and kiddies.
All my life I've wanted a little white house... out in the country, with blue shingles.
I don't like blue shingles.
But you like the white house.
And I'd paint the shingles any color you like.
- Lavender?
- Sure!
Or pink?
Oh, Mary,
I'd rather have them blue.
Then they'd be just the color of your eyes.
Of course, you could have them black, or brown, or green, or... any color you like, just so long as you're there.
Mary...
Mary.
Gee, that's a pretty name!
- But Sergeant, I —
- Calm yourself, baby!
I'll get to you in a moment.
Now tell me where you found him.
A jane was hurt down at the roller coaster.
This monkey tried to run over me about it!
- Disturbing the peace, eh, kiddo?
- Oh, listen to me, Sergeant.
That's what I was trying to tell this man: that it was my girl that was hurt.
I was trying to get to her to help her.
So it was your girl that was hurt, eh?
What is her name?
- Mary, sir.
- Mary what?
I... I don't know.
You see, we only met today.
- Picked her up, eh?
- Oh, no, sir.
You wouldn't say that if you saw her.
She's not that kind of a girl.
She's a good kid, a sweet kid.
That ain't much of a description.
You're officially charged... with picking up girls and resisting arrest.
- Take him away.
- I wish I could make you realize, sir... that you've got to let me go.
I don't know that girl's name, but I love her.
And if I don't get to her,
I'll lose her.
And I'm gonna marry her... if she'll have me.
Dear me!
Isn't that thrilling!
- Do go on!
- Yes, I'll go on... and I'll tell you what I think of you.
You don't know when a man's sincere and when he's not.
What a great policeman you are!
You're so used to dealing with lousy, rotten people... you're rotten yourself!
Run along to your little Mary, sonny.
I hope you find her.
Do you — do you mean it?
Sure I mean it.
Don't mind me.
I'm just playful today.
Now run along.
Thanks.
As for you, you big ham, you go jump in the lake!
Hey, you go jump in the lake!
I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you've planned need a helping hand
I will understand always
Always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year but always
Lonesome me
Poor little lonesome me
So near and yet so far
From happiness
How I pray
We'll meet again someday
To love and laugh

Jeff Brown -
Star athlete, who believed so much -
- in exercise that he made many a girl walk home.
"I didn't think you would call for me in the rain. I'm sorry you are all wet."
"Young man, it's time you graduated.
You've been here seven years."
"I know you are going to be as popular at Clayton College as you were here."
"It is my pleasure to present this diploma to our most brilliant scholar."
"- and your scholastic record richly merits this honor medal."
"Ronald will now speak on the 'Curse of Athletics'."
"The secret of getting a medal like mine is - - books not sports."
"The student who wastes his time on athletics -
- rather than study shows only ignorance."
"Future generations depend upon brains and not -
- upon jumping the discus or hurdling the javelin."
"What have Ty Ruth or Babe
Dempsey done for Science?"
"Where would I be without my books?"
"Your speech was ridiculous.
Anyone prefers -
- an athlete to a weak-knee'd, teachers' pet."
"When you change your mind about athletics, then I'll change my mind about you."
"Mary is going to enter Clayton ...
I wish I could go."
"I'm afraid we can't afford it, dear."
"I can work my way through. Other boys do."
So the following term, Ronald arrived at Clayton, and was met by ...

"I admire his spirit.
At least, he's trying."
"Don't get too interested in that campus clown. -
- You're supposed to be going with me."
"You take an awful lot for granted."
"Attaboy, you made a hole in one."
A call to the Dean's office meant only one thing -
GRIEF
"You have been a miserable failure in all your studies and I know the reason why."
"I took up athletics because the girl I love thinks I'm a weakling."
"I love her and would do anything to please her."
"I understand, my boy. The same thing happened to me, -
- but I was stubborn.
That's why I'm a bachelor."
"Here's a list of the men eligible for the rowing crew."
"Coach, I'd like to have you make this young man coxswain of the crew."
"His size and weight are perfect and he has brains."
"My request is final."
"Clayton can't lose the boat race now.
I've just been appointed the 'Coaxer'."
"Boys, get out the smelling salts - -
- Little Lord Fauntleroy is your new coxswain."
"It's the Dean's orders. He'll be in that race unless -"
"- unless something happens to the poor boy."
The day of the race.
"Hey, coach - nothing has happened to Mama's boy!"
"Don't worry - you're coxswain.
Give him this and -
- he'll wake up just in time for the football season."
"Please leave! If you were seen in my room it would mean expulsion for me!"
"That's just what I want. I was expelled this morning -
- and thought I would like to take you with me."
"I'm going to stay here until we are discovered - -
- then you might change your mind about marrying me."
"Boys, we've got to win!
If we don't, rowing -
- will be a thing of the past at Clayton!"
"Is Ronald our coxswain to-day?"
"Certainly not. I've taken care of that pest in a big way."
The rival crew, ready for their most important race of the year.

They've just been kidding me."
"Maybe it's halitosis -

Act One
Schigolch!
You've come a long way
We haven't seen each other for ages
Do you still dance?
You've forgotten ewerything.
You should have stayed with me
In the old garret? I'd have run away
Chief Editor Dr. Schön looks after you nicely but he can't guarantee our future
You deserve to appear before a big audience. I've brought along just the man for that
Rodrigo Quast. He wants to stage a variety act with you
Dr. Schön is coming!
I'm getting married
Won't you kiss me, just because you're getting married?
Our relationship is the talk of the town. I'm risking my position
Don't you understand it's all over between us?
You'll have to kill me if you want to be free of me
He was my first ... patron
One does one's best
End of Act One
Act Two
The Minister of the Interior,
Dr. von Zamikov, wishes to announce...
...the marriage of his daughter
Charlotte Marie Adelaide...
...to Dr. Ludwig Schön
I warn you again: Dr. Schön's behaviour makes this marriage impossible
Father, I'm not bothered by what people say
Here are the costume designs for your revue, Alwa
What is Lulu doing?
Father must give her up. His wedding cannot be postponed any longer
The famous Rodrigo Quast wants to do a big variety act with me.
We're rehearsing
Alwa is my best friend. He is the only one who wants nothing from me
Or perhaps you want nothing from me because you don't love me?
Dear Geschwitz, you must design such a costume for me
Is she really this beautiful?
I forbade you to come here!
I haven't come to see you
Alwa
Please get me Volume K of the dictionary
Very well. Come and see me tomorrow
Why don't you marry Lulu, Father?
One doesn't marry such women.
That would be suicide
What did she want?
She wants to be in variety. Someone wants to do a trapeze act with her
No trapeze! Use her in your revue.
My newspaper will guarantee its success
One thing more: beware of that woman
End of Act Two
Act Three
Nonsense! Wouldn't you rather do the trapeze act with me?
I'm not going on!
Bring her to her senses!
We'll do our variety act after all
I'll dance for the whole world, but not for that woman
Tell them to start
Where is Lulu?
Smoking forbidden here!
Satisfied, Alwa? Now I'll marry Lulu.
It will be the death of me
End of Act Three
Act Four
I'd be a right scoundrel if I didn't lay a rose on my little Lulu's bridal bed
Father, I'm going away tonight ... for a long time
He's my Father!
If only you'd come with me
I can't live without you any longer
You'll miss your train
Take it
Kill yourself!
Kill yourself, so you don't make me a murderer as well!
End of Act Four
Act Five
Your Honours. I have painted a picture of a tragic life
Members of the Jury.
Look at this woman
Have I not shown that this woman did not commit murder?
Her husband was the victim of tragic circumstances
Did not the son of the deceased speak in her defence?
No, this unfortunate is not a murderess.
You must acquit her, she is innocent
Your Honours. Members of the Jury
The Greek gods created a woman:
Pandora. She was beautiful, charming, versed in the art of flattery
But the gods also gave her a box containing the evils of the world
The headless woman opened the box and the evils were loosed upon us
Counsel for the Defence portrays the accused as a persecuted innocent
I call her Pandora, because she brought evil upon Dr. Schön
The arguments of the Defence do not sway me. I demand the death penalty
Prosecutor! Do you know what would have become of your wife if she had spent her nights as a child drifting around cafés?
... sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter with the four and a half months already served ...
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
End of Act Five
Act Six
Passport.: Alwa Schön
How dare you come here?
Where else can I go but home?
If you feel at home where my father bled to death ... I must leave!
Is that the District Court?
I want to speak to
Prosecutor Von Bodungen
This is Alwa Schön. Have you any news of the escapee?
We'll go away together. Countess
Geschwitz will lend me her passport
Passport.: Countess Augusta Geschwitz
I have the lady's baggage
"5,000 Marks Reward'
Received with thanks.
Marquis Casti Piani
Marquis Casti Piani
May I prove my friendship by giving you good advice?
Do not go to Paris, there are so many prying eyes. Come with me.
I know a place where people are hospitable ... and discreet
End of Act Six
Act Seven
Lulu has been living here for three months
A fine hotel. Hospitable and discreet
What's wrong? It's how we live
I've just got engaged. I'm going to stage a fantastic variety act with my fiancée
But we need 20,000 francs to stage it
You must give me the money
Ask Alwa, perhaps he has won today
If I could carry on playing
I'd win it all back
That boy gets everything
You should only play when you're sure of winning
How much?
300 pounds
The German police would give me 250 pounds
300, then. I'll go and book a cabin
He's acting as if he wants to buy me
I need money urgently. You can't give me any.
The Egyptian will pay me 50 pounds more than the German police. You're lucky
I'm securing your future.
The police will never find you in his
Cairo establishment
Get ready quickly.
You're leaving in an hour
I won't be sold. That's worse than prison
I need money. If you aren't ready in an hour I'm calling the police
Alwa, you must win, you must.
Otherwwise I'm lost
If I don't have the 20,000 francs by tonight I'll report you to the police
Money ... everyone wants money
Cry, my child, cry
Rodrigo will report me to the police.
Save me
I'll show him!
I know how we can all get out of this mess
Countess Geschwitz fancies you and she has money
Be nice to her, then I'm sure she'll cough up
Only you can save me
Rodrigo is madly in love with you
Throw yourself at him, he'll do anything for you. Otherwise, he'll report me
Calm down, you'll soon have your money
Police!
Police! Police!
Hurry! I'll find a boat!
We must find a ship to take us to London
End of Act Seven
Act Eight
We only take in order to give.
Brother, how can I help you?
No one can help me
It's funny how you can get booze on credit, but not bread
Why put on the paint?
We like you as you are
What a pity! I wanted to eat Christmas pudding once more in my life
Warning to the Women of Londonl
For some time now...
...a man has been trying to lure
women and girls to dark places...
...in order to murder them
Women and girls should not
go out alone at night
I have no money
Come on, I like you
You're under the mistletoe, you must let yourself be kissed

THE LAST COMMAND
Hollywood - 1928!
The Magic Empire of the
Twentieth Century!
The Mecca of the World!
To this Hollywood had come Leo Andreyev, a Russian director ...
"Every Russian in Hollywood is in that stack!"
Sergius Alexander
Claims to have been commanding general ...
... of Russian Army and cousin to Czar.
Little film experience --
Works for $7.50 a day.
"Have him report to work tomorrow morning ..."
"... and fit him into a General's uniform!"
"The Eureka Studio calling ..."
"Six tomorrow morning ... studio gate!"
The Bread Line of Hollywood.
"Quit your shovin'!
Who do you think you are?"
"One Corporal!"
"One General!"
"Quit shakin' your head!
How do you expect me to make up?"
"Excuse me, please ...
I can't help it ... I ...
I had a great shock once!"
"Where'd you get the gadget from ... steal it out of a hock shop?"
"The Czar gave it to me."
"What do you know about that? The Czar gave him this beautiful medal!"
"I'm your pal ... I want to show it to everybody ..."
Imperial Russia - 1917.
Proud, majestic, haughty ... seemingly eternal at the ages!
On a dozen far-flung battle fronts, Russia was engaged ...
... in a death grapple with the enemy.
Tireless in the defense of a crumbling empire was the ...
... Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, cousin to the Czar ...
... and Commanding General of the Russian Armies.
"Everything is in perfect order,
Your Imperial Highness ...
... There is no need for you to tire yourself with an inspection."
"The revolutionists have intercepted most of our supplies."
"Let him strut a little longer!
His day are numbered!"
"The days of all who are dragging Russia down are numbered!"
"Only a few weeks more ... but they seem an eternity!"
"We have waited too long to be impatient now!"
"You are ordered to report for passport examination in the morning."
"They are actors playing for the troops and their pasports are in order ...
... but our reports show they are revolutionists ..."
"... she is Natalie Dabrova, the most dangerous revolutionist in Russia!"
"Let's have them up!
He's dangerous enough ...
... and she's pretty enough ... to merit my personal attention!"
"The second time this week you've worn my coat and smoked my cigarettes!"
"If he does it again ...
... remove the coat and shoot the contents!"
"So you two are serving your country ... by acting!"
"A fine patriotic service... when Russia is fighting for her life!"
"Why aren't you in uniform?"
"My lungs are weak."
"Perhaps it is your courage that is weak!"
"It doesn't require courage to send others to battle and death!"
"Put him under arrest!"
"What is this man to you?"
"Nothing at all. He is Leo
Andreyev ... the director of the Kief Imperial Theatre."
"Orders from the General Staff,
Your Imperial Highness!"
"You will, of course, honor us with your company?"
The new Headquarters.
HIS MAJESTY THE CZAR
WILL VISIT YOUR HEADQUARTERS ...
... THIS AFTERNOON
TO INSPECT THE TROOPS
"Recall a division from the front ...
... His Majesty thinks the war is a parlor game."
"We can't spare a division... we need every man!"
"Don't argue! Have a division deloused and re-equipped... and send it here immediately!"
And so, with the flames of war crackling along ...
... a two-thousand mile front, troops bitterly needed ...
... to defend Russia played parade for the Czar.
"Your Imperial Highness, you are urgently needed to dispatch instructions!"
"The show will be over in a minute!"
"Russia relies on you, dear cousin."
After a week ... after thousands of men had spilled their blood...
... to defend a few inches of earth ... there came a lull between storms.
"Where is the lady?"
"I beg you to accept this expession of gratitude for your company."
"That sort of thing should always be done after caviar!"
"The General Staff,
Your Imperial Highness!"
"Hiss Majesty plans to visit the front tomorrow! ...
... It might be advisable to stage an offensive for him ...
... in the morning ... not too early!"
"My troops are not prepared for an offensive! ...
... I will not sacrifice them merely for the entertainment of the Czar!"
"That's what provides fuel for the revolution!"
"Can't you see the man is very ill?"
"I'll show you dirty revolutionary dogs!"
"Aren't you taking a terrific risk in defying the Czar's wishes?"
"I would take any risk to prevent a needless sacrifice."
"Then why do you continue this stupid war?"
"We must have victory! ...
... Defeat means revolution ... and the collapse of Russia!"
"Then you love Russia so much?"
"I would gladly die tonight ... if it would help Russia!"
"Before you die ... won't you at least have coffee with me ... in my room?"
"You are very beautiful!
One could easily fall in love with you!"
"Your hand is trembling!"
"Will you get me my cigarettes, please?
Yours are so strong!"
"Why didn't you shoot?"
"I don't know why
I didn't kill you ..."
"... I suppose it was because
I couldn't kill ... anyone ...
... who loves Russia as much as you do!"
"From now on you are my prisoner of war ..."
"... and my prisoner of love."
A group of obscure people meet to decide the fate of Russia.
"Train Number 476, carrying the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander ...
... and staff, has left for the front!"
"Communicate with our agents at once! Tonight Russia becomes a republic!"
"If we get the right news at the next station ...
... His Imperial Highness will long remember this ride!"
"His Imperial Highness will be here in five minutes! ...
... Let's give him the greatest reception he has ever had!"
"All out, Masters of Russia!
Last stop!"
"People of Russia... you are being led by traitors!"
"We have been slaves too long! Now we are the masters!"
"I'll be your servant just once more! ...
... I'll place the noose around your neck myself!"
"This is the end,
Your Imperial Highness ...
... It is our turn now!"
"Let's hang him in Petrograd... for all the world to see!"
"Look at him! ...
The greatest man in Russia...
... greatest even than the Czar!"
"Make him sweat as we have sweated! ...
... Make him stoke our train to Petrograd!"
"Would His Imperial Highness care for one of his cigarettes?"
"To the locomotive!"
"That woman belongs to me ... she goes with the coat!"
"Don't you understand?
It was the only way
I could save your life."
"I love you!"
"These pearls will pay your way out of Russia!"
"I love you!  I love you!"
And so the backwash of a tortured nation ...
... had carried still another extra to Hollywood.
"Get the extra people on the stage!"
"The director has an important part for you, Pop. You've got to look nice!"
"Is that beard supposed to be Russian? It looks like an ad for cough drops!"
"In Russia, that was worn on the left side. I know because I was a general."
"I've made twenty Russian pictures. You can't tell me anything about Russia!"
"Get me a whip!"
"I have waited ten years for this moment, Your
Imperial Highness."
"The same coat, the same uniform, the same man ...
... only the times have changed!"
"This is supposed to be a trench scene of troops just before a battle ..."
"You are the General in command!"
"The troops are tired of war ... tired of listening to our pretty speeches ..."
"One of them becomes violent ... you strike him with this whip!"
"We won't have to rehearse that scene ...
I know you can use a whip!"
"Music please ... the
Russian National Anthem."
"Wind machine!"
"Lights!"
"Camera!"
"What's the difference who wins this war? ... We're sick and tired of fighting ..."
"You've given your last command!
A new day is here!
Down with your Russia!
"People of Russia, you are being led by traitors ...
... we must win or Russia will perish!"
"The command is forward ... to victory ..."
"Long Live Russia!"
"Have we won?"
"Yes, Your Imperial Highness ... you have won!"
"Tough luck! That guy was a great actor."
"He was more than a great actor ... he was a great man."

The Unknown
This is a story they...
...tell in old Madrid...
...it's a story they say is true.
"You all know me...
...Antonio Zanzi... and my gypsy circus..."
"...and now, the sensation of sensations!
The wonder of wonders!
ALONZO, THE ARMLESS!"
"Assisting Alonzo in this...
...death-defying act, is my...
...daugter...NANON!"
MALABAR THE MIGHTY.
"You are right, Alonzo...
...brute strength does not...
...mean everything to all women".
"Alonzo, all my life men...
...have tried to put their beastly hands on me...
...to paw over me".
"I have grown so that I...
...shrink with fear when...
...any man even touches me".
"You are wise, Nanon.
Always fear them... always hate them".
"And remember...
...I am always near you...
...ready to help you".
"If it takes ten million years, Nanon...
...I will keep saying 'I love you'...
...until you believe me".
"No one will get her...
...no one but me!"
"See, Nanon! Eyes that adore you...
...hands that long to caress you...
...and strength to protect you!"
"Why do you always draw away from me?"
"Why isn't he different... 
...from other men!
Why doesn't he keep his hands of me?"
"Hands! Men's hands!
How I hate them!"
"Men! The beasts!
God would show wisdom if he took the...
...hands from all of them!"
"Forgive me, Alonzo...
...I did not mean you".
"You are the one man I...
...can come to without fear".
"She is with Alonzo again!
Are you afraid to deal with him?" 
"Putting crazy ideas in her...
...head again!
I'll settle this!"
"A thousand thanks, Malabar.
I will try to repay same day".
"You have Nanon in your heart,...
...haven't you?"
"In my heart... in my soul...
...in my blood!"
"You are fortunate.
You have arms...
...and strength that she loves".
"Go take her in your arms...
...and let her listen to the...
...song of your blood".
"Cojo... I said no one is going to have her!
No one but me!"
"There is a time for fear, Nanon...
...and a time for hate...
...and a time for love".
"You worry, Alonzo, that sometime...
...will find out you have arms?"
"What would the police give...
...to know I have hands...
...and who I am?"
"There they are, Cojo...
...and Zanzi may be another...
...to find how I have them".
"I have been waiting for you... to teach you...
...that my orders are law!"
"Stop them!
They've burned enough clothes to keep twenty...
...gypsy souls out of hell!"
"The same hands that strangled Zanzi...
...committed the robberies in other towns...
...where this circus played!
They're somwehere in this troupe!"
"Get your finger-prints taken!"
"What will happen, Alonzo...
...if they sell the circus to pay...
...my father's debts?"
"Do not worry, Nanon,...
...I promised your father I would...
...always take care of you".
"The circus has gone... every caravan.
Why did we not travel with them, Alonzo?"
"Because I want to take you...
...away from the things you hate, Nanon".
"I could not go away without...
...telling you again that I will...
...love you always".
"I am so sorry Malabar put his...
...hand on you again... so sorry".
"Cojo, did you see her?
She kissed me!"
"You must never let her touch... you that way again".
"She will feel that you have arms!"
"Cojo will never tell!"
"There is nothing I will not do to own her! Nothing... do you understand? Nothing!"
"You are a riddle, Nanon.
You shrink from me... yet you kiss my flowers when I am gone".
"Then if you do care for me, why won't you ever let me hold you in my arms?"
"I know now what you fear".
"Some day that fear will die.
You will find me near you always...waiting...loving hoping".
"Cojo, I've got to have her!
She has got to marry me!"
"No Alonzo! On your wedding night she would see your arms....and hate you!"
"No, Cojo....she would never hate me... she would forgive me".
"But you forget....she saw her father strangled by a hand with two thumbs".
"You are forgetting that you have arms!"
"No, no Alonzo! Not that!
Never do that!"
Leave the door to the operating room open and be there at midnight - alone.
Remember Algiero, 20 years ago!
"Why this letter... and who are you?"
"You're here to backmail me!
It's money you want!"
"Well....what is the price of your silence about my past?"
"And be careful that I do not die in this operation.... because I left a letter telling who you are".
"I am afraid any more, Malabar.
All my foolish fears are gone".
"You're recovering rapidly.
You'll be able to leave in a few weeks".
"But we must wait until...
...Alonzo returns.
I want him with us at our wedding".
"Perhaps the landlady knows where she is.
Go ask, Cojo".
"But it's strange I've never heard from Alonzo... not one word since he went away".
"The landlady says she is at that theatre on the plaza".
"You are thinner, Alonzo!
Have you been sick?"
"No not sick... but I have lost some flesh".
"How is Cojo?
You love him best of anyone, don't you?"
"No, Nanon... not best".
"I am happy you have returned
Alonzo, now we can be married".
"Oh... I forgot. You have been away.
I well call him".
"Has Nanon told you the good news,
Alonzo?"
"Remember how I used to be afraid of his hands?"
"I am not any more.
I love them now".
"Alonzo is laughing at the way everything has happened".
"I did what you told me, Alonzo.
I took her in my arms..."
"I'm all right now".
"It was just something in here that stung like the lash of a whip".
"They said you were rehearsing.
Is this your rigging!"
"See... I have a horse hitched to each hand and they pull in opposite directions".
"You see, when the horses are tugging he could not let go if he wanted to".
"It's very dangerous.
Suppose the treadmills broke or stopped suddenly".
"If that happens the horses would tear my arms from my body".
"Do not say that! You make Alonzo worry that something will happen to you".
"Do not worry, Alonzo...
Nothing will happen.
We have been rehearsing for weeks".
"I couldn't reach Nanon's robe.
Will you get it for me?"
So... for Alonzo there was an end Hate called Death... and for Nanon, an end to Hate... called Love.
"Malabar, if I live ten million years,
I'll always say, 'I love you.'".

THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK
The waterfront of New York
- the end of many journeys, the beginning of many adventures.
Miles of docks wait day and night for strange cargo - and stranger men.
Ships come in from the sea - tarrying a day or two in the endless journey from port to port.
These were the days before oil fuel made stoking a lady's job - when stokers earned their pay in sweat and coal-dust.
"Well, Bill! We brought the ol' barge in right on time!"
"Pick up that waste!
Nobody goes ashore till this hole is cleaned up!"
"This packet sails tomorrow morning."
"You've got one night ashore.
If any o' you muckers come back drunk, you'll do double shift!"
"He's the most even- tempered guy I ever knew - always sore!"
"He thinks we're goin' ashore to play marbles!"
The Sandbar, a cable's length from the wharf, has vanished now - wiped out by commerce and reform.
But that night it was wide awake and roaring.
Save his soul and money comes to Hymn-Book Harry
"Meet my husband!"
"Well, Andy! I guess you never expected to run across me here!"
Night and fog met the stokers coming ashore.
"Hey, Bill! That's no place to take a lady!"
"Come on, Bill. They'll take care of her!"
"Okay, Bill! Be a hero an' leave your pal!"
"But just remember Singapore - - an' recollect Shanghai!"
"Well, you gave me the air.
It's been three years - what did you expect me to do?"
"Take that out o' here - before you draw the police!"
"Get her a hot drink!"
"One hot toddy!"
"You're not goin' in there!
That's the only rag she had to her back!"
"So you're the guy that saved my life?"
"You could have saved yourself the trouble, an' let me die."
"All right! Make believe you died - make believe you're startin' all over again!"
"You left all that slush in the river, Baby. All you need is a good time!"
"I've had too many good times."
"You ain't never been out with Bill Roberts."
"Dry up before you catch cold!"
"Would you care?"
"Well, I might..."
"After a month in the stoke-hole,
I got no sympathy for anybody that wants to quit a swell world like this!"
"Throw yourself into them new rags an' give me a chance!"
"All right, Bill Roberts,
I'll give you a chance."
"Anyway, I can always make a hole in the water."
"Are you goin' to let me have a good time in my own quiet way - or must I take this place apart?"
"Thought you might want your tie - Bill."
"Pretty, ain't she?"
"You better take my tip - an' stay away from that dame!"
"Shove off, my lad! I want to talk with your lady friend."
"You may be big game aboard ship, but you're only an animal-cracker here."
"Gee, but you're strong!"
"I guess you've known a lot o' girls."
"I ain't braggin' about my love-affairs."
"I'm not braggin', either."
"Ever been married, Bill?"
"Say, who'd marry a guy like me?"
"Oh, I don't know.
A lot o' girls might."
"You ever been married, Baby?"
"Say, who'd marry a girl like me?"
"I've sailed the seven seas, but I never saw a craft as trim as you."
"I don't think it's fair of you to kid me."
"Say! What makes you think I'm kiddin'?"
"What did you ever do that makes you worse than me?
I'd marry you in a minute!"
"An' come to think of it,
I'll marry you right now!"
"You don't know Bill Roberts!
I'll try anything once!"
"Get me a parson - I'm goin' to get spliced to my girl friend!"
"Come back here, Bill - don't make a fool o' yourself!"
"Meet the bride!"
"I better get Hymn-Book Harry - before he wrecks the place!"
"I'm goin' to do right by our Nell!
I'm goin' to marry her - here an' now!"
"Do you think he can make you decent by marryin' you?"
"I don't know what to think, any more."
"Until I got married,
I was decent!"
"We'll give you a marriage you'll never forget!"
"Where's your license?"
"Are you goin' to queer our fun just because you got to have a little piece o' paper?"
"If you got to have a license,
Bill will get one first thing in the morning."
"Won't you, Bill?"
"Word of honor, Parson.
First thing in the morning!"
"Let the old fusser go!
I'll marry you."
"If any of you eggs know why these heels shouldn't get hitched, speak now or forever after hold your trap!"
"Does it mean that much to you?"
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God and in the face of this company -"
"- to join this Man, and this 
Woman, in Holy Matrimony."
"Matrimony is an honorable estate .... and is not to be entered into lightly -"
"Do you take this woman to be your wedded wife?"
"Will you love her, comfort her, honor her, and keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others
-- as long as you both shall live?"
"Sure, I will!"
"I will."
"Give me the ring."
"Here's mine - I hope it does you more good than it did me!"
"Here's your wages, Parson.
Easy come, easy go!"
"I expect you to bring me the license in the morning. 
Pay me then."
"What's the meanin' of this jamboree?"
"Oh, I thought I'd get married, and settle down."
"But how are you goin' to get rid of her?"
"Who says I want to get rid of her?"
"I know you, Bill Roberts!
You might fool her, but you can't fool me!"
"What lady threw that shoe?"
"You don't know what this means to me, Bill!"
"I'll be a good wife, Bill."
Morning.
"Got a match, Chief?"
"I s'pose you've forgot all about last night?"
"Wasn't you never young, Chief?
I was just havin' a good time!"
"I s'pose you've forgot about gettin' married, too."
"Chief, last night's over.
Today's another day!"
"Mebbe for you, but not for me.
That sock in the jaw will cost you your job!"
"One ship's as good as another,
Chief. Any port in a storm!"
"Get out o' here - or my husband will kill you!"
"Don't kid me!"
"Don't let Bill Roberts stand between you an' me - you know he ain't comin' back!"
"You're a dirty liar!
He is comin' back!"
"Rustle that stretcher - this guy's in bad shape!"
"You won't get nowhere keepin' your mouth shut!"
"I warned you! Now beat it
- while you got time!"
"I'm her husband."
"She didn't shoot him.
The kid wouldn't hurt a fly!"
"I shot him, an' nobody else is goin' to get the credit for it."
"I'm his wife. He gave me the air once too often!"
"Why didn't you say so before?"
"I didn't care - before."
"I hope you have better luck than me - - but I doubt it."
"I didn't figure on your comin' back to help me."
"You didn't need my help, Baby."
"Goin' away - Bill?"
"Sorry, Baby. Sailin' in an hour -
- I never missed a ship in my life."
"Could you give me a minute to - to get used to it, Bill?"
"I never even thanked you for pullin' me out o' the water."
"That's all right!"
"An' I never thanked you for them swell clothes you bought me."
"That's all right, too."
"An' I guess you expect me to thank you for bein' decent enough to make me your wife."
"Now listen, kid - you can't get me sore! I never did a decent thing in my life."
"I've always been like this.
There ain't no power on earth that could ever keep me ashore!"
"Why get serious about it, anyway?
You knew all I had was one night ashore - you knew I was just a dirty stoker!"
"You ain't so bad, Bill Roberts!"
"But it would have been kind o' funny if this had been on the level
- even for a couple o' months."
"Maybe if I ever stayed ashore for as long as a couple o' months
I'd get to like it."
"Get a move on, Bill.
Time's up!"
"So long, Baby."
"Well - goodbye - Bill."
"Come on out o' this - before you get into another mess!"
"I'll fix it for you, Bill.
You can't go to sea like this."
"What are you tryin' to  do
- bring me more bad luck?"
"Superstitious, are you?"
"The nerve of that dame - bawling me out after all
I done for her!"
"I could of told you before that she was no good
- like all females!"
"Lucky for you I happened along!
If I hadn't pried you loose, she'd of stuck like a barnacle!"
"Buck into it, you two!
I want steam, not talk!"
"I'll have you put in irons for this!"
"Where's my wife?"
"In jail, where she belongs."
"What's she in jail for?"
"Why don't you go to the
Night Court an' find out?"
"Thirty days. Next case!"
"You are charged with having in your possession clothes stolen from the Harbor Pawn Shop."
"How did you get them?"
"My husband gave them to me."
"Where is your husband?"
"He left me this morning."
"How long have you been married?"
"I was married last night."
"Thirty days. Next case!"
"Just a minute, Captain!
I'm her husband.
I pinched them duds myself!"
"Break in anywhere - take anything you want - - that's your idea, I suppose?"
"No, sir, I rung the bell!
But there wasn't no answer, so I helped myself."
"I see - man of importance
- no time to waste.
Just what was your hurry?"
"Well sir, I'm a stoker.
I only had one night ashore, an' I wanted to have a good time."
"Sixty days will slow you down.
Release the woman. Next case!"
"Sixty days ain't a long cruise,
Baby - an' it'll be my last one, if you'll wait.
"I guess I'd wait forever, Bill."
THE TREASURE
From the novel by R. H. Bartsch 
Adapted for the screen by W. Hennings and G. W. Pabst 
Director: G. W. Pabst 
First Act 
The house bell maker. 
Rebuilt in 1683 after the Turks were expelled from the country with the help of the Lord. 
What an odd guy you are, Svetelentz! 
... however, I hear secrets, while you hear nothing. 
Now there's a carefree boy! 
To Arno, the goldsmith, in the Himmelmayer house in Graz 
And that's me by name! 
We hereby inform you that we received your letter. My work is already so advanced that you may start yours. I have taken good note of your budget for the ornamentation work.  Please start to work without further delay. Awaiting its arrival, 
Balthasar Hofer, master bell maker in Marburg. 
Yes, it was terrible here. The Turks had plundered everyone ... 
At the time, there was nothing left of the homes but the columns and some foundations. 
Curiously, there are still rumors about a treasure that the 
Turkish Emperor's men had buried somewhere ... 
Look, Leni, when you the son of a wealthy farmer and expect a large inheritance, one does not sit with the homeless ... 
End of Act One 
Second Act 
Master, are you certain of these rumors about the location of the treasure? 
And if the treasure were in your own home? 
The diving rods must be cut a hazel bush in the spring or autumn, three days before the new moon, between eleven and midnight.
The most favorable months are September and December. You must select a branch that is one to two years old. The best bushes grow in the mountains, where the ore is. 
Yes, I have always traveled the world ... and when my work on the bell is completed, 
I will continue on my way! 
You know, Svetelenz is going to drive me completely mad... now he will try to persuade me that the treasure is here, in this house ... 
He is searching ... he knows where the treasure is ... 
I also know one ... 
The stones are silent ... 
What would you have the stones say? 
What is buried within you ... 
End of Act Two 
Act Three 
Master, did you know that there is a ghost going about in your house at night? 
Well, tonight ... 
He knows about the money ... 
What if Svetelentz was right ...? 
He must know things are hidden from us ... 
Master, believe me, it is gold ... 
It is you who should find the treasure, not him ... 
But not with a divining rod! No! 
I will discover the secret of this house by logical deduction... and then ... 
During the night ... 
A treasure dating from the Turkish presence should be hidden in the foundations ... because they are all that remain from that time. 
Let's leave it for today! And not a word to the master ... 
I found the treasure ... 
But the goldsmith knows about it... 
End of Act Three 
Act Four 
He must disappear.  He won't keep quiet ... 
Go and fetch him. 
Hey, you, get ready for work! 
We must get the stranger out of the house so we can unearth the treasure ... 
I will send him with Beate to the cellar for wine. He will not say no ... 
I have something to tell you ... 
Not now, he is listening to us ... 
Well, I'll go with her. 
End of Act Four 
Act Five
Let them have the treasure.  You have me ... 
The only reason I want the treasure is because I love you. 
Lady ... lady ... What if I surrender my share of the treasure for your daughter? 
... then all the gold remains with us. 
You belong to me, I've traded the treasure for you ... 
I found the treasure. 
I am not for sale. 
Arno ... let them have the gold.

Gold on Indian land! The Sioux tribes were given other reservation, and President Grant set a day when settlers might race for possession of the rich lands.
<b>By the President of the United States of America
Proclamation</b>
I Ulysses S. Grant,
President of the United States, do hereby make knowm
that the said lands acquired from the Sioux tribes,
will be available for settlement at and after the hour of o'clock ...
noon of the 25 day of June, 1887 and not before ...
In the middle of the seventies, ship of hope bore thousands of emigrants to seek the reality of their dreams in America.
Some sought happiness ... some only the horn of plently ... the chalice of ... the Unholy Grail ...
And from crowded eastern cities, civilization began pouring the overflow into the trackless immensity of the West.
Spring, 1876 ...
Old World blood began to fuse with Colonial strains ... and "westward the course of empire takes its way".
In the Black Hills of Dakota, the outriders of progress had set up a trading post at Custer.
" Gold! Gold ... I'm tellin' ye ... the mountains is just abustin' with it! "
" Sorry, Lucas, but we can't touch that land ... it's on the Sioux Reservation. "
" Where'd you strike it, Lucas? "
And then came the eager thud of hoofs and the creak of wagon wheels.
The start of an empire that was to be compounded from the peoples of the face of the earth!
Dan O'Malley had came from Ireland at a smile a minute pace.
♫ " All the way from Ireland ♫
♫ With a Swede named Squaarehead Joe ♫
♫ Bound to find Dakota ♫
♫ And my calico! "♫
" The wheel came off. "
" Oh, did it ? "
" Something ought to be done about it."
" You must have traveled a lot to know all those things."
" I can fix it. "
" Don't let me stop you."
" I'm Mayor Carleton of Virginia.
Suh ... this is my daughter Lee."
" My name and address is Dan O'Malley."
" We're on our way to the Dakota rush ...
With these race horses."
" Sure, an' you'll be needin'  speed that day!
Th' Dagoes are askin' Saint Anthony for wings ...
An' th' Irish who have 'em! "

" Bull " Stanley ...
Who lived day by day on pluck, powder and providence.
Mike Costigan and " Spade " Allen weren't exactly thieves ... but they had a habit of finding horses that nobody had lost.
" Chaw ? "
" Naw ! "
" Am I seein' things ... or is them million wagons on the square? "
" Pardner ... where-you all bound for? "
" Sufferin' coyotes ... yer don't mean t' say you ain't heard tell about gold in the Dakotas! "
" We're goin' to the Dakotas ... he may be there ... "
" It ain't gold I'm looking for ... but it's a man jest as yeller ..."
Hundreds of gold-mad men swarmed Custer, awaiting word to rush for the ore-ladened lands.
Sheriff Layne Hunter, running the mushroom town with a high hand; keeping his own lawless gang in cheek by a generous division of the spoils.
" Layne, please don't make me stay in there with those ... women ..."
" Just for tonight, Millie ... tomorrow we'll find a better place."
" A string of race hosses ... about fifteen miles back ... an' only two men herdin' them! "
" Thoroughbreds! "
" Why the low-down hoss-thieves! "
" Nothin' to it ... our businness is gettin' overcrowded."
" I have to goin' blind ...  fired three shots and only dropped two of 'em."
" By golly ... he's a woman! "
" Put them hosses back ! "
Hour by hour, thousand by thousand, the stampeders crushed into Custer, as the big day neared.
Zach Little ... Editor of the Custer " Pathfinder ", was half Scotch and half seltzer.
" They had a lot of touble takin' out Spud Taylor's appendix ... they had to kill him first. "
THE EMPORIUM
JOE MINSK
And still they come ... lured by the magic word ... Gold.
" You are a minister of the Gospel, Sir? "
" There's a minister in town, Layne ... now we can be married! "
" Parson ... this ain't exactly a Sunday School camp ... but they's some of us that'll be d...n glad you come along."
" Oh, bless these plows ... that they may make this wilderness blossom with the glory of God! "
" I'm Sheriff Hunter ... allow me ..."
" This lady's in my outfit ... if they's anything she needs, I'll 'tend to it! "
" Since when did the notorious
' Bull ' Stanley become so gallant ..."
"... And Mike Costigan! Every sheriff west of the Mississippi has asked me to welcome you! "
"... And 'Spade' Allen! Been shot at lately for card cheating? "
" I congratulate you, Miss ... on your selection of friends! "
" Come along, my 3 Bad Men ... it's time we were making camp."
" What you lookin' at ... hoss face? "
" They're dangerous men ... but I'll take care of them ... in my own way! "
Just outside the town ... a camp for the night.
" I'm mighty grateful to you men for helping me through."
" We couldn't see anybody robbed."
" No, sir, not us! "
" I'd like to hire you three, but I suppose you have business to attend to ..."
" To tell the truth, miss ...  our business ain't what it used to be."
" Then you're free ... for the moment? "
" Y.. y .. yes ... for the moment. "
" I ... I'm afraid I can't pay you any wages ... just yet."
" For the time bein', miss ...
I'll work for nothin'..."
"... and I know my pardners will ! "
"Oh, gladly!"
" Then you'll be my men? "
♫ " Gettin' near Dakota. Just rarin' for to go ...♫
♫ Feelin' very mighty happy,
'Cause I've seen my calico! " ♫
Morning found a wagon city on the edge of the town.
" I'm sorry about ... er ... yesterday, Miss Carleton."
" Drunk again ! "
" So are we ! "
" It's plumb low-down to do a thing like this ... an' her trustin' us! "
" I'm thinkin' three terrapins like us ain't fit to take care of a gal like her ..."
" What our gal needs is a husband! "
" Leave it to us! We'll find a marryin' man ... if we have to shoot him."
" So you're back again, Lucas? "
Brother, I have gone awug with the man I love.
Everithing is all right, as he has promised to marry me.
Lovingly, Millie.
Husband hunting ...
" Not a Chink ... they get shot too easy."
" Thirty two."
" Twenty eight."
" I've just reached manhood."
" Then you'd better reach again! "
" Sound as a dollar ! "
" Come on ... you ain't safe alone."
" If a man's heart is in the right place, it don't matter what sex he belongs to."
Dan sold his outfit and joined the stampede.
" You're mine now .... Hunter wanted to get rid of you and gave you to me."
" Ragamuffins! "
" Married? "
" Want a job? "
" I found a man ! "
" It's plumb unsafe for you to go ridin' alone that a-way."
" He's the new hired hand."
" But 'bull' ... I don't think we need any more help."
" Not so bad ..."
" Not so good ..."
" All right ... he'll do."
" Now let nature take its course."
" I hope he don't drink ..."
"... we don't want no soaks around here."
" I haven't seen your dad around
... Where is he? "
" Sheriff some of the better element ... are complaining about the way you run this town. "
" Listen, Rabbi ... Business is terrible! ...
Nobody buys a new suit even to be buried in. "
Cleanliness is next to Goldliness ...
That's why Saturday night comes before Sunday.
" You don't reckon she'll be wantin' us to take a bath, do you? "
" I'm a little nervous about it."
" Guard the tent."
" How about three fingers of bug juice?"
♫ " I'm here in Dakota I want the world to know ...♫
♫ Goin' to get a homstead.
Cause I found my calico! " ♫
" Do you like that tune, Miss Lee? "
" Having a nice time ? "
" You're goin' to tell me how to get that gold ! "
" Hunter, you've been takin' in too much territory... Now you're all through! "
" You bungling fool !"
" Hunter sent him to be make me tell the way to the gold land ..."
" ... my map won't do me any good now ... but it'll take you to where there's gold ! "
The night before the rush ....
Custer, an armed camp ... with "Bull" Stanley leading the revolt against Hunter.
... while in the little church the women pray ... for safety, today ...
Divine guidance tomorrow...
"... and as He led the children of Israel into the promised land, so He will lead us ..."
Knowing his danger, Hunter fans the flames of lawless abandon among his followers.
" Burn that psalm-singing preacher's shack! "
" Brother! Brother! "
" Brother! Brother! "
" Brother! "
" It's gettin' stuffy in here with all this smoke and love ... I'm leavin' !"
" We'll sneak across the line tonight and wait. "
" Millie! Little Sister! "
" Millie, who is ... the man? "
The Grand Land Rush!
Morning broke with the clatter of wagons ... the roaring, sweating, cursing, fighting mob scrambling ... for position in the line.
" It's time for you to start, Missy ... you've got a long, hard ride ahead ..."
" I'm ready when you are, 'Bull'! "
" Mike and 'Spade' will take care of you ...
I've got to look for someone else."
" Please, 'Bull'... I need you. "
On the line! Ready for the dot of twelve ...
And the race for land and gold.
