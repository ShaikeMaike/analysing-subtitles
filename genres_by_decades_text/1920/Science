RUSClCO Company presents a new project: the first in the national history film in a fantasy genre by Yakov Protazanov, "Aelita" , based upon Alexei Tolstoy's novel of the same name.
The film is released with frame-by-frame cleaning of the picture and in a new musical arrangement using the works of composers
Alexander Skryabin,
Igor Stravinsky and Alexander Glazunov.
On December 4, 1921 , at 18:27 European Standard Time, all the radio stations on Earth received a strange message.
Anta... Odeli... Uta...
Anta... Odeli... Uta...
Anta... Odeli... Uta... ln charge of the Moscow radio station was engineer Los (N.M. Tseretelli).
Pass it immediately to the bureau of deciphering.
At the evacuation center of the Kursky
Railway Station.
Among the employees of the center was Natasha, engineer Los' wife.
Red Army soldier Gusev (l.P. Batalov) arrived from the front for recuperation.
The deciphering bureau failed to make out the mysterious radio.
- Couldn't it be a radio from Mars to our inventors?
Los' close friend and colleague - engineer Spiridonov (N.M. Tseretelli)
Anything's possible! Perhaps they on Mars got worried about you and me!..
Come here, happy newlywed.
Your wife is calling again. l can leave earlier today.
Come and meet me.
Anta... Odeli... Uta... 18-27
All Los' brain power and energy have been devoted to one task - to the trip to Mars, and in his imagination he often pictured...
Aelita the Queen
(Yu.l. Solntseva). lkhoshka, Aelita's favorite servant
(A.F. Peregonets ).
Tuskub the Ruler (K.V. Eggert).
Gor, keeper of the planet's energy
(Yu.A. Zavadsky).
A model of the apparatus built by Gor for observing the life on other planets. lt's a great discovery, but let it remain a secret... for everybody!..
Show me other worlds...
No one will know about it.
All right... ln the evening l'll meet you at the tower of radiant energy... ln the evening
Only to you l'll show the life on a neighboring planet.
Time to go back.
Tuskub may come and see us.
Touch my lips with yours, like humans do... on Earth.
Spiridonov spent all evenings at his friend's place, working with him on building a spaceship to fly to Mars. lf only we could find the source of energy that would overcome
Earth's gravity!..
From the first day Gusev had become the infirmary's favorite.
Nurse Masha (V.G. Orlova)
"Love me or not, honey!.."
" A soldier got no money!.." ln 1921 the railways had no lack of passengers.
Comrade Erlikh and his wife, Yelena
We don't provide quarters.
Go to the women's section.
You're so...
Get out of here!
What the cheek!
Victor, l have the address of an old acquaintance... Let's give it a try!..
That day they were distributing food rations at the evacuation center. l'm not angry... about the past,
Yelena. lntroduce me to him as your brother.
White bread...
Victor Karlovich Erlikh
Who's that character writing to you?
You're so charming that l cannot believe you would be so cruel to me...
You're jealous, aren't you?
The food Erlikh brought made it possible to have a feast that was rare for Moscow, and remember "the beautiful past" .
What the hell! lt's sour, this wine! l remember the wine we had before...
Oh!.. Before, all human relationships were so sensitive, delicate...
Yes... Before we had order...
The days went on... Los stubbornly continued his experiments.
After each failed experiment,
Los went on dreaming...
Anta, Odeli, Uta
Excuse me!.. l'm the Chairman of the House Committee, l do my duty.
You'll have to vacate your laboratory for a new tenant.
You know, we have met before.
Do you remember?..
This is Erlikh, our new tenant.
At the evacuation center, an active preparation for a show was going on.
Join us... We're having such fun!
Yelena was successfully carrying out her husband's instructions.
On the day of the show, Natasha received a food ration at the club.
As a Soviet functionary,
Erlikh was doing fine.
To Mr. Pavlov - one sack of sugar. l've brought sugar... We must hide it!
Hurry!.. l told you we could pluck that goose.
The evacuation center's people decided to outdo the academic theatres.
Comrade Gusev is our chief assistant director.
The chocolate is real! l have to go home. l got a lot of work.
At the distribution center, an unpleasant discovery was made.
The center's manager went for help to the Chief of the Criminal lnvestigation. lnvestigate it and, if necessary, search Erlikh's apartment. l've got talent. By God, l've got it... l'll prove to you!
Citizen Kravtsov, l repeat it again: l'm not hiring you. l believe you're incompetent.
For the lndian ink, it was necessary to go to Spiridonov.
Got tired, comrade?... l sympathize. l sympathize with you very much. l know everything... l found it in your coat's pocket...
You're lying. You're lying all the time!..
The night seemed agonizingly long after that first quarrel.
Would you like to go to a ball and have fun in spite of all the comrades?
To engineer M.S. Los.
The administration of Volkhovstroi thanks you for almost a year-long work...
Will you go?
Kravtsov decided to investigate on his own the case of the lost sugar.
The meeting place of "businessmen" ...
All tickets are sold out.
You'll make good money!
What a miser! ln a whole week, just one medallion!..
Each reminder of the mysterious radio made his fantasy work with a new force.
For many days now Aelita could not see Earth and...
Today is the meeting of the elders.
No one will know if you go to the tower.
How dare you hide from me the apparatus built by Gor?!
You're a queen, but we're the rulers.
The tower will remain closed.
So, by the decision of the elders, a third of the living workforce is put into cold storage for keeping.
All the workers - the population toiling for the " elders" , never left their dungeons.
The first third to the cold storage!
The first third!
Are you avoiding me, Aelita?..
Your thoughts are occupied with an Earthman..
Wait for me here. l'll come out to you.
Martians were not alien to a feeling of jealousy...
You're in love with an Earthman.
You will never see him! l'm leaving with you all the designs of my "interplanetonef" .
Save them. This is the work of my life.
Are you going alone?
How about Natasha?!
Natasha was impatiently waiting for her husband...
Let's go to the ball. There'll be a most select society there. l'm sure your husband won't mind.
Let's go!.. To spite him!..
Let's have fun!
Anta, Odeli, Uta lllegal ball of the " select society" .
The ball's organizers talked Natasha into having supper with them. l thought you were at the station seeing off your husband going on a trip.
My ravishing, my dear.
Stay at least for half an hour.
Well, a quarter of an hour. l have to leave today. l regret l couldn't say goodbye to you. l may be on this business trip for a long time. Yours, L.
The only joy for Los was the realization that he, too, could take part in the great work of building the new Russia.
Slowly, yet inevitably, life was taking its normal course, and there was less and less work at the evacuation center...
Allow me to go and see off this torturer...
Moscow. March 3, 1922. lt's been over 2 months since your departure, and in this time you've sent me only 3 postcards. lf it's the end...
Krasnopresnensky District
SOVlET
MARRlAGE
REGlSTRY OFFlCE
With the evacuation center closed,
Natasha went to work in a kindergarten.
Los' business trip was coming to an end.
To engineer M.S. Los.
The administration of "VOLKHOVSTROl" thanks you for your 6-month work.
Dear friend! lt's been 2 months now since l left Russia... for good. l feel ashamed to admit it, but the ways and habits of the past proved stronger than me... l hid your designs in the fireplace in your room, where...
And the dream took hold of him again. ln his dreams Los disguises himself as Spiridonov. lt's strange... He hasn't showed up for two months, and today he appears as though he fell from another planet.
The new crime was promising new laurels for Kravtsov.
A suspicious character.
We must found out who he is.
At one of the out-of-the-way outskirts of Moscow.
Kravtsov at his work.
Don't touch it! By this glove l'll find the criminal.
The absence of foreign and home fronts, as well as the enforced inaction, burdened Gusev. l can't do nothing! l've established four republics, and now l'm going sour here...
Hot on the trail. l'm arresting you on a charge of...
Do you have a warrant?!
About the flight... l'll go with my great pleasure!...
Think it over, comrade. lt's a lot of risk and very little profit...
The heights l'm reaching! l'm flying to Mars tomorrow!
On the eve of the flight, the last workers were let to go home.
Next morning Moscow was celebrating one of the great Revolution days.
Where a good detective cannot ride, he will walk.
Five minutes before the flight.
- We're flying! We're flying!
Engineer Spiridonov, you're under arrest for unauthorized return to the RSFSR and murder of engineer Los' wife.
Some Pinkerton! Couldn't tell a false beard and a wig. ln that case... Engineer Los, you're under arrest for... living under someone else's disguise.
This projectile is coming from Earth!
The observatory will fix the time and place of the projectile's fall.
The aliens from Earth must be destroyed.
You must not do harm to the aliens from Earth.
They'll be destroyed! We won't let the plague of earth mutiny onto Mars! l know the time and place of the projectile's fall.
The " elders" did not leave, waiting for the Observatory's report.
Hurry to meet the guests from
Earth and bring them to me.
The moment indicated by Chief
Astronomer was nearing.
Comrades, are you from the militia?..
A man here must be arrested.
May l introduce myself? Commander
Gusev from the Budyonny Cavalry.
Tuskub! Tuskub!
This is an Earthman!
Comrade Tuskubov, allow me, by my mandate, to arrest the criminal Los who arrived on your territory.
Touch my lips with yours, like you do it on Earth...
Do you recognize this necklace,
Tuskub?!
"Love me or not, honey!.."
" A soldier got no money!"
You're mine! We'll be ruling over everybody here together!
Never! Never will l forgive myself for raising my hand against you!
Aelita, on the " elders'" orders, this Earthman is under arrest.
The free speech of free men has won over the " elders'" thousand-year hypnosis.
Comrades! Only you can help yourselves!
We had the same situation.
Everything began with...
October 25, 191 7
...following our example, comrades, form one working family of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics of Mars. l'm with you! l will lead you! l don't believe her... lt's not for the masters to make revolutions!
You've got power.
Lay down your arms, you will never need them again on Mars.
Victory! The troops are on our side!
Open fire on the insurgents!
Drive them back to the dungeons! l alone will reign and rule now!..
ANTA, ODELl, UTA
Buy tires by
ANTA, ODELl, UTA
Buy tires by
ANTA... ODELl... UTA!!
We're exposing the mysterious radio - it's our tires trademark.
We're going to the Far East Front.
Our train will be in an hour.
And l've been dreaming again...
Half an hour ago l killed my wife...
But l'm not running away, no... l'll go back to her...
We can't leave the man like that.
He may need help! l was insane when l was shooting at you... l'll be thanking providence all my life for having missed.
Do you still have any doubts?..
No, l believe you... Forgive me.
By the order of a court investigator, you're under arrest.
Enough of dreaming. A different, real work is awaiting all of us!

 El golem (1920) [ESP] sub spanish (this one is more stable).avi 681MB (714,752,000 bytes)
 which is re-encoded by me using VirtualDub ;)
 for the original one is a bit unstable when playing.
 and because the original file contains the audio data half as much as the video data
 when re-encoding, i used its audio data twice.
after all, this is a silent movie. u may never notice that ;) script :
 from another divx which is English subbed.
 and i added some which are not included in the English subbed divx
 by Babel translator. i don't know Spanish :)
so if you are good at Spanish, you'd better correct this sub.. author : feel_you (http://back.to/nineteen) tool : CCMP comment : 
 you can get this movie's script at http://www.monstrula.de/ or http://www.geocities.com/classicmoviescripts/.
 this sub. is made with the text of another divx above
 for there's no crucial difference between it and script at web.
 this movie Der Golem has two versions: the one made in 1915 and the other 1920
 and the divx above is the one made in 1920 not 1915.

Soon after its premiere, the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made.
From that time onward, more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost.
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved was, however, a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to 16mm film stock, lacking the full frame of the picture's original aspect ratio.
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material.
Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards.
In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative, the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black.
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment.
Those titles which appear in a different typeface (like the one used here) have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline.
Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader.
This film was produced by Ufa and is distributed courtesy of Parufamet.

Epigraph:
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
Shift change.
Deep beneath the earth lay the
City of the Workers.
As deep beneath the earth as the City of the Workers lay, so high above it towered the complex known as the "Sons' Club", with its lecture halls and libraries, its theatres and stadiums.
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold, had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?
Look! These are your brothers!
Look - !
These are your brothers!
Who - was that?
But this was what happened to Freder - the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis - as he sought out the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel - to my father - !
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion from my son, and not from you - !
Details - !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls, Freder?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...
Your magnificent city, Father - and you the brain of this city - and all of us within the light of this city... -
...and where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city - ?
Off where they belong...
...off where they belong...?
...in the Depths...?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, - with an important message...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...
...in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine...
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages...
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you? -
It means: To be sent below! -
Father - below! Into the Depths - !
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...
Into the Depths, - to my brothers...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son's every move...
Brother...
...the Machine! There needs to be someone at the Machine!
There will be someone at the machine...
ME.
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Wait for me - both of you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
In the middle of Metropolis, there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked.
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang, the inventor.
Hel
Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind.
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
A mind like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget...
Only one time in life did I forget something: that Hel was a woman - and you a man...
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen - for me she lives - !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?!
Do you wish to see her - ?!
Now, Joh Fredersen - ?!
Isn't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future - the Machine-Man - ?!
24 more hours of work - and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!
And what brings you my way,
Joh Fredersen?
I need your advice - as usual, when all my experts fail me...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers?
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...
Father - ! Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ??! !
- it's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Come! Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!
...but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel.
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising.
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others.
The same language was spoken, but these men did not understand one another...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
And where is our Mediator,
Maria - ?
Wait for him!
He will surely come!
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer - !
Oh Mediator, have you finally come...
You summoned me - here I am!
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman...
I shall sow discord between them and her!
I shall destroy their belief in this woman -
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...
You fool! Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel... your son...
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches:
"Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which it is written:
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, having a golden cup in her hand.
And upon her forehead was a name written, a mystery:
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother of Abominations ofthe Earth.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe Saints."
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen - him and his city and his son - !
GLUTTONY
AVARICE
PRIDE
LUST
ENVY
ANGER
SLOTH
Had you come earlier, you wouldn't have frightened me...
I now beg of you: stay away from me and my beloved...!
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing?
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Would you please wake Georgy up?
He must lead me to the Workers' City at once...
No. 11811, get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it - understood?
I have to have someone who's faithful to me, Josaphat, - otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal of my path - ?!
I must go on, Josaphat, - must now, on my own, seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me...
Tonight, Josaphat - tonight when I come back...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
So, what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight?
You still don't seem to have grasped who sent me here...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn't want his son to find you still here tonight!
In three hours' time
I shall be calling for you!
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine your face!
Where is Maria - ?!
She's with your father...
I'm telling you, she is with your father - !
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed!
Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred.
You shall see her dance, and if only one single person recognises the machine in her,
I will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything!
C. Rotwang"
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!
All Seven Deadly Sins, on her behalf - !
Death overtakes the City - !

Avalun Publishing, Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire...
But for ten days your father's bloodhound has been making the Workers' City unsafe...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them...
Even stranger things have been happening, Freder...
On that evening when you fell ill...
...once the best of friends... because of that woman...
...the other man... on that same evening...
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned... but night after night in Yoshiwara...
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped...
...is also called Maria...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint - ?!
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold.
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion...
Whatever happens tonight: it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them...
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you talked about peace, Maria... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator!
You know I've always talked about peace... but your Mediator hasn't come...
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come - !
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!
Your clone does not obey his will - only mine alone!
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis - ?!
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow - ?!
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh - ?!
Let the machines starve, you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !
Do them in - these machines - ! !
You aren't Maria - ! ! !
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !
Maria talks of peace, not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !
Joh Fredersen's son - ! !
Do him in, the dog, in his white silken hide - ! ! !
Get your women, your sons, out of the Workers' City!
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines - ! ! !
In the attic of his home,
Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen:
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers - and is in love with you - !"
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.
On the other side of the attic's window,
Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.
Maria is free.
...faithful after all...
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.
Women and men, let no-one miss out on today - !
Death to the machines - ! !
Not one man - not one woman has stayed behind - !
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !
To the Heart-Machine - !
DANGER
Open the gates!
You have to open the gates!
If the Heart-Machine perishes, nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing - ! !
Have you lost your minds - ??
If the Heart-Machine perishes, the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste - ! !
Where are your fathers, your mothers?
Do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers?!
Yes - you! You're Maria - !
To the air shafts - quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning - !
We'll take the children to the Sons' Club!
Why are all the lights out?
I need to know - !
Where is my son?! ! !
Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation:
Joh Fredersen, where is my son - ?!
Where are your children??!
The city is drowned, the shafts are totally flooded - ! !
Who bade you attack the machines, without which you're finished, you idiots - ??!
It's the witch's fault - !
We'll be looking on as the world goes to the devil - !
Find the witch; this is all her fault - !
Strike her dead - ! !
Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel - !
The witch - ! the witch - !
There she is - ! there she is - !
Where are our children, you witch, you - ??!
Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her! ! !
To the stake with her - ! !
Hel - ! My Hel - ! !
Your children... saved - ! ! !
Head and hands want to join together, but they don't have the heart to do it...
Oh Mediator, show them the way to one another...

Here, overlooking the city, is the mansion of Claire Lescot, famous singer, and unusual woman 
Her riches release her from ordinary illusions. Claire Lescot has a kind of "international" salon, where she meets this afternoon with notable personalities of the world. 
The fantasy of that curious artist, a famous clown, an academic, a former minister a boxer, an industrialist, and a poet come together here pell-mell 
... with Frank Mahler, a great businessman (Kellerman).  
Kranine, "the Apostle", with his theory of the "humanitarian" 
... a practitioner of despotism, the maharajah Djorah of Nopur ... 
Philippe Hériat 
Among all those fans of Claire Lescot, the queen, there is a hidden rivalry... 
Each dreams of attracting this famous woman to himself. whose triumphs have not reduced loneliness. 
Concert ... the protests 
The return of Claire Lescot threatens to make much noise. The upcoming marriage of the singer to Frank M.lh.r was just announced.  He "merely" has twelve important theaters in the United States. 
This announcement, and the strange maneuvers precipitated it, would have upset certain rivals of the ambitious artist. 
And it could be that her recital tomorrow night will be enriched with an unexpected chorus of protests. 
At last!... Claire .... 
Even her close friends call her "The Inhuman Woman" 
Georgette LeBlanc 
In this small court of powerful international people where can be heard the most secret things... 
... the servants wear a judicious mask to make them deaf to what is said ... and always smiling. a final guest is late ... Claire decides not to wait for him. 
The late one ... 
... a young engineer, passionate about mechanical sports and the magic of modern science ... 
Einar Norse ... 
Jaques-Catelain
Claire, with her glory, her power, her mystery, deeply impresses this young fan... does he dare enter ... so late?
Yes, after my two concerts, I resolved to leave. I will take a trip around the world alone. 
... unless something detains me here ... 
SOMETHING 
Anything? 
WHAT? 
.. SUCCESS ... 
.. LOVE ... 
The unexpected ... 
She will go! He must speak to her this evening .. what would keep her there! 
Why this world tour? Why not go to America? There you may do as you please.  I offer you all my theaters. 
NO ... thanks ... I am not interested in what I conquer! 
Concerned about Claire's departure, "The Apostle" also proposes 
The wheel of society is always turning. 
For a woman of action such as you, what could be better than the PROGRESS OF HUMANITY 
... our movement is going forward in Mongolia. Imagine what role you could play ... there. 
I am not interested in humanity; I just want exceptional love. 
While Claire had provided for entertaining distractions 
Djorah ... himself ... 
... A "crown"? 
... I'm not dead yet! 
... Kill me first! 
Waiting ... 
Claire's indifference has exasperated the impatient Einar ... 
I do not want you to leave 
... because I ... you they are playing with fire ... 
I am tired of fighting ... of arguing with you ... I need your strength 
... you ... for myself alone
... if you refuse... 
... I will kill myself! 
If you can destroy your life so easily, it is not worth very much. 
Claire's irony increased Einar's desperation. 
SOMEONE SAID ... that our great singer Cl. r. Le.c.t has finally accepted the Indian crown that a charming maharajah offered her. 
Without you this world is hateful to me ... a blow in one will throw me into the other. 
Without you this world is hateful to me ... a blow in one will throw me into the other. a little farm girl, an "innocent" one... 
It is - already - the morning ... Claire has just learned ... 
... The search was in vain.  The body has been lost in the water ... 
This evening
 - Claire Lescot -
Vocal Recital 
Modern Music 
... She will not sing, I think, after that! 
News 
He loved the beautiful, too ... 
... and that is what has killed him.
Einar Norse, a young engineer who, yesterday afternoon, left Claire's house, was found dead, after crashing his car down a fatal slope. 
... "the Apostle" was excited for playing his part in the downfall of someone who frustrated his personal ambition. 
Punish this creature who insults humanity ... return, this evening, to her show. 
Tauberger Theater Director 
Champs Elysees 
Unable to sing tonight reimburse box office from personal income 
Claire Lescot 
This renunciation of her singing, due to social conventions imposed Claire, created a cruel hesitation but the reason for her rebellion against her sadness ... was it a betrayal of her duty to serve her art?  Must she disappoint those who expect her to perform? for fear of the murmurings ... of cowardice before the sentimental hypocrisy of humanity? 
Rumor has it that you will not sing this evening ... Is this true? ... 
... it is wrong ... I will sing this evening ... ... 
Everywhere, little by little, the slander curiously spreads. 
News 
He loved the beautiful one too much ... and that is what has killed 
Einar Norse, a young engineer who, yesterday evening, left Claire's house, was found dead (voluntarily, they say), thanks to a fall down a fatal slope. 
This Lescot, what an outrageous life! 
She should be locked up! 
A young engineer commits suicide for an artist. 
She shouldn't receive any forgiveness ... a woman without a stomach! 
BY THE AFTERNOON 
... The audience is large, shaken by the tragedy ... the scandal among the last to arrive 
The ballet is going to end.  The room is crowded 
After a brief intermission, Claire appears 
Now a curious noise greeted Claire's entry
Suddenly Kranine attacked 
The entire room is passionate - feverish - for or against this "inhuman" woman ... 
... to boldly hold her head up... 
... and achieve such a triumph and while the room is emptying 
No ... not for anyone! 
I would like to speak to you .. in another place - of Einar Norse ... 
They just found his body horribly mutilated ... to legally identify the body, two witnesses are required 
Please be the second witness ... in your home ... tomorrow ... at seven ... 
Towards the strange laboratory where Einar Norse's body lies ... at the appointed time 
Claire ... fainting from shock ... 
... unexpected music ... hateful ... in this tortured atmosphere, Claire is increasingly ... excited ... haunted ... suddenly the wind ... when she finally leaves to discover the Secret of her immense human suffering ... suddenly please excuse this ... mysterious ... 
At the top ... No: 
I did not leave your home to die, but, clearly, I remembered your saying
If you can destroy your life so easily, it is not worth very much. 
And then I wanted them to think me dead in order to make you know - even more strongly KNOW - what you hid ... 
You do not know anything! 
I know you're here! 
And that if not for this, you would never have come here! 
Yes! I know something more ... or here some thing is going to make you abandon your trip. 
While, unarmed, Claire smiled at this mystery, down below, Djorah ... 
Beware! 
This device is dangerous ... 
DANGER OF DEATH 
Until tomorrow ... here ... to KNOW? 
The prince's jealousy exasperates him ... 
Claire wants to be alone, her spirit surprisingly obsessed 
All this magical science at Einar's home attracts Claire so unexpectedly, like something as strong as love. 
At the scheduled time at the home of the wise "enchanting" modern 
THE WORLD IS HERE 
See ... Why leave? 
It is enough for you to just sing here in front of the microphone. 
And while the TSF radio voice will broadcast your voice everywhere, on the same waves, by a new process, the image of your listeners will come back. 
On this television screen you will be able to see, while you sing, the people who listen to you all over the earth. 
She travels without moving through space 
... across the joy and pain of people ... 
She forgets the time ... 
... And my concert! ... it is appalling ... 
And spectators in front of the theater 
Yes ... it is a new device attached to the one where you had to burn yesterday, and produces a force of unexpected effects. 
... perhaps it is possible to revive the movements of a heart, heal humanity from death, but I have not dared to experiment on anyone. attention ... The machine ... ... 
Will you be at home this evening ... after the theater? 
But ... yes. 
The concert is over 
I forbid you to go there. take care ... you will not arrive there alive

And now the great laboratory beats with activity ...

I want your legal advice. Profesor
Challenger threatens to sue my paper... for doubting his yarn about live dinosaurs.
FAMOUS ZOOLOGISTS RETURNS FROM SOUTH
AMERICA WITHOUTH PROOFS OF STRANGE TALE
Profesor Challenger, well-known author and scientist, has returned to London...
...with a strange tale of Mammoths,
Pterodoctyls and other prehistoric monsters...
...roaming at large somewhere on the upper reaches of the Amazon. Unfortunately...
...for the professor's reputation for veracity, he refuses to give the exact location of his alleged...
...discoveries, and still more unfortunately, the photographs in his possession are so badly damaged...
(when the Professor's canoe is said to have been overturned)
...that they certainly cannot be acepted...
...as evidence in this case.
I believe Challenger is insane!
He nearly killed three reporters
I sent to interview him today!
Mr. McArdle, couldn't you send me on a dangerous assignment?
All I need is an opportunity -
You seem very anxious to lose your life!
Have you been interviewing
Challenger, Malone?
Don't apologize - hurry over to Zoological
Hall and cover Challenger's lecture.
Reporters are barred
- but get in!
There's Sir John Roxton
- famous hunter and explorer.
He's here to check up on
Challenger's cock-and-bull story.
Well, Malone, we're in for a lively session tonight.
- the students are out in force to heckle old Challenger.
Challenger has made himself a public laughing
- stock by his tale about live dinosaurs!
What can he hope to gain by such lies?
The back country of the
Amazon contains over...
...fifty thousand miles of unexplored water-ways.
Who can say what may be living in that jungle - as vast as all Europe?
But how can Challenger's story be true?
These creatures have all been dead ten million years!
You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.
Reporters are barred-
...if I show my press pass I'll get kicked out. I wonder if you -
Gladly - I'll take you in on my pass.
That's profesor Summerlee, the eminent coleopterist.
- owing to lack of proofs, this
Society cannot sponsor Profesor...
...Challenger's statement, but is glad to afford him this opportunity to state his case, and, we trust, clear his name.
Bring on your mastodons!
Bring on your mammoths!
I will - if any of you spineless worms are brave enough to go back with me...
...into the trackless jungles where these monsters live!
I told you old Challenger is sincere!
And I'm not here tonight to defend my statements - but to demand that...
...a committee be formed to go back to the Lost World with me -
Looks like a riot.
It's a beastly shame!
When dealing with undeveloped minds,
...it is useless to appeal to reason
- for they have none!
I am calling for volunteers!
Volunteers to face death - or worse
- for the sake of science.
I am sixty-seven years of age - but, because I think you are a liar and a fraud -
I accept your challenge, sir!
Accepted! Better an old fool - than a young coward!
I'm neither a student nor a scientist
- but I'd like to be counted in on this!
My friend, Sir John Roxton!
Accepted!
Your record as a hunter of big game will add weight to your testimony - if we return!
Professor Challenger,
I'd like to go on this expedition!
Probably the brain of a child
- but the body of an athlete.
Accepted.
What is your name?
Edward E. Malone -
And your occupation?
I- I'm a-a-er-a reporter, sir.
London-Record Journal.
Take me home - I've had enough of this!
Eleven Enmore Park, Kensington, West!
Professor Challenger, I've got to go on this expedition! The girl...
...I'm engaged to won't marry me until I've faced death or -
This man attacked me!
Do you give him in charge, sir?
No. I was to blame.
I intruded upon him.
Now, sir, can't we talk this expedition over sanely?
Sir John Roxton is a friend of mine-
Why didn't you mention that before?
You've hurt another nice young man!
I saw you from the dining room window!
If my husband gets abusive again - just call me!
You betrayed a glimmer of intelligence just now while talking to the policeman-
Sit down!
Do you want to join this expedition because you believe my statements are true?
Austin!
Tell Miss White
I wish to see her at once!
Have you shown Malone - the diary?
Property of Maple White?
BRONTOSAURUS
Miss Paula White - daughter of poor Maple White - the unfortunate explorer whose notebook you hold in your hands.
Miss White was her father's trained assistant.
She will tell you why she came to me.
I was in camp with jungle fever when my father...
...went up to explore that terrible plateau.
Carnivorous beast Allosaurus.
Evidently already almost externet even lea for I saw few of they.
A Living Brontosaurus
You mean that you actually saw living descendants of these monsters...
...that are supposed to have been dead for millions of years?
Yes, they were tremendous in size and ferocity.
Our bearers were so terrified they deserted-
...carrying me back to the coast - leaving my father...
...marooned up there - with those beasts -
He would go
- in spite of what we had - seen.
My husband promised to raise funds for a rescue party - but instead of...
...getting people to help him, he throws them out of windows and things!
Why, this is a great
human interest story -
And even if my paper was not convinced of the scientific value of your statements -
...it might finance a rescue party provided that the exclusive publication rights-
I'll swear not to send an article back to my paper without your full approval, sir!
If Sir John Roxton will go with me -
I believe we can make my managing editor see this thing!
I'm sure you know why I am going on this rescue party, Paula - don't you?
LIVERPOOL
AMAZON RIVER
I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our voyage.
Eventually we found ourselves in that no-man's-land...
...which is formed by the half-defined frontiers...
...between Peru,
Brazil and Colombia.
The sealed map we promised Challenger to not open untill we arrived here is only...
...a blank page.
Excepting a miracle, our expedition seems to have come to a premature end.
May I come in?
From henceforth
I take command of this expedition.
Let it be clear that you are all perfectly helpless without me!
If that mischievious beast is to go with us,
I remain behind!
Jocko knows which berries and roots in the forest are edible, and which are poisonous...
- he will be far more use to us than you, my dear sir!
RECORD
EXPLORERS REACH LAST
OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
Record-Journal Party Searching for Lost Scientist to Make Way into Mystery World via Secret Rivers.
MAY NOT BE HEARD
FROM AGAIN FOR MONTHS
It's a Brazilian sloth - they always walk head downward. See the baby clinging to her?
Dear Mr. McArdle: It is three weeks since we sent back the canoes...
...and tonight we are camping at the base of the great plateau upon which...
...Maple White was marooned.
Challenger has guided us to this spot, and proven that...
...the Plateau is a fact -
...but we have no reason to believe that any monsters are roaming...
...about up there.
In fact, I don't think...
They're not cubs - but full grown
"spectacle bears" - great camp followers.
Paula says her father felled one of the trees on that pinnacle so that it dropped across...
...the chasm and made a bridge.
You can still see the stump of the old tree.
In the morning we'll climb the pinnacle - and drop the other tree over.
A Pterodactyl -
...proving definitely that the statements in poor Maple White's diary are true!
A Brontosaurus
- feeding merely on leaves.
Perfectly harmless - unless it happens to step on us.
Who would believe this! My elephant gun might as well be a bean-shooter!
Great guns!
We can't get back!
We're prisoners
- exactly like Maple White!
That means our folk are still alive!
What are you thinking of, Paula
- in this lost world of ours?
I was thinking if my father were still alive
- he would have seen our fire...
- and come to us.
An Allosaurus - a meat-eater - the most vicious pest of the ancient world.
The barrier might as well thistle-down
- and fire may not work with the next one...
- we've got to find a safe camp!
Jocko will be mighty lonesome down here without Miss.
Paula
- he climbed that big rock...
...this morning to get to her - he can't bear that girl out of his sight!
I have an idea! After supper bring all those hammocks into the tent!
We must establish camp here - our only refuge from these monsters -
...if we'll live long enough to search for your father.
Now that we've found these caves we could live here the rest of our lives -
...if we had some weapon capable of making a dent in a dinosaur!
I am now inventing such a weapon.
We can't rest until every inch of this plateau is explored!
It's miles in length - your father may have found other caves -
When I release the tree it will snap back with terrific force -
...and by calculating the curve the rock will describe as it rushes through the air-
A curve? Nonsense! Any school boy could tell you the rock will describe a parabola.
A curve!
A parabola!
I was right - you described a curve!
We'll work all night and make enough ladder to get you in the morning.
Fine! But how in thunder do you expect to get it up to us?
Bring Miss Paula to call Jocko - he'll climb anything to get to her!
There's only a small cave above this -
...but your father must be somewhere on the plateau...
- it's impossible to get away!
Do you mean we are to be here - always?
What difference does it make where we are
Paula - so long as we are - together?
But your engagement to - Gadys?
Paula, dear, we're as cut off from the world and its obligations and promises...
...as if we were on the moon.
I'm going to ask Professor
Summerlee to marry us.
You know he used to be a minister.
Go hunt up the professors
- I have something to - tell Paula-
A lovely specimen!
We'll stalk it and observe its habits!
That dormant volcano is waking!
The whole plateau will be covered in lava!
But this has been going on for hours -
I'm afraid they're lost -
If they get back we must be here to show them the way to the tunnel opening.
It's their only hope of escape!
The professors and Mr. Malone are safe - they'll be here in a minute or two!
I certainly hope that mud holds!
We're back in the world
- and its obligations.
Why should we let Gladys rob us of happiness, Paula?
I can't steal my happiness from another woman.
I'm Major Hibbard, of the
Brazilian geodetic Survey.
Yesterday I saw a cloud of smoke over the plateau -
And we smoked out quite a rat, Major!
I'd give my entrie personal fortune to get that beast to London - alive!
I'll send for men to dredge out this stream
- built a steel cage and a raft -
...and when the big rains come next month, we might float your "rat" out!
If we once could get our raft as far as the Amazon, you could charter a steamer from there!
Later - In London.
Tonight you will not jeer -
...for I have brought back a living proof of my statements!
May I ask what you mean when you say
"proof", Professor Challenger?
A living Brontosaurus
- nearly sixty feet long...
...from the nose to the tip of the tail!
Mr. Edward Malone, through whose efforts this expedition, was financed, is now superintending the unloading of the monster...
...from the ship we chartered-
The message I have been expecting has come!
I'll inform you in a moment when and where the Brontosaurus will be on view!
As we swung the cage out over the dock the cables broke-
The fall smashed the cage
- and it got out!
It's running wild
- the streets are in an uproar!
My Brontosaurus has escaped! Keep off the streets, untill I recapture it!
This is outrage - we've been hoaxed again -
Challenger should be run out of town!
How d'ydo, Gladys.
You see I'm - back.
And, as you really owe it all to me,
I hope you'll forgive me - for not waiting.
My husband, Percy Potts.
May I ask what great stunt, what heroic deed Mr. Potts performed -
...to win you, Gladys?
That was just my girlish whim!
Percy is a clerk at a store, and has never been out of London in his life!
Excuse me!
She didn't wait for me - she's married!
That's Sir John Roxton
- sportsman.

You should have let that skunk break his neck, Helius -!
For thirty years I live like a dog for the sake of my ideas - and then comes this louse-fellow speculating on my misery, and wants to buy my manuscript from me as a curiosity -!
I'd like to have dinner with you,
Professor - can you spare some bread?
I found this in my coat when you left the other day - buy yourself some bread with it, Mr. Helius -!
Spare me having to take handouts from my only friend, Helius...

Hypothetical Account
of the Gold Content
In the Mountains
of the Moon
I maintain, after many years of comparative analyses, that primitive moon-rock contains more gold than the earth's mountains.
One day, the first spaceship will fly to the moon, to bring its gold back to the earth!
Laughter, gentlemen, is the argument of idiots against every new idea -!!
The progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification -!!!
Professor - I've decided to go...
But not without me, Helius - not without me -!!
Now your idea will triumph after all, Professor...
Naturally Windegger will go along?
What -? Windegger won't -? Your collaborator and best friend?
Friede Velten, student of astronomy, and Hans Windegger, Chief Engineer of Helius Hangars are engaged.
Dear Friede!
Best wishes to you and Hans!
Don't be upset that I can't come tonight to your engagement party!
Please accept the flowers as a substitute.
Yours, Wolf Helius.
He doesn't even know anything about my decision - no-one does - except for you...
I tell you, Helius, more people than you and I know of your plan -
- and the fellow whom I threw down the stairs before is one of them -!
Three nights ago -
So you think someone knows of my plans and is thus also interested in your moon-gold theory?
Helius, don't be angry - it's my life's work - go home -
I can't rest until I know the manuscript is in your safe!
Dear Helius! I write to you in incomparable bliss and you should be the first to know that Friede has agreed to be my wife.
Perhaps I took her a bit by surprise, but she said yes!
Come tonight to the engagement party at Friede's apartment!
I am ridiculously happy!
Windegger
Fresh violets, sir?
Wolf Helius, Bergstr. 86-3
To be delivered in person
Mr. Helius isn't home...
Please... let me wait for Mr. Helius anyway. Mr. Windegger sent me...
To be delivered In person
Dear Helius! Accept this poor soul, if you can, and give him work and a chance to make a life - he won't disappoint you.
Warmest regards,
Windegger
Drive to the nearest police station - don't hold things up with long explanations - just bring some sort of officer here to me!
MINGO:
NICK CARTER OF THE SKY
Saturn-Pirates
The thieves' craft approaches
unlucky Saturn!
God in Heaven: You must have some idea when you last phoned -!
Did you leave the flat unattended -?
Only for a moment, when
Gustav came to get me... but then there was that man whom Mr. Windegger had sent -!
Would you allow me to use your telephone?
My phone isn't working...
Christ, madame - someone has to pick up - there's at least half a dozen people sitting around that phone -!
I'm only the foreman of Helius Hangars - but if you keep working like this, you, Miss Friede, will soon be the forewoman of us all!
I was supposed to have sent you somebody with a letter of recommendation -?!
I'm begging you, Hans, get over here...
I can't tell you over the telephone what this is all about... just, please, come...
You can be assured, Hans, that I would not call you away from your engagement party if it weren't absolutely necessary...
We'll be there right away,
Helius!
Allow me to introduce myself -:
Turner...
If you go flying down those steps again, Mr. Turner,
I won't be standing at the bottom to catch you...
Believe me, Mr. Helius, there's no wiser way to pass the time till the arrival of Ms. Velten and Mr. Windegger than to have a chat with me...
First, a small request... tell your chauffeur it's no longer necessary to inform the police...
The police have already been informed, Mr. Turner...
Just a measure of caution,
Mr. Helius, - as well as this...
Also a measure of caution,
Mr. Turner?
I now grasp the phenomenon,
Mr. Turner, how you haven't been whiling away in prison all this time -!
You do flatter,
Mr. Helius!
Perhaps you can also reveal to me, Mr. Turner, where the stolen manuscript - and the contents missing from my safe are located -?!
Five of the wealthiest and cleverest minds who wish to keep the earth's gold-reserve under their control -
One of the most interesting documents, madame and sirs...
To prove the accessibility of the moon,
Helius sent the unmanned trial-rocket H. 23 filled with magnesium, moonward - the explosion of which, upon impact, was viewed and photographed from the earth!
Thanks to the competence of our representative
I can show you something completely different - things that Helius himself has thus far not made available to the scientific community.
Cinematographic images of the surface of the moon by H. 32 during its first orbit of the moon.
The unmanned register-rocket H.32, equipped with automatic imaging-instruments.
The rocket-jet.
In its nose-cone...
...is located the egg-shaped register-chamber with the automated imaging-instruments.
The imaging-instrument, linked to a clockwork.
The mirror tele-objective.

First image of the moon,
36 hours after liftoff:
Distance of the rocket from the moon: Approx. 40,000 km.
At an altitude of approx. 1000 km
H.32 flies over the moon-crater Eratosthenes -
- in its depths the astronomer
W. H. Pickering, director of Mandeville
Observatory, Jamaica, believes to have observed swarms of insects.
The objective's eye sees what no man's eye has ever seen:
The opposite side of the moon turned away from the earth.
Cryptic, monochrome planes of colossal dimensions -
Vegetation? Fog?
Water? -
- all seem to confirm the theory of Prof. Peter Andreas Hansen
- of the Seeberg Observatory near Gotha - that on the opposite side of the moon exists an atmosphere and, therefore, life.
Why lose more time?
I for one want the moon's riches of gold, should they actually prove to exist, to fall into the hands of businessmen and not visionaries and idealists!
At this moment our representative is making
Mr. Helius aware of our intentions in a very concrete manner...
You have only two choices,
Mr. Helius:
Either make the trip to the moon in our employ -
- or not at all...
If we don't come to an agreement, Mr. Helius, five minutes after my departure, your hangar, along with the nearly completed spaceship, will be reduced to a heap of rubble...
What would you gain, by killing me off, Mr. Helius? - at the most, a travel companion who is less considerate!
You still don't get the picture, Mr. Helius... we'd rather annihilate all of your plans than let you shut us out of the operation...
Tell your clients,
Mr. Turner, that I do not aim to found upon the moon a criminal-colony...
Give me 24 hours to think it over...
Will your... plans be seriously affected by the theft, Helius?
Don't worry about the plans -!
I have duplicates of everything, safe in my desk's secret compartment!
Hans dear, if I were you, I wouldn't be so sure about that!
Why did you conceal from us,
Helius, the fact that you now actually want to take on the voyage to the moon?
You've called me your good comrade so often at work - in the laboratory - in this very room... now you want to lie to me, Helius?
I didn't mean to lie to you, Friede -
I just wanted to spare
Hans the conflict between his love for you and his sense of duty towards the work we've been doing!
But do you really believe, Helius, that Hans would ever be capable of letting you down?!
Oh no, Helius! You won't make the trip to the moon without Windegger...
- and not without me -!
Have you forgotten, Friede, how those fared that dared this trip to the moon before us -
IN MEMORY OF...
TO THE BOLD PIONEERS
OF SPACE NAVIGATION
WHO DID NOT RETURN FROM
THEIR JOURNEY INTO OUTER-SPACE
THE Y LIVED AND DIED FOR
A GREAT IDEA
HONOUR THEIR MEMORY
Friede - don't you get it?!
I just couldn't stand to know you were in danger -
God in heaven - and what danger indeed -!!!
He's decided to travel to the moon, Hans...
So when do we start -?
And who will go with us?
Ask Friede...
Friede... you want to go with me -?
...in exactly 24 hours...
Mr. Helius, the 24 hours for consideration were up 61 minutes ago...
The explosion is of no concern, Mr. Helius - it's nothing but a small accentuation of my offers...
The price of this first warning, Mr. Windegger, is the hangar:
Just a shack... the second one will cost the lives of men... the third, the spaceship...
Don't force me, Mr. Helius, to take stronger measures:
Choose the lesser of two evils -: Me!
I give you my word,
Mr. Helius, the very hour that we come to an agreement, you'll get your stolen material back, complete and in perfect condition...
...the Spaceship "FRIEDE"
("Peace") is ready for launch...
...at moonrise the spaceship will soar into outer-space...
...only to land - if God sees fit - 36 hours later upon the opposite side of the moon...
...at this moment bells will ring - the sirens of all the factories, trains and ships around the world will wail to honour the pioneers of space navigation...
In this final hour I must once again warn all of you...
You, Manfeldt, and you -
Mr. Turner:
I'm leaving out Windegger:
And as for you... Friede -!
Friede... in this last minute... -
I'm begging you -
Don't beg me, Helius!
Helius, in this last instant, do you want to shame me as a woman?
...the whole world's eyes are directed upon us... -
...the whole world's ears are listening to us...
Everyone to their stations...
We launch in 50 minutes -!
...the whole world's eyes are directed upon us... -
...the whole world's ears are listening to us...
Just now
Just now the
Just now the spaceship
Just now the spaceship has
Just now the spaceship has reached
Just now the spaceship has reached the
Just now the spaceship has reached the launch pad...
...because the spaceship is built too light to stand freely, it's submerged in a water-basin in which it floats upright...
From the moment of launch till attaining the necessary speed of 11,200 km per second...
SPEED
...there will be 8 critical minutes in the battle with the increase in speed, with G-force, which has a fatal effect upon human organisms when it goes over
40 metres per second...
G-FORCE
...after these 8 minutes, during which we'll feel an intolerable burden pulling our bodies back to earth, we'll be victors in the battle with gravitational force... or -
...and if we aren't able to maintain our speed of 11200... then we'll hurtle - and hurtle - further - and further still -
- irretrievably lost in outer-space - never again... never again... to return to the earth...
I'll be the one to pull the stop-lever, Windegger!
60 seconds to go -!
20 seconds to go - lie still - take a deep breath -!
10 seconds to go -!
Seconds to go!
NOW
Launch-rocket depleted!
Full-throttle on middle-rocket!
Win-degger... jet-tison... middle... - ro-cket...
Turn... back!!!
Maybe this chap is dead?!
I think Josephine needs a brandy!
I think Mr. Turner needs one even more -!
Don't you see, someone is stowed away in the cargo hold!
Okay, you wretched scoundrel, how did you get in here?!
I've devoted my whole life to moon-issues, Mr. Helius!

We're seeing it again, Hans... we're seeing it again!
And when are we finally going to land?!
If we had a spark of reason in us, we wouldn't ever land -!
You're just afraid - you wimp -!!
Tell him he has no right to jeopardise all our lives for the sake of his ambition!
By God now is not the time for arguments, Hans -
Shut the window-hatches -!
Full brake-power - we're plummeting -!
Hold on tight -!!!!
The ignition cable probably isn't going to fix itself!
The moon awaits!
First though we have to do an air-sample, to tell whether we can breathe outside!
Do what you want!
I'm only interested in how
I'll get back out of here!
I'll tell you just one thing, Friede, as soon as I have the spaceship ready to launch again, I'll fly back to earth - and neither Helius nor
Manfeldt will stop me -!
Do you really aim to stab Helius in the back?
Do you really aim to stab me in the back?
Now Helius has no choice but to prepare right away for the trip back -!
But Helius is convinced that we'll find water with the divining rod!
You know what the only thing is that we'll find on the moon -!
- Death!
Professor, please, help me with the air-sample!
For God's sake, don't open it -!!
If he opens the outer door and outside there's no breathable atmosphere, then we're done for good!
He's taken the divining rod with him!
It's as if the rod is pulling him forward!
Mingo would follow this trail, Mr. Helius!
The main objective should be to look for water!
I have enough to do, to get us ready to launch again!
May I volunteer to look for Professor Manfeldt and, at the same time, water?
Atmosfere breathable, not yet analised.
Törner on the trale for 3 hours of Manfeldt searching for water.
Since when is Gustav your secretary?
I can't stand it anymore...
I'm going to look for Manfeldt -!
From Miss Friede... so you won't go hungry!
Professor -!
Professor -!
Professor -!!
Professor -! Manfeldt -!!
Professor -!!!
Don't let him into the ship!!
Don't let him into the ship!!!
Is there anyone in the world to whom we should relay your last regards - if we get back to earth?
The oxygen containers - the shot hit the oxygen containers -!!!!
What does this mean,
Miss Friede, with the oxygen containers?!
Let's pray to God it means nothing!
We've lost more than half of the oxygen!
That means: One of us can't go back to earth -!
One of us has to stay on the moon -!!
Yes, Windegger:
One of us!
Do you know what this means - do you?!
To stay here - alone on the moon - just because you didn't want to listen to me - you and him!!
Short one loses - long one wins... and we draw three times... how's that?!
You draw -!
So draw then -!
Would it be easier for you, Hans, if I stayed with you on the moon?
I have only one desire:
To get back to earth -!!
Let's drink to a happy homecoming to earth - for all of us...
...to a happy homecoming - for all of us, Hans!
The base-camp is ready,
Mr. Helius!
Now you must prove, Gustav, that I can rely upon you!
I'm staying back here on the moon...
- and you will guide the spaceship away from the moon!
Do you want Mr. Windegger to perish -?
And Miss Friede, who loves him -?
The enormous shock of the launch will naturally wake the sleepers - and then Mr. Windegger will take over the command...
Dear Hans! I am convinced that you won't let me down just as I haven't let you down.
I shall wait calmly and with confidence that you'll come to get me.
My greetings to Friede! - Helius.
Farewell!
At the beginning of the Middle Ages the legend of the mandrake was born. 
According to legend, a root was transformed into a human being. 
We have to go out at night to find the root, when the clock strikes midnight. 
You should place the stick into the ground below the gallows. 
The root of the mandrake, with its strength and
Magic brought fortune to men, but misfortune and pain. 
His Excellency, Professor 
Jakob ten Brink was famous for his ability to experiment with the hereditary character of man. 
During my studies, I have found the legend of the mandrake, and now 
I look at this old superstition scientifically. 
We know the wind carries pollen from flower to flower ... without any will, without a certain goal. 
And thus was born in the laboratory the animal laboratory. I wanted to discover: Is character inherited from the parents or just by chance? 
I always say to my students: 
We should overcome the road open for experiments 
Teacher's Voronoff. XXX
Above all, we should pay attention to the results. Because then we open new possibilities for the study of humanity. 
Franz Braun, nephew of the teacher. 
Wouldn't these men just mock you, uncle? 
On the contrary! It would be the biggest experiment of my life: 
Creating a man in the laboratory. 
A being with a hereditary character that does not come influenced by the parents. 
The woman must be of the same qualities as the land fertilized under the gallows, the "mandrake" must come from the dregs of society
While the prison administration got a man for the professor, 
Franz Braun was looking for women for his uncle needed to perfect the experiment. 
Alraune, daughter of sin ... from the dark days of superstition. 
Franz Baum his uncle was looking for the ideal woman he needed for his experiment 
I am warning you. Forget that your plan violates nature, the finest of life ... 
Beware: the legend of the mandrake is real! It will become a living being, but it lacks the warmth of life, and bears the cold of death inside. 
I tell you, the legend of the mandrake is true.
It is a living being that lacks the warmth of life and bears the cold of death within itself. 
Be on guard ... 
... consequences of your action ... 
Nature will have her revenge! 
Alraune be educated at school 
Convent of the Sacred-Heart. 
I cannot do this to my parents! 
I want to do everything you want. 
On the bank of the Industry and Credit. 
Mom sends you greetings. 
And the Mandrake? 
The evolution of Mandrake. 
24 October 1908 
It is a success, with the help of my nephew, the creation of a Mandrake root. 
He is a dreamer, I, by contrast, am a man of science ... I am above prejudice. 
According to legend, the mandrake brings fortune and wealth. Today I have selected a name: Alraune ten Brink. 
It is blasphemy ... and you will be punished.
Alraune disappears without a trace ... 
-School of the Sacred Heart convent. 
I want champagne! 
At one stop, Alraune lies for the first time to people from a traveling circus. 
Aren't you afraid of a mouse? 
After months of investigation, 
Alraune ten Brink was found. 
In the end, I knew I would succeed. 
Alraune, doesn't it embarrass you? 
I'm scared of you. 
You used to be my nephew. We moved away until your story was forgotten. 
Enough of this visit by a gentleman. 
Who do you think is your father? 
I offend, Alraune. 
If you knew where you came from!  
... and then presented in high society.
Father, come here! 
Surprisingly, father, we seem so little alike. 
Do I look more like my mother? 
Yes ... I think of your mother often. 
What if she looks like her mother? 
Never! 
Dear lady, I want to ask the professor for you hand. 
Sorry, sir ... Alraune is yet very young and should remain with me. 
Tonight at eleven I flee with her. 
What a shame ... An experiment by a cynical scientist ... a daughter of vice and crime. 
What is my place among men? 
I play him. I get even with him. 
You are right ... I stayed with him. 
Dear Dad, I think you're jealous. 
His letter was brought to me here. 
In the diary of my "father" I read everything that happened before my birth. 
Have mercy on me ... 
I want to know everything. 
I'll give you everything you want, but we go from here. 
Alraune ... you and me ... 
You're a cheater! What were you thinking? 
I have now learned that this woman is not you daughter. 
I cannot deceive you. 
You must stay with me, or I will kill you ... 
Dear Professor! It is as if a ghost followed you ... as if a devil wanted to harm another. 
All speculation has failed ... 
She has destroyed ... 
Come to the gaming table, Alraune. 
You will bring me luck. 
Play red, the color of good fortune. 
Red five times in a row. 
Place your bets! 
For the ninth time the ball has landed on red. 
I want to leave. 
We have not lost everything yet, Alraune. 
We still have your jewels. 
We have not lost everything, Alraune.
We still have your jewelry.
Yes ... but not with you ... 
Take me out of here ... 
Give me another soul, a heart ... and I will become a human being and love as a human being. 
Alraune began a new life together the one she loved. And the one who violated the laws of nature, fell into a hell of loneliness and insanity.
