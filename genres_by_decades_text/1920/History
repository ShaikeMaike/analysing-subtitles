Such was McTeague.
Such was Mother
McTeague.
Filled with the one idea of having her son enter a profession and rise in life ... the chance came at last to
Mother McTeague.
His mother's ambition was fired ... and Mac went away with the dentist to learn his profession.
Mac learned dentistry, after a fashion, through assisting the charlatan .... and, years later, on Polk
Street in San Francisco, "Doc"
McTeague was established.
"Have a seat, Marcus."
"Trina, Mac's the strongest duck you ever seen -- by damn!"
"That's Maria ... she keeps Mac's place clean. She's cuckoo in the head."
"Buy a ticket in the lottery?"
"-- just a dollar!"
"Go 'long with you!
Lotteries is against the law!"
"-- the butcher in the next block won twenty dollars the last drawing!"
"Mac, old pal, I wantcha to shake hands with my cousin, Trina Sieppe.
She's my sweetie!"
"Don't you hurt her too much, Mac."
"So long, Mac, I got to do some work yet ... at the dog hospital."
"Don't do anything I wouldn't do .... you know!"
"I guess I'll have to pull them three teeth and make you a bridge."
"Oh no! That will cost too much, won't it?"
For the first time in his life, McTeague felt an inkling of ambition to please a woman.
During the next two weeks Trina was a daily patient.
"Ether ... not so dangerous as gas."
So Mac administered the ether.
But below the fine fabric bred of his mother, ran the foul stream of hereditary evil ... the taint of generations given through his father.
Terrified at his weakness,
McTeague threw himself once more into his work with desperate energy ... until he finished.
"Oh, Mac's all right ... by damn!"
Trina was to come no more.
His dream was gone.
The following Sunday,
Marcus took Mac to the Cliff House.
"What's the matter with you these days, Mac ... huh?"
"It's ... it's ... Miss Sieppe!"
"You mean ... that you, too --"
"She's been the first girl I've ever known.
I couldn't help myself!"
"-- I was so close to her -- "
"-- an' smelled her hair --"
"-- an' felt her breath!"
"Oh! ... you don't know!"
"Well ... what are we goin' to do 'bout it?"
"I'll give her up to you, old man --"
"-- by damn!"
"Friends for life --"
"-- or ... death!"
"I'm ... much ... obliged,
Marcus. I'm much ... obliged!"
Then, with unselfish friend- ship for his "pal", Marcus took Mac to Oakland the next Sunday ... that he might again be with Trina and meet her folks.
"Mac, this is Trina's father!"
"Sure glad t' know ya, Mr. Sieppe."
"Mommer!"
"Doc,...shake hands with my cousin, Selina."
"Here's where we shell out, Mac."
"Gimme four bits!"
"I ain't got no money with me ... only a dime!"
What a day that was for McTeague ... what a never-to-be-forgotten day!
Weeks passed and March rains put a stop to their picnics ... but Mac saw
Trina every Wednesday and
Sunday.
"Let's go over and sit on the sewer."
"-- 'Hearts and
Flowers'?"
"No ... but, 'Nearer My
God to Thee'."
"Say, Miss Trina,... why can't us two get married?"
"Why not? Dontcher like me well enough?"
"Then ... why not?"
"Because!"
First .... chance had brought them face to face; now .... mysterious instincts, as ungovernable as the winds of the heavens, were knitting their lives together.
"Let me go alone .... please!"
"-- you may ... you may come Sunday!"
"Can't I kiss ya again?"
"I've got her! By God ...
I've got her!!"
Trina and Mac became engaged. The event was celebrated with a theatre party.
"I liked the lady best ... who sang those sad songs."
"I liked pest ... der yodlers!"
"I liked best ... the fellow who played 'Nearer My
God to Thee' ... on the beer bottles."
"Behave!"
And afterwards, there was to be "some- thing to eat" at Mac's dental parlors.
"Your lottery ticket has won five thousand dollars!"
"Oh! .... there's a mistake!"
"On presentation of your ticket .... you will receive a check for five thousand dollars!"
"What will you do with all this money,
Trina?"
"Get married on it .... for one thing!"
"Can't we go into your parlors and celebrate?"
The party ended late. Mac and Marcus gave up their rooms to Trina, "Der
Mommer" and little
"Owgooste".
"Oh, Mac! Think of all this money coming to us .... just at this moment."
"Come along, Mac. We've gotta sleep with the dogs tonight you know."
"What a damn fool
I was --"
"-- if I'd a' kept
Trina, I'd a' had ... five thousand bucks!"
"-- damn the luck!"
Trina and Mac were married a month later in the photographer's rooms that
Mac rented for their future home.
-- and then they viewed the gifts.
-- and then, for two full hours, they gorged themselves.
-- then, came the farewell.
"Doctor ... be good to her! Be very good to her ... won't you?"
"Der's nuttin' to pe
'fraid of! Go to your husban'."
The early months of married life wrought changes.
Since her lottery winning,
Trina feared their good luck might lead to extravagance; and her normal instinct for saving became a passion.
"I haven't no small change, Mac."
For quite some time,
McTeague had his eye on a little house .... that they might be by themselves.
"What d'yer think?"
"We can't afford such extravagance. Thirty- five dollars ... and the water extra!"
In the new order of life, Trina reduced
Mac's visits to Frenna's
Saloon to one night a week.
"Say, Mac .... when are ya gonna pay me that money you owe me?"
"Huh? Do ... I ... owe ... you ... any money?"
"Well, you owe me ... four bits! I paid for you and Trina that day ... at the picnic!"
"You oughta have told me before."
"I'm ... I'm much obliged to you, Marcus."
"-- and you never paid me for sleepin' in my dog hospital the night you was engaged, either!"
"Do you mean ... I ....
I shoulda paid for that, too?"
"Well,... you'd a' had to pay four bits for a bed anywheres!"
"What's the matter with you lately, Marcus?
Is there somethin' I've done?"
"All I know is ... that
I been soldiered out of my girl --"
"-- an' out o' my money!"
"Do I get any o' them five thousand bucks from the lottery?"
"It ain't mine to give!"
"You're drunk! ... that's what you are!"
"Am I gonna get some o' that money?"
"-- I'm through with you!!"
"He broke my pipe!!"
"-- he can't make small o' me!"
"He broke my pipe! --"
Marcus' attack was soon a forgotten incident. Mac's moods of wrath always faded in Trina's company.
"-- Mommer wants ... me --"
"-- wants ... US --"
"-- to send her fifty dollars."
"Well, I guess we can send it ...... can't we?"
"I wonder if Mommer thinks we're millionaires?"
"Trina, you're gettin' to be a regular stingy!
You're gettin' worse and worse every day!"
"But .... fifty dollars is fifty dollars!"
"Well, you got a lot saved up ... and besides, you still got all o' your five thousand."
"Don't talk that way,
Mac! That money is never ... never going to be touched!"
"If Mommer really needs the money so badly .... she'll write again."
Trina's miserly attitude grew steadily through the following months ... but her brusque outbursts of affection kept her tolerable to the slow-thinking McTeague.
"Well .... bygones is bygones, ain't they,
Mac?
"Sure!"
"Well ... how's business,
Doc?"
"-- plenty o' money?"
"-- lots to do?"
"Everythin' just fine .... huh?"
"We've got lots to do -"
"-- but we haven't got no money!"
"Well,... I'm goin' away.
Goin' in cattle ranchin with a English duck."
"Comin' back? Why,...
I ain't never comin' back."
"I came t' say
'goodbye'."
"I guess we won't never see each other again."
"I guess so."
"Good luck .... t' you both!"
"Goodbye! That's the best thing I ever heard
Marcus say."
So Marcus had left .... left for good. Never again should they be disturbed by him.
"Why .... it isn't possible!"
"Well .... I ain't gonna quit for just a piece o' paper!"
"Go on, Mac! Get all the money you can before they make you stop."
"It's MARCUS .... that's done it! --"
"-- damn his soul!!"
Only little by little did the McTeagues understand the calamity that had befallen them.
"I got ev'rythin' fixed, an' ready an' waitin' ... an' nobody's ever gonna come any more."
"That's the way to rub it out ... by me crying on it."
"If...I...ever...meet...
MARCUS SCHOULER!"
"If...you...ever...do!"
With the stopping of
McTeague's practice, the grind began. Trina sold everything; she worked at toy whittling that her money might remain untouched.
"They fired me!"
"Isn't there another surgical instrument factory in town?"
"Yes...there's...there's two more."
"We're losing money every second you sit here! --"
"-- and we cannot afford it!"
"They paid you ... didn't they?"
"-- always money!"
"Better gimme a nickel for carfare --"
"-- it's a long walk --"
"-- an' it's gonna rain."
"A big fellow like you ... 'fraid of a little walk!"
"You oughta taken a car."
"You're goin' to catch your death o' cold!"
"Two straight, Joe."
"It kind o' disagrees with me."
"Aw ... hell! You'll die ... if you stand 'round soaked like that."
Gold was her master .... a passion with her, a mania, a veritable mental disease.
"Did you get a place?"
"Did you ... get caught ... in the rain?"
"Wouldn't even gimme a nickel ... for carfare!"
"I didn't know it was going to rain."
"Didn't I tell you it was?"
"You ain't gonna make small o' me .... all the time!"
"Did you ... get a place?"
"Gimme back the money
I gave ya!"
"I ... paid ... the grocery bill with it."
"I don't believe ya!"
"Why, Mac ... do you think
I'd lie to you?"
"Did you ... get a place?"
"Ain't that fine?"
"Ain't it lovely?"
"I won't have you yell at me ... like that!"
"You're gonna do ... just as I tell you ... after this ... Trina McTeague!"
"Yes! ... I been drinkin' whiskey!"
"I'm beat out ... an'
I don't wanta be bothered!"
"I wonder where he got the money ... to buy the whiskey?"
As time went on, Mac's idleness became habitual.
His dislike for Trina increased with every day of her persistent stinginess.
"I'll get some money and come back."
"You with all that money .... an' me with nothin'. Come'n!"
"Don't you love me any more, Mac?"
"Sure I do!"
As Trina's greed grew, Mac's ambition waned .... and died. They sank lower and lower that Trina might still save from her meager earnings.
"That's three days old.
It's hardly fit for dogs."
"Where's my change?"
"Two bits ... out o' a dollar?"
"Do you think I'd ... cheat you?"
Mac's meal was eaten and finished in silence.
For the first time in his life he had thoughts.
"So long!"
"Kiss me goodbye, Mac?"
"Why don't you bring some of your fish home sometimes?"
"It might save you a nickel."
"I think I'll take them birds o' mine along."
"Sell 'em?"
"You ought to get at least five dollars for them."
"Maybe ... six dollars!"
"Well ... so long!"
"- how I've slaved, and starved for you."
Mac never returned after that day .... so
Trina took employment as a scrub-women.
And with all her gold, she was alone .... a solitary, abandoned woman.
"Say, Trina ... lemme in, will ya?"
"I ain't had nothin' t' eat since yesterday mornin'."
"I'll see you starve before you get another penny ... of my money!"
"I wouldn't let a dog go hungry!"
"Not ... if he'd bitten you?"
"If I had hold o' you, I'd --"
"I want that five thousand!"
"I bet ... it'll rain tomorrow."
McTeague had been missing from San Francisco for weeks, when --
The Fugitive.
"-- I know 'um well!
I can identify 'um!"
"-- an' that five thousand he got away with .... belongs to me!"
"There ain't a man o' you big enough t' stop me from goin'!"
"Lord love you, come
'long then. He's been reported headin' for
Death Valley."
That night desolation lay still around Mac. Every nerve cried aloud for rest, yet every instinct seemed goading him to hurry on.
"Damn you! Come on, will ya .... an' have it out!"
"If it gets much hotter ...
I don't know!"
"God! .... what a country!"
And for days, on Mac went .... chasing the receding horizon that always fled before him.
The last water hole.
"It's impossible to cross
Death Valley! There ain't enough water for one man an' his mount .... let alone eight!"
"We've got to circle
'round the Valley."
"Like hell I will! I ain't sworn in."
"I'll do ... as I please!"
"Go on then ... you damn fool! But I ain't got nothin' t' do with it!"
"If you catch him, put these bracelets on him an' bring him in!"
McTeague was headed for the very heart of Death
Valley .... that horrible wilderness of which even beasts were afraid.
"It's goin' to be worse than ever today."
"By damn ... if he ain't got no water with
'um, I'll be in a bad way."
But hatred and the greed for gold kept
Marcus up .... and closer and closer he came.
"What did ya do with that five thousand?"
"Got any water?"
"Is all the water we got ... on the saddle?"
"He ate some loco-weed.
We'd better finish him ... t'ain't right to let 'um suffer."
"There's no water ... within a hundred miles o' here!"
"We...are...dead...men!"
"Even if we're done for, I'll take some o' my truck along."
"I ain't so sure 'bout who that money belongs to!"
"-- an' don't try and load that gun either!"
"Don't you lay your fingers on that sack!"

Part one.
"MEN AND MAGGOTS."
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land.
A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts.
The individual personality, having hardly had time to become conscious of itself... dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan.
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.
We, the sailors of Potemkin, must support the workers, our brothers... and stand among the front lines of the revolution!
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty.
Attentive, but clumsy.
He vents his anger on a young man.
Hurtful...
Vakulinchuk 
Comrades! The time has come when we too must speak out.
Why wait? All of Russia has risen!
Are we to be the last?
Morning.
We've had enough rotten meat!
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!
The ship doctor Smirnov.
It could crawl overboard on its own!
These aren't worms.
They are dead fly larvae.
You can wash them off with brine!
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are!
We've had enough rotten meat!
It's good meat. End of discussion!
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing.
The ship's store.
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two.
"DRAMA ON THE DECK."
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward!
The petty officers.
You're free to go!
I'll hang the rest on the yard!
Call the guards!
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks, calls the sailors to the gun turret.
To the turret...
To the turret!
To the turret...
Guys!...
It's time.
Most of them gathered by the turret.
Stop! Don't move!
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!
I'll shoot you all like dogs!
Cover them with canvas!
Got it!
Cover them!
Attention!
Dear Lord!
Make the disobedient see reason!
Fire right into the canvas!
Vakulinchuk decides.
Fire!
BROTHERS!
Who are you shooting at?!
The rifles quavered.
Shoot!
Everyone shoot!
Shoot, scum!
To the rifles, brothers!
Smash the dragons! Smash 'em!
Smash 'em all!
Have fear of God!
Beat it, sorcerer!
To the bottom to feed the worms!
Brothers! We've won!
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky.
Vakulinchuk's overboard!
Save Vakulinchuk!
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner's hand.
To the shore.
Odessa.
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three.
"THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."
Mist lingered on from the night...
Rumours came from the pier.
Together with the sun, the news hit the city.
The battleship raided...
...rebellion...
...shore...
A killed sailor...
We'll remember.
For a spoonful of borscht.
"Citizens of Odessa! Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky.
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors!
Signed: Crew of the squadron battleship 
Prince Tavrichesky."
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!
All for one.
One for all.
Down with the executioners!
Down with tyranny!
Mothers and brothers!
Let there not be differences or hostility among us!
Smash the Jews!
Shoulder to shoulder.
The land is ours.
Tomorrow is ours.
A delegate from shore.
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
WE WILL WIN!
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively.
Part four.
"THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."
In those memorable days, the city lived together with the rebellious battleship.
Like a white-winged flock, boats flew to the battleship.
AND SUDDENLY
Let's go! Let's convince them!
Listen! Don't shoot!
My boy is badly hurt.
COSSACKS!
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship's shells.
The target - the Odessa theater.
The generals' headquarters.
Part five.
"RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.
Landing is not possible.
The admiral's squadron is coming our way.
With one heart, they decided to face the squadron.
Night came, full of anxiety.
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.
Sore from constant speech, throats breathe heavily and unevenly.
Squadron on the horizon!
All hands on deck!
Prepare for battle!
Full speed!
Hearts forward!
Top speed!
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.
The admiral attacks!
The squadron draws near!
Give the signal: join us!
Join!...
...us!
The enemy is within firing range!
All against one.
ONE AGAINST ALL.
Shoot?... or...
BROTHERS!
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah.
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, without a single shot, the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron.

The Wife of the Pharaoh
Only about half of the 2976 meters of the original film survived, and in poor condition.
In the present version the gaps in the plot will be explained in black text on a white background.
The text of the other intertitles follows the original script.
First Act
King Samlak of Ethiopia to King Amenes who sits on Amon Ra's throne.
Life gives him salvation and strength.
I am visiting your residence, to humbly offer you an alliance, for the protection of the inner and outer peace of our Empires.
For our bond to become even stronger,
I wish to offer you my daughter Makeda.
An accident at the construction site of the Treasury...
Don't jeopardize the valuable lives of the workers and give me time for the construction.
I only wish to know when the
Treasury will be finished!
The misfortune of the
Treasury is real.
Your men will perish miserably...!
Because the King is having build a Treasury, our men must die...?
To the Pharaoh!
Pharaoh, give us back our men!
Think of the children!
Are you ready to offer the
Gods a morning sacrifice?
Lord of the Heavens, 
Father of the Gods, the King is facing you, to thank you in this morning hour.
King Samlak of Ethiopia gets his daughter decorated before her entrance into Egypts capital.
She thinks too highly of herself to assist me with my decoration.
Theonis, the slave, attracts the fury of Makedas, her mistress.
Before punishment she got saved by an Egyptian:
Ramphis, son of Sothis,
Amenes' architect.
He kidnaps her on his raft that transports wood and valuables for the Pharaoh's new Treasury.
Second Act
Samlak, King of Ethiopia, and his daughter Makeda are arriving at the Pharaoh.
Amenes is less impressed by
Makeda than by the treasures
Samlak had brought with him.
In the house of the Treasurer,
Ramphis and Theonis are playing a board game.
That's my treasury.
Don't we want to go down there to see the Treasury from nearby?
No one is allowed to come close to the Treasury at the risk of capital punishment. 
I cannot break my own order.
You have good reasons to be cautious.
People are stealing in your country.
At the ports of your Capital a female slave was stolen.
...have it announced throughout the country that I vouched for bringing along the stolen slave.
Come on, we want to finalize the alliance.
Coming close to the Treasury is a capital offense.
- Tomorrow!
- Tomorrow!
What were you looking for in my Treasury?
You're lying!
You will both die!
Kill me, but keep him alive.
I alone am guilty!
As soon as the sun rises a lawful judgement will be enforced.
I am ready to pay for his life.
I wait until sunrise... then he will die.
Now you know my will.
The Pharaoh hat Ramphis thrown into the alligator pool.
Ramphis is screaming. 
Theonis hears it from her cell.
She can see through the window how Ramphes is in danger.
Bring me to the King - but let him alive.
Thanks to the goodness of the Pharaoh you've been pardoned to lifelong forced labor in the stone pit.
You are the first genuine person...
I will do anything to win your heart.
But I pardoned him?
...pardoning with lifelong forced labor in the stone pit!
Those are your important state affairs.
Didn't you guarantee to bring me back the stolen slave?
Infuriated  because Amenes refuses to hand over the slave to Theonis, the Ethiopians are departing.
Fourth Act
...and all of this because of a foreign girl!
Are you aware that you're bringing your country into a war?
...and all of this because of a slave!
No, because of a Queen.
Bless her!
The Queen will be shown to the people.
Don't you want to come to go see her?
Long live the Queen!
War! The Ethiopians are crossing the country scorching and killing.
Before going off to war against the Ethiopians,
Amenes asks Theonis for a vow of fidelity.
She refuses when she hears that Ramphis and the prisoners escaped from the stone pit.
The Pharaoh, who has to give up hope for her love, has her being fixed into the walls of the Treasury, and Sothis, who knows the secret gate, will be blinded.
Father!
What's the value of a person's eyes, when a King is worrying about his wife?
The wife, who's responsible for your blindness, must die.
Fifth Act
The King doesn't want to be disordered.
If you want to see Theonis alive, do not humiliate her, she is my wife.
Forgive me that I want to save you.
I stand before you so pure, as I am leaving you.
Where is the King?
We don't have any accurate news yet.
King Amenes is dead.
If you deliberately extradite the Queen, King Samlak will pardon you. Otherwise the city will be destroyed, and the population will be exterminated.
The Queen should decide herself.
In your hands is the fate of the people. Make a choice.
Bring me to King Samlak.
Only a coward will hand over the Queen to the Barbarians.
Sixth Act
The judgement of the dead on King Amenes.
The dead Kings body has been stolen by the enemy!
These are his remnants.
We judge the dead according to our customs.
He was strict but fair!
Anyone accusing the dead of an evil deed, please stand up.
Anyone who has something to say in favor of the dead, please come forward.
No exception, Queen Theonis, for your sake...
Amenes, you are guilty, no grievance about you.
Your name will be obliterated forever.
Let's leave this place, now that I'm free.
You aren't free. You have the duty to heal the wounds of your people. They are suffering because of you.
The power is in your hands now to choose for your people a righteous King 
Please save the people from another Tyran and choose the most worthy King.
Who do you think is most worthy?
He is your King!
You are the hope of the people.
It is your holy duty...
The Egyptians are celebrating the new King.
Don't you know me, your King Amenes?
This fool imagines he is King Amenes!
Where is Theonis?
Are you lamenting me?
Who is your King?
I claim my wife!
The King too is subjected to the commandments of the Gods.
Give me Theonis!
He betrayed you for the woman's sake.
Our man have been slaughtered for the sake of this woman.
Stone them!
Spare them!
Amenes begs the people to spare Theonis, to no avail.
He also begs them to kill him as well.
Instead, he again is crowned Pharaoh.
With the crown on his head, he falls dead from the throne.
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th. Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la
Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world: the record of the trial of
Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death.
The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded exactly.
Reading it, we discover the real Joan... not in armor, but simple and human... a young woman who died for her country... and we are witness to an amazing drama: a young, pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth...
In France I'm called Joan... in my village,
I'm called Jeannette.
How old are you?
Nineteen...I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Will you recite it?
You claim to be sent by God?
To save France... it's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I don't know if God loves or hates the English... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France... except those that die here!
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you...in what form?
Did he have wings?
Did he wear a crown?
How was he dressed?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothing?
If we give you women's clothing, would you wear it?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over...
I will again dress as a woman.
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man?
And what reward do you expect from God?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
For me, she is a saint.
Has God made you promises?
That has nothing to do with this trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Shall we put this question to a vote?
So! What has God promised you?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
Since she couldn't be made to confess easily... we will have to be clever...
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles.
I will dictate a letter.
I have great sympathy for you!
Do you know the signature of your King?
I have a letter from him for you.
I can't read.
To our beloved Joan...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army.
I send you this devoted priest.
Have confidence in him.
Just as Jesus is the son of God... you claim to be the daughter of God?
Will you recite the
Lord's Prayer?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison?
By a great victory!
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven?
So you are certain of being saved?
Be careful, it's a dangerous answer.
Since you are sure of your salvation... you have no need of the Church?
Are you in a state of grace?
Respond!
Are you in a state of grace?
If I am, may God keep me there.
If I am not, may God grant it to me!
Father... permit me to attend Mass.
Joan, if we permit you to attend Mass... will you stop wearing men's clothes?
So, you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass?
These shameless clothes... abominable to God...
You are no daughter of God...
You are Satan's creature!
Go prepare the torture chamber.
She really looks like a daughter of God, eh?
The torture chamber.
Regard your judges.
Do you not feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you?
But God is even wiser!
Listen, Joan, we know that your visions do not come from God... but from the devil.
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel?
You have knelt before Satan, not St. Michael!
Don't you see that it's the Devil who has turned your head... who has tricked you... and betrayed you?
I think she's ready to abjure!
The Church opens its arms to you... but if you reject it, the Church will abandon you... and you will be alone... alone!
Yes, alone... alone, with God!
Even if you part my soul from my body...
I will confess nothing...
And if I do confess, later I will say it was forced from me!
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death.
She is very weak.
She has a fever... we must bleed her.
Be careful, she could end her own life... she's very crafty.
Bring the Sacraments.
Is there something you wish to tell us?
I fear that I am about to die... and if I do, I ask you to bury me in sacred ground.
The Church is merciful...
It always welcomes the misguided lamb.
Joan, we all want what's best for you.
Look, I have sent for the Sacraments.
I am a good Christian.
Do you not know it is the
Body of Christ you refuse?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy?
I love and honor God... with all my heart.
You claim...that I am... sent by the devil.
It's not true... to make me suffer, the devil has sent you... and you... and you... and you...
There is nothing left to be done... alert the executioner!
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul...
It is to you, Joan, that I speak.
It is to you that I say your King is a heretic!
My King is the most noble
Christian of all.
The arrogance of this woman is insane.
France has never seen such a monster...
I have never wronged anyone.
If you do not sign, you will be burned alive...
The stake awaits you...
You don't have the right to die.
Your King still needs you.
Joan, sign... and save your life!
Joan, we have great sympathy for you.
Sign, Joan!
In the name of the Lord. Amen.
Having recognized your errors, you shall not be excommunicated.
But as you have greatly sinned, we condemn you... to perpetual imprisonment, to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of anguish.
A good day's work: you have saved your life and your soul.
She has only made fools of you!
Long live Joan!
Go find the judges!
I take it back, I have lied...
Hurry!
I have committed a great sin...
I have denied God... to save my life.
But Joan, you have confessed before everyone that the devil misled you.
You still believe you were sent by God?
Her answer will bring her death.
Everything I said was for fear of the stake.
Have you anything else to tell us?
We have come to prepare you for death.
Now...already?
How am I to die?
At the stake.
I'll bring the last Sacrament.
How can you still believe that you are sent by God?
His ways are not our ways.
Yes, I am His child.
And the great victory?
...my martyrdom!
...and your deliverance?
...death!
Will you take confession?
May the Body of Our Lord
Jesus Christ keep my soul... unto life everlasting. Amen.
Be courageous, Joan.
Your last hour approaches.
Dear God, I accept my death gladly... but do not let me suffer too long.
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise?
Jesus!
You have burned a saint!
The flames sheltered
Joan's soul... as it rose to heaven -
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France...
Joan, whose memory will always be cherished... by the people of France.
Are you Englishmen or are you a lot of foreigners ?
Are you free and independent citizens... or are you a flock of bloomin' sheeps ?
Do you want England to be ruled by an outsider ?
No. No, you says.
Then who is this here Disraeli that he should be Prime Minister of England ?
A Jew whose grandfather was an Italian. A bloomin' foreigner.
Hear, hear !
What's he done for England, I ask ya ?
What's he done ?
Nothing.
Our friend here says nothing.
He must be blind, deaf and dumb...
... as well as intoxicated.
And what does he say now ?
He says Russia is looking at us with eyes of yearning.
That the Tsar has set up in his heart to rule the seven seas.
Bloomin' lot ! I says down with Disraeli.
Gladstone is the man for us.
I consider it an affront...
...to every English gentleman that the destinies of our nation should be in the hands of a person like Disraeli.
A man who poses as a great patriot...
...but who is in reality an unprincipled politician seeking only to gratify his mad lust for power.
And now he wants to involve us in serious international trouble... with this infernal nonsense about
Russia trying to undermine our power in India.
If the fellow keeps on he'll put England on the rocks.
What does the Governor of the Bank of England say ?
I say he's a dreamer. A dangerous visionary reaching out for Empire with greedy hands...
...committing us to a foreign policy of imperialism that makes me tremble for England's safety.
But thank God for Gladstone.
He's more than a match for Disraeli.
Foreign policy such as the right honorable gentleman proposes...
...would not only gain us, and deservedly, the ill will of other nations... but would ultimately involve us in that great calamity: war !
I say that in proposing such a policy...
... the right honorable gentleman has branded himself...
... as unworthy to be the Counselor of England's sovereign.
Unworthy to be the guardian of England's welfare.
Unworthy to hold the high office of Prime Minister.
And now that my honourable friend, Mr. Gladstone, with his customary eloquence and tact, has expressed his customary disapproval... the issue, gentlemen, is this:
Whether you are content to be a comfortable England... meeting in due course with a sad, inevitable fate... or whether you will be a great country... an imperial country... a country where your sons, when they rise... will rise to paramount positions...
...and obtain not merely the esteem of their own countrymen... but the esteem of the world.
Perhaps you think that because no war clouds darken the present horizon...
... that there is no danger.
Have you ever seen one of those moving landscapes of the coast of South America ?
You behold a range of exhausted volcanoes.
Not a flame flickers on a single palid peak.
But beneath... there is a dormant danger that will one day awake.
Dizzy, you're worrying about something.
No, no, my dear.
I sometimes think, but I never worry.
Well, I'll not bother you now about our garden party.
But I'm dying to be bothered.
Mary, my dear, your morning tribute.
Thank you, Dizzy.
Every morning, wherever we are, you never forget.
Nonsense, you know I married you for your money.
Let me see our list of invitations.
Lady Clarissa Pevensey...
...oh, and her father and mother, the Duke and Duchess of Glastonbury.
I'm afraid the Duke and Duchess shiver with contempt at the very name of Disraeli.
But Clarissa will see to it that they come.
Dear Clarissa.
She thinks you're the greatest man in the world.
And she's right.
She's quite right, my dear.
Young Deeford will condescend to come in order to protect Clarissa against my diabolical influence.
I'm quite sure your party will be a great success.
Mary, I want you to invite Borsinov.
Yes, dear.
The Russian Ambassador.
A most agreeable gentleman.
And I also want you to invite Mrs. Travers.
Mrs. Travers ?
Why, we scarcely know her.
That's why I want you to invite her.
I'm anxious to cultivate her acquaintance.
Mary...
Yes, dear.
Where have I met her before ?
Oh, we've met her at dinners...
No...
I mean long ago.
I connect her with something blue and white.
Now, Dizzy, you're off on one of your wild goose chases again.
Blue and white...
Mrs. Strauss.
Oh, my dear Mrs. Strauss.
You're looking more charming than usual.
Pease, sit down.
Did you learn anything ?
We've nothing immediate to fear from Disraeli.
He can't act without Parliament.
And Parliament has adjourned, thank the Lord.
Yes, England has obligingly tied the hands of the one man who might have blocked Russia's plans.
And long before his hands are free we shall have come to terms with Egypt.
Russia will control the Suez Canal.
And Disraeli's dream of British supremacy in Asia...
...will still be only a dream.
But don't forget...
Even whit his hands tied, Disraeli can still get things from up his sleeve.
He must be watched as closely as ever.
Mr. Foljambe is outside.
Oh, show him in.
Husbands always arrive at the wrong moment.
Hello, Foljambe.
Hello, dear.
Cigarette ?
No, thanks.
Anything new ?
Things will be at a standstill at Disraeli's office. until he comes back from abroad.
I got a note from him this morning...
...telling me I might have the rest of the week off...
...and thanking me for my faithful attention to his interests.
I'm afraid the great Disraeli is getting old.
Dear Clarissa.
Dear Lady Beaconsfield.
Viscount Deeford.
My dear, you look charming.
How do you do ?
The spirit of youth and beauty.
Deeford, behold !
Winter hand in hand with Spring.
Innocence with...
Guile ?
Experience.
Same thing.
May I be permitted ?
If something would only happen to Charles to make him human.
Perhaps something may happen to him, my dear.
With the help of Clarissa.
Oh.
What to a man of your sound judgement,
Mr. Disraeli's ideas must sometimes appear...
Utterly impractical.
Wildly fantastic.
The Bank of England's money will never back any of his crazy enterprises...
...as long as I can prevent it.
How fortunate England has men like you.
Why, Mrs. Travers, I...
May I be allowed to join you ?
Oh, yes. Certainly, sit down.
Thank you.
What a heavenly spot this is.
The Prime Minister's garden.
Why do you dislike Mr. Disraeli so much ?
I neither like him nor dislike him.
He's nothing to me.
Don't you feel lonely ?
Lonely ?
You're the only man in all the world who neither likes nor dislikes Mr. Disraeli.
Yes, yes. I know how much you admire him.
But we won't argue about that now.
May you be seated, Lady Clarissa ?
I have spoken to your mother and she has given me her gracious permission to address you.
Was her permission needed ?
Well, I'm rather a stickler for form, you know.
I know.
I consider it my duty to marry.
Yes ?
I am much interested in the working man.
I have plans for building model cottages with improved sanitary appliances.
I trust, my wife and I,
...will show our friends a model English household.... model children, in short a model...
One moment. What have all these models to do with me ?
Have I not made myself clear ?
Since first I had the privilege of meeting you,
I have watched you closely.
And, Clarissa...
May I call you Clarissa ?
I have decided that in time... you will become admirably suited to occupy the position I have adumbrated.
I beg your pardon.
Adumbrated. Outlined.
Oh, thank you.
You will think me very silly, Charles...
May I call you Charles ?
Thank you...
...but is this really an offer of marriage ?
I hoped I had made that clear without offensive plainness of speech.
How wonderful.
Oh, but you have the right to expect a high matrimonial alliance.
I mean the manner of your proposal.
Oh, surely...
You are a young man of 25,
I'm a girl of 19 and you come to me with an essay on political economy.
I'm a man of heavy responsibilities, not a hero of romance.
You will enter a family of which the men have never done anything to be ashamed of.
Have they ever done anything ?
Nothing, thank God, to attract attention.
Well, I think the next thing will be to announce our betrothal.
Not quite.
I'm very much honored, Lord Deeford, but I must decline the responsibilities and the privileges.
I beg your pardon !
Oh, Charles, you've made a horrible hash of the whole thing.
Hash ?
Yes, but please, let me talk or I shall have hysterics.
I did like you.
I liked you very much.
But your model cottages leave me cold, because I know the laborer wants bread, not bricks.
And all those model children.
I want flesh and blood children who tear their pinafores and smear their faces with jam.
But Lady Clarissa...
If ever I marry... and I hope I shall...
I want a husband who is at the bottom and is climbing.
Climbing on hands and knees.
Bleeding hands and bleeding knees.
With his eyes fixed on the summit.
Never mind if he never gets there.
I can help him to climb, and if he falls, I can fall with him.
But Cla...
No, you were born at the top.
You sit in a rarefied atmosphere like the gods on Olympus.
Oh !
I see I have made a mistake.
Well. You refused him, eh ?
Oh, how did you know ?
That back was eloquent of refusal.
You have no sympathy with readymade greatness.
You refused Deeford because he's a mere descendent and not an ancestor.
Well, am I not right ?
Well, he may become an ancestor, you know.
Tell me...
Are you fond of him ?
I like him very much.
If he had simply said, "Clarissa, will you marry me?",
I might have answered just as simply, "Yes".
But he lectured me on model cottages and the model family.
You know, I have a very high opinion of him.
You ? But he has no initiative.
Who knows ?
If the opportunity occurred, he might rise to it.
A man should make his own opportunity.
And it's no use talking.
I refused him and I told him why.
Did you.
Quite frankly.
Did you.
I told him I must have a man with pride.
As he is now, I would sooner marry a bricklayer.
He does lay bricks and he may build a cathedral.
Don't be hard on Deeford.
Go along and tell him you're sorry.
Very good advice, Mr. Disraeli, which I'm not going to follow.
A telegram, sir.
All right.
Personally, I can't endure these Disraelis.
But Clarissa would come...
I can't stand the fellow's confounded assurance.
Pardon me. Sir Michael, will you come into the library a moment ?
There's a little matter on which I particularly want your advice.
Oh, very well.
You'll excuse me.
Mrs. Travers, Duke,
I'm sure you'll forgive me for taking Sir Michael away.
Sit down, Sir Michael, sit down.
I've just had private information.
Khedive Ismail Pasha is in desperate need of money.
As you know, he holds the controlling shares of the Suez Canal.
Probert, this is an unparalleled opportunity for England.
Opportunity for England ?
You don't mean that in earnest.
Pardon me ? In dead earnest.
Do you seriously mean that you're thinking of purchasing the Suez Canal for England ?
I heave seldom meant anything half so seriously.
And you are about to suggest to me that the Bank of England should back you ?
I am.
Until Parliament meets again.
Then let me tell you, sir, at once.
I shall never consent. Never.
Wait a moment.
No, sir. There's nothing to wait for.
I'll not allow the Bank to play ducks and drakes with its money.
On an Egyptian ditch.
An Egyptian ditch ? That's rather neat.
They won't be ducks and drakes because the government will be at your back.
How do I know...
I say so.
Suppose the government falls.
Dear man, it's always falling.
What difference does that make ?
Don't the Conservatives invariably go on just where the Radicals left off...
...and vice-versa ?
Besides, in this case it hasn't time to fall.
This thing must be done within the next three weeks.
Long before Parliament meets.
But why such a hurry ?
Because Russia...
Oh, that ancient bugbear. that ever present peril,
...knows of this opportunity, they'll purchase the highroad to India.
Then why hasn't she purchased ?
She's not ready.
She has no fleets. But she's watching us.
She's watching me.
The spy mania.
And if she sees the slightest move on my part...
... she'll snap up the Canal...
... fleet or no fleet.
Hmm... a pretty woman, Mrs. Travers.
Yes.
Such pretty ears.
Well, sir, after that delightful interlude...
No, sir. Your scheme is hare-brained.
Unconstitutional, and the Bank will be no party to it.
I tell you there is no time...
You exaggerate the importance of the thing.
You have the Eastern imagination.
Because this Canal runs through a desert...
... you see it in a dream. In a mirage.
Neat again.
The Canal is a confessed failure.
Oh...
Whatever doesn't pay is a failure.
The tonnage that passed throuhgh it last year...
Oh, please !
And its filling up... filling up...
Soon the only ship sailing on it will be the.... the ship of the desert.
I mean the camel, sir.
Yes, I thought you meant the camel.
Beware of the East. Remember Pharaoh, sir, remember Pharaoh.
Yes, but what about Moses ?
He was a Jew.
That is, he was privileged.
In short ?
In short, I disapprove of your imperialistic ideas, Mr. Disraeli.
And the Bank will not stir a finger to further that.
Why are you er...
I feared you were getting too warm.
I rejoice to think that I have made this rash enterprise impossible.
Oh, but you haven't.
Where would you go for the money ?
Where Pharaoh went. Where all Christians go.
I shall go to Moses.
At any rate, understand it will be no use coming to me.
This, sir, is definite and final.
Nothing is final, Sir Michael.
In the unlikely event of Moses failing me...
I may send for you again.
And I shall not come, sir.
I think you will.
Dizzy. What were you and Sir Michael talking about ?
Lady Probert's in a dreadful way.
She's missed her husband.
Has she ?
He's missed his opportunity.
Come dear. Everybody will wonder what's become of you.
All right, my dear.
I must get hold of Hugh Meyers.
Hugh Meyers, tha banker ?
Hugh Meyers, the banker.
That's the man, Mary. That's the man.
Be very kind to send that telegram.
Dizzy, you're not worrying about money ?
No, no, my dear.
Probert and I were just talking politics.
There's Deeford.
You know I told you something might happen to him.
Yes.
Well, it has happened.
He has asked Clarissa to marry him.
That will be a good match, I suppose.
Yes, but she has refused.
Mary, I'm going to play fairy godfather and bring them together.
You a matchmaker.
The Prime Minister neglecting his work ?
The less a Prime Minister does, the fewer mistakes he's apt to make.
Thats rather good.
I must say that in the guestroom one night in the house.
I've been searching for a young man.
With such a prize as Clarissa,
Charles may become just what I need.
Think what a splendid couple they'd make.
Oh, Dizzy. Always dreaming a romance.
And living one, my dear, while you are by my side.
Is it Deeford ?
Yes.
Run along, my dear. He's eager to speak to me.
I think he wants to kill me.
Mr. Disraeli.
Hm ?
I know that tone of voice so well.
What do you mean, Sir ?
It's the tone of an angry man.
Now, what can have put you out ?
No, no, don't speak.
Interruptions are annoying.
If they hadn't interrupted me the first time I addressed the House of Commons,
I might have become a vestryman, and respectable.
Really, Mr. Disraeli, you make it difficult to talk to you seriously.
Never talk seriously.
Keep your grave face for your jokes.
I, er... never make jokes.
A man who never makes jokes is a standing joke to the world.
Humor is of several kinds. We Oxford men have a humor of our own.
I know.
An unconscious humor.
Mr. Disraeli...
Clarissa has refused me.
Yes ?
And I, sir, I attribute her refusal to your influence.
I see.
I was thoroughly justified in thinking well of you.
What do you mean ?
You have courage, or you would never say that to me.
And why should I not say it ?
Because it's true.
And when a young man speaks an unpleasant truth to a very old one...
... he shows absolutely reckless courage.
There was no other way.
A hundred.
You take a girl's no as final ?
I suppose she knows her own mind.
Certainly. Make her change it.
How ?
I'm glad you're asking me to help you.
Because I'm interested in you.
Interested in me ?
Deeply.
Why ?
Because England stands in terrible need of men like you.
I can't see that.
England was never so prosperous as now.
She has a wise aristocracy, an industrious middle class, a contented and happy peasantry.
Bravo, bravo !
How many old Tory squires have I heard talk just like that ?
And that's how they've talked since the beginning of things.
That's how they talked when they lost America.
When the Indian mutiny bashed upon us.
When our soldiers froze and starved in the Crimea.
When we deserted Denmark, and when we remained idle while France and Germany flew at each other's throats.
It's just that talk that has lost us all our friendships.
Oh, Continental friendships.
Frog-eaters, bear-swillers.
Is that how you talk to Clarissa ?
I do not discuss politics with women.
I do.
Think, man, think.
England is as isolated as a ship lying off the coast.
Her crew know nothing about what they call the land-lubbers.
They go on shore now and then for a debauch.
But as they only hunt out the vice, they come back with a headache...
...and righteously thank God they're not as other men.
I tell you, a ferment is at work all over the world...
...titanic forces take shape in America.
Forces you have no conception of.
The spirit of nationality is aroused in France, in Italy, in Germany.
New wine is being poured into old bottles and an explosion will follow sooner or later.
I shall not live to see it, but I hear the seething of the yeast.
But you... my God, what things you will witness.
Take care you are not asleep.
All the nations must expand and everywhere our Empire is in their way.
Russia, for instance.
Now, while England stands alone, while France is crippled, and before Germany is recovered... now is Russia's opportunity for snatching India.
With India lost, a whole fabric crumbles and England sinks into insignificance.
A Belgium at sea.
Now do you see why Clarissa refused you ?
These are the things I have shown her.
You wonder she wants a man of action ?
You wonder she's not contented with being a mere Duke's wife ?
I see.
I see, but...
... but what can I do ?
What can any one man do ?
What one man has already done.
You, sir ? But how can I hope to emulate you ?
You can learn. We'll learn.
Will you teach me, sir ?
Yes.
How can I begin ?
Leave your small ideals.
Or better still, grow from small ideals to greater.
You have begun well.
You're putting your house in order.
Now pass on. Pass on to parish. To the Empire.
To parish. How small it seems and...
...everything I've done in politics, how utterly insignificant.
In politics nothing is insignificant.
Contrast it with this question of India.
Whether we hold it or lose it.
What's the solution ? War ?
War is never a solution.
It's an aggravation.
What then is the solution ?
A very small thing.
A thing men are laughing at.
What, sir, what ?
A ditch.
A ditch dug in sand.
A ditch ?
A ditch dug in shifting sand.
You mean the...
I mean that a ditch dug in sand grows the very best celery.
Oh, Mrs. Travers. We were just in the thick of the the most interesting horticultural argument.
Really ?
Yes.
Mary !
Yes, dear ?
Lord Deeford has done me the honor of accepting a secretaryship.
What ?
Lord Deeford working ?
Clarissa, isn't that unexpected ?
Not altogether.
And how he'll have to work.
You'll have so much to teach him.
Mr. Disraeli has already begun.
Yes. I've been teaching him what it took me many years to learn.
What is that ?
My dear lady, that a ditch dug in sand grows the very best celery.
Dizzy, what do you mean ?
Celery ?
Good morning, Mr. Disraeli.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Foljambe.
Good morning, sir.
You didn't tell me Mr. Foljambe was waiting.
He was not here, sir.
These are ready for delivery, sir.
Thank you, Terle.
Dispatches from Russia.
Good, Deeford. Thank you.
You might look over these figures, will you ?
And have those delivered for me.
Is there anything else, sir ?
Nothing else, Mr. Foljambe.
Oh, Mr. Foljambe.
You have the figures about the fortification ?
Yes, sir.
The...
These are the dispatches from Russia, aren't they ?
I beg your pardon, sir.
Quite a natural mistake.
Mr. Hugh Meyers, sir.
Ah, Meyers.
How do you do ?
Well ?
The money is on its way.
From the Argentine.
When will it arrive ?
In three weeks.
Good.
To be placed at my disposal in the Bank of England.
The Bank of England ?
That's rather humorous.
Why ?
I was thinking of Probert.
Oh.
Deeford.
This is Mr. Hugh Meyers.
One of the world's greatest powers.
We have to raise money, you know, for the fortifications of the Gulf of Aden.
I hoped it was something much more romantic than that, sir.
Oh, what ?
The Suez Canal.
Did you ?
You're quite right.
It is the Suez Canal.
Since you've hit on the truth, it's better that I should tell you...
...that until I am ready, not a syllable must be breathed on this matter.
Is that clear ?
On my honor, sir.
Good.
Will you come into my room, Mr. Meyers.
Excuse me, sir.
I forgot to give you your list of engagements.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Foljambe.
Mr. Meyers, this is Mr. Foljambe.
Such a working man.
Let me see... what was the exact amount required for the fortification of the Gulf of Aden ?
You have the papers, you know, the blue one.
I'll find out, sir.
Thank you.
Come, Mr. Meyers.
Do you know why Mr. Meyers is here ?
I'm very busy.
He's not here for any fortification scheme.
He's here for the Suez Canal.
Lady Clarissa Pevensey and Mrs. Travers are here.
Here's an invasion.
Delighted.
Mrs. Travers and I were dying to see how you looked in the throes of toil.
Well, it hasn't undermined my constitution yet.
We expected to find you with a wet towel around your head.
Oh, no, so far I've done nothing but look on.
This is a wonderful opportunity for you.
That will be a bombshell for Probert.
I'm delighted.
Well, well, well.
Come to see the neophyte, eh ?
Ah, Mrs. Travers.
You know, I half expected this visit.
Allow me. Mr. Hugh Meyers,
Lady Clarissa Pevensey, Mrs... Travers.
How do you do ?
My dear ladies, you'll excuse us.
Was this a momentous interview ?
I really cannot tell you.
That means that it was.
How exciting to be in all the State secrets.
But I am not.
I am only an apprentice.
How humbly you speak of yourself.
I know now that I know nothing.
That's a great stride towards your goal, isn't it ?
Is it ?
I think so.
May we ?
Please do. Just let an old woman rest her weary bones.
Agatha !
Shhhh.
Meyers ?
Yes.
About the Canal ?
Yes.
They're agreed.
How do you know ?
Both radiant.
Then ?
Cairo. Start now.
Yes, but I...
Now !
Instructions ?
At Trieste.
Trieste ? How ?
By way of Ostend.
Ostend ?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Travers.
Oh, Mr. Foljambe.
Here are the papers giving the figures you asked for, sir.
Thank you.
The blue one and the white one.
Blue and white.
Curious.
Mrs. Travers, this is Mr. Foljambe.
Such a worker.
How's your poor husband ?
No better, I fear.
Still abroad. Taking the waters, you know.
Will you kindly make my excuses to the young people.
They're out there.
You're not going so abruptly.
I'm sorry, but dear Lady Probert is organizing a bazaar.
Always occupied in good work.
Always with your hand... in some great undertaking.
It's secret too ?
Goodbye, Mr. Disraeli.
Goodbye, Lady Travers.
No, not a step, not a step, goodbye.
Goodbye, Mrs. Travers.
Ostend.
Ostend.
I beg your pardon, sir.
I thought you called.
Charles ! Charles !
Very sorry, sir.
Did Foljambe make any comments about... Meyers' visit ?
Yes. I thought him rather impertinent.
How ?
Shall I go ?
No, no, my dear. Well ?
He asked questions. But I snubbed him.
Finally he had the impertinence to say that you were seeing Meyers about...
Well ?
Am I to speak in Lady Clarissa's...
Yes, go on.
About the Suez Canal.
And what did you say ?
Not a word, of course.
How did you snub him ?
I merely stood up.
And looked at him.
Ooooh !
What, sir ?
What more could you have told him if you talked for an hour ?
Do you accuse me of speaking ?
No, sir, I accuse you of holding your tongue too eloquently.
Oh, well, he's easily muzzled.
How ?
Put him on his parole. I'll fetch him.
Yes, fetch him, fetch him.
Mr. Terle ! Mr. Terle !
Yes, sir. Send for the senior Queen's messenger quickly.
Yes, sir.
Well ? He's not there.
He's not in his room, sir.
No. So, do you know where he is ?
He's at Victoria Station.
Catching the 10:30 express on his way to Ostend, Trieste and so to Cairo.
For God's sake, sir, who is he ?
He's Mrs. Travers' husband.
What ?
Yes. He and she are agents.
Spies Russia has sent here to discover what you have told them.
Have him arrested.
How ?
On what grounds ? What has he done ?
Sir, why did you employ him knowing he was a spy ?
Because I knew it.
Because I wanted to have the man under my eye.
For weeks he has been secretly entering this room. I knew it.
I've planted papers I know he was trying to read.
I had him on the wrong scent when you...
When I blundered.
When you lost control of your features.
Would you tell us why silence is so important ?
Now it's of no importance whatever.
Yes. You ought to know.
So that in future...
Future ? What future is there for me ?
... in future you may learn to control your features as well as your tongue.
Sit down.
Ismael Pasha, the khedive of Egypt, is under the impression that he is Rameses, the Great.
And the only pyramid he has raised is the pyramid of death.
Egypt is a dry bone out of which he has sucked the last ounce of marrow.
The last assets he has are the controlling shares in the Suez Canal.
And these he is dying to sell to the highest bidder.
France built the Canal but is too poor to buy it.
Russia covets it as a means of snatching India.
England has the means of defending it.
Both pretend the purchase is the last thing in the world they're thinking of.
Both are watching each other like cats.
And Ismael sits and waits for the cat to jump.
Those shares I mean to have.
How ?
The Bank of England refuses to back me, but today Meyers is giving me a blank check...
...and I felt the thing was done.
But now Foljambe knows, Russia knows.
In a week Foljambe will be in Cairo and whatever sum they offer he will double.
Now do you see the importance of it ?
There's no remedy.
Of course there is.
What, sir, what ?
I must send a man to the khedive.
With unlimited powers.
Ready to outbid anything, ready to pay on the nail.
What must be the man's qualifications ?
A strong, stern, silent man.
Subtle and cunning.
Fighting wilyness with wilyness.
Have you such a man, sir ?
I've sent for him.
What is it, Clarissa ?
What is it, my dear ?
Oh, I thought for a minute, while you were speaking...
...that perhaps Charles might...
Oh, don't say it. Clarissa, don't say it.
Yes, do say it Clarissa.
Do say it.
For there is another kind of man who might be twice as useful.
What kind ?
A man so honest that the rogues would think him a rogue.
So truthful, they'd swear he was lying.
So simple, they'd never fathom him.
Why laugh at me so ? I feel my folly bitterly enough !
What's the matter, Charles ?
Disgust. Utter disgust with myself and despair.
Why despair ?
Queen's messenger !
Not wanted !
You are the man !
I ?
I am to be trusted with this mission after what I've done ?
Why not ?
Because I'm a useless, conceited idler and a perfect and complete fool.
Well, granting that... what, I didn't say it.
But, granting that, that's a very good reason for sending you.
But I've failed already.
Nearly all my successes are founded on previous failures.
On your own showing, no one will ever suspect you.
You have only to meet all their cunning with that stolid British face of yours...
... and the schemes will be disarmed. Come, will you go ?
Will I go ?
Ah ! There's your man of action, Clarissa.
I warn you: there will be grave danger.
Are you ready to meet it ?
Yes, sir.
I mean danger of death.
Yes, sir.
Death ?
Every step of the way.
Every hour of the day.
Danger lurking in every disguise.
And once he is in Egypt, if his errand be known, his life wil not be worth a moment's purchase.
Oh, I didn't know. I didn't know !
Clarissa, my child. Do you forbid him to go ?
I ? I cannot forbid.
Yes, you can. He shall obey you.
But think a moment. If you forbid and he obeys and I send that other man, how will you feel ?
Clarissa.
You must go !
Well done !
I think I may tell him, may I not ?
That a great reward is awaiting his return.
If I succeed ?
Whether you succeed or fail, eh ?
Good !
Now, then. When can you be ready to start ?
I think I could start the day after tomorrow.
Capital ! That will make the enterprise so much more interesting.
How do you mean, sir ?
Foljambe will have a 48 hours start with Ismael.
You mean I shall be too late ?
I'm trying to convey that impression.
Well... tomorrow then, if it must be.
That's better.
Although Foljambe can do a great deal in a day...
Well, there's a night mail tonight at nine.
Now.
Now ? You don't mean...
I mean in ten minutes.
But my luggage. I shan't even have a clean collar.
Damn your collar. Catch the Dover Express Delivery from Charing Cross.
You'll be in Marseilles tomorrow and in Cairo a day ahead of Foljambe.
A day ahead !
By Jove, I'll do it !
Of course you will.
Now, children...
... say goodbye to one another, while I write your instructions.
Clarissa. Did you hear what Mr. Disraeli said just now ?
The hope he allowed... of reward ?
If he had not said it I should have.
A reward will be mine if I succeed.
Or if you fail.
Clarissa, do you love me, then ?
I love you.
Time's up.
Ready, sir.
Now, then...
Here's all you need.
Money, instructions and the code for telegrams.
I keep the duplicate. Now be on.
No, no ! Departure should be sudden.
Good luck.
Goodbye.
And God bless you.
Well. Now then.
What am I to do ? What am I to do ?
Would you care to go for a drive ?
Oh, you're heartless.
How am I to wait ?
How am I to wait ?
You ? You don't love him.
No ? Then why did I send him ?
Listen ! I've got an idea.
What ?
Come to the country and see peacocks.
Very noble and inteligent birds, I assure you.
Peacocks !
Well, I say they are intelligent birds.
Master, where are we going with that spade ?
What ? Why, bless my soul.
And them dirty boots.
Splendid morning's work, eh, Potter ?
Don't blame me if you caught your death.
Caught me death ? What do you mean ?
'Tis well known you ought to be in your bed.
Why ?
I'm not ill.
Yes, you are.
Mortal dead, you are. Says so in print.
Oh ?
Where ?
Last night's Globe.
I read it with me own eyes.
A highly respectable sheet.
What does it say ?
Says Dr. Williams has been seen going in and out o' here.
And that'd be true, too.
For he just strolled by and left this bottle of stuff for ye.
For me ?
Oh, no.
For Lady Beaconsfield.
Very kind of them to be so anxious about me.
Dr. Williams has been here twice to see Lady Beaconsfield, who had a fainting fit.
And that's all.
Oh, them London newspapers.
Ah, my coffee.
Good morning, Mr. Bascot.
Good morning, sir.
Is your mistress stirring ?
I believe so, sir.
And Lady Clarissa ?
Yes, sir.
Oh !
Good morning, Mr. Disraeli.
Good morning, my dear.
Any news of Charles ?
Not yet.
Not yet, not yet. It should have come days ago, shouldn't it ?
Are you so deeply in love ?
Oh, dreadfully.
Have you had breakfast ?
Oh, breakfast.
Tell me. How's the secret ?
About Mrs. Travers ?
Yes.
You've heard from her ?
Not a sound. She's keeping very quiet.
I don't like people who keep quiet.
She might do a great deal of mischief.
So Lady Beaconsfield has persuaded her to come here today.
I want to have that glorious creature where I can see her.
Ah, Mary, my dear.
Good morning, Dizzy.
Had a good night ?
Of course I have. Slept like a top.
Sure ?
Now, Clarissa, listen to him. He doubts everybody's words.
He doubts mine.
I never can believe anything you say about yourself, Mary.
Do you know what this foolish woman did a little while ago ?
She drove with me one night to the House of Commons...
... when I had to make a very important speech.
The footman slammed the carriage door and crushed her finger in it.
Oh !
Yes.
That poor finger.
And because she knew how distressed I should be...
... she never uttered a sound...
... and bore the agony unflinchingly.
And I knew nothing about it until I got home.
How wonderful.
Wait till you're married, my dear.
You'll be doing just as wonderful things...
... and thinking just as little of them.
Well, if you're telling the truth...
... you shall have your morning offering.
Clarissa, never allude to my health before Dizzy.
Promise me.
It worries him.
And heaven knows he has worries enough without that.
Is anything the matter ?
Nothing... nothing to make a fuss about.
Dr. Williams says I must be careful.
I am, so that's all right.
Now mind, not a word to Dizzy.
A crushed finger again ?
Gladly, every day for his sake.
The last rose of summer.
Thank you, Dizzy.
Telegram, sir.
Oh !
Thank you, Mr. Bascot.
Open it. Open it. Open it !
Mary, do look after that silly child.
While I read this telegram from my tailor.
Ah !
For pity's sake !
It is from Cairo !
What does it say ?
The celery is ripe to cut.
The celery is ripe to cut ?
I must say I hardly think it was worthwhile going to the extent...
What does it mean ?
A great deal more than it says.
Look.
What's that ?
A copy of the code I gave him. See ?
"The celery is ripe to cut".
The parallel sentence: "The Suez Canal purchase is completed and the check accepted.
Dizzy !
He did it !
Yes, superbly !
Oh, thank God ! Thank God !
Clarissa !
Let her cry, Mary, let her cry. It's worth it.
How glad you must be.
Glad, for now that other dream of mine will be realized.
What dream ?
To make my sovereign Empress of India.
Empress of India ?
Ah, sounds well, Mary, doesn't it ?
Mary, you shall be my messenger when the time is ripe.
You, Lady Beaconsfield, shall carry the news to our beloved Queen...
... and you shall be there, and you shall be proud...
... when I stand up to announce the new title to Our Majesty's faithful Common.
Yes, Dizzy, when will that be ?
Oh, some time must elapse.
This must be formally ratified.
Public opinion must be created.
Make haste, Dizzy, make haste.
Impatient woman.
Will Charles come back soon ?
There's another impatient woman, Mary.
I must telegraph this to Meyers.
Yes.
Meyers made this thing possible.
Another Jew, Mary.
There'll be a peerage for him.
How furious old Probert will be.
"Hugh Meyers, London Wall.
The Suez Canal purchase is completed and the check accepted".
But you haven't answered my question !
Will Charles come home soon ?
Yes, with drums beating, trumpets blowing...
...flags flying.
Oh, I don't care anything about that.
And wedding bells ringing.
A station cab !
Can that be Mrs. Travers ?
Mrs. Travers ?
We can't have Mrs. Travers here now.
She'd worm this out of you in no time.
She'd read it in both your faces.
Dizzy, you made me like her.
Well, get rid of her, send her away, kill her.
Put your wits together, both of you.
Tell her I'm very ill.
That I'm very ill indeed.
Hugh Meyers. It's Hugh Meyers !
Show him in at once.
That's splendid. Is it possible he heard the news ?
Would Charles have cabled him ?
No, no. These millionares know everything by a sort of instinct.
If he's coming to tell us, don't spoil its effect.
Don't tell him. I'll spring it on him later.
Ah, Mr. Meyers, delighted to see you.
Good morning.
How do you do, Mr. Meyers ?
Lady Clarissa Pevencey you know.
What happy winds... ?
Can I have a few moments in private with you, sir ?
Oh, these ladies...
Forgive me if I insist.
Why, of course.
Mary...
You'll stay for luncheon.
I'm sorry, that is impossible. But thank you very much.
Come, Clarissa.
Mr. Meyers, I was just about to send you this...
One moment, sir.
I want you to hear me first.
What I have to say...
Well ?
Sit down. Sit down.
Well ?
I don't know how to tell you.
It's so much harder than I expected.
Come, come. Tell me.
Mr. Disraeli...
I... I...
I am bankrupt.
What ?
I didn't quite catch.
Our house is bankrupt.
Bankrupt ?
Meyers bankrupt ?
You're mad ?
I wish to God I were.
You mean you're temporarily pressed, you're in temporary difficulties.
I mean we are bankrupt.
But that seems impossible.
It's the truth.
A house like yours, an historical firm, you might as well say the Bank of England !
So I should have thought.
What have you been doing ?
What... !
Stop. It's not our fault.
Well ?
First our ship with the bullion from the Argentine.
Yes ?
Gone down.
What ?
Scuttled.
You mean...
I mean purposely and criminally sunk.
All the crew saved. A conspiracy.
It will take weeks, months to recover the insurance.
And that is not all.
What else ?
For a long time, ever since our  interview in Downing Street, rumors affecting my credit have been spread abroad.
And now this mysterious wreck.
I'm being pressed.
I see.
On and on this power has been working in the dark.
My liabilities have been bought up... ah, feel angry as you like.
You're justified. I've been an honest man all my life.
And now I come before you in the light of a common cheat... oh !
Mr. Meyers...
I know you, sir.
Tell me... you say some power is behind active in this.
Who do you mean ?
I don't know. They're working through an agent.
And who is that ?
Samuel Llewelyn, a great solicitor.
Does anyone else know ?
Not a living soul.
I've come to you first because, of course, we cannot carry out the Canal contract.
Thank heaven I'm in time.
Thank heaven that has not gone through.
When will it be known, Meyers ?
When will it be known ?
Tonight, tomorrow morning.
Pray the Lord, it shall not !
Get back to town quickly.
Get to your office. Stay there. Stay there !
I must know you are there ! Don't budge if I keep you there all night.
But...
Don't breathe a word of this...
Don't let anyone else. Don't give the slightest hint of anything unusual.
We have to act lightly. Watch your words, watch your looks.
Something may happen.
Something shall happen !
What, sir ? What ?
God knows. God knows.
Mr. Disraeli...
Yes. Yes.
Mary.
Mary !
Yes, dear ?
I want you.
What is it ?
Mary... You've stood by me in many horrible predicaments.
I'm in the worst I was ever in.
Dizzy !
Meyers.
Meyers is bankrupt.
Does that mean we are poor ?
No. No.
Oh, if that were all.
Then ?
Meyers was finding the money for the Canal.
Oh !
Wait !
Deeford has passed the check.
Now Meyers is failed, we can't pay.
And you ?
I ?
Yes, dear.
I want to know how this will affect you.
What does that matter ?
It's all that matters to me.
I hadn't thought of that.
What will happen to me.
Disgrace. Utter and irretrievable.
The kind of disgrace no man can bear.
No man can live through.
Dizzy !
Yes, by heaven I will bear it !
I'll face the nation !
I'll bear it alone !
Not alone dear.
Thank God for you, Mary.
Thank God.
Have you done anything yet ?
So soon ? what could I do ?
Shouldn't we go up to town ?
I can't. I daren't. I can't move secretly.
The Prime Minister can't stir without setting the whole world agog.
The papers have said I'm ill. If I'm seen in Downing Street now during the recess when I'm supposed to be ill...
... every newspaper in the world would grow hysterical.
It's horrible, Mary.
I'm bound hand and foot.
Mrs. Travers.
What ?
Mrs. Travers in a station cab, sir.
I'll get rid of her.
Get rid of her ? Mr. Bascot, ask her to wait...
Show her in when I ring.
Surely you will not receive her now.
We must keep her here.
Why ?
She must stay here. We mustn't let her out of our site.
Dizzy, what is this play acting ?
I'm ill.
Very ill.
If the newspapers have said I'm ill, she'll see the sickest man she ever saw in her life.
Mrs. Travers is here. Shall I send her away ?
No, no, no.
Chain her. Hand and foot.
But, Mr Disraeli !
Shhh.
I'm ill.
Very ill.
Mrs. Travers.
Ah, dear Lady Beaconsfield.
I'm so sorry. I heard Mr. Disraeli was ill.
I didn't know whether to come or not.
I'm sure you can't want to see me.
Is that Mrs. Travers, dear ?
Yes, dear.
Dear Mrs. Travers.
It's so good of you.
I'm very weak. Very weak.
I'm so sorry. What is the matter ?
Well, I'm...
I'm very weak.
I'm very glad to see you. You're so bright.
So young, and so...
How's your poor husband ?
Still abroad. In search of health, you know.
Very sad.
And you have come to see the poor sick man.
Isn't it good of her, Mary ?
Yes, dear.
Do sit down.... there...
... where I can see you.
Sweet Clarissa, more beautiful every day.
I saw the dear Duchess, your mother, yesterday.
She seems very anxious about Lord Deeford.
He's abroad too, isn't he ?
Egypt or somewhere.
Yes, he is abroad.
Yes, he is in Egypt.
I do hope he's not too venturesome.
Cairo is such a dreadful place.
Those Orientals, you know.
One can never trust them.
No...
So sly, and deceitful...
Ah...
Dear sympathetic creature. Isn't she sympathetic, Mary ?
Yes, dear.
But don't be uneasy. We've just heard from Deeford.
Indeed ?
Mary,
Yes, dear.
Isn't it time I had my beef tea ?
You say you have heard ?
What, Mrs. Travers ?
Oh, from Deeford.
Yes, we had a telegram.
Where is that telegram, Mary ?
On the table, dear.
Help me up, dear.
Why, there it is. Under the paper weight.
Read it for yourself, Mrs. Travers.
Heavens, how pale I am.
The celery is ripe to cut.
How odd.
Yes. Why odd ?
Well, that anyone should cable all the way from Egypt about celery.
Well, you know, he's engaged in a very interesting agricultural experiment.
You remember we were discussing that very subject at the garden party.
Oh, yes. And what a delightful party that was.
And all dispersed. Lord Deeford in Egypt, poor Mr. Disraeli very ill...
... Sir Michael Probert out of town...
I beg your pardon ?
A twinge. I thank you so  much.
I've been trying to remember his name all day.
Probert, of course.
Is that one of the famous peacocks ?
Yes. Dizzy is very proud of them. And of the swans.
I've heard so much about them.
May I have a look at them ?
Yes.
He has given them such funny names.
She has the code. Don't let her read it.
Follow her. Stick to her.
Such funny things.
I'll show you their houses.
Oh, please don't trouble.
No trouble.
Mary.
Yes, dear.
You know the Probert country place.
You can drive there in 3 minutes.
I want you to fetch him at once.
I'll order the carriage.
Wait !
Is Mrs. Travers' cab still there ?
Yes.
Well, you can take that.
But if he refuses to come ?
You tell him it's a matter of life and death.
But Mrs. Travers ?
I'll look after her.
Mary !
Yes, dear.
Take Clarissa with you.
I want that woman alone.
That must be signed.
Yes, they are beautiful.
And so tame.
I'm so glad you liked them.
Do come and sit down.
But I really ought to be going.
Oh, no. Do sit down.
Lady Beaconsfield and Clarissa have to go and meet the specialist.
We shall be gone only a very few moments.
Come, Clarissa.
Specialist ? Oh, are you so ill ?
Yes.
But he'll cure me. He'll cure me.
And you should stay and nurse the poor sick man.
I'm dreadfully sorry, but...
You must stay.
Till they come back.
But my cab is waiting.
No. I've sent that away.
Really ?
Now, don't be angry.
What a dainty hand.
Such supple fingers.
So long and thin.
So exquisitely shaped.
Please...
They're so quick to grasp things.
Unconsidered trifles, scraps of paper...
Oh, just let me go. You're hurting me.
You're in such a hurry to get away from the poor sick man ?
To get away and read... the code ?
Well ? What of it ?
Ah... that's better.
That's how I remember you.
Remember me ?
So strange. When we first met at the Duke of Glastonbury's...
... I remembered you, but I couldn't place you.
I connected you with something blue and white.
Milk and water ?
No.
Snow and water.
Mont Blanc and the Lake of Geneva.
Geneva in the '60s.
Russian refugees and their English sympathisers.
A man called Lumley and his ravishing... shall I say... wife ?
No. Comrade. That was the term.
Charming relationship. Delightful couple.
So good to the unhappy exiles. But people are cruel.
Thay said the good Mr. Lumley and his charming comrade were agents.
Decoys in Russian pay, engaged in worming out the secrets of the refugees... in tempting them back to Russia, to Siberia, to death.
And pray what has all this to do with me ?
Ah, what indeed ?
With you, the friend of Dukes and bankers, with Mr. Lumley and his charming comrade... who were driven out of Geneva by the slanderers.
And where do you think I saw him next ?
In Downing Street.
He had changed his name to Foljambe.
I was so sorry for him that I gave him work.
But you did more.
You gave him instructions...
... to hurry to Trieste. Now do I know you ?
Dear Mrs. Lumley Travers Foljambe ?
Well ? And what next ?
Admiration.
Profound admiration.
Until this moment. Today you have disappointed me.
Why steal that ?
Weak. Very weak.
You had only to ask me and I would have told you.
"The celery is ripe to cut" means the Suez Canal purchase is completed and the check accepted.
Poor dear old Lumley has had all that tiresome journey for nothing.
I congratulate you.
Your apple-faced boy has blundered into success.
Ah, that's what any of us do, Mrs. Travers.
A success that will cost you dear.
That's the sort of thing Gladstone will say.
It's what the world will say when it knows that Meyers is bankrupt.
The world knows what ?
Meyers is bankrupt. Bankrupt, bankrupt.
Mrs Travers, I'm very weak. Don't jest with me.
Meyers is bankrupt and his check waste paper.
Wait, wait. It's easy for you to tell me this, but why should I believe you ?
Because it was my invention.
You thought to circumvent me with your apple-faced boy.
What do you say now, Mr. Disraeli ?
You can't expect me to say much.
I am a child in your hands.
Oh, Mr. Disraeli, I'm sorry to hear that you are ill.
I'm so much better.
Mrs. Travers' stimulating company...
Sir Michael Probert.
How do you do ?
But he's not a...
A specialist ? Oh, yes he is.
Why, what's going on ?
If you're not ill, why have you sent for me ?
Probert, sit down.
I want to tell you a little story.
Don't go, Mrs Travers.
This may interest you, too
I repeat. Why have you sent for me ?
I told you I might send for you.
When ? What do you mean ?
When we had our last delightful interview.
Oh, I thought as much.
Your hare-brained scheme.
Moses has failed you and you had to give it up.
Well, it's no use appealing to me...
Moses has not failed me.
... and I've carried the scheme through.
What ?
Do you mean to tell me that you have purchased the Suez Canal ?
The power and the glory of my country were at stake.
I had to act quickly and I had to act on my own responsibility.
Then let me tell you, sir, you have committed a crime.
As Parliament was not sitting to vote the money I had to seek it elsewhere.
Five million sterling, you refused.
I did and I'm proud of it.
I went to the wealthiest private firm, to Hugh Meyers.
A Jew.
Meyers, not being a party man but a patriot, saw the greatness of the idea and stood beside me.
I sent Deeford to Ismael.
Spies got wind of what I was doing and Russia knew.
So Deeford had to go in a hurry. A race for an Empire.
He has succeeded, understand me ?
I put the matter quite simply.
Deeford has bought the Canal and has paid for it with Meyers' check drawn on the Bank of England. Wait !
Meanwhile, Russia has been at work, by the intermediary of one of the most charming women of my acquaintance.
Meyers is bankrupt.
What ?
Yes. Russia has ruined him.
Mr. Disraeli, I warned you of this.
I foresaw it. Your high-handed action has landed you just where I said it would.
You must get out of it as best you can.
It's no use appealing to me.
No, and I will not appeal to you. I will command you.
What ?
You will sign this note giving Meyers unlimited credit.
Meyers ? Are you mad ?
I've never been more sane in my life.
If Meyers's position is saved, we can gain time.
The Bank of England must give him unlimited credit today, now !
You don't know what you're saying.
You don't know to whom you're speaking.
I refuse...
You can't.
I refuse emphatically !
You've mistaken your man. I'm an Englishman.
The head of a great national institution.
And I'm not to be ordered about by... an alien. A Jew.
The alien, the Jew happens to be the better citizen.
Moreover, he happens to be the Prime Minister.
You threaten me ?
Yes, if you force me to it.
Oh, empty threats.
You think so ? If you say the Bank is a national institution... what becomes of that title if it refuses to save the Nation ?
What becomes of you ?
Mr. Disraeli !
When it is known that the lack of patriotism of one man... has placed our country in the position of a person who is trying to pass a fraudulent check...
... expose the nation to the ridicule of the world... lost the Canal, lost India, baffled England, beaten and disgraced her, dragged her through the mud...
What becomes of the Bank ?
You can't touch the Bank !
I'll smash the Bank !
Parliament's granted the Bank it's charter...
Parliament can withdraw it and shall withdraw it at my bidding... your Board of Directors will be swept away... your shareholders bankrupt, the Bank ruined...
... and you displaced.
I am Prime Minister. I can do this...
... and if you don't sign, by God I will !
Now...
Take your paper. I have signed it.
I have signed it to save the Bank.
That's an outrage, that a man like you should have such power.
Oh, Mr. Disraeli, thank God you have such power.
I haven't, dear child, but he doesn't know that.
Oh !
She must on no account be disturbed.
Let her sleep as long as possible.
Yes, sir.
Well ?
Can't tell. I'm very hopeful of the result of this deep sleep.
But I can't say anything more at present.
I can't go. I can't leave her like this.
Mr. Disraeli, I know how you feel,
... but you must go.
I feel bound to remind you that Queen Victoria is going to attend your reception in person.
That is an honor she has never before paid to a Prime Minister.
All the Court will be there.
Every country in the world will be represented.
And all to pay homage to you.
And Mary won't be there.
You know she always loved people to flatter me.
All England will be at your feet tonight.
And Mary won't be there.
I promised her that we would meet the Queen...
... hand in hand.
How can I go through with it ?
The glitter, the music, the dancing.
And what to all the congratulations.
Alone.
You've always been a fighter, Mr. Disraeli.
If it were possible for you to stay I would advise it.
But you cannot break faith with Her Majesty.
The Queen would understand and pardon me.
But you are right. I cannot break faith with the Nation.
I must go.
If there's any change for the worse,
I'll send you a telegram and you can be home in a few hours.
Home ?
Without her, I have no home.
When she wakes...
... give her this.
From me.
What a day this has been for Dizzy, eh Belinda ?
It's all very astonishing.
They say the Queen is delighted with her new title, Empress of India.
And how Disraeli swayed the House when he announced the new title.
Even Gladstone was delighted.
Dizzy is a great man.
Oh, father, so you've come round to that at last.
Well, there's no use denying it now.
I never denied his greatness.
Oh, Meyers, on your legs again.
Thanks to you, Sir Michael.
Yes, yes. Great patriotic idea.
Dizzy and I talked it over long before you came in.
So he told me.
And the Bank was a great patriotic institution... couldn't let it drop.
How fortunate you saw it in that light.
Glad to help you. Glad to help you.
Mr. Meyers.
Lady Clarissa.
The Viscount Deeford has come home.
Yes. To think of it. I've not been allowed to see him yet.
Too bad. Too bad, Why not ?
He only arrived half an hour ago...
... and had to come straight to Downing Street.
Naturally.
They say Lady Beaconsfield is ill.
Mr. Meyers, I'm dreadfully anxious.
Nothing serious, I hope.
I don't know, and I daren't ask Mr. Disraeli.
Her absence tonight is such a horrible disappointment for him.
Of course, of course.
Mr. Disraeli.
Mr. Disraeli.
Dear Mr. Disraeli.
Lady Probert. Charmed, charmed
So sorry dearest Lady Beaconsfield cannot be here tonight.
So is she.
And so am I.
So am I.
No doubt only a passing indisposition.
I trust so.
My dear child.
How is she ? Really.
Don't ask me. I daren't trust myself to speak.
I'm horribly anxious.
Dr. Williams reassured me, or I shoudn't be here now.
Not even to meet the Empress of India.
Her Majesty is on her way.
Before she arrives, I want to thank those men who have so splendidly stood at my side...
... and made our enterprise successful.
First, there's my friend, Mr. Hugh Meyers,
Mr. Meyers...
...concerning whose services I cannot speak too highly.
Next, there's Sir Michael Probert...
... at a moment of grave crisis, he came to my aid against his... shall I say...
... prejudice.
Mr. Meyers, Sir Michael Probert, it is my privilege to inform you...
... that in recognition of your patriotic action... your sovereign has bestowed a peerage upon each of you.
My congratulations.
Thank you.
May I add mine ?
Your grace is most kind.
Lastly, you'll be glad to know that my young friend... who carried through the delicate negotiations... with such consummate tact, I refer to Charles Viscont Deeford...
... arrived in London half an hour ago.
Viscount Deeford !
Charles !
Her Majesty desires to confer the Ribbon of the Bath upon you...
... with her own hand.
Clarissa.
Charles.
My dear.
Oh, hang all these people.
Why didn't you come earlier ?
Well, I had to see Dizzy and get into this rig.
My dear Mr. Meyers.
I beg your pardon, sir.
But this telegram has been waiting.
Charles, I'm frightened.
Why ?
Lady Beaconsfield has been very ill.
You don't mean...
It may be...
...news of her death.
Dizzy,
Mary !
I didn't know.
But the doctor sent you a telegram, dear.
Yes.

THE LAST COMMAND
Hollywood - 1928!
The Magic Empire of the
Twentieth Century!
The Mecca of the World!
To this Hollywood had come Leo Andreyev, a Russian director ...
"Every Russian in Hollywood is in that stack!"
Sergius Alexander
Claims to have been commanding general ...
... of Russian Army and cousin to Czar.
Little film experience --
Works for $7.50 a day.
"Have him report to work tomorrow morning ..."
"... and fit him into a General's uniform!"
"The Eureka Studio calling ..."
"Six tomorrow morning ... studio gate!"
The Bread Line of Hollywood.
"Quit your shovin'!
Who do you think you are?"
"One Corporal!"
"One General!"
"Quit shakin' your head!
How do you expect me to make up?"
"Excuse me, please ...
I can't help it ... I ...
I had a great shock once!"
"Where'd you get the gadget from ... steal it out of a hock shop?"
"The Czar gave it to me."
"What do you know about that? The Czar gave him this beautiful medal!"
"I'm your pal ... I want to show it to everybody ..."
Imperial Russia - 1917.
Proud, majestic, haughty ... seemingly eternal at the ages!
On a dozen far-flung battle fronts, Russia was engaged ...
... in a death grapple with the enemy.
Tireless in the defense of a crumbling empire was the ...
... Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, cousin to the Czar ...
... and Commanding General of the Russian Armies.
"Everything is in perfect order,
Your Imperial Highness ...
... There is no need for you to tire yourself with an inspection."
"The revolutionists have intercepted most of our supplies."
"Let him strut a little longer!
His day are numbered!"
"The days of all who are dragging Russia down are numbered!"
"Only a few weeks more ... but they seem an eternity!"
"We have waited too long to be impatient now!"
"You are ordered to report for passport examination in the morning."
"They are actors playing for the troops and their pasports are in order ...
... but our reports show they are revolutionists ..."
"... she is Natalie Dabrova, the most dangerous revolutionist in Russia!"
"Let's have them up!
He's dangerous enough ...
... and she's pretty enough ... to merit my personal attention!"
"The second time this week you've worn my coat and smoked my cigarettes!"
"If he does it again ...
... remove the coat and shoot the contents!"
"So you two are serving your country ... by acting!"
"A fine patriotic service... when Russia is fighting for her life!"
"Why aren't you in uniform?"
"My lungs are weak."
"Perhaps it is your courage that is weak!"
"It doesn't require courage to send others to battle and death!"
"Put him under arrest!"
"What is this man to you?"
"Nothing at all. He is Leo
Andreyev ... the director of the Kief Imperial Theatre."
"Orders from the General Staff,
Your Imperial Highness!"
"You will, of course, honor us with your company?"
The new Headquarters.
HIS MAJESTY THE CZAR
WILL VISIT YOUR HEADQUARTERS ...
... THIS AFTERNOON
TO INSPECT THE TROOPS
"Recall a division from the front ...
... His Majesty thinks the war is a parlor game."
"We can't spare a division... we need every man!"
"Don't argue! Have a division deloused and re-equipped... and send it here immediately!"
And so, with the flames of war crackling along ...
... a two-thousand mile front, troops bitterly needed ...
... to defend Russia played parade for the Czar.
"Your Imperial Highness, you are urgently needed to dispatch instructions!"
"The show will be over in a minute!"
"Russia relies on you, dear cousin."
After a week ... after thousands of men had spilled their blood...
... to defend a few inches of earth ... there came a lull between storms.
"Where is the lady?"
"I beg you to accept this expession of gratitude for your company."
"That sort of thing should always be done after caviar!"
"The General Staff,
Your Imperial Highness!"
"Hiss Majesty plans to visit the front tomorrow! ...
... It might be advisable to stage an offensive for him ...
... in the morning ... not too early!"
"My troops are not prepared for an offensive! ...
... I will not sacrifice them merely for the entertainment of the Czar!"
"That's what provides fuel for the revolution!"
"Can't you see the man is very ill?"
"I'll show you dirty revolutionary dogs!"
"Aren't you taking a terrific risk in defying the Czar's wishes?"
"I would take any risk to prevent a needless sacrifice."
"Then why do you continue this stupid war?"
"We must have victory! ...
... Defeat means revolution ... and the collapse of Russia!"
"Then you love Russia so much?"
"I would gladly die tonight ... if it would help Russia!"
"Before you die ... won't you at least have coffee with me ... in my room?"
"You are very beautiful!
One could easily fall in love with you!"
"Your hand is trembling!"
"Will you get me my cigarettes, please?
Yours are so strong!"
"Why didn't you shoot?"
"I don't know why
I didn't kill you ..."
"... I suppose it was because
I couldn't kill ... anyone ...
... who loves Russia as much as you do!"
"From now on you are my prisoner of war ..."
"... and my prisoner of love."
A group of obscure people meet to decide the fate of Russia.
"Train Number 476, carrying the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander ...
... and staff, has left for the front!"
"Communicate with our agents at once! Tonight Russia becomes a republic!"
"If we get the right news at the next station ...
... His Imperial Highness will long remember this ride!"
"His Imperial Highness will be here in five minutes! ...
... Let's give him the greatest reception he has ever had!"
"All out, Masters of Russia!
Last stop!"
"People of Russia... you are being led by traitors!"
"We have been slaves too long! Now we are the masters!"
"I'll be your servant just once more! ...
... I'll place the noose around your neck myself!"
"This is the end,
Your Imperial Highness ...
... It is our turn now!"
"Let's hang him in Petrograd... for all the world to see!"
"Look at him! ...
The greatest man in Russia...
... greatest even than the Czar!"
"Make him sweat as we have sweated! ...
... Make him stoke our train to Petrograd!"
"Would His Imperial Highness care for one of his cigarettes?"
"To the locomotive!"
"That woman belongs to me ... she goes with the coat!"
"Don't you understand?
It was the only way
I could save your life."
"I love you!"
"These pearls will pay your way out of Russia!"
"I love you!  I love you!"
And so the backwash of a tortured nation ...
... had carried still another extra to Hollywood.
"Get the extra people on the stage!"
"The director has an important part for you, Pop. You've got to look nice!"
"Is that beard supposed to be Russian? It looks like an ad for cough drops!"
"In Russia, that was worn on the left side. I know because I was a general."
"I've made twenty Russian pictures. You can't tell me anything about Russia!"
"Get me a whip!"
"I have waited ten years for this moment, Your
Imperial Highness."
"The same coat, the same uniform, the same man ...
... only the times have changed!"
"This is supposed to be a trench scene of troops just before a battle ..."
"You are the General in command!"
"The troops are tired of war ... tired of listening to our pretty speeches ..."
"One of them becomes violent ... you strike him with this whip!"
"We won't have to rehearse that scene ...
I know you can use a whip!"
"Music please ... the
Russian National Anthem."
"Wind machine!"
"Lights!"
"Camera!"
"What's the difference who wins this war? ... We're sick and tired of fighting ..."
"You've given your last command!
A new day is here!
Down with your Russia!
"People of Russia, you are being led by traitors ...
... we must win or Russia will perish!"
"The command is forward ... to victory ..."
"Long Live Russia!"
"Have we won?"
"Yes, Your Imperial Highness ... you have won!"
"Tough luck! That guy was a great actor."
"He was more than a great actor ... he was a great man."
