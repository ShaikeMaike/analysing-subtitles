{4413}{4578}The town in the past...
{4728}{4807}Every evening, the high notables|of the small town
{4810}{4887}met at the Golden Unicorn|for the twilight cup...
{4945}{5018}His Ponderousness|the Mayor...
{5153}{5223}His Reverence|the Pastor...
{5386}{5461}His Erudition|the Doctor...
{5689}{5762}His Measuredness|the Notary...
{6071}{6163}... and the new teacher...
{6306}{6420}In other days, the ancient candlesticks|heard every evening the most|important news of the town...
{6423}{6502}But since some time,|the esteemed notables|had but a single topic:
{6505}{6559}the stranger,|and ever again the stranger...
{6674}{6742}One day, a stranger|asked the gravedigger|for the way to the town.
{6745}{6789}To the latter,|he looked strangely known,
{6792}{6836}though he had never|seen him in person...
{7842}{7925}"Who owns the land|beside the cemetery?"
{8003}{8116}"The Municipality has destined it|to the enlargement of the graveyard..."
{8658}{8728}"I hardly believe that|the Municipality is willing to|give away the cemetery land...
{8731}{8783}But, why the devil are you|interested exactly in that one -?"
{8871}{8982}"I'm a much tired wanderer...|I wish to make me a garden here..."
{9027}{9112}"Next to the graveyard - ?!"
{9155}{9264}The stranger's request|gave rise to a fierce debate|among the counselors;
{9267}{9339}but the gold he offered|was highly appealing...
{9976}{10041}The stranger's proposal|was approved unanimously,
{10044}{10125}and he was granted|the graveyard land|for ninety nine years...
{10210}{10269}But the joy of the conceited town-dwellers|was not unclouded;
{10272}{10345}because the stranger had built,|between his mysterious being|and the others,
{10348}{10398}an evenly unclimbable wall|all around his estate...
{10628}{10678}"You can see by yourselves, Sirs!
{10681}{10773}I've run all around the wall,|and found neither door nor gate - !"
{11521}{11551}"Stop your efforts, men!
{11554}{11604}I alone know the door|that opens this wall!"
{12056}{12139}"And nobody has yet found|a door in that weird wall - ?"
{12145}{12201}Second Verse.
{14263}{14314}"It's a good old custom|of the Golden Unicorn,
{14317}{14384}that young couples drink|the first dip from the bridal cup ---
{14387}{14442}And it's easily guessed|that you are sweethearts!"
{17055}{17122}"Excuse me...|do you know where my bridegroom went?"
{17194}{17266}"My dear child, your groom|went away with the stranger,
{17269}{17325}the one that was|sitting at your table..."
{18943}{19035}There are plants, that from|the magic light of the full moon|draw mysterious virtues:
{19038}{19098}mandrake and Salomon's seal,|wolfberry and centaury...
{19101}{19149}Nobody knew better|than the old chemist...
{22713}{22778}"Child, child,|you're quivering by fever!
{22781}{22839}But wait,|I'll make you a tonic tea,
{22842}{22895}and you'll feel better at once!"
{24352}{24396}Hymn XIX.
{24399}{24509}Put me as a seal on your heart,
{24512}{24607}And as a seal on your arm.
{24610}{24732}Because Love is as strong as Death,
{24735}{24827}Passion as steady as Hell
{24830}{24976}Its heat is burning|And a flame of the Lord
{25274}{25392}Because Love is as strong as Death,
{26306}{26379}"Hear, people:|the bell has struck eleven ....."
{27886}{28018}"What do you want, child,|in my kingdom?|I didn't call you..."
{28152}{28261}"I want to know|where's my beloved!"
{29135}{29192}"I did not steal him...|his time was over!"
{29358}{29416}"What you see here,|are the lives of men...
{29419}{29477}They light up and burn|for some time long -
{29480}{29535}And they go out,|when God so decides..."
{30669}{30745}"Believe me, my task is heavy|It's a doom!
{30748}{30822}I'm tired of seeing|the sufferings of men
{30825}{30898}And reaping hate, when I obey to God..."
{31229}{31322}"And is there a way,|to awake an extinct light|to a new life, Death - ?"
{31518}{31591}"No way. You overcome me - ?"
{31594}{31704}"I believe that Love|is as strong as Death - !"
{31924}{32021}"Is your love as strong as death?
{32024}{32139}Will you fight|against the immortal one?
{32142}{32280}I'd bless you,|should you succeed in beating me!"
{32591}{32661}"Here are three lights,|that are about to go out...
{32664}{32715}I put them in your hands,|save them!

 El golem (1920) [ESP] sub spanish (this one is more stable).avi 681MB (714,752,000 bytes)
 which is re-encoded by me using VirtualDub ;)
 for the original one is a bit unstable when playing.
 and because the original file contains the audio data half as much as the video data
 when re-encoding, i used its audio data twice.
after all, this is a silent movie. u may never notice that ;) script :
 from another divx which is English subbed.
 and i added some which are not included in the English subbed divx
 by Babel translator. i don't know Spanish :)
so if you are good at Spanish, you'd better correct this sub.. author : feel_you (http://back.to/nineteen) tool : CCMP comment : 
 you can get this movie's script at http://www.monstrula.de/ or http://www.geocities.com/classicmoviescripts/.
 this sub. is made with the text of another divx above
 for there's no crucial difference between it and script at web.
 this movie Der Golem has two versions: the one made in 1915 and the other 1920
 and the divx above is the one made in 1920 not 1915.
 full title of this movie is Golem, wie er in die Welt kam, Der 
 which in English Golem: How He Came Into the World, The. (just visit http://imdb.com/)

<SYNC Start=19640><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=83151><P Class=ENCC>
The first chapter.
<SYNC Start=87824><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=103278><P Class=ENCC>
The learned Rabbi Loew reads in the<br> stars that misfortune threatens the Jews.
<SYNC Start=111022><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=230620><P Class=ENCC>
I must speak with Rabbi Jehuda<br>
- danger threatens our people.
<SYNC Start=237831><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=312295><P Class=ENCC>
Call all the elders of the<br> community together to pray.
<SYNC Start=319518><P Class=ENCC>
The stars predict disaster.
<SYNC Start=324133><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=440773><P Class=ENCC>
DECREED : AGAINST THE JEWS,
<SYNC Start=443849><P Class=ENCC>
We can no longer neglect<br> the popular complaints against the Jews.
<SYNC Start=449604><P Class=ENCC>
They despise the holy Christian ceremonies;<br>
They endanger the lives and property
<SYNC Start=455308><P Class=ENCC> of their fellow-men;<br>
They practice black magic.
<SYNC Start=461125><P Class=ENCC>
We decree that all Jews shall leave<br> the city and all territory in sight of the city
<SYNC Start=466891><P Class=ENCC> before the month is ended.<br>
-Imperator
<SYNC Start=472257><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=547716><P Class=ENCC>
Knight Florian, deliver<br> our edict to the Ghetto.
<SYNC Start=554265><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=583575><P Class=ENCC>
Venus enters the constellation of Libra!<br>
The auspicious hour has come
<SYNC Start=589247><P Class=ENCC> to summon the dread spirit Astaroth,<br> and compel him to reveal the magic word.
<SYNC Start=596408><P Class=ENCC>
Then we can bring the Golem<br> to life to save our people.
<SYNC Start=601686><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=842571><P Class=ENCC>
A messenger from the<br>
Emperor is here.
<SYNC Start=848037><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=889624><P Class=ENCC>
Come with me to the High Rabbi Loew,<br> who is like a father to our whole community.
<SYNC Start=901436><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1082562><P Class=ENCC>
It was I who drew the Emperor's horoscope.<br>
I warned him twice of danger.
<SYNC Start=1088101><P Class=ENCC>
Tell him now that i humbly<br> request an audience with him.
<SYNC Start=1094290><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1166679><P Class=ENCC>
The second chapter.
<SYNC Start=1196875><P Class=ENCC>
The hour has come.<br>
The stars favor the wizard.
<SYNC Start=1206827><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1275677><P Class=ENCC>
Guard this secret<br> with your life.
<SYNC Start=1281780><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1317473><P Class=ENCC>
Knight Florian brings<br> the Emperor's answer.
<SYNC Start=1324183><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1556366><P Class=ENCC>
In memory of your services<br> we will grant you an audience.
<SYNC Start=1562922><P Class=ENCC>
Come to the festival at the castle,<br> and amuse us again
<SYNC Start=1570390><P Class=ENCC> with your magical arts.
<SYNC Start=1574126><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1651020><P Class=ENCC>
You shame me, but I will<br> soon have a guardian for you.
<SYNC Start=1658732><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1689413><P Class=ENCC>
If we can compel the powers of darkness<br> to reveal the magic word,
<SYNC Start=1710017><P Class=ENCC> we can bring the Golem to life.
<SYNC Start=1718870><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1733650><P Class=ENCC>
Who will know the magic word?
<SYNC Start=1739506><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1759652><P Class=ENCC>
NERYO MANTJE<br>
The message to give back the dead to the life.
<SYNC Start=1771242><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1774879><P Class=ENCC>
He who possesses the key of Solomon<br> can force Astaroth to reveal the word.
<SYNC Start=1804688><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1828154><P Class=ENCC>
The hour has come!
<SYNC Start=1834048><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1954369><P Class=ENCC>
Astaroth, Astaroth, appear!
<SYNC Start=1963293><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2000394><P Class=ENCC>
Tell me the magic word!
<SYNC Start=2008450><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2081312><P Class=ENCC>
The word, that so terrible word,<br>
I have snatched it.
<SYNC Start=2091335><P Class=ENCC>
Now I give back the Golem to the life

A strange crew.
<SYNC Start=2278968><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2368979><P Class=ENCC>
This is my new servant, Golem.
<SYNC Start=2374086><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2382504><P Class=ENCC>
The Golem's first appearance on the street.
<SYNC Start=2387670><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2510485><P Class=ENCC>
This is the Rabbi's new servant.<br>
He cannot speak, but he will not harm you.
<SYNC Start=2517995><P Class=ENCC>
He will come to you each day,<br> with a list of the articles we need.
<SYNC Start=2525506><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2685233><P Class=ENCC>
I go today to show the Golem to the Emperor.<br>
Stay and guard the house.

The Rose Festival
<SYNC Start=2782570><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2833442><P Class=ENCC>
At the time appointed by the Emperor<br> for the arrival of your father,
<SYNC Start=2839843><P Class=ENCC>
I will leave the castle and come to you.<br>
I have bribed your warden.
<SYNC Start=2846244><P Class=ENCC>
Place a light in your window as a sign that<br> you are waiting for me.

He is my creature, called Golem.<br>
More I may not tell you.
<SYNC Start=2989788><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3076672><P Class=ENCC>
What manner of miracle will you<br> show us today, strange magician?
<SYNC Start=3086598><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3093913><P Class=ENCC>
I will show you our people's<br> history, and our patriarchs.
<SYNC Start=3102945><P Class=ENCC>
And if you value your lives,<br> let no one speak or laugh.
<SYNC Start=3111978><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Moses, the eternal Jew.
<SYNC Start=3235841><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3453628><P Class=ENCC>
We are saved!<br>
The Emperor has withdrawn his decree.
<SYNC Start=3459666><P Class=ENCC>
Awake the sleeping brethren<br> with the joyful sound of the Schofa-horn!
<SYNC Start=3465704><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3678011><P Class=ENCC>
Let us rejoice!
<SYNC Start=3693019><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3737421><P Class=ENCC>
If you have brought the dead to life<br> through magic, beware of that life.
<SYNC Start=3747523><P Class=ENCC>
When Uranus enters the house of the planets,<br>
Astaroth will demand his creature.
<SYNC Start=3757625><P Class=ENCC>
Then the lifeless clay will scorn its master<br>
& turn to destroy him and all it meets.
<SYNC Start=3767727><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3773228><P Class=ENCC>
Your task, Golem, is fulfilled.<br>
Be lifeless clay once again,
<SYNC Start=3780652><P Class=ENCC> lest the powers of darkness<br> take vengeance.
<SYNC Start=3788075><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3806930><P Class=ENCC>
Master, Jehuda waits below<br> with the elders to escort you
<SYNC Start=3814400><P Class=ENCC> to the synagogue<br> for the ceremony of thanks.
<SYNC Start=3821871><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

SECRET OF A SOUL a Psychoanalytic Film
Inside every person there are desires and passions which remain...
...unknown to "consciousness".
In the dark hours of psychological conflict...
...these "unconscious" drives attempt to assert themselves....
...Mysterious illnesses arise from such struggles, the resolution...
...and cure of which form the field of psychoanalysis.
In the hands of the "psycho- analytically trained" doctor...
...the teaching of university professor Sigmund Freud...
...represent an important advance in the treatment...
...of these types of psychological illnesses.
The events in this film are taken from life. They do not deviate in...
...any important factual way from the actual medical case history.
"HELP!!!"
"Last night... with a razor...!"
"Come...
Papa's expecting us!"
Woman Gruesomely Murdered
"I'm from the homicide department.
We'd like to know if you observed...
...anything relevant to the crime committed last night in the house nearby."
"No... we just heard the cries for help this morning!"
Meanwhile... a surprise was waiting by the hearth.
"My friends! I am finally swimming toward home...
...Sumatra lies behind me, and in a short while
I shall be with you...
...I am sending these
'guest present' on ahead."
The Dream
Sincerely
Your Cousin Hans
"I dreamt terrible things...
It was horrible...!"
"Your wife says that her cousin has arrived."
"You must excuse me...
I cannot eat with you."
"I can't touch the knife!"
"You left this key lying in the café!"
"Is there some reason you're reluctant to enter your house?"
"Sorry, it's part of my job."
"My friend left his house last night, greatly agitated...
...and has not yet returned.
We're very concerned..."
"We fear an accident... since the murder in the neighboring house...
...my husband has been completely distraught..."
"We've received no reports of any accidents...
...Incidentally, the murderer was arrested today in Munich!"
"...and worst of all...
...last night I felt a sudden compulsion to kill my wife...
...whom I love more than anything...!"
"Do you know of no one who can help you?"
"You mean Dr. Orth.
He lives just across the way."
"I didn't expect that we would meet again so soon."
"I'm coming to you because
I'm totally distraught!...
...Tormented by inexplicable fears...!
...It is impossible for me to touch a knife...!"
"We do know of such illneses... and also of the possibility of their cure."
"But that's not all...!"
"I am  happily married and yet... yesterday evening...
...I was overcome with an almost irresistible urge...
...to kill my wife... isn't that crazy...?"
"No... but it may be a sign of serious psychological illness!"
"There's no reason to despair."
"Perhaps I can help you.
There is a method...
...called psychoanalysis...
...that I like to apply with such illnesses."
"I've reserved a room at a hotel.
Believe me, it's better that way."
"I'm taking charge of your husband's treatment."
"It is better during the treatment period, which will...
...last several months, that your husband does not live at home."
"That is everything, doctor!"
No... that is by no means everything. You can be cured...
...only when we have worked together to uncover...
...the 'unconscious' psychological conflicts which led to your illness!"
"You will start by telling me everything you see in your mind's eye!"
"Don't hold back anything because you think it is unimportant or nonsensical!"
"Thoughts will come up that you may not wish to express...
...Tell them to me anyway."
"A few day ago... in the morning...
...in my wife's bedroom...
I suddenly heard..."
"HELP!!!"
"Last night... with a razor...!"
"The impressions of that morning shook you greatly...
...psychologically...
...Had you recently quarreled with your wife?"
"No!"
"I grew up with my wife...
Marriage to her has given...
...my life its meaning."
"We were deeply in love, and wanted children... but..."
"Did something... happen... to cause you to give up hope of progeny?"
"I don't know... but lately...
...I have been plagued by terrible fantasies...
...I have seen my wife in shameful situations...!"
"What are the characteristics of this man who has appeared to you in these fantasies?"
"Wait a minute...!"
"I think I recognize him now... it's my childhood friend...
...my wife's cousin."
"Did your wife give you a reason to be jealous of her cousin?"
"He is my best friend.
Shortly after our wedding...
...he left us... to go to the tropics...
...I was never consciously jealous of him...
"As he took his leave from us...
I felt a strange emotion stirring in me..."
"Then, years went by.
On the day...
...before the outbreak of my illness...
...we received a letter from him that he was returning..."
Months passed of arduous work by doctor and patient...
...Finally today... an important new memory...
...rose to consciousness in the parient.
"On the night before the outbreak of my illness there was a bad storm."
"I had terrible dreams that night!"
"Since we have learned to interpret it...
...the dream has become the most important door...
...to our knowledge of the unconscious!"
"The images are muddled..."
"I don't want to look at them!"
"You may not give in to this resistance!"
"Arriving today at 10:30 a.m.
... Cousin Hans."
"When I got the telephone message that our cousin had arrives..."
"That is a typical mistake to make when receiving news...
...that is 'unconsciously' unwelcome."
"In the dream I stood before an Indian idol..."
Sincerely
Your Cousin Hans
"Why is this exotic image in your dream?"
"In the dream, a small Italian city...
...one I saw frequently on our honeymoon...
...emerged before my eyes...
...A bell tower grew steeply up out of the ground..."
"The laughing of these three women's heads was terrible!"
"Did you recognize the women?"
"These humiliations hit you in your most vulnerable spot!"
"Then, in the dream,
I stood before a prison cell...
...and looked through the bars."
"What did you see?"
"In your nightmare, the small wound on your wife's neck...
...flowed together with the crime in the nearby house...
...for this reason you saw yourself condemned as a murderer."
"These dream fantasies led, in your consciousness...
...to a morbid aversion to touching a knife."
"So this psychological illness kept you from killing your wife!"
"Were you finished with your dream of the trial?"
"No... I saw water... turbulent, dark water!"
"It has long been known that dreams of water...
...signify 'imminent' or
'wished for' birth...!"
"She gives the doll to her cousin!"
"Did you ever experience anything similar...
...in your childhood?"
"Back then she gave
'our' doll to her cousin!"
"The pain that you experienced when your wife gave 'our doll'...
...to her cousin has remained awake in your childless marriage!!"
"In the dream I got into a furious rage..."
"Have you notices what you're holding in your hand?"
"I am able to touch a knife again..."
"I've got a lot to apologize for!"

Act One
Schigolch!
You've come a long way
We haven't seen each other for ages
Do you still dance?
You've forgotten ewerything.
You should have stayed with me
In the old garret? I'd have run away
Chief Editor Dr. Schön looks after you nicely but he can't guarantee our future
You deserve to appear before a big audience. I've brought along just the man for that
Rodrigo Quast. He wants to stage a variety act with you
Dr. Schön is coming!
I'm getting married
Won't you kiss me, just because you're getting married?
Our relationship is the talk of the town. I'm risking my position
Don't you understand it's all over between us?
You'll have to kill me if you want to be free of me
He was my first ... patron
One does one's best
End of Act One
Act Two
The Minister of the Interior,
Dr. von Zamikov, wishes to announce...
...the marriage of his daughter
Charlotte Marie Adelaide...
...to Dr. Ludwig Schön
I warn you again: Dr. Schön's behaviour makes this marriage impossible
Father, I'm not bothered by what people say
Here are the costume designs for your revue, Alwa
What is Lulu doing?
Father must give her up. His wedding cannot be postponed any longer
The famous Rodrigo Quast wants to do a big variety act with me.
We're rehearsing
Alwa is my best friend. He is the only one who wants nothing from me
Or perhaps you want nothing from me because you don't love me?
Dear Geschwitz, you must design such a costume for me
Is she really this beautiful?
I forbade you to come here!
I haven't come to see you
Alwa
Please get me Volume K of the dictionary
Very well. Come and see me tomorrow
Why don't you marry Lulu, Father?
One doesn't marry such women.
That would be suicide
What did she want?
She wants to be in variety. Someone wants to do a trapeze act with her
No trapeze! Use her in your revue.
My newspaper will guarantee its success
One thing more: beware of that woman
End of Act Two
Act Three
Nonsense! Wouldn't you rather do the trapeze act with me?
I'm not going on!
Bring her to her senses!
We'll do our variety act after all
I'll dance for the whole world, but not for that woman
Tell them to start
Where is Lulu?
Smoking forbidden here!
Satisfied, Alwa? Now I'll marry Lulu.
It will be the death of me
End of Act Three
Act Four
I'd be a right scoundrel if I didn't lay a rose on my little Lulu's bridal bed
Father, I'm going away tonight ... for a long time
He's my Father!
If only you'd come with me
I can't live without you any longer
You'll miss your train
Take it
Kill yourself!
Kill yourself, so you don't make me a murderer as well!
End of Act Four
Act Five
Your Honours. I have painted a picture of a tragic life
Members of the Jury.
Look at this woman
Have I not shown that this woman did not commit murder?
Her husband was the victim of tragic circumstances
Did not the son of the deceased speak in her defence?
No, this unfortunate is not a murderess.
You must acquit her, she is innocent
Your Honours. Members of the Jury
The Greek gods created a woman:
Pandora. She was beautiful, charming, versed in the art of flattery
But the gods also gave her a box containing the evils of the world
The headless woman opened the box and the evils were loosed upon us
Counsel for the Defence portrays the accused as a persecuted innocent
I call her Pandora, because she brought evil upon Dr. Schön
The arguments of the Defence do not sway me. I demand the death penalty
Prosecutor! Do you know what would have become of your wife if she had spent her nights as a child drifting around cafés?
... sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter with the four and a half months already served ...
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
End of Act Five
Act Six
Passport.: Alwa Schön
How dare you come here?
Where else can I go but home?
If you feel at home where my father bled to death ... I must leave!
Is that the District Court?
I want to speak to
Prosecutor Von Bodungen
This is Alwa Schön. Have you any news of the escapee?
We'll go away together. Countess
Geschwitz will lend me her passport
Passport.: Countess Augusta Geschwitz
I have the lady's baggage
"5,000 Marks Reward'
Received with thanks.
Marquis Casti Piani
Marquis Casti Piani
May I prove my friendship by giving you good advice?
Do not go to Paris, there are so many prying eyes. Come with me.
I know a place where people are hospitable ... and discreet
End of Act Six
Act Seven
Lulu has been living here for three months
A fine hotel. Hospitable and discreet
What's wrong? It's how we live
I've just got engaged. I'm going to stage a fantastic variety act with my fiancée
But we need 20,000 francs to stage it
You must give me the money
Ask Alwa, perhaps he has won today
If I could carry on playing
I'd win it all back
That boy gets everything
You should only play when you're sure of winning
How much?
300 pounds
The German police would give me 250 pounds
300, then. I'll go and book a cabin
He's acting as if he wants to buy me
I need money urgently. You can't give me any.
The Egyptian will pay me 50 pounds more than the German police. You're lucky
I'm securing your future.
The police will never find you in his
Cairo establishment
Get ready quickly.
You're leaving in an hour
I won't be sold. That's worse than prison
I need money. If you aren't ready in an hour I'm calling the police
Alwa, you must win, you must.
Otherwwise I'm lost
If I don't have the 20,000 francs by tonight I'll report you to the police
Money ... everyone wants money
Cry, my child, cry
Rodrigo will report me to the police.
Save me
I'll show him!
I know how we can all get out of this mess
Countess Geschwitz fancies you and she has money
Be nice to her, then I'm sure she'll cough up
Only you can save me
Rodrigo is madly in love with you
Throw yourself at him, he'll do anything for you. Otherwise, he'll report me
Calm down, you'll soon have your money
Police!
Police! Police!
Hurry! I'll find a boat!
We must find a ship to take us to London
End of Act Seven
Act Eight
We only take in order to give.
Brother, how can I help you?
No one can help me
It's funny how you can get booze on credit, but not bread
Why put on the paint?
We like you as you are
What a pity! I wanted to eat Christmas pudding once more in my life
Warning to the Women of Londonl
For some time now...
...a man has been trying to lure
women and girls to dark places...
...in order to murder them
Women and girls should not
go out alone at night
I have no money
Come on, I like you
You're under the mistletoe, you must let yourself be kissed

Well, we finished earlier than Ike and I expected.
- Are you going anywhere?
- No, I don't think so.
So the next time, I changed to another tailor, but found out that he was no better than the first.
I bought some pretty expensive cloth and took it to him and you should've seen the mess he made of it
I told him I wouldn't pay for the thing, but the trouble is, he's got my material.
Well, I left the suit with him and it's been there ever since.
- Good evening Miss White.
And how are you?
- I'm all right, thanks.
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
Have you come to take Frank for a walk.
Yes
- That's right.
- Well, I must push along.
- Good-night.
- Good-night Frank.
- Well dear.
- I've been waiting here half an hour for you.
- Good-night Sean.
- Good-night Frank.
Good-night George.
- Sorry sir. Full up. You'll have more room upstairs.
- Goaaannn.
I think I told you, there's more room upstairs!
Sorry Sir. Full up here. There's more room up...HEY!
Frank. I've lost one of my gloves.
I think I left it at the other table.
- Is this it?
- Yes, thanks.
Thought so, there's a hole in two fingers.
Would you like a pair of nail scissors for Christmas?
- Funny, aren't you?
- Oh Miss, Miss!
It's no good being impatient, you'll have to wait your turn.
What's the matter with you today?
Got out of bed the wrong side?
-I don't like waiting about for you.
Oh, don't you? Oh, Miss!
Do you expect the entire machinary of Scotland Yard to be held up to please you?
You and your Scotland Yard
If it weren't for Edgar Wallace nobody'd ever heard of it.
Funny, aren't you?
Anyway, what's the hurry? We're only going to the pictures, we've got all evening.
- Well, I don't think I want to go to the pictures.
- Oh, and why not?
-I've seen everything worth seeing.
- You haven't seen "Fingerprints".
I'd like to see that.
Still it's about Scotland Yard! might be amusing. They're bound to get all the details wrong.
I don't see why. I did hear they'd got a real criminal to direct it.
- So as to be on the safe side.
- Oh, oh Miss!
Oh, blast!
Well, I've ordered.
- I'll go to the pictures with you, if you like.
- uh, changed your mind.
Have you got an ashtray Miss? I never seem to get an ashtray where I sit.
Frank, Frank. I've changed my mind again.
- About what?
- About going to the pictures.
- You mean you don't want to go again?
- No, not particularly.
- Why not?
- I don't know , I just don't want to.
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not enough … oy, Miss!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get the bill.
I'm about fed up with you. lf you don't want to go, I do.
- Oh all right, I'll come too.
- oy, Miss!
Oh, don't let's have a row. I'm sorry.
I know I've been rather beastly today.
- Miss!
- Frank, I've said I'm sorry.
Here, that will cover it.
Hold on. I live here.
Do you? Then you needn't come any further.
Oh, no now I said that I'd see you home, and I will.
But I'm only just around the corner.
Do you know Whites? The newsagent?
- Yes?
In the Kings road?
Yes.
- That's my father.
No!
Yes.
Now isn't that fine?
Then we're neighbors.
- Have you ever seen an artist's studio?
- No, I'd love to.
- Come up and see mine.
- Oh, I can't now. Another time.
- Why not now?
- Why, it's so late.
- Are you frightened?
- No, course not.
Then why not now?
No, really. Thanks awfully.
I must be getting home.
- You are frightened.
- I'm certainly not … take more'n a man to frighten me.
Yes...that's what I thought....at first.
- What is the time?
- Not very late.
- Come on. What's the harm.
Oh, no harm really. Besides, I always think a girl knows instinctively when she can trust a man.
Yes, of course she does.
Do you trust me?
- Alice? May I call you Alice?
- If you like.
Come on.
- Oh Mr. Crewe. Before you go in, could I...?
- Excuse me, miss.
No!
That chap's nothing but a sponger.
Always pestering people up and down this street.
Well, here we are.
I'm right up there. Top!
Excuse me a minute, will you?
I say, I'm awfully sorry. I won't be a minute. You start walking up.
That's all right.
Oh good evening. Sorry to disturb you.
About this note, did he leave any message?
No, he wouldn't leave any message.
-Have you seen him before.
- Yes, the same gent what called here several times.
Thanks very much.
Goodnight.
Bit of a climb, wasn't it?
What a lovely room. Did you do it all yourself?
Hardly. I say, do you feel cold?
I think I'll light the fire.
- I say. That's good, isn't it?
- Oh that? Yes, that's a new one, just finished.
- How do you hold this?
- What?
Oh, that.
That's easy. I'll show you.
Oh Lord, not like that. Let me show you.
You take this and hold it like that, you see...Then you get the brush and hold it there. You try.
- Like this?
- Yes.
- Oh, look what I've done.
- Ooo, yes
- Draw something Alice.
- Shall I?
- Yes.
Rotten.
Never mind. We'll finish this masterpiece together.
Now you hold the brush. Steady.
There we are.
You are awful.
Wait a minute.
There. Already a pick ahead of me.
I'll go and get those drinks....Right you are.
I say, how would I do for one of your models?
That's an idea.
- Let's see it on you.
- Do you mean, put it on?
Yes, why not?
- Oh, it's so strong!
- Go on.....
Oh no, I don't think so. Besides I have to go home soon.
I see.
Pity. I would have like to have sketched you in it.
- Would you have really?
- Yes, but perhaps you are right. It wouldn't suit you.
I bet it would.
- Shall I really try it on?
- Yes, will you?
- All right.
- Good.
- Think this will be big enough for me.
- What?
- I said, do you think this will be big enough for me.
- Yes, I think so.
- Go on, play something.
- Wait a minute, how does that thing go?
I know.
And that's a song about you my dear.
You haven't said how you like it.
Marvellous.
- I can't do it up.
-Wait a minute. Where is this trouble?
- I can't do it all up.
- Never mind.
- How do I look?
- Wait a minute, it isn't quite right.
Put your hands there.
- I better go.
- I say.
I've got it.
- Please give it to me.
- All right, come on out.
There it is.
Don't be silly Alice. Don't be silly.
No, no, let me go! Let me go!
No, no....
- Who did you say it was?
- Mr. Crewe!
- Mr. Who?
- No! Crewe, I tell you! It's horrible!
- All right. Don't you worry. I'll send round straight away. What number did you say?
Seven or eleven?
- What?
- 31, I said.
- No, no, 31.
- Ah good. Just take a look around, will you?
- Right you are sir.
- Alice, wake up.
Anyone'd think you hadn't been asleep all night.
What do you think!? There's been a murder last night, round the corner.
They tell me the police are round there now.
We'll all be murdered in our beds, soon, I'm sure we will.
'cause I don't  think the police are what they were.
Morning, Alice. 'eard about the murder?
- Yes, I heard.
- Do you remember Frank's telephone number dear?
- No, but here, you'll find it in the book.
- I mean, some murders are so different to others aren't they?
Pushed his lady friends under the water when they was having a bath
What was his name? you remember?
I think that was ever so beastly.
It gave me the shivers.
After I read about it, I didn't dare 'ave a bath for a month.
An' for weeks after that I only used to 'ave a rinse down.
What was his name? You remember,
Smith, wasn't it?
What's wrong Alice? You don't look very cheerful this morning.
-You do look a little bit peeky, I must say.
- Dad, Alice, breakfast.
Good-morning, Mr. White.
- Good-morning, Sir, good-morning.
Breakfast!!!
I couldn't look bak'n in the face after what happened last night and under our very noses.
Mind you, I don't think, meself, it's all together the police's fault.
What I mean is, they 'ave to wink at some things.
I mean it's one thing to buy chocolates out of hours, but it's quite another to stick a knife into a gentleman.
I must say I feel the same way about that too.
A good, clean, honest whack over the 'ead with a brick is one thing....
...something British about that. But knives?
No. Knives is not right.
I must say that's what I think and that's what I'll keep.
Whatever the provocation,
I could never use a knife.
Now, mind you a knife is a difficult thing to handle.
I mean any knife.... knife.... knife.... a butcher's knife!
- Alice, cut us a bit of bread, will you?
Knife.... knife.... of a knife.... 
...you come up against a knife!
I mean, in Chelsea you mustn't use a..
KNIFE!
- Dear, you ought to be more careful.
You might have cut somebody with that.
Customer.....
- No news of the murder yet?
- No, not yet.
- Thank you. Good-morning.
- Well, I must be going. I can't stand here gossiping all day like some people.
Chatter, chatter, chatter.... give
'em a chance to talk about other people's business, and they'll take it.
- What's the matter Alice?
Had another row with Frank?
- Another customer Alice.
- Good morning, Alice.
- Dear, it's Frank. Hello Frank.
- I say, have you 'eard about our murder?
- Yes, they put me on it.
- Did they? That's good isn't it?
Well, I hope you get him Frank!
- If they do, that will mean promotion, won't it?
- D'you reck'n you'll get him soon?
- Well, uh, I don't know.
-Well, I came in here to phone.
- That's all right.
-  Alice? Come here a minute will you?
- Well I must be going now. Good-bye,
Mrs. White, good-bye,  Mr. White.
Now you two.
- Sssshhhh.....Be careful...
What happened last night?
Why don't you tell me?
Look, you know where I found that?
It's the only piece of evidence that you were there. I'm keeping it back at present.
For God's sake, say something!
- If you're not using the phone...uh, may I?
I, uh, I want to get on to Scotland Yard.
- I say.
- I want the best cigar in the shop.
Certainly sir. Perhaps you'd like to telephone while I get it down?
- No thanks, that can wait.
- What does he mean?
- Very well sir. Now, uh, what sort of a cigar would you like sir? I've got..
I' ve got 'enry Clay or Corona, Corona?
- Corona.
- Certainly sir.
- Any news of the murder.
- No, nothing yet.
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no news.
- Are you, uh, quite sure?
- What the hell business is it of yours, anyway?
- You know, I looked everywhere for that other glove last night.
But, of course, you detectives are better trained at finding these things.
- Ah, here we are sir.
- Excuse me, will you?
Thank you.
Oh, they look good.
- They ought to. I've had ' em for years.
Is it all right sir?
- Yes, I thought the top was broken, but it's all right.
- Have you a light?
- Yes, here you are.
- How silly of me, hadn't noticed it.
- Uh.. all right sir?
- Oh, ha, of course, sorry.
Extraordinary actually...
I can't quite...
I say... would you pay for this?
Is this gentleman a friend of yours, Frank?
Well, we're not exactly friends. At least not yet.
But we're going to do a little business together, aren't we, Frank?
I'll look after the shop, Father.
You go and finish your paper.
What for?
Oh....all right my dear, all right.
Rather unfortunate that poor man died around the corner last night.
Look here you....
Perhaps it's rather fortunate, that your little secret only came into the hands of a man like me.
D'you know, there are some men who would make money out of a thing like that.
What a chance for blackmail.
Oh, oh that's awful.
I couldn't do a thing like that.
Morning, Miss. Two of each there.
By the way. You're a detective.
Let me give you a tip.
Don't wave important clues in telephone boxes. They've got glass doors.
You know, uh, detectives in glass houses shouldn't wave clues.
Come on, out with it. What do you want?
What do I want?
Oooooh, well, uh...
Couldn't we discuss that over breakfast?
Mother this is a friend of Frank's. Mr.?
- Tracy.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Mr. Tracy, would you like something to eat?
- Thank-you.
- Lovely weather, we're having.
- Yes, splendid.
- Who did you say that man was?
- He's a very important friend of Frank's.
I'll get the breakfast for him.
- Here! Aren't we rude?
Won't you take my chair?
- Oh, thanks.
- Did you see, or hear anything during the night?
- No, sir.
- What time did you go to bed?
- About half past ten, sir.
- Did you write this?
- Yes.
- How old would you say this man was.
- I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, sir, he had his hat on.
- Did you notice anything particular about his clothes?
- Well, uh, he had a black hat and a loose kind of collar.
'nd a tie and that's about all, I think.
- Was he dark or fair?
- Well, you couldn't say he was a blond and you couldn't say he was a brunette. He was a bit of both, you know, kind of mousey.
- Anything else?
- No.
- Except when he spoke to you, he went like this.
- All right.
Give me records.
- Well, bring him along. Let's hear what he's got to say.
- Understood?
-Yes, sir.
- Right, get along with it..
- That'll do to go on with.
- How much longer is that man going to stay? Don't tell me he'll be here to dinner.
- Don't make things awkward mother.
It means a lot to to me and Frank.
- Well, I don't see why they should carry on their business in my parlour.
- I'll take it.
- Very well.
- But I don't like that man and the sooner he goes the better.
You are very clever.
I can see that all right.
- Frank? Just a minute will you?
A pal of yours at the Yard, said he thought you might be here.
- Oh, all right.
Hello?
Yeah. Yes.
Well, I thought you wouldn't mind if...
What?
Who?
- Any news Frank?
- Alice, lock that door.
As you were saying ... rather unfortunate the way that poor man round the corner, uh, died last night.
On the other hand, perhaps it's fortunate. For us, that is... that a suspicious looking man, with a criminal record, was seen hanging around the place.
- You....
Look here, don't you try and swing this thing on me. That won't get you anywhere.
- Also rather unfortunate, that Scotland
Yard, are at present looking for that man.
- I say, Frank!
- Just a minute Alice.
- But there's one thing you seem to have forgotten....
- Oh, and what's that?
- Before we get to any hanging,
I shall have quite a lot to say.
And the first thing I shall say is, that she was there too.
- Oh, you will, will you?
Isn't there one thing you seem to have forgotten, that our word's as good as, or perhaps a bit better...
...than that of a jailbird.
So we'll face that when the time comes.
Meanwhile, we'll just sit quietly here until the squad van arrives.
- That surprises you doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't surprise me in the least.
When it comes, the surprise won't be for me.
- Very well then, we are both satisfied.
- Yes, we're both satisfied.
It's my word, against hers.
- Frank, you can't do this.
- Why not?
- Well, because...
- Now, now, don't interfere,
Alice, I know what I'm doing.
You don't, you don't.
- Please Frank.
- Oh, for God's sake, be quiet Alice.
- Why can't you let her speak.
- You mind your own business.
In any case, she'll speak at the right moment.
- Look here Frank. Why can't we, both of us, chuck the whole thing now?
I've got nothing against you.
You've got nothing against me.
Except, of course, I had some cash from you, but I wasn't serious.
Well, look here, have it back now.
Well can't you see, that she wants to chuck it up too? And so do I, you know.
Look here, Miss. You tell him.
Tell him that he's playing with fire and...
And we shall, all of us, burn our fingers.
I'm not bad really, I only... things have gone wrong lately, and one's got to live, you know.
All right then. It's still my word against hers.
That's it?
Oy!
You men meet me in the back, Frank, follow me!
I say, it's not me you want.....
It's him.....ask him.
Why his own....
Hello. Not very often I see you so early in the day as this.
- Called to see Frank?
- No.
No, I want to see lnspector Walls, please.
-Then you'll have to fill out one of these forms, you know.
- All right.
- Do you know something about this?
- Yes.
George, just a minute.
Take this along to inspector Walls.
Well I suppose you're going to tell him who did it, Miss.
Yes.
- You can come along now
- Here you are, Miss.
- Come in, please.
Won't you sit down?
You've something to tell us about this case.
- Yes.
- Well, what is it?
Well, you see. I know who did it.
Is this worthwhile sir, now that everything has been cleared up?
Let's hear what she's got to say.
What I was going to say is this...
I'd better say, what I have to say now...
I would rather not wait.
What I wanted to say is...
- I was the one.
- One moment please.
Hello.
Yes, yes.
Yes, hold on. Will you deal with this young lady,
I shall be busy for a minute. Yes, sir.
This way Miss, please.
Alice, whatever made you come here?
I did it.
- I know.
- You don't know.
He tried oh, I can't tell you.
It's too terrible. I was defending myself.
I didn't know what I was doing and then...
- My dear.
- Ha, ha! So you found him,
Miss. Did she tell you who did it.
- Yes.
You'll want to look out, or you'll be losing your job my boy.
I suppose we'll soon have lady detectives up in the Yard, eh.
And I shall be all right on the dole, won't I.
